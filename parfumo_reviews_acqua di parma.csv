Fico di Amalfi,03/10/2013,Miaw2,M,339,,0,Flanker fail,"In my opinion all of these Pi flankers are far away from original.

I can detect some herbals, an aquatic note and a very weak cedar base.

This one smells very synthetic and has almost no projection and lasting power.

Updated September 2014"
Fico di Amalfi,06/10/2012,Kannan,M,37,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Real Summer Tropical,Amazing fragrance with good projection. The Longevity more than 5hrs. Best summer scent i like ever. Dam good catchy smell which can easily attract everyone. I get lots of compliments. Girls Love this. One must own this for sure. Fantastic job by Givenchy. I Love it.
Fico di Amalfi,02/24/2013,Miner,M,32,,1,"Sun, Beach, and Coconut","Bold and different from the regular Pi Neo. Smells strongly of coconut - the only perfumes I know that evoke similar associations are Set Sail St. Barts and Fire Island. Not suitable for the office, as it is too noticeable, but excellent for the summer months.

Due to the vanilla sweetness in the dry-down, the scent lasts a long time, definitely 8-10 hours. The downside is the closure - it’s almost missing, so air always gets to the sprayer - in terms of longevity, especially for a limited edition that is no longer available, it's poorly designed."
Oud,08/22/2011,Turandot,F,839,,23,"To those whose hearts are full, their mouths overflow...","...so says a proverb. But for me, it's quite the opposite. I am full of enthusiasm for this fragrance, and I can't think of anything to say about it, because there is no further enhancement to all the enthusiastic Guerlain comments that have already been written on Parfumo. Moreover, the fragrance has long been discontinued, and in front of me lies a tiny glass vial with a single drop inside. After carefully dabbing a bit on my skin twice, there is not even 1/4ml left. But captured within it is the entire splendor of old Guerlain perfumery art.

It is often said that No.5 by Chanel was the first fragrance to combine synthetic fragrance materials with natural ones. We in sales diligently blow the same horn, but that does not make this statement any more accurate - see above. Pois de senteur was released in 1917, four years before No.5, and in the top note, we see and smell aldehydes!! In conjunction with hyacinth and citrus notes, this creates a radiant, voluminous, yet not shrill opening, which, like the overture of an opera, anticipates much and thus piques curiosity for more. And this ""more"" truly has substance. I wouldn't even want to try to fathom which spices are included; even the honey is at most only hinted at, because Pois de Senteur is by no means sweet, and that orange blossom and rose form a beautiful heart with the powdery iris, I don't need to tell you, every perfume lover knows that. But all these treasures together create this wonderful fluid that makes it impossible for me to describe the fragrance in a way that you can comprehend. And that's still not enough, because the base in this fragrance is not the conclusion but actually the highlight, as balsamic, incredibly soft, and enveloping, Pois de Senteur lingers on the skin for hours.

That there are no fragrances like Pois de Senteur anymore is as sad for me as it is for a historian the loss of valuable old books after a library fire. Treasures that are irretrievably part of the past.

It states here that not even Coriolon possesses this fragrance, which I cannot imagine. But I will simply assume that he at least knows more about it, and I would be very pleased if he would share that with us."
Mandorlo di Sicilia,09/13/2018,Jazzy76,F,320,,1,A spicy -gourmand cloud,"I re-tested just today after many years this scent I owned when I was younger at when the new entry ""à la mode"" was the very particular Angel by Thierry Mugler.
After this first gourmand scent other similar fragrance such as Wish by Chopard and this one, Byblos Cielo, came out.
This minimal and simple bottle hides a true spicy-gourmand cloud which transports you in the sky :at the first spray on my skin I smelled the spicy touch of the nutmeg and the pimento, while I didn't smell the citrusy opening note I see right now on the pyramid. then, a very warm and sensual jasmin developped its intoxicating scent , made softer by the unusual coconut note . Finally, on my skin remained the patchouli notes , a warm and cocooning patchouli, not too earthy and made smoother by the vanilla ,sweet but not sweetish and well balanced, and by a musky touch.
The result was very pleasant and very similar to the Thierry Mugler's angel one.
Unfortunately, the sillage makes the difference between these two fragrances: indeed, Cielo is more evanescent and after about one hour it evaporates, at least on my skin.
Anyway, the 120ml one size isn't expensive and for about 20€ or less you can have a quite good scent maybe not lo0nglasting but perfect as everyday scent in the cold season or night scent in summer or whenever you want to feel on a cloud!"
Mandorlo di Sicilia,04/11/2012,PBullFriend,F,310,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,spiced coconut woods,"Cielo is another one of those puzzling scents that I think could have been quite popular if promoted enough. It's a shame that hardly anyone has heard of it.

Looking at the notes, you would expect it to be quite floral, but I hardly smell any flowers at all. To me, it is a mildly spicy coconut-patchouli scent. Despite sharing half of its notes with the original Bronze Goddess (mandarin, coconut, gardenia, jasmine, vanilla, sandalwood), I don't think it has that same beachy/suntan lotion vibe. Rather, it's much more in line with wintry, fashion-oriented patchouli scents like Angel.(The notes it apparently shares with Angel are coconut, mandarin, jasmine, lily-of-the-valley, patchouli, musk, and vanilla.)

If you like Angel, but prefer a bit of spicy coconut to Angel's heavy sweetness, Byblos Cielo may be just what you want. It's available quite reasonably right now at the US online discounters. (I got a back-up bottle, because I don't know that there's enough demand for it to be around for long.)"
Mandorlo di Sicilia,06/18/2020,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,When you see a white cloud ..,"... think of me.

So wrote Yoko Ono once to John Lennon.

Cielo also starts with a white cloud - consisting of bright lily of the valley - and aquatic mandarin.
The floral ingredients also evoke thoughts of feather clouds.

But then the sky takes shape - the little clouds disappear - making way for a purplish-red canopy.

Spices linger in the air - which Cielo does not burden unnecessarily.

This twilight has something magical - which makes the fragrance very interesting.

The coconut vanilla blend conjures golden streaks in the sky - and the purple shifts to violet.

The scent becomes increasingly dense - but not heavy.
The air feels silky and sandalwood wraps itself in a creamy embrace.

A multifaceted fragrance - that reflects the sky in all its colors."
Mandorlo di Sicilia,04/25/2019,Astridpower,F,4,,2,Thunderstorm,"I find that at the beginning it smells as if you are running over a hill full of spicy meadow grasses in a thunderstorm - in a positive sense!

At first, it is a little bit gentle, but only for the first few seconds - after that, it becomes more powerful - also in a positive sense.

Afterwards, it smells strong/spicy/leathery - but still remains gentle. Not a bad combination ;)

However, I don't think it smells like Angel by Mugler?! At least not on me :)"

Magnolia Nobile,09/16/2025,xtermn8,M,168,,1,"Fruity, sparkling champagne vibes!","Personal: 7/10 – Sweet, sparkly, fruity champagne vibe. Fun, girly, not really my vibe, but pleasant.
Mass appeal: 9/10 – A best seller for a reason. Fruity, slightly floral, fresh champagne is super safe.
Performance: 4.5/10 – Mist, so it vanishes quick, though it clings a little more than some others.
Value: 8/10 – Super affordable for an easy grab-and-go festive scent.
Uniqueness: 5/10 – Smells like dozens of fruity, floral fragrances, just a bit more sparkly.

SCORE: 67/100

Full bottle buy? YES, if you want a reliable, fun, sweet, sparkly body mist.
Blind buy? YES, cheap, safe, and sparkly-sweet. Very safe and easy to like.
Recommend? YES, especially as a gift. Very likable.
Date night? NO, too sugary and playful to be seductive. May work for casual settings.
Office safe? YES, sweet but inoffensive, and it dies down quickly, though cloying if oversprayed.

Pros: Sparkly, fun, fruity champagne vibe. Universally likable. Affordable.
Cons: Generic, sugary, and girly. It's not your everyday fruity floral, but it's not that special.

A Thousand Wishes is iconic for a reason, and B&BW knows it. They kind of perfected the fun, girly, fruity vibe with a slightly more mature touch of that bright, fresh champagne energy that really keeps you enjoying something so, well, simple.

Review #85 in my fragrance journey – this fragrance I owned as a body mist"
Magnolia Nobile,07/21/2020,Oriane,F,139,,3,"Red Berries and Divinely Sweet, Warm Drydown","This review is for the shower gel, body spray, and body creme used in conjunction.

Top Notes: Champagne, Carambola (Star Fruit), and Quince.

Heart Notes: Peony and Freesia.

Base Notes: Amber, Almond Creme, Sugar, Sandalwood, and Musk. (this fragrance really shines in the base notes!)

I was looking for something new at B&BW the other day, and the SA suggested A Thousand Wishes. Neither the name nor the packaging particularly impressed me, but I was happy to sniff it on card. I immediately thought it smelt similar to Amber Blush as I could detect the champagne note in it. I already own Amber Blush shower gel, body spray, and lotion, and whilst I liked A Thousand Wishes well enough, I did not want to purchase something that might be essentially the same fragrance as Amber Blush.

I checked the notes on-line for Amber Blush and A Thousand Wishes and saw that they shared some notes, most notably champagne but also amber, sandalwood, and musk. However, other notes were quiet different. Amber Blush contains raspberry, apricot, suede, mandarin orange, magnolia, star anise, gardenia, jasmine, and bergamot whilst A Thousand Wishes has none of these latter notes. The bergamot and mandarin orange in Amber Blush give it a much more citrusy top whilst the champagne gives it a good deal of champagne fizziness throughout. A Thousand Wishes has neither the citrusy top nor the persistent fizziness of Amber Blush. Hence, whilst they are perceived as having some slight family resemblance, overall they are different enough to be distinguished from one another.

I was inspired by the promise of a creamy almond note in A Thousand Wishes as I love nutty notes, so I purchased the body spray, shower gel, and the body creme. I believe layering gives the best projection, sillage, and longevity. I am happy to say that A Thousand Wishes fulfilled my hope that it would be full size bottle worthy.

Whilst A Thousand Wishes is similar to Amber Blush, it is different enough to stand on its own as a unique fragrance. Firstly, it is not as strong of a fragrance as is Amber Blush. I found it is much softer, and the champagne note is not as pronounced. In the deep dry down there is a creamy almond note and a warm amber note along with a nice woody sandalwood and a hint of musk that blended perfectly with the persistent but soft champagne note. The almond note is soft but quite nice, and combined with the amber and sandalwood in the base, it makes for a very warm and snuggly fragrance.

A Thousand Wishes smells quite seductively sweet and alluring given the base notes, and I think it would make a very nice year round scent. I think the fruit and florals will be more noticeable during the warm weather months, and the base notes will really shine on crisp, cold days. A Thousand Wishes is very nice, and I am very surprised as I did not expect it to be this nice. I would not say it is terribly ""special,"" but as such fruity-floral fragrances go, it is far nicer than most I have sniffed. I am so glad the SA suggested it because I probably never would have tried it had she not done.

I like the dry down best. If I concentrate and inhale deeply, I am able to detect all of the base notes, and they do smell wonderful! This is a well blended fragrance. I think anyone who wears these base notes well can wear this fragrance well. As with all of my B&BW fragrances, projection, sillage, and longevity are excellent whence the matching products are layered with the body spray and/or the EdT.

These scores are within the B&BW family of scents. They are not meant to be compared to the same type of scored given to a Guerlain or a Chanel for example.

Fragrance: 8.5/10

Projection: 8/10

Sillage: 8/10

Longevity: 9/10"
Colonia Assoluta,04/10/2016,Aliana,F,28,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Setting Spray with a Fragrance from Aromatherapy - A Little Luxury for the Soul,"Beauty Elixir is not a perfume.

Beauty Elixir is a setting spray, a refreshing spray enriched with essential oils from aromatherapy and care oils from cosmetics. The spray is applied to the face, neck, and décolletage, or if desired - to the entire body.
The mood and skin feel caressed, the scent is unlike anything I know. It vaguely reminds me of scent No. 1 from the same company, but:
This is not a perfume, but something ethereal, delicate, fresh, that immerses the soul in lightness and leaves a gentle feeling on the skin. The fragrant liquid that emerges is like a small mist cloud that envelops you. The fluid settles on everything it touches - and makes it feel fresh for about 15 minutes. For that long, you can smell this fine combination on yourself. On the skin, the delicate tension lasts a bit longer, for me about 30 minutes.
It has happened to me several times, for example in a café or on the train, that after I sprayed, people immediately asked me about it, and not a few have taken me up on my suggestion to spray them too :) Men and women are truly captivated by the warmth of the scent and its effect, and some have even composed real superlatives about the fragrance :)
I love this spray, especially because of its scent. The caring effect is minimal and hardly noticeable when used alongside other cosmetics. When sprayed on a clean face, you can tell that there are care oils in it. I have extremely sensitive skin, but I tolerate the spray well to very well - only once did I experience a brief itch, but I'm not even sure it wasn't the combination of everything - summer, heat, city air, perfume, sunscreen, day cream, makeup products, Beauty Elixir.... Sometimes a lot comes together.
I have always considered this spray to be a cosmetic product, as it is applied by spraying onto the skin to care for and refresh it. That it also smells so dreamy is simply wonderful!

The text on the packaging:
Pamper your skin with the M. Asam® Beauty Elixir for face and body. Experience the invigorating scent with essential oils of mint and lemon. The moisturizing spray is enriched with an active ingredient complex that can help make the skin appear more even and give the skin radiance and a youthful glow. The refreshing spray can be used several times a day.
Application:
Spray on face and body for refreshment. Keep eyes closed while spraying on the face.

P.S. It is also available as Beauty Elixir Orange."
Rosa Nobile,09/17/2012,Michelangela,F,89,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,About Sung,"„May I introduce?”
His name is SUNG, Alfred Sung!
~
Been forgotten? Or ferment unknown? To believe hardly!
~
The presentation misleads about the contents. A graceful simple flask which allows to expect a rather androgynous classical-sporty smell, maybe also a harsh Chypre...

I spray to me something on the back of the hand and a hurricane of most delightfully fresh flowers, hard, immensely floods me a wave, no, rather it, wholehearted and absolutely unsweet. The lemon marks underline the flower drunkenness and give him a light green flair.
This is a bomb! An explosion, a nasal orgasm! I am completely overpowered.
This immense flood already stops some minutes and I imagine that I should be maybe a little more economically with the dosage not to kill my dear sphere with it. However, thus as every passionate storm ends once, this smell also finds his quiet pole and slips slowly in a creamy bed to pause there still long as an expressive companion.
The smell is elegant and very expressive, absolutely passionate female.
~
Silage: terrifically
Durability: excellently
~
Result:
This smell is no shy little flower waters, but an absolutely successful Powerscent of the early 80th. I would never have expected behind this simple flask such a wonderful flower power which lies down so quite unsweet, even a little green on the skin of her bearer.
Thus I am over the moon to have bought him by chance and blind!!
True flower fans should on no account miss this smell...."
Rosa Nobile,04/11/2014,DarkMatter,F,24,,4,Dirty Lily!,"I really wanted to like this '80s gem. I love powerhouse perfumes from that era, it reminds me of my teen years when I worse far too much perfume, hairspray and had gargantuan shoulder-pads!

Knowing that it was going to be a big fragrance I only applied one modest spray so that I could see how I liked it. I could always apply more later right? I was so sure that I would love it. The notes looked so right and there was nothing that jumped out at me from the list that scared me off.

I also wish I could give you a list of the different florals as they developed, as they played with each other. I can't, I'm very sorry. Initially I smelt lily of the valley. Now I love lily of the valley, in it's fresh soapy incarnation but here it was downright indolic, dirty and grimy, slightly urinous. I couldn't tell if it was the lily or another note that was giving this impression because on my skin Sung is a very linear perfume. The notes didn't develop, change or sparkle. The dirty lily just clung to my skin for the better part of 7 hours until it became more powdery, but still very dirty.

I want to appreciate it, but I can't. Sung seems so very dated. Perhaps if I still had huge hair and matching shoulder-pads, I would feel at home with it. Perhaps the original formulation back when it was released was more complex? I don't know. But for now, I safely assert to anyone who has the curiosity to try it, get hold of a sample before you buy to make sure it really is you."
Rosa Nobile,09/19/2023,Exciter76,F,78,,4,If A Perfume Could Smell Like A Victorian-Era Porcelain Doll...,"Originally reviewed on May 6, 2012:

I remember my best friend from high school had this on her vanity back when everyone else had Sunflowers and Tresor on theirs. I used to snoop around in her collection as our tastes ran similar. Sung was my favorite in her collection. I believe I even used up her bottle and tried to offer up a rancid bottle of Primo (Kmart’s answer to Giorgio Beverly Hills) in exchange. She was a true friend—she forgave both my overindulgence with her bottle of Sung and my reparations in the form of an insult-in-a-bottle. Fast forward about fifteen years. I had long forgotten the name of my friend’s emptied bottle but I knew the scent immediately. It was about time for a long overdue reunion.

Sung is a very verdant white floral that I cannot help but associate with white lace. To be exact, I smell lily-of-the-valley first and foremost, sweetened by other white flowers and grounded by woods. It dries down smelling of soft and powdery white flowers, a real gem among rocks for white floral lovers. It has real tenacious staying power and it is quite the sillage monster, a quality many contemporary fragrances lack. It is as precious, as romantic, and as much an anachronism as lacy gloves. It is a fragrance that may seem a bit out of place these days but it will endure fads and whims of the present and find its place among the classics.

Revised reminiscence on September 19, 2023:

I take part in an online project, ""Monthly Perfume Tray Project,"" in which I create a tray featuring a small subset of perfumes from my collection. It's an ideal project in which to take part because I'm able to focus on my collection in an very intimate way. It has (mostly) tamed my desire to acquire new bottles and helped me cull those bottles that no longer speak to me, assuming they ever did. This month I added Sung EAU DE TOILETTE to my tray.

I'd always loved Sung EAU DE TOILETTE but, at some point in the 2010s, my mother discovered it, too. She got a whiff of it on me and was reminded of a perfume her grandmother wore, a long lost Avon. Once my mom got a hold of it, it was no longer my high school nostalgia scent—it was one of mom's signature scents. I felt awkward wearing it, so I gave her my bottle.

My mother passed away in 2021. I inherited her perfume collection, which included a new 100mL bottle of Sung EAU DE TOILETTE. I tried to wear it soon after her passing but I found it too painful. Fast forward to September 2023: I'm able to wear it but it's taken on new facets and associations. I find it much mossier than I remembered. Maybe it's my body chemistry, or maybe it was my mother's chemistry that gave it a mossier quality that I couldn't ""unsmell."" It's also possible that the new bottle was a reformulation, thus giving the appearance of being greener and mossier. The white florals that I associated with white lace gloves became a little louder and brasher. Again, I don't know if that can be associated with my body chemistry, reformulation, my memory or any other combination of factors.

To be frank, Sung EAU DE TOILETTE always felt anachronistic, even in the few years that followed its release (I discovered it in 1991). This may seem irrelevant but my aforementioned best mate in high school used to do some modeling, particularly vintage Victorian costume modeling. She was also a model for porcelain dolls. She looked like a turn-of-the-century doll, with porcelain white skin and large hazel eyes. She was the girl that boys were too intimidated to approach because she was so beautiful and otherworldly. Sung EAU DE TOILETTE fit her and her aesthetic so perfectly; it, too, was hauntingly beautiful with its porcelain white essence and otherworldly presence. Much like Sung EAU DE TOILETTE, though she was all those qualities listed, she was also very accessible and likeable, if you took the time to get to know her.

I'm glad I'm reconnecting with Sung EAU DE TOILETTE. It still feels awkward to wear again. It's still anachronistically beautiful, nevertheless."
Rosa Nobile,10/11/2014,Fanny,F,67,,2,Guns n lilies,"Sung is a special song sung by high pitched voices.
I was very surprised by its extreme freshness, which I adore in this particular case. It is almost severe in its bite..., and I can appreciate that in full techni-colour.

Rosa Nobile,03/04/2023,Pimmsy1,F,1,,3,Alfred Sung for Women/To Riviera with Love,"The “original” fragrance, developed in 1986 and distributed by the Riviera Corporation, is the true fragrance. Unknowingly, I purchased the EDT, altered, distributed by Revlon, and noticed there is a huge difference. Maybe that is why there are so many trying to unload on eBay. At first I thought my bottles unfortunately turned. They were kept in a cool, dark, linen closet so perhaps EDT turns bad after a considerable length of time. Once I learned that Revlon became involved, I purchased a bottle, from the Riviera Corporation, off of eBay and it smelled as the original scent and happily, it was perfectly fine."

Why does mimicry come to mind when I think of Sung? Well, this mimicry refers to the bottle. A simple bottle with a greenish content that suggests a light, lemony, summery water. Wrong! Deception, but in a big way. A typical case of ""you thought!"" The little gem cleverly deceives, but only..."
Rosa Nobile,09/21/2022,Sabiba27,F,15,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Gimme more ... flowers,"I confess that my fragrance preferences are stuck somewhere in the 90s. Back then, I discovered Tendre Poison, and that became my one-and-only perfume until the last bottle I won on eBay about five years ago. So, for two decades, there was no need or desire to look for other perfumes, and my nose is extremely conditioned to TP.

Flowers, especially white flowers, are a must, and tuberose can join in as well. A certain freshness is absolutely necessary, as it shouldn’t become powdery, but rather clean-soapy and slightly sweet. After a loud floral explosion, a light spiciness should set in, but definitely no dark woods, rather a hint of clove and amber, so balsamic notes that give the fragrance depth without making it masculine. I don’t want to perceive vanilla distinctly; it should only be used to round things off, not push itself to the forefront.
Of course, I expect decent longevity and some sillage, so I don’t have to keep my nose glued to my arm. If the perfume is also attractively priced, all the better.

All of this characterizes Sung. I also really like the ""Pure"" from AS, but the wax note annoys me over time. Sung hits hard with the flowers, and that’s exactly what my Tendre Poison-spoiled 90s nose wants.

Actually, I would like a perfume that can be easily purchased anywhere for a change. But if you’re as one-track-minded in fragrance as I am, you can’t complain about difficult sourcing conditions. I’d better stock up on a ten-year supply of Sung. That should last until I move into a retirement home.

Edit 8.2.24: Unfortunately, Sung has also fallen victim to reformulation and is now just a shadow of its former self. The original version is recognizable by the indentation for the spray head in the black cap. The reformulated version does not have that. To spray, you have to remove the cap."
Rosa Nobile,05/22/2013,Fefaminz,F,134,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,The Powerhouses of the Past...,"A small bottle full of youthful memories has come my way through a generous perfume! Back in the eighties, we struck olfactorily without regard for losses, indulging in scents straight from the source, and elegant restraint was not necessarily the norm when it came to perfume.

As soon as I applied this fragrance, I can already envision myself wearing a wool coat with huge shoulder pads!

This scent is anything but quiet; I don’t perceive any citrus notes (thankfully), it immediately launches with an incredible abundance of flowers, spicy, sweet, aromatic. New flowers keep appearing, spices join in, it nearly knocks me over! Gradually, the fragrance becomes deeper, the woods take over without completely pushing the flowers away, and they linger with me for hours. The longevity is very good, which I almost regret, as I would love to dive into the overflowing floral abundance again and again - but due to the exceptionally good sillage, I hold back and look forward to the next time. For me, this fragrance has nothing fruity, and despite the spices, it doesn’t remind me in the slightest of anything edible, and I am very pleased to get to know this perfume after all these years!"

But the scent ""Sung"". It seems to vibrate, beginning with the aforementioned ""firecrackers"".

The fragrance starts somewhat muffled and slightly cacophonous. But that doesn't last long. Only in the first 30 seconds after leaving its bottle does the scent play a bit awkwardly and almost discordantly with the nose. But as soon as that settles, a wonderful melody emerges, uniting all the flowers of spring. It plays powerfully and harmoniously with the strings of the aromas. And their ""bow"" is the iris, amber, and sandalwood. Drawing out soft and supple tones. Bright and light.
Gradually, some darker accords join in, slightly melancholic-earthy with vetiver and patchouli. But they maintain their beautiful smoothness through vanilla.
The entire melody is now masterfully coaxed from the instrument, which is made of a special wood.
I no longer want to think of the beginning, as I am more than positively surprised...."
Rosa Nobile,11/21/2012,oYo,F,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Monster of the Deep Sea,"My husband and I empty the bag containing the latest, still unsorted samples from generous donors (a big thank you to Michelangela for the sample of Sung :-)). My husband reads aloud, ""Sung A. Sung, what is that?"" I can't remember what it's supposed to smell like, so I just take a sniff. ""Hmmmm, quite floral, Ylang Ylang or something."" We both spray it on ourselves.

What a surprise! In the first minutes, the Ylang Ylang unfolds in all its glory; I can't make out any citrus notes, but there's something else: a salty note, like sea salt on the skin. Curiously, I keep sniffing my skin to seek out this salty scent.

Only a little later, the jasmine also makes an appearance, while the Ylang Ylang has already taken over the room. The flowers smell incredibly deep, animalistic, like predators. We both agree that this scent is a sea serpent or some other sea monster, of course a female, that has emerged from mysterious depths, adorned with seaweed and strange, fleshy, wild, dark red flowers that exude an enchanting fragrance. There’s nothing delicate, loving, fine, or sweet about it, but pure wildness and predator.

We are both fascinated by the scent and enjoy it for several hours. As it slowly becomes a bit more subdued, a hint of soft sandalwood and a touch of vanilla make themselves known, which do not tame the sea serpent but rather give it a certain animalistic marine wisdom, something ancient and primal. The salty note still holds me captive beneath the floral rush.

Then the sandalwood base unfolds; I can't detect any vetiver on myself. Above all, there hovers an animalistic floral note, but now I can no longer identify it as a specific flower. I go to bed and happily sniff my arm - in the cooler and fresher air of the bedroom, the scent is different. Strange, what is that? I sniff more closely, no longer finding the floral scent, but rather a note that almost makes me feel nauseous: indole!

I get up again and go to the living room to show this to my husband. But the room is saturated with perfume, and here the indole cannot be perceived. So back to bed, yes, there it is again; even my husband can smell it here! I decide not to sniff my arm anymore during the night - when I sleep, I become sensitive to such rather borderline components.

Yes, the scent is truly wonderful, opulent, sensual, animalistic. Especially the salty note in it awakens my fascination. If only the apparently quite high indole content weren't there..."
Iris Nobile,05/21/2024,Gourmandgrl,F,307,,4,"Bad first impressions, but second chances = my ""holy grail"" cotton candy","My first time testing this was part of the ""Carnaval Trio Purse Spray Set"" (which includes Le Soda Pop and Maïs Soufflé ) - and it was very disappointing.

I bought the set used on a resale site in 2022, so I'm uncertain if the juice was already impacted by improper perfume storage practices or if it was simply the batch. The Sucre de Coton vial was somehow simultaneously too sweet but also sour in nature - like cotton candy that had melted in the sun, became a hot syrupy puddle, and turned for the worst. ""Sickening"" was an accurate way to describe it, as others have said below.

I'm not someone who seeks out cotton candy notes regularly, as they're often too sweet for me (even as a self-proclaimed ""gourmand lover"") - so I'm surprised that I gave this a second chance. But I found a full size in a TJ Maxx store a couple months back, and I'm now in love with this little blue bottle.

It does open with a bit of ""synthetic screech"" - similar to Pink Sugar EAU DE TOILETTE . But it calms down after 5-10 minutes, and develops into the bulk of the fragrance:

- 60% quiet spun sugar (not too synthetic or overly sweet; well-balanced by the other elements)
- 40% ""laundry detergent"" (perhaps the cyclamen note, but I wouldn't say there's anything ""green"" or ""spicy"" about this - and instead would guess it to be closer to fluffy, sweet lilac without too much powder)

I can see this being compared to Boardwalk Delight EAU DE PARFUM because of the cotton candy + ""laundry detergent"" combination, but I personally found Boardwalk Delight to be too synthetic and headache inducing - whereas Sucre de Coton was surprisingly delightful.

The sweetness of the cotton candy is fairly subtle, only creating a personal scent bubble when wearing. The freshness of the ""laundry detergent"" component helps to round it out, making it more balanced and giving it a fresher + more comforting feel.

It lasts about 2-3 hours on my skin, so longevity is lower for me and this one is already ""soft"" to begin with. But it's a fun ""cheapie"", and is quickly becoming one of my favorites for summer!"
Iris Nobile,12/31/2023,Katiemeans,F,6,,2,The Most Sickeningly Sweet,"I bought this fragrance online when there was a sale on Urban Outfitters. My mistake was buying it in the summer when it was 90°, but now that I’m wearing it in the winter, I really enjoy it. It is definitely the sweetest perfume I have in my collection, and that is saying a lot considering how many gourmand fragrances I own.

Like the previous reviewer said, this has a buttery quality to it. However, I do believe it smells like cotton candy. Not an airy light version but the kind where the sugar gets stuck on the machine and it gets really hot and syrupy. Makes me feel like I’m at the circus!

This fragrance can be nauseating to people who do not like very sweet gourmands. One or two sprays is enough."
Iris Nobile,06/27/2023,Pangantucan,F,17,,2,The Hunt for the Perfect Cotton Candy Continues,"I was super excited about this one because I was *hoping* it would be a more elevated version of Body Fantasies Cotton Candy body spray. But wow, this is weird!

It's immediately really sour-sweet, leaning more on sour. The mixed berries feel artificial, like blue raspberry liquid squeeze candy. Wears off semi-quickly, ~20 minutes.

Then there's this uncomfortable warm and spicy element that totally caught me off guard. I think pink cyclamen was a poor choice for this scent. It grounds the perfume and keeps it from being light and airy. This middle note especially makes my stomach churn a little bit.

Even though there already is a buttered popcorn scent that was released in the same lineup as Sucre de Coton, all this reminds me of is a buttered popcorn Jellybean, lightly coated with a berry-flavored mouth wash. What a strange take on cotton candy...

I'm washing this off. If I really try, I can kind of see a sour/spicy vanilla, but I'd rather wear the BF spray. Tart, light, and sickenenly sweet, liked whipped sugar crystals! That's what I was hoping for. This is not it, unfortunately."

Colonia Mirra,03/30/2020,M3000,M,19,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Blind Test Video: Invented Lavender in Fruity Patchouli,"*What are we smelling?*
In this blind test, Bookie and I didn't always agree. While I'm sure about large amounts of lavender, she perceives the sweetness more prominently. Did someone say leather? We both smell dried fruits, as well as a fine creaminess in the base.

Is this perfume the work of a professional and/or does a small house reference a great classic? We observe a clear progression; there's a lot happening here! In our assessment, we cross paths: I find the opening more interesting, while Bookie prefers the base. In the end, we nearly align. I give it a well-meaning 7 points.

*What do you see?*
Spray it on and let’s go! We dive in with the top notes and describe our impressions. You can watch us smell, wonder, guess, and assert live. Later (at 3:20 min), about three hours after application, we will share what we have perceived in the meantime, before we finally learn the prepared reveal ourselves.

A heartfelt thank you to the user Ichbins, who provided us with this blind test!

Peonia Nobile,03/04/2022,Vitodito,M,94,,1,Different Iris / Coco,"Coconut with iris.

Smells like you store a suntan lotion in an old wood shelf, which is odd but not that bad.

Creamy, coconutty and with a lipstick vibe. Performance is quite good too.

Funny but too weird for my taste. Smells interesting though, maybe better on a woman. Definitely a niche perfume. Not a common smell."
Peonia Nobile,01/05/2021,MrFloral,M,15,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,There's a hit on the coconut,"Somewhere in the tropics.
An unsuspecting man takes off his hat to wipe the sweat from his forehead.
Just at that moment, it falls like in slow motion and lands right on the 12.
The fruit bursts open and a wonderful coconut scent pours over the poor tourist.

The rising freshness and the coconut scent immediately make him forget the bump on his head.

Then the alcohol dries down and I'm back at home. Before I can even wonder what just happened, a flashback hits me.

At first, I thought of something sweet/slightly citrusy like a bad scent or chewing gum (was it Maoam?!). Then I'm back in my childhood. I don't know what I used to snack on, but that candy I had poisoned my young body with smelled exactly like this.

The coconut disappears as quickly as it came. Then there's the slightly sweet yet fresh chewing gum smell. Somehow tasty but still too fresh/sharp for me. I would have preferred to change the channel. But that settles down after about 40-60 minutes.

The heart notes slowly take over. The coconut scent comes back and blends with iris & the top notes. At first a bit changeable, but the closer it gets to the base, the more brilliant the scent becomes.

Sweet, but not too overpowering. Soft & harmonious. In the background, there's a constant light freshness. A rollercoaster of feelings: iris, coconut, iris, coconut... Freshness, yet flowers, freshness, yet flowers...

A beautiful perfume when it reaches the base. Oh, and the coconut bomb at the beginning - also top. In between, it's interesting, but not quite my thing, especially at the price point of the Centenario.

But then jasmine, musk, iris & coconut cream... delightful dessert... light and airy. A feel-good scent, a good mood scent. Apart from the coconut, I can hardly distinguish the notes anymore. They flow into each other and I smile :)

Not too extravagant for a centenary celebration, and at ~7 hours, only a few guests are still partying. Even the clothing only faintly smells of the Centenario.

I'm torn. I wouldn't have actively sought this out, and yet it's so well made that it makes its way onto the Nice to Have list.

One of those scents you wear when you're in a good mood, and that mood seems to increase exponentially :P"
Ambra,10/13/2017,Vroni72,F,3,,4,My Fresh Favorite,"It’s an autumn day, I open the package and there it is:
a beautiful bottle, well crafted, but what I’m even more excited about is the content. I spray it on and there it is ...really beautifully fresh, amazing!
What I smell are lemon, mandarin, simply wonderful. It is very fresh but not intrusive, nothing piercing, which I don’t like. I wait... this pleasant freshness remains, what I notice later is the apple that comes in. Hours later I still smell it... a pleasant very soft freshness and a very light woody note.
I believe it has become my new favorite scent :)"
Acqua Nobile Magnolia,03/11/2025,LeapingFrog,M,9,,2,"Uniquely spicy, spicely unique","As most of my perfume collection, this story begins with Masculin Ouragan EAU DE TOILETTE being discontinued. Of course. I'm always looking for a way to replace Ouragan. A never-ending search for a substitute, that so far has only got me Zino EAU DE TOILETTE, not as a replacement, but as in the ""same vibe"".

Looking around, I was searching for something with cloves, sandalwood, cedar, patchouli, vanilla, citrus stuff. That's when O Boticário showed me this.

Since I'm from Brazil, this one, although somewhat expensive, isn't hard to get. ~R$325, for an EDP with such an amazing atomizer. Just one spray and you're good to go for a long, long time. People often compliment O Boticário's fixative, and yeah. This one here stays with you for a long while. Just to give an example of pricing, Sauvage Elixir costs around R$1500, and 200 ml of Cool Water EAU DE TOILETTE fluctuates from R$300 to R$400. Creed stuff goes 3k+.

Does it replace Ouragan? Nope. Does it remind me of Ouragan? I... Kinda? Like a harsher, older version of Ouragan. I mean, if my objective is smell like a antiques shop, or museum, it does help in that regard. And I do want to smell like a walking talking museum, as I pointed out when talking about Ouragan.

It's warm. Just open the bottle, you don't even have to spray it, you'll feel the warmth. Spicy, warm, with some citrus stuff going on. Has a whisky-like feel to it, but also reminds me of ""cocoa butter""...? You know, those lipsticks thingies. Anyway, Gentleman Givenchy Réserve Privée has the same feeling, for me, but softer than Malbec Signature.

The heart is the harshest part. Strong cloves and maybe cinnamon? Aggressively spicy.

After a long while, it gets soft. The vanilla/amber base, so similar to The Blend Bourbon (also from O Boticário) and Ouragan. Lovely. That's the biggest reason I got it, but I still like the whole thing. But out of the sweetness comes a freshness, an unexpected fougère vibe.

If it weren't so harsh, I think it might have been the perfect perfume for me, considering my quest. But, for what it is, I still like it a lot.

I do think it fits the name ""Signature"". It's remarkable, unforgettable. It shines."
Acqua Nobile Gelsomino,07/16/2016,AmySourbutts,F,84,,0,Completely Inoffensive,"This is a lovely, soft scent that could be worn anywhere without offense. It reminds me of the lightness of Love's Baby Soft, though it smells different. To be honest, all I smell are vanilla and florals, but this is a nice faragrance even for a very young girl."
Note di Colonia II,09/08/2012,Missk,F,1357,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,2,A beautiful and elegant gardenia fragrance,"Penhaligon's Ellenisia is one of those beautiful, Spring-appropriate florals. It's mostly a white floral, however there are some subtle, zesty fruit accords which add to this fragrance's freshness and complexity.

Luscious, green and dewy gardenia blossoms feature as the headline act in Ellenisia. Sweetness and a subtle hint of creaminess is also provided by the jasmine and tuberose. At first sniff, I swear I could detect a juicy pear accord intermingling with the white florals. I stick by that assumption as I am still able to smell it alongside the zesty mandarin note.

On paper, Ellenisia smells very pure and watery, however on skin, (mine in particular), this fragrance is much greener and sparkling. It's a scent that bursts with life and vivacity.

Ellenisia is a rather polite and elegant fragrance, nothing overtly sensual or bold. Penhaligon's has a certain style and feel, which conjures up an image of refined English ladies at a tea party. I quite like its quaint and traditional approach, and while I can't say that Ellenisia is entirely original, it certainly does stand out amongst the modern fragrances of today.

The longevity could have perhaps been a little more lasting on the skin, as I had been really enjoying the beautiful bouquet until its premature departure. I'm surprised to see that Ellenisia is an EDP, as the way it sat on my skin was more like a less concentrated and subtle EDT.

If you are in search of a natural smelling white floral, one with a dominant gardenia accord, I do highly recommend Ellenisia. However for better longevity and more bang for your buck, I'm afraid I will have to point you in the direction of either Kai or Chanel Gardenia."
Note di Colonia II,02/22/2015,ColinM,M,516,,2,Victorian leaves,"Ellenisia by Penhaligon’s is a rich yet discreet floral scent quite on the white-green-sweet side with a watercolour rose heart, somehow quite conventional but really pleasant and pleasantly “British” as regards of its soapy, slightly nostalgic sense of refinement, as much classy as restrained. Plus, it also feels quite youthful and lively, albeit a bit melancholic – shortly nothing outdated or too formal/mature. Some metallic-camphorous nuances “ruin” a bit the romanticism here, but they’re subtle: what you get is mostly jasmine (quite clean, nothing indolic), sandalwood, something greenish providing a crisp and crunchy “leafy” feel (think it is that “violet leaves” note), resins, and a really quiet but dense tuberose note - don’t expect any headache-inducing note, it is there more just to add an earthy stout vein to the floral accord. The evolution is quick and well, much “evolving”, as it passes through different stages – at some point it almost feels an osmanthus-fruity-tea note emerges, then it all goes back to greenish-white territories, finally drifting towards earthier-camphoraceous nuances. Overall a totally solid and compelling fragrance, really elegant, clean, sharp and to me, perfectly composed and with totally good materials, as far as I can tell. The persistence is good and vibrant, with a subtle “carnal” feel but with a Victorian mood – a pale, restrained, pulsating yet “bourgeois” kind of carnal (shortly, a bit frigid, no offense). Cold and luminous like a London garden in mid-March, with clouds coming and going. Nice!

7,5-8/10"
Note di Colonia II,10/20/2017,Anthology,F,18,,1,Hello white flowers!,"Hello white flowers! Ellenisia opens with jasmine and sweet tuberose, followed by rose. Maybe a hint of orange, but just a hint. A wonderful mix of flowers with a sweet, honeyed facet. Nice, bold and full of life. It gives you a joyful mood. It feels like you are in a garden full of white flowers where their fragrances intertwine and create a divine odour. An odour of joy, a life full of happiness.
The base has a bitterness probably due to the plum, but is still very nice and sweet.
If you are into florals, especially white florals, this one is a try. It has good projection and longevity."
Note di Colonia II,07/10/2014,Inger,F,112,,28,This fragrance is a dream,"Quietly and gently, Ellenisia has sneaked into my heart and secured a firm place there.

I tried it by chance and sniffed it on my wrist all day long...
The next day I went back and took it with me....

Nothing here is loud or lavish, nothing is pretentious or attention-seeking.

A fruity beginning, not too sweet and not too bitter, a little hidden violet looking up at the spring sky with big eyes, a gentle hint of jasmine, gardenia, and roses, but so delicate that nothing feels overwhelming.
Ellenisia smells lovely for several hours - simply dreamily beautiful.
Then later, a slightly sweeter and warmer note comes in - the nectar and vanilla spread their arms.

Nothing here is excessive or shrill, nothing is bitter, nothing is sweet.

Ellenisia is a dream.

Delicate - like a fleeting kiss.

Gentle - like the loving hands of a mother.

Soft - like a down pillow on which a little elf rests.

Lovely - like the laughter of happy children.

But the best part is - some dreams come true - this one is called Ellenisia."
Note di Colonia II,12/17/2017,loewenherz,M,916,,30,Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella,"is undoubtedly the most famous of all (at least partially) German fairy tale films - and an incredible forty-four years old. Based on the version by the Bohemian writer Božena Nemcová, it varies the more popular version in this country a bit: Cinderella can ride and shoot and is neither gifted by a little bird (as in the Brothers Grimm) nor by a good fairy (as in Charles Perrault and - based on that - Walt Disney), but receives those eponymous hazelnuts instead. Originally conceived as a spring film, its shooting schedule was unexpectedly moved to winter - and thus it ultimately became, by chance, THE winter and Christmas film par excellence.

One of the most legendary and magical moments in the film is when Cinderella rides through the blue twilight to the castle on the white horse Nikolaus - to Karel Svoboda's iconic music and in a delicate powder pink dance dress with light blue and intricate silver embroidery, complemented by a matching pink hooded cloak. The landscape - it is in Saxony and not Bohemia, the backdrop of the royal castle is Moritzburg near Dresden - is deeply snow-covered (the Czech actress Libuše Šafránková, who played Cinderella at nineteen, later stated that she was freezing the entire time), and the pink cloak flows gently like a fairy's breath behind the young rider.

Penhaligon's Ellenisia - although English and neither Saxon nor Bohemian and several decades younger - combines the same seemingly contradictory themes as the evening ride to the royal ball: the stillness of the winter landscape and the pink freshness of girlhood. Ellenisia is not a cold fragrance, let alone a distant one, but it does have an initial coolness that serves as a canvas for its delicately playful flowers - flowers that seem a bit old-fashioned but are not outdated. And finally, there is a hint of warmth - like Cinderella's breath as she fogs up a peephole in the frozen window of the ballroom and sees the clownishly made-up Dora dancing inside.

Conclusion: it is both fascinating and comforting that the magic of this comparatively simply made fairy tale film still works today. And when I have Penhaligon's Ellenisia in my nose and gaze into the winter night with half-closed eyes, I almost believe I can see Cinderella riding in the distance under the trees in her pink cloak to the ball..."

Note di Colonia II,03/27/2021,Kysaria,F,11,,6,Like the Kiss of a Butterfly,"In my opinion, the scent is a dream. It starts floral and fresh; I smell grassy violets and sweet gardenia; a bit of powdery jasmine and gentle rose. In my mind's eye, I walk across a green meadow. Here and there, purple violets have pushed through the grass; to my right, white gardenias are blooming. I spread out a picnic blanket and sit down, take a deep breath, and enjoy the scent. Spring. The sun warms my skin - a deep calm comes over me. The fragrance remains floral-green but becomes softer. I sit there for a few hours, lost in my thoughts. Around me, the bees are buzzing, a butterfly flies by. It lands on a blossom, pausing - just for a moment - and then moves on. The scent does the same: after less than six hours, I can only perceive it in my hair.
A much too short pleasure.
Regarding the sillage: it seems to be low, just like the longevity; my husband had to lean over to me - even though we were in the car - to form his own opinion about the perfume. His verdict: Smells soapy and doesn't suit you.

Note di Colonia II,06/05/2024,Azalee,F,2,,3,Pashmina Scarf in Rich Pink,"Ellenisia is, in my opinion, a very successful, unsweet floral scent, balanced, with green-bitter nuances and completely without a floral-fruity punch.
It starts floral-fresh paired with the bitter notes of mandarin peel. I can already perceive the flowers, especially gardenia. Later, a beautiful full bouquet of gardenia, jasmine, and tuberose unfolds, with the rose remaining very subtle in the background. Even in this phase, the slightly bitter elements do not fade away, which I greatly appreciate, as it maintains a certain freshness.
In the base, the wonderful plum joins in, also not too sweet, definitely not overripe or (in the case of juice) fermented, but cool-plum and very finely balanced with the vanilla.
In this interplay, the scent feels rather late-summer to me (could be due to the plum), like a lovely soft pashmina scarf that you wrap around your shoulders on cool evenings, in a beautiful rich, deep pink/rosewood tone.

The sillage is good, the scent is easily noticeable, and the longevity is also impressive; sprayed in the morning, it is still there in the evening (close to the skin).

Overall very elegant, very sophisticated, and - no longer available for order at Penhaligons.

Fuzzy soft roots pulse bitter buttery cream through the veins onto a dark leathery back. As if you and a diamond-shaped creature were bridged by an iris. Green fairy from bioluminescence plays a tuberose balloon, trumpet-shaped, silky flesh membrane, whispered floral notes. On the bathed skin of a girl, tiny sour roses. Above, a quiet rustling, white listening, shimmering hair in glowing waves that wash over your scalp, mossy shells extinguishing in fire, spicy smoke in gentle hissing, salt edges on cistus bushes, mixing bark mulch into earth liqueur, blurring thoughts in alcohol mist, in the midst, afterwards and in between.
Write it down. So that it can be understood. I don't know if that's possible. They are wild notes on a Post-It. Sentence fragments on A4 graph paper. They stand at the top of the second section. Scent, very emotional and delicate. As if all that is written merges into a fragrance of familiar skin, floral and wild, coarse-leathery and mild, a liqueur-like shimmer with salty edges and smoke remnants from campfires, from moss and roots, from mulchy woods and resin-stuck pelts, stirred into an enchanting cream, handcrafted and in small batches by a woman from Vermont, Abby Hinsman.

You smell freshly showered, like after an expensive lotion, as if you just got out of the bathtub and are applying a luxury lotion. The scent is not overpowering, but if you want to smell subtly and beautifully, you absolutely have to buy this. For €15, you really get a beautiful fragrance, one of the nicest in my collection. It's a shame you can't buy it anymore. The sprayer is unfortunately not good."
Colonia Assoluta Edizione Riviera,04/11/2014,Sorceress,F,216,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Rock The Casbah,"So we have another entry from Bath & Body Works. These are busy folks. I will say this mini bottle is attractive. It’s glass with a fancy cap, blue wrapper and blue juice inside. For the $4.00 I paid for it, I don’t mind at all. Bath & Body Works always has these quaint sounding notes – “desert sand accord”; “casablanca orchid”; “exotic amber” and “pink amber”. The sounds of them draw you in.
I happened into a BBW out of town not realizing they had come up with a new potion. Telling the SA how disappointed I am that Sensual Amber is no longer available, she puts this in my hands.
I’m always a sucker for the mini EdP’s for a few bucks and I only paid $4.00 for this .24 oz. size. The bottle looks larger than what it actually holds.
Amber definitely steals the show for this new fragrance and stays at the forefront throughout the duration while the other notes do their swirls and dips to let you know they are there. The apricot and fig are barely there but noticeable and quite pleasant while the lemon verbena adds just a tingly bit of zest to awaken senses.
The apricot and fig lends a bitterness and keeps Morocco Orchid & Pink Amber on the drier side. Desert sand accord is listed in the top notes and sand can evoke so many images. As a note, it can give a perfume a warm ambery feel and that’s the idea behind this fragrance. It works along with the amber, vanilla and cashmere wood to create and foster such a cozy atmosphere when wearing it. It’s an intimate, informal feeling. The cashmere wood adds a musky feel, almost to the point of stifling your senses.
At times, I get a waxyness, not unlike Lemon Pledge, which I’d have to attribute to either the Lemon or the Rose or perhaps both. It’s there and lends its hand to the usual Bath & Body Works synthetic branding.
Ironically, orchid, jasmine and rose comprise the heart, yet I sense absolutely no floral composition in this perfume. As far as I’m concerned, it’s not Morocco Orchid & Pink Amber. It’s just Pink Amber. Or it should be Clean Pink Amber.
For amber lovers, this is a replacement for Sensual Amber, although it’s just too different. Whereas Sensual Amber is juicier more full-bodied, Morocco Orchid & Pink Amber seems to lack the richness and sophistication that I’m looking for. It’s a light introductory amber that lacks the sophistication and maturity I’d want in a full bottle of perfume. It’s subtle and very clean in it’s presentation and I don’t believe amber should be. It deserves to be heavier and fuller, and more resinous and more rosinous.
The amber that performs in Morocco Orchid & Pink Amber is better suited for summer days, evenings and hot weather. It lasts as a skin scent for a couple of hours and then disappears. As a throw-in to my purse, it will suffice for continual re-sprays.
And no idea why but Rock The Casbah comes to mind for me."
Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2024,03/30/2024,Porfiria,F,33,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Queen of summer? This is for you!,"Do we need yet another fragrance with tropical notes and sunscreen vibes?

Yes, absolutely yes!!
because we want to think about summer sea and freedom.
if done with the right criteria can we say “Yupppie”!

What is the right criteria for me?
it's not a sugar explosion, it's not unbalanced, it's not gourmand, it's not powdery or a fluffy coconut donuts.

It has a beautiful green opening that opens into a tropical floral heart made creamy by coconut. Yeap that’s all? Yes but what a beautiful sensation on your skin!!
It looks a bit like TF's Soleil Blanc but in a slightly wilder way.
More feminine than masculine
Duration good projection lower due most Killian fragrances."
Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2024,03/19/2024,DNiche,F,10,,1,"Wow, now it's summer!",What to say? An amazing summer feeling will envelop you as soon as you will spray this wonder new fragrance from Kilian. The coconut note is absolutely predominant and it makes you feel on a tropical island. The tiare flowers and the vanilla give the fragrance that special summer vibes that you would appreciate in the months to come. The longevity is very good and few pumps will accompany you for an entire day.
Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2024,03/09/2024,Havasiszabi,M,5,,2,Coconut Wonder,"Sunkissed goddess is essentially Eau de Soleil Blanc by Tom Ford on steroids. The coconut note is dominant, but undercut by a floral backbone and zesty opening. As a fan of the original Soleil Blanc and being disappointed by the fresher Eau de soleil blanc release, this has scratched that itch for me that I was missing, as the performance is beyond good for a summer fragrance. Highly recommend if you are looking for a fresh coconut - suntan lotion fragrance."
Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2024,03/09/2024,Schar002,F,58,,7,Fleeting Kiss,"A release that was eagerly anticipated.
Is it the scent of a goddess, kissed by the sun?
Maybe.
But perhaps it is just a promise, fleeting like a kiss blown into the air with hopes for more...

The fragrance is tropical.
Top and heart notes are easily perceptible.
Sweet, floral, and with coconut.... Summer, sun, white sandy beach.

Where would I wear it?
In a luxury resort in the Maldives or during a vacation in the South Seas.

After a day of sunbathing at the Waldorf Astoria Maldives, slathered in the finest sunscreen, I rinse off the wellness day, using the Frangipani shower oil and coconut shampoo from the luxury resort.
I apply aftersun lotion to my body, the scent is delicate.

I pin up my still damp hair with a clip and choose a long white dress for dinner on the beach.

I apply SUNKISSED GODDESS, the fragrance fits so well with this fantastic vacation in the Maldives....

Conclusion: A well-made summer scent, fine and luxurious.
Made for postcard-worthy vacations in life.

However, I miss the special something that makes the scent a ""wow"" for me.
Also, the price is too high for a nice summer fragrance.
In everyday life, I lack the opportunity to wear it, as I am not lying on a dream beach every day and showering under a rainforest shower ;-).

For anyone who wants to beam themselves into such a moment, or wants to have a paradise summer 365 days a year:
A test is worth it!

EDIT 02/2025: A small decant accompanied me to Maui, Hawaii. Now when I sniff it, it smells of sun, Kaanapali Beach, and a beautiful time! A leftover bottle had to come home - in memory of my wonderful trip!"

Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2021,09/23/2022,Elysium,M,898,,2,There’s Something Soapy In The Air,"According to the tweet from Oddity Group, who oversaw the campaign for the brand launch, DM introduced the Seinz line to the market in March 2019, and consequently, I also assume the three perfumes. When writing these lines, Sport is part of a series of three fragrances from the SEINZ line, which has very little sportiness and releases soapy accords with leafy and earthy overtones. In the series, we find a Classic EAU DE TOILETTE perfume, somewhat greenish with aromatic and musky touches, and an Intense EAU DE TOILETTE scent, on the woody kind with sweetish and gourmand nuances. All three fragrances are enclosed in a minimal box that opens by sliding the inner tube, and on one side shows the olfactory pyramid with two crucialnotes for each phase. The bottles are essential, simple, in opaque glass, and Sport is blue.

But what does this fragrance smell like? To my nose, Sport announces itself with a fresh and citrusy boost. The bergamot is velvety, and the orange is slightly sweet. There is a tinge of sourness, as if unripe lemon peel oil were there in the citrus fruit mix. In the beginning, I feel nuances resembling tobacco leaves, undoubtedly due to the mixture of the other notes. The citric aspect subsides quickly, while the green note of the tobacco leaves takes on consistency.

The heart notes change towards a soapy aroma, thanks to the velvety leaves of geranium and sage. Rosy and clean hues make their way through the tobacco-like trail, take over and transform the scent into something aromatic, a little dark, fresh, deep, and virile. I confirm my initial intuition, and Sport is not the usual cologne to wear before or after the gym. Most likely, violet leaves also give it a moist and dusty look while enhancing the tobacco-like nuance. The more the perfume grows on my skin, the more I like it. I swear I wasn’t expecting a fragrance of this level, and the low rating is misleading.

After overcoming the initial chaos, and the major aromatic explosion, Sport changes again on the finish, taking on woody, a little earthy, and little smoky characteristics. The dry note of cedar wood marries the more herbaceous note of vetiver root, and these two chords alternate as if on a swing. Cedar is somewhat resinous, while the facets of pencil shavings are almost absent. Overall the fragrance that has now become a skin perfume remains fresh and green for the rest of its life.

As I perceive it, Sport is a pleasing fragrance. It performs well and never has unpleasant or out-of-tune peaks. It may not be unique, but it is well done, lasts several hours, and leaves a clean halo out of the shower. An all-around fragrance, which can be worn from spring to late autumn, but also in winter if that’s your thing. Better to use it for the day, outdoors, in your free time, but also for work.

I base the review on a 60ml bottle I have owned since September 2022.

Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2021,05/17/2025,Dionysos2022,M,946,,2,And since triplets are always...,"... three, I also tried it out on this Saturday morning and was almost as disappointed as with the white one. I sprayed it on and the videos of Miki Montales came to mind, where he would show this scent to a Justin.

Upon application, a piercing synthetic citrus scent assaults the nose, which is masked by sage and floral notes. The wood doesn't improve it either, and the vetiver gives this scent no depth.

The longevity and sillage are just adequate.

Here we have a men's fragrance that the world didn't need. Theoretically wearable at any age. Also for women if they want. It's a scent for warm and hot days. It can be worn during the day. Definitely not in the evening.

For those who like a creepy synthetic citrus green floral woody scent. Then please. Fortunately, it costs almost nothing."
Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2021,03/17/2025,ben2w4,M,4,,2,Seinz. Sport A Fresh Scent for Every Day,"Seinz. Sport by dm is a fresh and sporty fragrance. At first, it has a strong scent of orange and other citrus fruits. Later, light woody notes come in, which soften the fragrance.

Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long, and you can only smell it faintly. Nevertheless, it is good for teenagers or people who are just starting with perfume. The bottle looks okay, but nothing special.

For the affordable price, Seinz. Sport is a good fragrance, especially for warm days or after sports."
Mirto di Panarea Limited Edition 2021,07/01/2020,Mantus,M,487,,4,Eau de Ajax,"At first, one can perceive a very intense and strong citrusy sour note, which brings with it a remarkably greenish biting quality, and I suspected the use of citron and completely overdosaged lime instead of bergamot.

""With the 'lime', I also constantly have the feeling that the dropper from the oil bottle has fallen off, and the person responsible for Eau de Ajax probably got a bit startled at first but then thought: Well, since it's already in there, let's process it - We have to think sustainably, right!? -

By the way, I believe that all the oils have had their droppers fall off...

At the same time, the 'bergamot' is enveloped by a very sweet orangey note that appears somewhat unpleasantly jelly-like, and I thought I perceived orange essence instead of orange. - ""This with the Polish 'Vegan' seems to be true already!"" :-)

""And now in German:

This stuff first takes your shoes off! -

Full-on Ajax cleaning milk and so authentic that you think you've just taken a little sip from the bottle, and NO, you shouldn't try this now!

A little later, Eau de Ajax is still geared up for a ruckus; shouldn't one rather say scrubbed? Although not quite as much anymore, but still!

And it gets a scratchy spicy edge from the sage, which is accompanied by a slightly sweet Mediterranean lavender, and to crown the disaster, there is a sweet floral note around it that completely confuses you and you can't assign it at all, because it is also carried by the Cascalonian Iso - E Super God, and I recognize that I was right about the sage, the irritating flower is a geranium, and my synapses probably just added lavender because today is such a beautiful day!"" :-)

What remains is a very bright, soft, resinous wooden tone that conceals a fine deep spicy note in the background and provides an extremely pleasant smooth finish.

Overall, the scent lasts 5.5 hours on my skin.

The sillage is designed to be very noticeable at half an arm's length for the first 10 minutes and 3 cm close to the skin for 1 hour, before it rapidly diminishes until the scent fades away."
Colonia Intensa Prestige Edition 2012,03/13/2025,MacnZee,M,29,,1,Not for me,There was something quite strange and off-putting in the opening that sadly never went away. I think it may have been the betal leaf. Unfortunately it was all my nose would fixate on and sadly this was a scrubber for me. The price was fairly reasonable considering it was a patron release. $200usd for a 30 ml bottle. I was thankfully able to sell it for the same price so I didn't take a loss
Colonia Designer Edition,07/26/2020,LilJ,M,3,,6,Please stay a little longer...,"I will try to briefly describe my impression of the scent with this short comment:

The Opening (Duration: approx. 1-2 hours):
First of all, big compliments to DUA! I love Layton and Aventus, and with this fragrance, they have managed to combine both main components. The opening is very citrusy, fruity, fresh, and comparatively long-lasting. A fruity Chypre! The typical Aventus pineapple note accompanies this successful start. The sillage is really very strong during the first 2 hours (I would give it a 9). While the drydown of Layton occurs much earlier, you need to be a bit more patient here.

The Drydown (after approx. 2 hours):

The drydown then moves more towards the creamy and gourmand direction. Birch, musk, and vanilla join in, while the citrus notes fade a bit. Overall, the scent no longer radiates the great initial power. However, it smells really delicious :). I would now rate the sillage a 7. In comparison, I find the drydown of Layton stronger - the drydown of PLC is a bit too shy for me.

Longevity:
As can be inferred from the title, I am not completely satisfied with the longevity. Especially with products from DUA, I would have expected a longevity beyond the 10-hour mark. However, the scent leaves me ""already"" after 6-8 hours. But it could also be due to my skin type... on clothing, it holds up solidly.

Why I still find the scent so good:
It really excellently combines the individual components of Aventus, Layton, and Percival. Anyone who loves the individual fragrances will adore PLC! This scent is also a perfect all-rounder. In the office? No problem! Date night? Compliments guaranteed! Season? Doesn't matter! Even during sports, it delights me :)"
Iris Nobile Edizione Speziale 2014 - 10º Anniversario,08/20/2013,Tar,F,261,,1,Slice of life: From washing to ironing,"This is the first Profumi del Forte fragrance, what does not reminds me to a landscape, but even FIORISIA is a ""slice of life"" perfume.

First I detect an odor of laundry soap. After the top notes fade, the heart surprises me with power of will: it is much stronger than the top. I can imagine, that in the bottle the top notes are sitting on the head of the heart notes, and heart's flowers are fighting for their freedom. But the released flowers get only a few minutes on the stage, since FIORISIA goes on its own way, does not caring about the perfume-habits. Heart ends in a stubborn washing powder aroma, later on it softens till soapiness.
From the base notes cedarwood is the king. It shows up first as broken branches wooden fibers, and drying, drying, till you get the scent of the ironed clothes.

Not bad, but not my cup of tea."
Colonia Essenza Edizione Speciale,09/06/2020,Elysium,M,898,,2,The Imperial State Crown,"Ruby is a pink to blood-red gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum — aluminium oxide. Other gem-quality corundum varieties are called sapphires. Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, along with amethyst, sapphire, emerald and diamond, and a massive one is part of the Imperial State Crown. The word ruby comes from “ruber”, Latin for red. The colour of a ruby is for the chromium element. The experts have described the perfect coloured ruby as pigeon blood red, usually sourced in Myanmar (Burma), this rather gruesome simile captures the most sought after colour for rubies. And Rubino scent (Italian name for Ruby) has a lot to do with that. The EDT, which I own and I am reviewing here, comes with a solid white box, containing an elegant squared bottle akin to Lalique’s Le Parfum. The juice is reminiscent of brandy, with a plastic cap shaped like a ruby gemstone and a tiny black tape wrapped around the sprayer. A lovely and luxurious presentation, indeed.

About Rubino scent, as soon as the juice comes out of the bottle, a thick, obscure smell of dark red fruits pleasantly fills the air. Not berries, slightly sweetish, but not overly sweet, with strong accents of overripe and juicy nectarine peach, with its ruby red, smooth skin. The pulp of the peach dips in freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice, which prevails over other citrus fruits. However, mandarin orange with its pulpy texture reflects perfectly in the opening of Rubino, sharp, tart, fresh and sparkling, though slightly spicy. The zesty and fruity accord features a floral and somewhat woody davana herb, with its smooth, tea-like smell, evocative of dried fruit, used mainly in oriental perfumes, and chypres such as Rubino. There is a dusty and powdery accent that lingers in the background, as if it blended a bit of iris or violet in the concoction — unquestionably Alpha-isomethyl ionone.

The heart emerges with a rosy peony and pittosporum, the latter’s flowers smelling heavenly, almost overpowering honey and orange blossoms like. The flowers to my nose smell exactly like Jasmine tea, I came across them the last Spring during the blooming. Others will say mock orange blossom or lilies with baby powder and a touch of lemon. Either way, it’s a good, sweet floral. Such a honeyed accord lasts a few hours, and I catch the redolence now and then. The jasmine I catch in there, and the amber-patchouli duo come in soon after and the juice deepens to a floral, deep, spicy, ambery, woody scent.

The sweetness of the initial stage keeps growing and growing up to the last stage, the dry down, yet never obnoxious. Mellow accords of powdery vanilla, sweet and creamy amber, and soft woody cashmeran melt with modern earthy patchouli, here used to counter an otherwise nauseating and cloying sugar bomb. Just when I thought it’s all over, and white blossoms reigned above all, a tiny whiff of patchouli appeared. The patchouli makes it a dark green scent, and the amber is substantial. The woody aspect from the cedar stays in the background, together with a soft touch of white musk. So this is not just old-styled scent; it has this hot vibe that seems provocative and filthy. A very sultry womanly smell. Juicy, opulent, dry, smoky, and a tad bit of floral. The patchouli and the musk notes, when added to the powdery florals in Rubino, create a spicy warmth that exudes sex appeal and mystery.

Rubino is a fragrance from the Chypre Floral group, which I’d have put into floriental, and the nose of this fragrance is Maurizio Cerizza. The overall aura makes me prefer Rubino during the colder seasons, early Spring, late Fall, and all Winter evenings and nights fit well. Not sure I will wear it for business meetings, but it’s a very sexy choice for outdoor events, weddings, birthdays, nights out. It smells voluptuous. I smell white flowers from the bottle, on the skin, it is spicy patchouli and amber. Did I say that I love it? The scent has excellent projection and lasts about several hours on my skin, the former of those hours with good sillage. The more I wear this perfume, the more I like it. They make it of quality ingredients, and nobody can accuse anyone who wears it from wearing “cheap perfume”.

This review bases upon a 100ml (3.4 Fl. oz) EDT bottle I own since September 2020.

Colonia Essenza Edizione Speciale,01/21/2016,Spektrum,F,113,,8,Powder and Makeup,"It's strong. Just sniffing the nozzle of the bottle and also the test strip instantly transported me back about 25 years. I am standing in front of my grandmother's washstand and opening her makeup drawer. Inside were ancient powder compacts and bright red lipsticks; she hasn't used this stuff in ages, and it didn't look like anything you could still buy...
So if you want to smell totally retro and like a film star from the 50s or 60s coming straight from the makeup room, get this one.
I didn't find it fresh at all, rather relatively heavy and very, very powdery. The pyramid reads just like how fragrances were often made back in the day: citrus as top notes (which I didn't recognize while testing), then rose in the heart, patchouli and musk for fixation... maybe such a standard blend was also used to scent cosmetics. But that's speculation."
