Legend Spirit,07/13/2017,Manscents,M,14,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Casual Summer,"Montblanc Legend Spirit is a good casual scent for the spring or summer. I think it is a very versatile fragrance and it would probably make a good work scent. Ideal for casual occasions but no reason why this could not be worn for more formal event also. Legend Spirit has a well blended opening and is has some sweetness but is also clean, fresh and invigorating It has the potential to collect complements. I get slightly above average projection / silage for the first 1 to 2 hour after that its starts getting closer to the skin. Longevity 6- 7 hours.

The white and chrome colour scheme of the bottle is a solid enough design but the downside is the bottle its totally opaque. it would have been nice to a have a small section to see the amount of visible juice remaining.

Overall scent 7.5/10"
Legend Spirit,08/25/2017,Muotarek,M,51,,1,Invictus clone,"Invictus clone, it smells good in the initial spray then i feel i'm gonna throw up, not my thing at all!! very synthetic and in a not good way, so i'm gonna stick to Mont Blanc Legend Intense which smells amazing and very well blended.

So this is a huge PASS for me."

Legend Spirit,04/29/2024,StarA1,M,136,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,A true legend...and the love of my life,"This legendary, timeless fragrance is the one that introduced me to the world of perfumes when I was younger.
I love light summer fragrances, but I don’t like winter fragrances that have a strong and pungent smell that surrounds you with an aura of oud, leather and tobacco, and I think they harm the wearer.

This fragrance is the most eloquent example of summer fragrances. It is a light, aquatic, refreshing masculine fragrance that contains citrus and musk. It has a very distinctive scent.

This fragrance is suitable for men over 35 years and older, The fragrance bottle is luxurious and pure white, made of polished glass, covered with shiny metal on top, and the bottle cap is also made of shiny metal, and of course there is the Montblanc logo on the bottle.

I usually don’t re-purchase fragrances twice, no matter how much I love them...but this is one of the rare fragrances that I have re-purchased.

Conclusion: An excellent summer fragrance that gives you self-confidence and a constant feeling of freshness."
Legend Spirit,05/13/2024,Guitar2016,M,232,,1,Lovely Fragrance,"This is a Nice scent, Fresh, Clean and Bright. The bottle explains everything. I bought it blind-buy after reading the positive comments with reasonable price. It opens up with slightly sweet fresh spicy , citrusy , Lavender and spices notes in the background then dry down is musky woody. The Combination of the Lavender and Cardamom notes is fantastic in the middle notes and..."
Legend Spirit,06/13/2023,Monstaro,M,41,,3,Nice but not for me,"Ya know, this is a really nice fragrance. Nothing terrible unique, but it's fresh, soapy, sweet yet still masculine. On paper, this is something that I would love. It is definitely a younger scent - I'm talking like teenager - but even if I was still in my teens, I'm not sure it would have been my style.

It's fun and outgoing, but not very deep, and me personally I try to express a sense of depth and awareness balanced with being outgoing. This fragrance only expresses half of that."
Legend Spirit,07/13/2025,Averycj,M,50,,1,Dangerously Close to Toilet Cleaner Territory,"This one is very citrusy. Like, aggressively citrusy. First sniff had me thinking of Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce vibes because of that citrus blast, but then it started leaning into Nautica Voyage territory. It’s kind of like if those two did a fusion dance and became one lemony aquatic scent.

For around $25, it’s not a bad cheapie at all. Smells clean, fresh, and like you put in at least some effort. I know Legend Spirit and Nautica Voyage are often compared when it comes to budget summer scents, but personally? I’d go with Voyage. It’s like ten bucks cheaper on Jomashop, a bit softer on the nose, and doesn’t hit you with a toilet cleaner vibe.

And to be fair, Legend Spirit doesn’t totally cross into harsh-cleaner territory, but it’s close. Not in a bad way, just... you’ll know what I mean when you smell it. It’s fresh, but also kind of sharp. Definitely better than smelling like B.O., but not something I’d full bottle. Maybe a good gym bag frag or something you throw on for those really humid days.

Solid aquatic, a bit too heavy on the citrus for me, but not a bad grab if you want something cheap, loud, and clean."
Legend Spirit,01/26/2025,MB02S,M,3,,2,Mont Blanc Legend Spirit,"It's the best value for money summer fragrance I'ved tried. It's very masculine and fresh, not a lot of spice but I don't mind in this instance because the rest is very well-blended. A very pleasent bergamot and grapefruit, I don't really get the musk on the drydown but the woods make up for it beatifully. Downside is that it doesn't last as long as I would like, but for 30€ you really can't go wrong for a very cheap freshie.
Scent: 8.3/10
Longevity: 6.1/10
Sillage: 6.8/10 (3-5 works for me)
Bottle: 5.4 (nothing fancy, plain and simple)
Value for money: 9.5/10"
Legend Spirit,07/03/2025,Rsansom3,M,4,,2,A very pleasant surprise...,"A lovely, addictive scent. I like this way, way more than the OG Legend. Nothing wrong with being so close to A&F's Fierce, but I wore that during highschool and college so it's hard to wear Legend without feeling like a kid again (sometimes a good thing, sometimes not).

Legend Spirit is better from the start simply by being more unique and more versatile. There is a overwhelming sense of freshness that comes across and lingers through the whole profile. This must be the ""water notes"" listed. I personally don't smell the citrus, but I do get something here that is sweet, a tiny bit fruity, but not overwhelmingly so. Maybe the lavender? Maybe the cardamom? Whatever it is, it helps this fresh, aquatic smell become something almost mouthwatering. And then it gets even better as it dries down and the musk starts to come out. This is one of those summer scents that can be sprayed in the early afternoon and be absolutely perfect, and stays perfect as the day transitions into evening and the scent matures on your skin.

I personally don't get the performance issues others are complaining about. It's not a beast-mode fragrance, no, but I'm of the opinion that sometimes subtlety is the best strategy. With it being a EDT in mind, I spray 7-8 times (3-4 times on chest/back of neck, 2 times on each inner elbow) and I can easily pick it up as I move around 10 hours later. There have even been times where, a solid 12 hours later, I couldn't quite pick it up myself but my wife would comment about how good I smell when I walk by.

For how much a 100ml bottle costs (at discounters, cough cough), this is an absolutely killer deal. A dumb grab n spray everyday warm weather fragrance that actually has some depth and interest and smells amazing? Yeah sign me up, I wish I found this gem years and years ago."
Legend Spirit,09/05/2023,JinBaba,M,33,,1,Summer Freshy Scent,"Legend Spirit is a classic fragrance for the summer or the warmer spring days. It opens with a burst of sparkling citrus notes, including bergamot and pink pepper. As the scent develops, a blend of fresh aquatic, lavender and cardamom emerges, adding a touch of aromatic warmth to the composition. The heart of Legend Spirit is a clean and fresh accord that is both timeless..."

Wow. I never ever get so much compliments on any fragrance like this one. Not on Sauvage or Luna Rossa Carbon, not on Aqua di Gio, Not on Bvlgari Aqva, not on YSL La Nuit or YSL L'homme, and not on Lalique White or Boss reversed. And here is this not-so-hyped brand with this not hyped fragrance...."
Legend Spirit,12/05/2020,Daniel812,M,2,,1,Mont Blanc Legend Spirit Review,"This perfume is a hit, I love its fragrance and the best thing is that it lasts all day. Its Top notes are Grapefruit, Bergamot and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Water Notes, Lavender and Cardamom; base notes are White Musk, White Woods, Cashmere Wood and Oakmoss. I love this perfume. Men of the world; wear this perfume. Is perfect. Me, and my family have had a time to say that it smells so GOOOOD!!!! Last Longing to make it even way better. Recommend for young men and teenagers but any man can wear it. You have to try it."
Legend Spirit,06/23/2025,Tomhx,M,6,,1,Decent 'harmless impression' scent that leaves a lot to be desired,"Legend Spirit is an odd fragrance. This is an EDT, and altough you definitely get that sort of vibe, its not what most fresh EDT's are. My main complain with many EDT's is that there usually isnt a note prominent in the scent, or just one or two notes that quickly fade away. That is not much different with Legend Spirit, but it does have a certain woodyness that sets itself at least a little apart from other EDT's.

The problem is that that is it. Its a 2-3 hour scent that has not one prominent note that is worth mentioning. Its not Particularly cheap either. Its a pretty harmless scent that because of that wood probably fits better as a 'special occassion' scent than other EDT's, but if that is your goal to get out of Legend Spirit, i would say there are much better, even cheaper options out there.

Its great for teenagers and as an option to choose from if you cant make a choice without choosing the wrong thing, i do think its not bad, but it doesnt fit as anything else than a underwheling harmless signature scent. From a score of 0-100, i would give this a 67"
Legend Spirit,09/13/2024,Niklas709,M,3,,1,Legend Spirit sehr Sauber,"Legend Spirit ist für mich ein sehr sauberer Duft, welchen man gut tragen kann um frisch geduscht und Sauber zu riechen. Perfekt für den Alltag und für den Sport. Er ist auf keinen Fall aufdringlich. Außerdem ist der Legend Spirit von Mont Blanc für sein Preis echt jeden Cent wert. Ein Klasse Duft für die Schule und für den Sommer."
Legend Spirit,08/02/2020,ScentSlave,M,246,,0,This one gets a lot of hype,"but it doesn’t quite live up to its expectations, at least in my opinion. It smells like it WISHES it was in the Invictus line, but doesn’t quite make the cut. The opening REALLY tries to be one of the Paco Rabanne trophy cups, but as it dries down it becomes quite a bit “thinner” in how it resonates and projects. Imagine how someone who was rocking Invictus when they “hooked up” would smell when they left in the morning. That’s the vibe I get. How someone who wore Invictus edt and didn’t scrub hard enough in the shower would smell. A thinned out, softer feeling Paco flask with a pinch of “soap” added to it.

It’s not a bad scent by any means. Some people kind of like Invictus, but think its a little too “loud” in sillage and projection. Legend Spirit would appeal to them. It’s softer, and doesn’t project as much; maybe a 1.5ft radius maximum. Sillage is also very weak, and it becomes a skin scent very quickly. It’s not bad, but it’s definitely not for me."
Legend Spirit,09/23/2017,Basti87,M,1062,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Goes in the direction of Invictus/Invictus Aqua,"This Montblanc also joined my collection this month. I have owned the original Legend for some time, and I ordered this flanker untested. It is not very famous, neither here nor elsewhere, but some recommend this fragrance.

This flanker of Legend is little known. One thing to note: The typical Fierce DNA from the original is not found here. The fragrance pyramid is also rather unremarkable. A fresh bergamot-grapefruit blend, followed by a light aquatic note and a subtle spiciness. Finally, there is a musk-wood mixture that is quite mild. The fragrance pyramid confirms this as well. It starts off slightly sharp-unpleasant and somewhat synthetic. This subsides after a few minutes. The Legend DNA is not recognizable to me at any point, which is not unusual for flankers these days. However, I perceive a strong similarity to Invictus/Invictus Aqua by Paco Rabanne. Due to this beautiful bitter grapefruit note, it leans more towards Invictus Aqua, especially in the first hour. As the aquatic notes come through more, it develops more of its own character. It is accompanied by light spicy hints that are very soft and rather pleasant in the background. In the final phase of this fragrance, fresh woods paired with musk come into play. The gentle woods fit well into this fresh attire. Especially from the second hour, it truly becomes a fresh, soft creation. This slight Invictus note is still present, but significantly softer.
Really a pleasant fragrance that can also be great for sports activities. It is truly uncomplicated and gentle. I have already tested it at the gym. I must say that it is pleasant and not intrusive during sports. For other occasions, it might be too unremarkable.
The performance is not bad for a fresh fragrance, but also not more than that. It starts with very good sillage, which, however, quickly diminishes, but remains in a pleasant range. Of course, it cannot compete with the performance of Invictus. Longevity should be around 5-6 hours, with the last hours being hardly noticeable.

In terms of price, this fragrance is really fair. I paid around 20 euros for 30ml, which I believe this fragrance is truly worth. There are certainly much cheaper fresh fragrances, but that should not diminish this scent. Not a must-have, but still a very solid release."
Legend Spirit,03/19/2020,Ischeki,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,19,The Yes-Sayer,Is it currently being hyped quite a bit on YouTube? - Yes. Did I therefore seek out a sample out of curiosity? - Yes. Was that completely unnecessary since I have already snagged 80 other fragrances on Parfumo? - Yes. Am I still glad that I did it? - Yes. Does it smell exactly like Hubba Bubba bubblegummy sweet at the start? - Yes. Does the sweetness then settle down to reveal...
Legend Spirit,04/01/2019,2fast4u,M,2,,7,Compliment Magnet,"I am writing this comment because something happened to me with the perfume recently that I have never experienced with any other fragrance :D
I find the perfectly embedded grapefruit scent brilliant, but I was surprised by how many compliments I received about this perfume, both from men and especially from women. After two sprays on my neck and about an hour later, I was walking on a windy evening outside (!) to the stadium when a young woman, from three (!) meters away, called out, ""Hey you in the black sweater, you smell really good!"" I was really surprised, partly because I don't overdo it with the scent and partly because this grapefruit-musk fragrance is actually a soft, rather subtle version.
This perfume is totally underrated and a little insider tip from me ;)"
Legend Spirit,06/10/2022,TomGehFord,M,17,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,26,"""Sell, do, act!"", or: Mr. ""I-wear-the-top-note-all-day""","In customer consulting, we are always supported by field representatives from different companies (those of you in banking know this), each responsible for their own areas, such as insurance, personal loans, funds, or even building savings contracts.

A few years ago, when the candidate for the last category was once again replaced, we were assigned a very special guy. Naturally, there are all sorts of people here too: brash show-offs who get a new AMG as their vehicle every six months, chronic depressives, sleeping pills, burnout candidates, but rarely truly good advisors - which is, by the way, due to the job being simply inhumane. For comparison: the current colleague works daily from early morning until at least midnight, has probably seen his children for the last time in a non-sleeping state six months ago, and will likely throw in the towel soon.

But there was one, a very special one, on whom all hope rested at that time. He was supposed to sell a massive number of building savings contracts. He was introduced to us as a highly motivated former securities professional who had worked at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. This information could have been spared, as he exuded an unbelievably clichéd vibe from every pore. Hectic, fast, restless, bloated from coke. While waiting for the customer, sharply planning and highly focused with one hand on his chin, pacing up and down in the customer area, incredibly assertive and demanding (even though he was only supposed to support us, and no one was subordinate to him), and of course ridiculously over-motivated.
When he entered the office, he would call out with what was probably a freshly powdered nose, ""Morning, hi, hello, Moin, Morning!"". When saying goodbye, he didn't simply say ""Bye!"", but he would excitedly tap on the table and shout, ""So! Ciao, bye, ciao! And sell, do, act, right?"", before almost running out. He spoke incredibly quickly, concisely, and purposefully. He was not a ""normal"" consultant, but the purest caricature of one. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing him. I just still enjoy my somehow cult-worthy memories of him. Every one of his quirks was cinematic. None of my descriptions are exaggerated!

One of his main characteristics was that he would go to his car about every 15 minutes. We don't know what else he did there (it probably snowed in his car more often), but one thing was clear to all of us: the spray head of his bottle would be activated again soon! We only experienced him with the top note of this incredibly masculine, pleasing, somehow sporty and metallic scent. No one ever knew the heart, let alone the base note. The sillage was enormous, and due to the quarterly re-spraying, the offices still smelled of the fragrance even after two hours. The whole powder must have significantly damaged his nose anyway, and with the constant application of the little water, the poor guy must have been completely scent-blind.

At some point, I mustered the courage to ask him about the fragrance.
""Uh, Montblanc, yes,"" he said, while simultaneously continuing to work on his laptop and tapping his leg. ""Okay, smells good,"" I replied, and went back to my office, as he probably would have already tuned me out as an unnecessary distraction from his work at that moment. Just the sight of this sales robot could bring one closer to their first heart attack.

Anyway, with the information I had available, I soon went to the perfumery to test all the Montblancs available at that time (this was still before the release of ""Explorer""). I ultimately found success with ""Legend Spirit"" and realized for the first time that fragrances on one's own skin or ""with the nose on the arm"" never smell the same as in the air - because they always smell better there!
Fruity, fresh, clean, masculine, universally applicable, and guaranteed to please everyone. No unnecessary games or extravagant scent notes. The ""legendary spirit"" simply smells ""on point"". It has only one goal: to make you smell good or to make an impression. Sometimes, when you're tired of all the niche stuff, a reach for the white bottle helps, and you immediately feel as fresh as if you just did coke, uh, showered.

""Montblanc Legend Spirit"" doesn't need an elaborate description. It's simple, and good at it. As a perfume lover, you might find scents with an oudy toffee note, spiced with cinnamon, sharpened with ginger, and made long-lasting with dog poop, more artistically valuable. But try reapplying that every 15 minutes - you won't last long with that!

No, sometimes it has to be simple. Sometimes, when you want to conclude a building savings contract and are frustrated because ""unfortunately all building savings contracts under 10,000 EUR are currently sold out,"" you can also just work the spray head of this unspectacular little fragrance to vent your frustration and think of Mr. N.

So, bye, ciao, bye! Buy Montblanc Legend Spirit, spray, act! Invictus Aqua 2016 sold out! Do it! ACT!"

Legend Spirit,09/07/2020,Intenso,M,123,,8,Everything but a Legend!,"The rather positive reactions to this fragrance don't really make sense to me. I just find nothing exciting about Legend Spirit, apart from the bottle. The bottle is really beautiful, the white color combined with the metallic accent adds some flair to the fragrance shelf.
The scent is quite inexpensive to acquire, and in my opinion, it smells like it. It has a very ""teenage"" vibe and reminds me of the first drugstore scent of a 15-year-old boy. The fragrance starts off somewhat acceptable with a noticeable grapefruit and melon-like scent DNA, quite fresh.
Over time, a bit of sandalwood becomes noticeable, but that doesn't make it any more attractive or interesting.
Otherwise, it's boring, as the fragrance develops absolutely nothing that brings depth and punch. Sillage and longevity are okay, especially for the price. I would also not recommend over-spraying this fragrance, as this ""cheap drugstore scent note"" literally takes your breath away. For teenagers, it's just about okay, thanks to the initial freshness, but I cannot recommend this fragrance for men."
Legend Spirit,04/23/2020,Nichelover01,M,7,,6,Nice Immerser - or not?,"I tested this one at Duty Free. It reminded me not only of Invictus but much more of Lacoste L12.12 blanc. So far, so good. I then applied it and got on the plane. Again and again, I thought during the flight (no joke): “Who smells so good here?”

When my girlfriend pointed out that it was me, I promptly ordered it. After wearing it several times, I found it increasingly annoying/synthetic, and so it had to leave my collection. The sillage really smells great, though!

Conclusion: A good everyday and sports fragrance with good H+S, but it lacks a bit of uniqueness and might be too synthetic for some.

Not a blind buy, but worth a test."
Legend Spirit,04/24/2018,Eggenberg,M,2,,8,Montblanc Legend Spirit,"I find the scent very good, I skipped ""sillage"" as I can't really judge it.

I also got the ""After Shave Balm"" from Mont Blanc Legend Spirit, and combined with the Eau de Toilette, it's really amazing.

Also, the price is totally fine.

I know one thing: as soon as it's empty, which shouldn't take too long, I will get it again.

Shower, shave, After Shave Balm from Legend Spirit plus Eau de Toilette ... and just like that, I have 5 more women on Facebook and 7 more women on WhatsApp... ;)

Legend Spirit,11/23/2020,Xecut,M,4,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Of Hope and Other Soap Bubbles,"There is a book from 1940 that deals with hope. In ""The Tartar Steppe,"" the Italian Dino Buzzati describes the life of the young officer Giovanni Drogo, who soon wants to prove his courage and fighting spirit. The story tells of empty hope, of chimera, and of wasting time. The soldier is assigned to a remote fortress in the desert. Waiting for great battles, he takes up his duty. It is said that the Tartars are preparing an attack on the base.

Over time, the orders in the fortress prove to be a futile endeavor. Weeks, months, and years pass. Sometimes it seems as if the longed-for moment of heroism in battle will arrive. But all in vain - the enemy does not storm, and there is no salvation.

With compelling pathos, Buzzati tells of an existence that fades away over time. After 30 years, having grown old and alone, Drogo leaves his fortress. As he dies lonely in an inn, he cannot witness the feverish preparations for war. The Tartars have launched an offensive on the post where Drogo once spent his life.

This Montblanc variant also plays with hope. The smooth bottle with the delicate snap cap is almost a work of art. The opulent opening, thanks to grapefruit, appears quite genuinely neat, but quickly transitions into a sweet-soft drydown. The appealing start with a freshness kick is unfortunately soon hopelessly over. Unnoticed, one is left alone with the quietly pleasing base.

And just like with Drogo, the desire is the scent definition in Legend Spirit. Not the reality."
Legend Spirit,05/23/2018,Farneon,M,112,,2,Salt on Our Skin???,"So, I’ll keep it as short as possible! This scent cannot compete with the Montblancs I otherwise love: Individuel, Presence, and Starwalker ""stinking"" in my nose! Luckily, all three can still be ordered, but they probably won’t be produced anymore! What a shame: The good ones are being phased out, while the bad ones are kept! :-( Free after the motto ""I liked the old songs, not the new ones""! What would I give to be able to smell Photo, Relax, or Bogner Man again ...

But back to LS: Not a terrible or bad scent, but I have enough options in my closet to reach for something else in case of ""freshness."" Why? LS has a very salty note for me, and I can’t handle that. I have no idea where it comes from, but that’s how I perceive it. Therefore, LS smells somehow ""mustier"" and ""stricter"" to me than other citrus aquatics, which I actually like very much. A bit like sweat, you know! ;-)

But of course, this is just my personal impression. So if you like it ..."
Legend Spirit,11/21/2021,Philipp91,M,219,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A lot of quality for little money,"Montblanc really offers great fragrances for relatively little money. The Legend Spirit EdT is very similar to Paco Rabanne Invictus EdT. However, it is more exciting, fresher, and fruitier. Of course, it also has a decent amount of sweetness, but it also features aquatic notes, grapefruit, and bergamot. These provide the freshness.

The scent lasts about as long as Invictus, with excellent longevity and sillage (around 8 hours of good projection). A fragrance for everyday wear, for going out, to make a statement, for the club. Unlike Le Male or One Million, Legend Spirit can still be worn well at 30+. The bottle is beautifully white and silver and feels really high-quality. And the kicker is, of course, the price: for little money, you get a lot of fragrance quality! Definitely worth a try!"

Legend Spirit,09/01/2022,Sirbennyone,M,499,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Underrated...,"Sometimes you need something quick (in the car, in the bathroom, or who knows where) and in my opinion, this is the fragrance - a no-brainer....

I've read for years that it smells like shower gel, but sometimes I wonder, what's so bad about that?

We all know cheap shower gels or deodorants, and most people use them too; are they bad? They can be annoying or feel less luxurious, that's true, but they do have a job, and they fulfill it - just like this fragrance here.

I've been using it for several years now, and when it comes to compliments, it casually outperforms many €200 (+) fragrances, and that alone says a lot.

When I wear it, I feel fresh - refreshed and really satisfied, that's how it should be.

A subtle classic all-rounder that fits well with a suit and in the office - especially with public traffic. Legend is easily noticeable, but unobtrusive.

Legend Spirit,03/19/2021,Carthago911,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Beautiful but Weak Everyday Fragrance,"In itself, Legend Spirit is a great, fresh fragrance that can be worn by any man. Online, it is often claimed that it smells like Invictus Aqua (2016), which I cannot confirm for myself. JF often compares it to toilet spray in a positive sense, which I find quite far-fetched.

Longevity is rather ""very weak"" for me, as it quickly disappears even from clothing. The sillage is okay in the initial minutes but fades quite quickly, so in my opinion, the scent is only perceived close to the body. However, this is not a deal-breaker for its price. Compared to other Mont Blanc fragrances, the performance is rather weak.

I can imagine the fragrance very well on very hot days inland or on vacation. It makes sense especially when you know that you will be showering or bathing in the next few hours. It is also suitable for the office on warmer days, although one would need to reapply several times a day. It is also suitable for men who like to wear a fragrance while training at the gym or for applying ""after"" (of course after showering ;-)).

Conclusion: Acceptable for the price and very well suited for ""unimportant"" everyday situations."
Legend Spirit,09/13/2024,Moritz007,M,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,A summer must.,"Montblanc Legend Spirit is a fragrance that truly surprises for its price! When I first applied it, a strong, fresh hint of fruity notes immediately came through, like pear (even though there’s none in it, haha) or grapefruit. Very aquatic. The opening is really zesty, with a mix of the aforementioned grapefruit and bergamot that refreshes you right away and gives you that clean shower feeling.

What I particularly like is that the fragrance doesn’t change too much. Sure, over time it becomes a bit warmer, with those wood notes in the background, but that fresh feeling remains throughout. For the price you pay, you really get a lot - a great blend of freshness and elegance that is perfect for warm days.

One downside: the longevity could perhaps be a bit better, but at this price, you can just apply a little more, haha. If you’re looking for something light and fresh that isn’t overwhelming, then Legend Spirit is truly a good choice!"

For sporty people who often dress casually, it's just an awesome all-rounder.

The scent is fresh, slightly sweet, partly warm, partly blue, it really can do it all.

Many see a resemblance to Invictus Aqua (2016).

It is definitely usable in pretty much any situation.

I also don't think it's too youthful, as many claim.

You should definitely give it a try if you like freshies :)"
Legend Spirit,06/05/2024,Chearsky,M,20,,3,You could have been so good!,"From the scent profile this fragrance gives off, it is clearly one of the best aquatic scents I know. The aquatic notes, bergamot, and lavender harmonize excellently. A brilliant everyday companion that unfortunately does NOT last long and whose sillage is also not really good...
It has the potential to be among the best, but unfortunately, it was not fully utilized.

All in all, you can't complain for this price; you get such a great fragrance for so little money (then you just have to take it with you and reapply).

It is perfect as a gym scent; the fragrance makes you want to work out!"

Legend Spirit,08/05/2025,Langschwert,M,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,The Beginning,"This is where it all began for me. My passion for fragrances, my collection, my day.
My brother, who had been enthusiastic about fragrances for a while, gifted me this one for my birthday. Giving a fragrance as a gift without prior knowledge is always a tricky matter, whether it is liked or not. But with this one, there was no problem. It is very pleasant, light, and fresh, not groundbreaking in any way, yet always useful. Even though my collection now consists mostly of niche fragrances, I still find myself returning to this one, whether on a hot summer day or during a visit to the university or elsewhere, it doesn’t matter. This one works anytime and never disappoints. It’s incredibly pleasant even during sports."
Legend Spirit,01/27/2023,LukasMa,M,4,,1,Great Price-Performance Ratio,"The scent is always appropriate.
Fresh and a bit sweet.
Perfect for wearing in the warmer seasons.
Great price for what you get.
It is almost always well received.
Recommendation for those who want to smell fresh but have a certain sweet touch. Unfortunately, the upper chrome part of the bottle came off for me, I had to glue it back on, but it doesn’t affect the scent, of course."
Legend Spirit,03/21/2023,Webaslan88,M,32,,2,Daily Driver from April to September,"Citrusy-fresh, lightly peppery aquatic with a woody base. This is how one could briefly and succinctly describe Legend Spirit by Montblanc. It sounds very unremarkable, like an everyday summer fragrance. But doesn’t it want to be that? Whether it wants to or not, it is. And it does it well.

The bottle is simple and rounded, similar to the other fragrances in the Legend line. The white color fits very well with the image, a nice change from the typical aqua blue of other aquatics. The bottle cap is chrome-plated, as is the top. It feels quite nice to the touch.

What ingredients are often listed in a fresh fragrance? Right, citrus fruits. Here, bergamot and grapefruit provide a deliciously fresh opening, which is slightly enhanced by the pepper. The latter fades after a few minutes and is replaced by aquatic notes - bringing in a slight synthetic quality. However, the synthetic aspect hardly bothers me; the accord remains fresh up to that point. Cardamom and lavender now contribute floral-sweet notes, and I would even describe it as having a slight creaminess from here on. But really just very lightly; maybe I’m just imagining that. Musk and various woods round off the fresh scent, without completely drifting into a woody territory, but rather remaining fundamentally citrusy-fresh. The woods, in my opinion, fit quite well with the overall picture of Legend Spirit.

It’s a pity that the H/S doesn’t bring a bit more power. After 4 hours, it’s only close to the skin for me. The fragrance is perfect as an everyday scent from spring to late summer. Whether at the office, during sports, at home, or on a beach holiday. Well, for dates, I might recommend something else. For that, Legend Spirit is too fresh and sporty. The price/performance ratio is also still good here. I can highly recommend this one for all aquatic fans and freshie lovers!"
Legend Spirit,06/14/2025,MaxPain,M,8,,3,Clean Freak for Training,"Absolutely great shower gel scent for sports, whether at the gym, martial arts, soccer, or anywhere else where you sweat a lot and have close contact with people, the scent is always perceived as pleasant... ""how can it be that you sweat like a pig but smell like you've just showered"" I've heard that many times. I also like to wear MB Legend during sports - I would describe it as a bit less ""shower gel-like,"" but still very fresh and suitable for the gym.

Legend Spirit,07/21/2025,LuisGries,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Clean-boy in a Polo Shirt,"That's what I thought when I sprayed the fragrance. Nice and fresh, ozonic, masculine (more for teenagers). The scent radiates a certain clean boy aesthetic. I had been at the gym in the morning, then freshly showered. Bam, ozonic fresh citrus, shower-like in the opening. Shortly after, the fragrance is fresh, relaxed, and ready to start the day. The scent is not very strong but accompanies you well throughout the day. School, sports, work, leisure. The smell of clean clothes with a hint of musk that is by no means overpowering lingers on you. A no-brainer."
Legend Spirit,01/12/2024,Youkarat,M,6,,2,Classic Fresh Scent,"Smells pleasantly fresh / sporty, I must honestly say nothing special, but it fits quite well for everyday use.

You press once, and bam, you feel instantly transported to the beach. The opening is an explosive, almost sparkling blend of pink pepper and grapefruit. It’s a freshness that feels not cool, but radiant and invigorating.
After the first few minutes, gentle, aquatic notes join in, making the scent incredibly clean and carefree. The drydown then becomes warmer and woodier, yet without losing its lightness. You can feel the depth of oak moss and a hint of musk, which makes it super masculine and elegant."

Individuel,07/14/2017,Manscents,M,14,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Individuel Bargin,"Montblanc Individual in my opinion is the best releases from this house. A very clean and aromatic fresh scent. There is also some sweetness provided by the Tonka bean, Raspberry and the Vanilla notes, There is more than a resemblance to Creed Santal as mentioned on various reviews although this was released first, Also it has been compared to the original Joop. although only slightly. This more refined and not as cloying as Joop . If you dont want to spend too much on a fragrance or just want to add this to a collection this is perfect.

Occasion wise this could be worn all year round apart form extreme heat as there is some sweetness but this is purely subjective, Montblanc Individual is perfect for work environment or socialising during the day or night. The projection / Silage is good for the first 3-4 hours and also above average longevity. Go easy on the trigger as this could potentially be over sprayed depending on skin type. This would make a good blind buy and I have to say this is a quality of this release from Montblanc.

The bottle design is simple but effective.

Overall scent 8.0"
Individuel,10/13/2022,Smellavision,M,205,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"Sweet, musky fabric softener!","I know, that's really cutting it short but Individuel is just great for office use, though it's kind of a lighter take on an oriental. The opening is sweet, but the sweetness becomes lesser the further you come into the drydown and I find it quite hard to dislike.
Is it synthetic? Yeah well, the opening has some synthetics with that raspberry tinge, but again it gets better and less obvious in the drydown where it turns smoother, fresher and more suave with the combo of bay leaf and cinnamon.

The green notes sparkle in warmer weather but I actually find this to be an all-year kind of scent, as the spices and berries are more prominent in colder temps, while the rosemary, greens and lavender give it a cooler take as the temperatures rise.

I cannot compare it to Joop Homme as I've never tried that one, but comparisons to Creed Original Santal are definitely justified - that Individuel is cheaper and was actually released before Original Santal just makes it even more respectable IMO. Appropriate for any age group, and I could even see it working just fine for enthusiastic youngsters in their early twenties, despite being launched in 2003. Adequate to good performance in regards to both longevity and projection. Overall, a very nice composition by Pierre Bourdon - the price to quality ratio here is really good and you won't offend anyone with this type of scent, so give it a whirl!"
Individuel,05/21/2020,Elysium,M,898,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,The Individual Needs That Differ From Each Person,"I noticed Montblanc Individuel by chance while looking for another perfume on Youtube, and a video appeared that examined the cheap men's fragrances with an unquestionably significant impact. Vlogger, like many other people on the web, referred to the similarity with Joop! Homme, the dark purple juice that I loved and wore just released in the early nineties. Hence, I pursued research and found that three colognes share the same vibe and common foundation, with a strong orange blossom initial note, such as Joop! Homme (1989), MB Individuel (2003), and Creed Original Santal (2005). The former has appealing qualities, much bolder, opulent and somehow cloying if worn in the wrong season, but was one of the biggest clubbing bombs, instead, this one is more on the aromatic side. About the latter, I have no idea since I never smelled it. So yes, at first glance, the similarity with Joop! Homme is inevitable if you happened to feel it or use it. However, this is only the first impression, because compared side by side the two share the same vibration, the same cherry syrup accord, but then proceed in two separate ways. Joop! is Joop!, no question about it!

I lastly manage to review this masterpiece, and wonder how come I have refrained from buying this for all this time. I bought it in May and wore it a couple of times, but umm... it didn't convince me at all. It is very sweet but yes compared to many super sweet fragrances it is relatively fresh. The performance of my lot is mediocre, low projection, low sillage, and low longevity, not a beast as you often hear on YouTube or read on blogs. So, what the fuss? Though, I love the overall redolence. As soon as you spray this scent on the skin, it gives you an instant boost of rich aromas, and you're going to notice that raspberry sweetness, delightful with clean laundry nuances but neither gourmand nor cloying. You can get it from the very beginning up to the dry-down where the note is supposed to be. But, there is also a sort of crisp freshness and balminess coming from the aromatic herbs and spices. My chemistry enhances the odorous notes of icy mint, memory balm rosemary, calming blueish lavender, sparkling coriander leaf, and juniper berry, which rise from the skin pleasantly. Instead, I don't get any citrus notes, yet I seem to catch some fruity pineapple accord, but it could be my nose. Other elements provide a woodier spice accord, such as cardamom and juniper. In this initial stage, Individuel is metallic, grey, a little deep. The cinnamon, raspberry, and juniper notes in Individuel give it a slightly fruity aroma which distinguishes it, in my opinion.

A little while later, it soon moves into the heart and leaves a relatively faint but noticeably sillage. There are a bunch of floral notes present, which creates a powdery feel. I can nearly detect individual blossoms like jasmine, violet, and orange flower, surrounded by a touch of green geranium. The interplay between the aromatics and floral notes are fresh and comforting.

Eftsoons, as it dries down, this clean freshness becomes woodier and creamier. The sweetness of the raspberry pairs with vanilla, on top of that sandalwood base. And a touch of amber, which arrives rather quickly for an oriental. A chocolate-like berry note lurks in there, too. Musk and moss hesitate, and I don't get them so pronounced as in Joop!. Thus, a luscious, slightly woody scent, with a creaminess, and dotted with cinnamon spice.

Provocative, some people love it, some others hate it. Though, I believe that this scent grows and grows on you, the more you wear it, the more you appreciate it. On my skin, the overall smell highlights juniper berries, raspberry, vanilla, cedarwood. The sweet, fruity, and spicy aroma makes MB Individuel perfect for those milder seasons where it is neither too warm nor too cold, Spring and Autumn's days fit flawlessly. It features remarkable notes that go well with the nighttime, either. Whether you’re going out to join a dinner party with friends, colleagues, or meeting the family, it gets serious!
The projection is below average, it's not overwhelming, but a bit weak, and I also get moderate longevity, of about half a day, depending on the weather. Individuel is everything but a solid performer, yet more than useful, for most occasions.
About the perfumer, Pierre Bourdon likes to create pure aura scents using complicated formulas and pyramids, and he does it successfully in Kouros, Cool Water, and Individuel. I love the first two more than the third, but Individuel holds its own and is worthy of Bourdon, and of anyone who wears modern orientals. If Creed Original Santal was inspired by this, there should be a reason, right?

This review is based on a 75ml bottle that I have owned since May 2020 (batch code i353, production date 2018-12-19).

Stay well; stay healthy.

Individuel,01/21/2014,Platinum1,M,59,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,"~ MB ""Santal"" ~","When a designer fragrance is compared to a niche typically it's a compliment. If a similar designer scent is routinely considered equal to or better than the niche that is high praise! And this is what you will find in this mainstream Mont Blanc Indivduel as it is often compared to Creed's own Original Santal. I know it sounds over simplified but this edt's opening reminds me of my favorite chocolate and raspberry candy with the dry down reminding me of perhaps the worlds greatest smelling fabric softener, no need to get complicated here. It is very linear and that is just fine by me as this budget scent gives a very desirable sweet yet fresh ride from start to finish. Oh and the bottle design would looks right at home between any of my favorite Chanel's."

It last all day and then some without problems. I think it is a strong scent, so be careful with the sprays. Use for casual everyday, work/university.

Joop Homme is certainly more sinthetic and not as well crafted as this, why they differ.

I feel a very pronounced notes of cinnamon, vanilla and pineapple mostly.

Lasting power is high and with huge projection."
Individuel,04/04/2021,ScentSlave,M,246,,5,This stuff smells fantastic,"It’s a great value for the price. A very nice, fresh, and sweet fragrance indeed. In my eyes, it is absolutely worthy of the accolades it gets. Projection is very soft, however, barely reaching a 2 ft radius, and the sillage trail is limited as well. The longevity on this varies, but it averages about 6 hours on my skin.

For $20-$40, you can’t complain about those limitations, as again, the scent itself is actually very nice.

If you can find it, grab it, as it is a very versatile scent you can sport year round. Don’t set the bar too high as far as expectations go, but know that it is definitely worth the price you can find it at.

Pretty much all Mont Blanc scents share that trait; not mind blowing, but very nice and price worthy."
Individuel,03/09/2019,Oldish2002,M,128,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Great one for colder seasons,"This is a great creation. I really enjoy wearing this one. Not too strong, not too harsh. Perfect for casual wear (of course, careful with the trigger). I like to use it in the fall and a bit in the early of winter. Some are using it in the spring as well, but I don't. Great for hanging out with friends as well. A bit sweet and also a fresh touch.
That raspberry feel makes it so approachable and warm. VERY cheap for the quality inside the bottle. A nice bottle and pretty unique juice. Not so many people are using it in my surroundings and that's why I love it so much. I always get questions like ""what is this ? hmm.. what are you wearing ? you smell so .. different"". I really appreciate some uniqueness in a fragrance. I guess we all do and this one has it. When it comes to performance .. Excellent for me. 6-7 hours , maybe pushing 8 with decent projection of 1.5/2 hours. For the price we pay, this is more than enough. I will always come back for this one because I really like it and it gets the job done.
Overall : 7.5/10"
Individuel,02/07/2019,Itchynose,M,41,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Ubiquitous individuality,"It's fresh, fruity, sweet, clean and possibly Montblanc's biggest hit since the advent of the fountain pen.

Individuel's raspberry and clean laundry combo has become such a popular scent in recent years that it almost feels wrong to jump on an already crowded bandwagon but it is hard to find anything to dislike about this fragrance. This is a modern smelling juice with enough personality to stand out from the many sweet-but-manly scents in the market these days. Versatility is another factor explaining Individuel's success: it's practically an office safe cologne in small doses and a sweet party beast when sprayed without a care.

All in all Individuel smells great, performs well and it's likely to remain a permanent presence in many men's fragrance rotations."
Individuel,05/09/2022,Razvanyke,M,215,,4,Similar but not the same,"I have a CREED original Santal sample at home, and like many others I was wondering what is the point to pay premium €€ when you can get the cheaper Individuel, right? Well .. it´s not that simple.

I got myself a sample before buying a bottle of Montblanc to check with my own nose if it is really so similar like people want you to believe. And when you start spray it, they seem to have the similar sweet sandalwood direction, like JOOP Homme but less cloying.

After about 5 minutes, the CREED becomes very understated, in the same way Green Irish Tweed is vs Cool Water .. with a certain class and it´s less in your face, if I can say so.

The Individuel comes close to the skin very fast and it becomes this generic sweet, ""not sure what I sprayed"" sandalwood similar to JOOP smell.

Don´t get me wrong, if you are someone who could not care less about scents and perfume houses and notes and so on, you will find Montblanc a top choice and use it and spray it and could not care less about the details.

But if you are someone with a decent collection and a trained nose to sense the little things, you will understand what I mean.

The are similar, thanks to the influence of the great Pierre Burdon in both scent DNAs .. but in the Creed one I think Olivier´s influence can be seen, he also had a word into how it smells and what will come out from the sketch board.

Conclusion:
I would regret buying a full bottle of Montblanc and probably never use it and will just stay in the drawer, on the other hand the Creed is not so modern to make me use daily but I would like a bottle, maybe a 50ml one into my collection.

With the right price, maybe even used from the Souk - the Creed ""wins"" this versus."

It's safe to wear in places like the grocery store or the office. Although I don't hate it anymore, it still smells pretty boring to me."

Don't be fooled by the initial sweet blast upon spraying – give it five minutes. The drydown is where the magic truly happens, a golden aroma that lasts.
Wearing this cologne is like having freshly laundered clothes all day. It's sweet, desirable, and creates an undeniable aura of confidence. The projection and longevity are impressive, so heed this warning: two sprays max are all you need. This stuff is potent!
Forget the comparisons to Joop. While both are sweet, Individuel is in a different league. Joop is linear and overwhelmingly sweet, while Individuel is complex, evolving beautifully over time with added freshness and desirability.
If Joop is a one-dimensional charmer, Individuel is the sophisticated individual who becomes more captivating as time goes on.
Buy, Try, or Pass? BUY. A definite must-have for any fragrance enthusiast."
Individuel,06/20/2025,Liviuss,M,60,,3,very good,"Intrigued by the hundreds of reviews comparing it to Creed's Original Santal (which I really like and which came out AFTER Individuel), I decided to get it.... The result? I have no regrets....
The similarity is there and you can immediately notice it. OS, however, is deeper and more structured, smells less like synthetic aldehydes, and is rounder and creamier overall. In short, it smells qualitatively better, and there's no arguing about that.
However, it must be said that Inviduel costs literally 1/10th the price of OS and performs better overall in terms of projection, longevity, and sillage.
Is it worth replacing OS with Individuel? Well, it depends on your budget, but let's just say that Individuel is a truly respectable ""settler.""
EDIT September 2025
I also bought Montblanc's Individuel to compare them, and I must confirm that the similarities are there. The mood and vibes are similar, but the Montblanc is significantly sweeter, with a fruity note completely absent from the Creed. Even on the drydown, the Montblanc has a sweet base, while the Creed remains dry and aromatic. The Montblanc also feels more like a shower gel, while the Creed does not.
So, are they similar? Yes, but also no... are they redundant? No... I prefer the Creed, but I also enjoy wearing the Montblanc.
EDIT
I tested the two half-siblings, Original Santal and Individuelle, in a 1-on-1 comparison on skin. Strange as it may seem, I must say that OS performs significantly better than Individuelle; in fact, the latter fades tremendously after half an hour, while OS remains quite strong and continues to be noticeable and consistent for the first two or three hours. In terms of longevity, the Creed is also superior. I confirm the differences in terms of olfactory profile, similar opening aside, the aromas take different directions from the heart onwards."
Individuel,04/17/2018,Eyedean,M,22,,1,Hyped?,"I think that this one is pretty hard to screw up. It maybe wouldn’t be appropriate at a funeral, other than that I think you’ll be ok.
Also it probably is more of a fall/winter type of frag... but I guess it is up to you.

The scent itself is like a sweeter, yet fresh but still a bit powdery kind of feel with raspberry on top."
Individuel,01/10/2025,MostlyVegan,N/A,4,,2,Synthetic,"I am not one for synthetic perfume. I blind-bought this because of the red berry note, which I can barely smell when I spray it on. It might just not work with my skin.

I have a friend who tried it recently, and it instantly became his favorite fragrance. Unlike me, he wasn’t coming in with high expectations. I guess this could be a hit if you're relatively new to fragrances and like a soft, masculine scent that won’t overwhelm the people around you too much."

It's cheap and that's it.

I feel a lot of sweet, synthetic raspberry, but maybe that's just my problem. XD"
Individuel,01/04/2019,BenPrax,M,2,,0,Safe bet,"It's nothing groundbreaking. It's not challenging. While it's not too cheap smelling, it's not high quality. It's not the sort of thing you'd wear if you wanted to impress or make an impact.

But...

It's cosy and comfortable, it's nice (hate that word, but it fits), it's safe, projects decently and lasts rather well.

It's the sort of thing you'd wear if you wanted to smell good but not stand out. Perfect for those 'meh' dumb reach days. It's the sort of thing you could wear to the office and not have people bat an eyelid. It's the sort of thing you could wear taking your kids to their friends' parties. It's the sort of thing you'd wear to do the food shopping.

It's sweet without being cloying, spicy without being raucous and fruity without being overpowering.

Is it worth the hype? Probably not. I only bought it because of the hype, but almost two years in, I still find myself grabbing it when the occasion suits. Not the sort of fragrance to buy if you're only looking to buy one fragrance.

Definitely better in the cooler months, but pretty much a no-brainer for the cost (under €20 for 100ml), caveats accepted.

You won't get compliments by the bucket load, but you'll certainly be told you smell 'nice'.

A solid 7/10."
Individuel,10/22/2025,ScentGrail,M,108,,1,Beginners Dream Scent,"Individuel has to be one of the most popular fragrance community scents of all time, and a perfume I got for the second time in 2025. What can I say except that for all of your fragrance enthusiasts who have been in this never-ending game for a long time, Individuel is a distant cousin of Joop! Homme, and a fragrance from which Creed’s Original Santal took heavy inspiration.

TOP NOTES
Upon the first spray and a couple of minutes until the top notes start to fade away, I get this delightful mix of lavender, juniper berries, spice, and a touch of pineapple. In my experience, the opening is relatively fresh and clean, but not plain – the fruit and spice give it an energising character.

HEART NOTES
After 5-10 minutes, the scent transitions to the heart (middle) phase. Here, the pineapple and big spice notes start to fade, leaving behind a blend of herbal and floral tones. Lavender stays the most prominent note, and we are introduced to orange blossom similar to the one found in the famous Nikos Sculpture. Compared to the top, the heart is cleaner and simpler. It’s almost like the fragrance “cools off” into a soapy lavender/vanilla laundry scent.

BASE NOTES
For me, the combination of raspberry, vanilla, and top-notch implementation of sandalwood really comes forward, giving a creamy, woody warmth along with fruity and comforting touches. The dry-down (base) has a warm, soft, and subtly sweet quality. It feels like a comfortable sweater or flannel shirt in scent form.

OVERALL
There is always a place in your perfume collection for a versatile, budget-friendly men’s scent that will surprise you with its pleasant character. It’s not a high-end niche masterpiece, but it doesn’t try to be. Instead, it delivers a warm, sweet-woody scent with a touch of fruity freshness. Highly recommended!

Individuel,07/23/2018,Dinomafia,M,3,,0,Spice Shop,"If you like spicy scents then this one might be for you. If you want to try the fragrance without spending the money, try Nike Brown Men at around AUD10.00 or Gold Spray by Al Haramain.

On a spiciness level between 1 to 3, with 1 being least spicy and 3 being most spicy Montblanc is (1) much cleaner smoother then Nike Brown Man (2) and Gold Spray by Al Haramain (3) being the most spicy fragrance. I think that Montblanc and Nike Brown Man are almost identical on the dry down though.

The test of a perfume depends on whether or not you would buy it again. Personally, I wouldn't buy another bottle."

Individuel,09/24/2021,N471v3,M,134,,19,"The Golden Ratio. An Icon, Survived by Its Rival!","Montblanc Individuel is a no-brainer for me in my collection.

It's a fragrance that I bought after seeing a YouTuber talk about it, and I knew right from the first sniff, ""Hey wow,... there's really something to this!! It's truly special!""

For a long time, I thought it was a homage or a copy of Creed's Original Santal, which is what you might guess just by the scent, since Original Santal smells somehow more natural and a bit more luxurious.

But it isn't!
Individuel: year 2003
Original Santal: year 2005

However, I didn't care anyway, as Individuel smells more interesting to me; it just resonates more within me. Even if it is a bit more chemical/artificial - or maybe that's exactly why?

What does Individuel smell like?
Wow... with this note list, as long as the Old Testament, it's really a challenge to describe it! :D

I would say the raspberry plays a very central role; everything revolves around it. It is surrounded by sweet, floral, woody, and spicy notes, but there are so many and so different that I really find it hard to pick them out individually.

Let's say fruity sweet, with a slight amber touch, a bit sticky, somewhat ""alien"" or strange/chemical. Also fresh, actually quite a bit! It just doesn't stand out as much because the sweetness shines stronger, and there are so ""many little"" fresh notes that puzzle together here.
And overall, Individuel smells somehow typically masculine-cologne-like; it simply feels like a confident, sexy signature scent.
A little mysterious, but present, with great projection, yet not arrogant.

The Individuel lover likes to wear their fragrance often; it's also a ""grab-and-go"" kind of thing. It fits in really any season and temperature, and for most situations. It might be a bit too ""happy"" for a funeral, but otherwise, it really works for everything. So in the office, you'll quickly make a few new friends with it. ;)

Unfortunately, Individuel has now been discontinued after a long time on the market; it is no longer listed on the manufacturer's website. (But I guess you can still find it here and there in some online shops..)

In any case, I understand it, because even though it is very timeless, fragrances like Explorer or Legend are simply more modern and ""do"" something similar. But they are a bit easier to grasp in their DNA for the general public.

I still find Individuel to be truly unique, almost a kind of highlight from the house; it is, in scent, a bit like the golden ratio of this fragrance direction for me.

Just perfect!

I would also think of Joop Homme, which is somewhat similar, but Joop Homme is, in my opinion, much more obvious. (Le Male vibe) It smells much more like ""the broad masses,"" you immediately think ""I know that one.."". And maybe a bit youthful...

Individuel is just... more individual. ;)

It's a fragrance where you are constantly asked what it is, with a nervousness in the voice of the person asking, wishing it were as individual as well. ;D

I should mention that I usually prefer niche fragrances over designer scents, but I find Individuel just has that ""certain something""; I know some that are similar, but none that are the same.

So the name is 100% fitting for me. The bottle is beautifully shaped, clear, and yet practical - you just like to hold it!

Longevity and sillage are very good to outstanding for me.

I will definitely always stay Individuel(l)! :)"
Individuel,04/25/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,18,"A droning, artificial raspberry-tonka bean brew without any class","I must strongly agree with my very critical predecessors Cappelusman and Riotsk - how can such a fragrance joke receive almost 80% rating?!

Honestly - sometimes I wonder how some people here would rate a fragrance if they didn't know the average score.

In any case, I don't understand what qualitatively separates ""Individuel"" from the new, utterly trampled ""Karl Lagerfeld for men""?

From my perspective? Almost nothing!
One is completely unjustifiably near the top 100 (of now over 10,000(!) men's fragrances), the other is in one of the last places, and both are ultimately a completely uninspired, synthetically annoying, uncharacteristic soup.

The many comparisons below with ""Joop! Homme"" are partly valid, but compared to ""Individuel,"" the Joop! classic, although I don't really appreciate it, at least has 100% recognizability, profile, and artistic independence.

The name ""Individuel"" seems ironic to me - the opposite is the case!

If you definitely don't want to offend anyone olfactorily and want to receive mainstream compliments from less fragrance-savvy people, then feel free to grab this!

The opening of the 11-year-old Montblanc is already dominated by raspberry, somewhat syrupy-artificial, with slight hints of cinnamon and a bit of minty freshness.

Not as overpowering as ""Joop! Homme,"" closer to the skin, but thus also more diffuse and shallow. And definitely somewhat artificial!

It continues with a bit of sweet orange blossom, along with some light floral notes, somehow also reminiscent of Hubba-Bubba gum. Largely style-free.

There are really hundreds of fragrances of this kind buzzing around, mainly thrown on the market by companies like Lacoste, Joop!, Sander, Gucci. So why almost 80%?! People!

From the roughly 30 ingredients mentioned above, I can at best perceive 5-6. Especially the base is a real joke; beyond the aforementioned raspberry, I can at most detect tonka bean, a bit of vanilla, and minimal amber.

Above all, there hovers an annoyingly persistent synthetic tone, like the cheapest synthetic musk in cheap deodorants. Horrible!

So, Montblanc, I can only shout: ""Shoemaker, stick to your lasts!"" They can make great pens, but with perfumes, they are (see also ""Starwalker,"" ""Legend"") on a synthetic wannabe perfumer's wrong path."
Individuel,10/17/2018,Ajlen,M,122,,13,When the Fragrance Becomes a Matter of Luck,"Clone or no clone, that is the question here. No, actually not. It is definitely not a clone. Still, I can understand the association well - Individuel immediately reminds me of Joop Homme. However, in the form of a modernized update.

It starts off fruity and sweet with a strong raspberry note. And yet there is also a minty freshness that vaguely reminds me of Versace's Eros. There, combined with apple, here with raspberry. In terms of content, it works almost identically in my opinion. Overall, I see strong parallels to Eros in the entire composition. As it progresses, the fragrance becomes more floral, but also simultaneously woodier, before it moves into the vanilla-tonka base. The sweet fruity berry note lingers in a subdued form until the end. Overall, the progression feels much more linear in practice than the ingredient list would suggest.

If one wants to draw a comparison to Joop Homme, Montblanc Individuel comes across as significantly more contemporary. I find it not only fresher but somehow more transparent. Moreover, despite all the sweetness, it clearly conveys the modern clean man. This makes it versatile and wearable. Strong enough to be noticed, but not too intense for the office. Quite well balanced, in my opinion. I cannot make comparisons to Creed's Original Santal due to lack of testing.

So I can rate the fragrance itself consistently positively. But I find these obvious quality issues from batch to batch intolerable. Minor deviations are known. And reformulations too. But what is being thrown onto the market in terms of fluctuations, I cannot understand. Can and should such things be factored into the overall rating? I think so. If I have to test three bottles to get ""the right"" fragrance, I no longer have any understanding for that.

Fragrance: Strong
Price: Convincing
Quality: Matter of Luck"
Individuel,06/28/2017,Bernado77,M,74,,6,Not a Joop Clone,"Received today and tested at 25-30 degrees. It is often written here that this scent smells like a Joop clone, but I don't think so. It smells fruity and fresh right after spraying, and it has an interesting scent progression that, while remaining sweet until the end, is not as cloyingly sweet as others in this category. The vanilla, which was not mentioned in the comments, can be detected, I think, from start to finish. Sillage and longevity are quite good; the sillage is still noticeably detectable at a distance of 50 cm after 2 hours, and the longevity of 6 hours is also acceptable. Conclusion: Good scent, but somehow too much of everything; it wants to smell herbal, sweet, fresh, and fruity, but it is not perfectly balanced in any of these aspects. It resembles Creed Santal, but is not quite as harmonious, yet it costs only about 1/3! Despite all the criticism, it's a nice scent and a real compliment magnet, though not as overpowering as, for example, Ultra Male."

The next day, this friend told me that one of her friends asked, “What was your friend's name again, who smelled unbelievably good?” and she meant me (at least that's what my friend thinks, haha).

Now about the fragrance:
It is fresh and sweet at the same time, so you can wear it almost anytime as long as the temperature is below 20-25 degrees.
I really like the raspberry note, even though it smells quite synthetic.
The fragrance feels mature even though it is not woody or smoky at all.

Individuel,09/17/2016,Basti87,M,1062,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,A Delicious Alternative for Joop! Homme Fans,"This fragrance has been on my wishlist for a long time. I spontaneously ordered it. Since I really love Joop! Homme, I am very grateful for nice alternatives. Joop! Homme is a scent I love very much but wear very rarely. Best for me because I enjoy smelling it and feel comfortable with it. For the public, it is too well-known and ""overused."" Nevertheless, for me, it is one of the best fragrance classics of all time.
I read through the comments here and found: It polarizes. I like scents that you either hate or love. Since this is already the case with Joop! Homme, it must be similar with this one. It's interesting to test such fragrances and form your own opinion.
Additionally, Individuel is creating a hype online as an affordable super scent. Many YouTubers recommend this fragrance. You don't have to put too much weight on it, but it's definitely worth a test. Price-wise, you can take a chance on a blind buy. I paid 35 euros for 75ml.

The bottle is really beautiful and fits the image of Mont Blanc. Elegant and simple. It looks valuable.
Since I was very curious about this scent, I was very excited to spray it. I was very pleased. The similarity to Joop! Homme is unmistakable without being a true copy. It starts fresh and fruity. It is much tamer than its pink twin. The sillage is really similarly good, but that sharpness that could trigger sneezing fits is not present. Juniper berry and mint are well perceptible. I struggle with the rest. The fragrance pyramid lists so many notes that I find hard to decipher. Later, sweet notes come into play. Vanilla and raspberry are really very delicious here. Overall, a great composition that makes me feel comfortable from start to finish. Even though it is very sweet, I perceive this fragrance as masculine. The sillage is really as good as with Joop. The longevity is also really very good. I do not know the other fragrance twin from Creed. Since I generally reject niche fragrances, I don't care about that.
Individuel is best suited for younger people. It is quite versatile for occasions. It is suitable for everyday wear, but it would also shine in clubs and at parties. In terms of style, I think it fits better with jeans and a shirt. Seasonally, it is truly an all-rounder. Except on hot days, it can be worn well throughout the year.

Conclusion: Anyone who likes Joop! Homme MUST test this fragrance. A great alternative to the unfortunately overused classic. For anyone who does not like Joop! Homme: Stay away from this scent. By no means a copy, but the similarity is unmistakable. Price-performance: TOP! Hype justified!"
Individuel,11/11/2020,Ufooo,M,5,,12,"""Fresh fabric softener with a raspberry vibe"" Jeremy Fragrance anno 2016?","It's been a while since I watched a lot of videos from the enthusiastic perfume YouTuber.
Today, I don't enjoy his videos as much anymore, as he has developed in a strange direction.
What has remained with me is the catchphrase that I always think of when I read ""Montblanc Individuel"".

I think he hit the nail on the head with that one.
Montblanc Individuel lives up to its name, as I - at least so far - haven't smelled a fragrance that goes in a similar direction.

My beginner's nose initially detects a nice interplay of bergamot, juniper berry, and laundry detergent, with the latter being subtle and hardly disturbing.
As the scent develops, it shifts and becomes slightly spicy and sweet.
In my opinion, the fragrance is consistently accompanied by an artificial nuance, which does not detract from the overall composition!

I think it's a practical perfume for anyone who enjoys clean, fresh, but also delicious scents!
Definitely worth a blind buy, as it is affordable (23€ for 75ml as of Nov. 2020)."
Individuel,03/26/2018,Male1979,M,0,,6,"Joop Homme? No man! This is ""Montblanc Original Santal"" :-)","Hi Folks,

I recently acquired this fragrance and initially had to struggle to get a decent batch (see previous comment from ""Gaesch""). I was also a victim of the soap issue and could only truly enjoy this lovely scent with the second bottle.

Much has already been said about the development, and I can only confirm again that the longevity of this little water is extremely impressive, and Montblanc has created a real performance monster here.

Sweetness meets masculinity. That's how I would describe it. Last week, I was at the local ""Kaufhof,"" and they recently have a respectable ""Creed"" collection. When I sprayed ""Original Santal"" on my wrist, I was almost blown away. Exactly the same DNA. The Creed is just softer, and Montblanc delivers a much better performance with Individuel. So, if you can get a better Creed scent for very little money, you can't go wrong. Get yourself a bottle while they are still being sold.

Individuel,06/19/2020,Ck1studies,M,2,,5,Blind purchase...,"because of the community :-)

I have to admit that the only reason I got this fragrance was the Montblanc brand. No. Of course, because it is supposed to resemble a Creed scent, and who wants to spend 200€ on a fragrance? I do, but not for (this) Creed.

I really wanted to test this fragrance because various perfume lovers were talking about it. And it’s not expensive either.

Well, I noticed the following during multiple tests of the fragrance: it doesn’t change - linear progression from start to finish.

Individually, it smells sweet and fruity the whole time, mainly like raspberry. An Albanian colleague, who is also my hairdresser and had never rated my perfume until that point, said: “you smell good, yes.” It’s worth mentioning a compliment I received from a lady’s perspective.

Personally, I don’t think much of this fragrance. It doesn’t have anything special for me and somehow smells like Hubba Hubba. I like Hubba Hubba, but I don’t want to smell like it. A fragrance you can wear when you don’t know what else to wear.

Longevity and sillage? Quite okay, about average. Especially for this price, acceptable :)"
Individuel,07/17/2013,Waldlichtung,M,2,,12,Fresh as the Mountain Peak of Montblanc,"I bought this fragrance blind based on the positive reviews here on Parfumo.
Scent:
Even though the fragrance pyramid resembles a novel, I find the scent not particularly complex. Right at the beginning, it smells dominantly fruity-fresh. As it develops, the freshness decreases and vanilla joins the fruitiness, which is not citrusy, orangey, or apple-like as often, but is clearly characterized by berries. The mentioned comparison of a ""raspberry-vanilla pudding"" is quite accurate.

Effect:
The way the perfume presents itself strongly reminds me of Jil Sander ""Sun Men."" Although the scent notes of both perfumes have no affinities, the astonishing lightness with which they manage to make heavy fragrance components appear light and fresh remains.
This perfume makes one appear particularly clean and fresh (more than any previously tested sport or aqua fragrance) and is a real treat, especially after showering, both for oneself and for those around.

Longevity:
The longevity is above average. On my otherwise very finicky skin, the scent lasts easily 10 hours. However, on clothing, the longevity is surprisingly low, although I prefer it this way rather than the other way around :)

Sillage:
With 68%, the sillage here is, in my opinion, underrated!
Especially in the first 2 hours after application, I am often complimented on my scent, and I can also perceive it almost the full 10 hours (despite the habituation effect), so I would rate it more at 75-80%.

Bottle:
Very simple but quite elegant bottle design, only the metal cover (between the glass and the cap) wobbles for me (though this may be an isolated case).

Occasions:
""Montblanc Individuel"" is the quintessential everyday perfume. Whether you’re chilling on the grass with your buddies after university or heading to a classy evening event, this perfume is always appropriate. I would only avoid it for dates or romantic moments, as there are far more suitable fragrances for that (Rochas Man, Armani Code Ultimate, etc.), which are all significantly less suitable for everyday wear. Nevertheless, the feedback from women regarding this scent is very positive.
Best regards, Waldlichtung"
Individuel,06/05/2013,BackToBlack,M,112,,14,Raspberry - Vanilla Pudding for the Empty Soul,"Since I’ve been quite adventurous after trying out a few fragrances from Montblanc, I’ve now also gotten Individuel.

The name isn’t exactly thrilling, and it’s one that’s been heard many times before, but it is definitely unique, especially for a not overly high price.

Montblanc - no hype, no exaggerated advertisements about various extremes of the two poles, and not at all in everyone’s mouth, which I noticed recently. Hardly anyone knows Montblanc or has ever had experience with fragrances from this house. I certainly didn’t until recently, but now I’m really excited and happy to have a few treasures in my collection.

As soon as I have Individuel on my skin, it bubbles up and envelops me with a very unique layer of mint and juniper berry. The juniper berry is very sharp and unripe. It plays the entire top note, and the mint is the icing on the cake. Together, they form a perfectly coordinated team that occasionally needs a red card. Because they can be quite loud on me. The opening is very strong and practically bombs into the olfactory cells. Caution! - Overdosing right from the start could have serious consequences. The other person could vanish as quickly as they appeared. After a few minutes, it subsides, and the mint loses intensity just like the juniper berry. A pleasant scent of bergamot spreads, mixed with a delicate hint of nothing - lavender. I had to really dig in to catch a whiff of the lavender. The quiet lavender doesn’t bother me at all. It’s good when the lavender just sneaks through the scent. Too much of it wouldn’t appeal to me. Cinnamon also arrives after a few minutes and becomes heavier and more intense. It’s high-quality cinnamon that lifts your spirits.

Once the scent has been on the skin for a while, it becomes more elegant and significantly stronger in character. Nothing remains of the shrill nature from the beginning. The jasmine stands out a bit, but it doesn’t particularly distinguish itself in the heart note. After about two and a half hours, I smell noble jasmine that has just begun to unfold. A fitted suit is surrounded by such a fine jasmine scent - fantastic. And definitely not feminine. The orange blossom somewhat dampens the unfolding and keeps everything grounded. The heart note merges with the base note after almost 3 hours. Finally, the moment arrives that delights me the most. It shifts from heaviness back to lightness, and a wonderful opening spreads in my olfactory cells. I think of vanilla pudding enriched with cinnamon and drizzled with warm raspberry juice. But not too sweet - rather a bit bitter in taste, as the raspberry is still unripe. Dull and sensual would fit. Because the vanilla is not too loud, the cinnamon highlights it a bit, and the unsweetened raspberry juice cradles the scent in a classic ambiance of nobility and kindness. A noble dessert, enriched with fresh mint and a few drops of dark chocolate. Also, a fine rosé wine. Such a dessert would surely make women happy as well.

The finish of Individuel is very gradual and suddenly extinguishes when it reaches its final point. Until the end, the fine raspberry - vanilla combination holds its ground. However, it is overshadowed after its peak by musk and sandalwood, which makes it harder and louder again. It is never arrogant or overly boosted. The patchouli then sinks the scent into depth and lets it drown in chocolate. A beautiful play of thoughts and olfactory cells for the empty soul, especially if one hasn’t been feeling so well in the past few days.

I’m surprised that there’s so much “sweetness” in the scent, and that it doesn’t smell like a lollipop factory. It is always muted in its sweet nature, which makes it so interesting.

The price is great, and the bottle is very appealing. A small sensory experience - for women and for men.

The longevity is very good - you can still smell this interesting combination of light sweetness and muted sensuality for hours, which then shifts into hardness. Masculinity wrapped in a lush berry scent, enriched with fine woods and vanilla, that knows exactly how to present itself without shooting anyone out of the game."
Individuel,07/01/2011,Jensemann,M,217,,15,Delicious Raspberry/Vanilla,"I am surprised that there is no comment yet on this truly wonderful perfume. I used to smell this scent so often on my former colleague, and it became my absolute favorite fragrance. To this day. I couldn't name a single creation that smells as good overall and, above all, lasts so long on the skin. Applied in the morning, there's still a bit of ""individuality"" in the late afternoon. :)
The notes that you can sniff out are clearly the vanilla and, even more beautifully, the raspberry. :) As cute as that sounds, this raspberry (it might also have been juniper berry, it's just both quite fruity :D), I just tried to inhale it when I had ""Individuel"" on my body. Simply wonderful.

As mentioned, vanilla and something ""berry-like"" are the main players in this wonderful fragrance that I still love today, and can no longer love, as it seems this scent is no longer available for purchase. Really, really a shame, but it seems to be the case at the moment that truly beautiful fragrances are disappearing and generic scents want to take over.

""Individuel,"" the name likely fits its wearer, I could always identify with this scent, and I would still do so today.

Mont Blanc, you have created one of the best fragrances that exist, a huge thank you for this! :)"
Individuel,12/10/2017,Mantus,M,487,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Noble Sweetness,"Individually, it starts fresh - sweet, but also citrusy - herbal.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to our perfume ""ErhanSaceros"" for the bottling.

At first, one can perceive something very pleasantly aromatic - sweet, which is thanks to the juniper berry.

At the same time, there is also something Mediterranean - herbal to be noticed, which beautifully complements the juniper berry and ensures that the top note is given a lovely maritime aura, stemming from the lavender.

There is also a pleasant fresh mint detectable, which is responsible for preventing the scent from drifting into the sticky territory and is supported by a herbal - citrus note, so that the fresh aura is slightly intensified and comes from the bergamot.

In the background, there is a warming sweet - spicy facet present, which lends a pleasant substance to the top note and can only be cinnamon.

This constellation is perceptible on my skin for 20 minutes before the heart note unfolds.

Now something very deep floral, slightly creamy can be perceived, which is underlined by a very pleasant floral, subtly sweet nuance, thanks to the geranium and jasmine.

There is also a certain bright, sparkling note present, which arranges wonderfully with the geranium and jasmine and ensures that the scent remains pleasantly fresh - sweet rather than dull, stemming from the orange blossom.

In the background, there is a spicy nuance of violet that gives the heart note a certain refinement and makes the scent appear very pleasantly floral, yet still masculine - distinctive.

The heart note is perceptible on my skin for 4.5 hours before the base asserts itself.

Now something pleasantly sweet - fruity can be perceived, which is thanks to the raspberry and has always deterred me before a test or even a purchase, as I always thought that raspberry could only appear sweet - sticky.

But that is not the case!

The raspberry is supported by something very pleasantly earthy, slightly spicy, which is due to the patchouli, and it is precisely this component that ensures that the scent does not drift into the sweet - sticky territory, but rather gains a certain noble elegance without losing its sweetness.

At the same time, the base receives something very warm, cuddly, which is thanks to the lovely vanilla and the creamy - spicy sandalwood, evoking a wonderful feeling in me.

There is also a very deep sweet - spicy ""tangibility"" of the amber, which is responsible for the components of the base merging into a whole.

And yet, one perceives a certain clear, clean, and slightly mossy note in the background, which comes from the musk and the oak moss, setting very interesting accents.

Unfortunately, I could not perceive the tonka bean, vetiver, and dark chocolate, but I can very well imagine that they were merely used as support and let the scent fade away very pleasantly.

Overall, the scent lasts 9 hours on my skin.

The sillage is designed from the beginning to be perceived very clearly at arm's length, and this is maintained for 4 hours before it gradually diminishes until the scent finally completely fades away."

Individuel,09/11/2018,Farneon,M,112,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"The ""Golden Raspberry"" goes to ...","... Montblanc! :-) Yes, I know, it actually stands for poorly made, trashy films, but the association was just so fitting. And aside from the Hollywood business, there's nothing wrong with a refined sweet fruit, at least not in terms of perfume. With a staggering 21 ingredients mentioned here, it’s not hard to immediately pick out that one, the raspberry. It is sweet, as one would expect, but I actually don’t expect it to be so dominant in an EDT. However, it is called ""Individuel,"" a name that asserts its validity right from the first spray.

The raspberry is, of course, appropriately packaged here, enveloped by a bit of mint and other herbs. It thrives on a bed of musk and wood shavings, with a few fallen petals scattered around to release their residual scent. And yes, with a bit of imagination, my nose can also detect a slightly chocolatey undertone. Overall, I’m glad that the raspberry doesn’t come off overly sweet. This keeps the sweetness within a very pleasant range that is tolerable for me as a fan of fresh scents.

Fortunately (for me), they refrain from giving the whole thing an earthy and/or prudish base to make the scent come off more gentlemanly, but also more old-fashioned. Overall, this creates a summery sweetness that fits the raspberry harvest season and that I associate more with a Berliner Weiße than with gummy bears. ""Individuel"" convinces me (aside from the price of around €30 for 100 ml) as an all-year-round scent for any occasion. I just have to feel like wearing it, but that’s easily the case once a week. Well done, Mr. Bourdon, I would say! :-)

PS: Could also pass as a unisex scent with a slightly stronger floral component!"
Individuel,06/20/2017,Mörfi,M,8,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Je suis Individualiste,"A lot has already been written about this fragrance in the forums, so I'll keep it short and sweet: This one works for me. Fruity, lively, life-affirming. I've already received several compliments because of it. In short - it's not too sweet or overly heavy, but just right to create a harmonious overall impression. I don't need edges and corners; the wearer can bring those.

A little reassurance for fans

The license for production and distribution is held by Interparfums, Paris, and they have no intention of removing this popular men's fragrance from their lineup, as it has now found a loyal customer base worldwide and represents a solid foundation in their fragrance program. (Statement Interparfums.fr)"
Individuel,11/03/2021,JannisD,M,0,,7,Hype? No Thanks,"If you delve a little into the world of perfume, perhaps watching a few top 10 videos, you quickly come across this 20 Euro fragrance.

By now, I've learned from some blind buys, and this one contributed significantly to that. Of course, 20 Euros isn't a huge loss, but it can add up quickly, and the principle remains the same. I'd rather invest in the well-known ones, but back to Individual.

Heard a lot about it, bought it blind for twenty, didn't think much of it, should be enough for freshly washed, but then quickly disappointed.
The scent can best be described as a very, very strong synthetic sweet raspberry. The sweetness isn't even the main issue, even though it's way too much for me, but the exaggerated synthetic quality from start to finish.

In the end, I had to wash it off because it was just disgusting. So far, the worst fragrance I've had the chance to smell.
When you see all the positive reviews here, it really stands out how far opinions can differ.

Trying is better than studying."
Individuel,06/28/2015,MarkRipley,M,19,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,"Very sweet raspberries in vanilla sugar, chemically processed","I’m glad that this blind purchase cost me very little thanks to a randomly received voucher! Until now, I only knew Starwalker by Montblanc, which I actually liked quite a bit, but it was somehow too ordinary for me. Individuel, on the other hand, is an absolute bombshell that really needs to be approached with caution.

Normally, I would start summarizing the scent development I experienced, but in the case of Individuel, I unfortunately find that extremely difficult. My nose can hardly detect any changes in the many hours after spraying. I also struggle to pick out the numerous fragrance notes listed here. Generally, Individuel has a vanilla-sweet raspberry theme, which seems to be surrounded by many other fragrance notes. You really have to be a big fan of sweet scents to like it. Nevertheless, the fragrance has a slight freshness, possibly caused by the mint. However, I wouldn’t wear it in very high temperatures, as the synthetic elements could be quite overwhelming.

Speaking of synthetics: Wow, someone has really been experimenting in the lab here! A remarkable artificiality envelops the actual scent, which I would probably really like without all this chemistry. To me, the synthetic aspect seems to be used solely to enhance the fragrance in terms of longevity and especially sillage. This likely creates that mixed perfume mush that hits you particularly hard in the first hours. You initially smell like an entire perfumery where a bunch of testers has just been released, the majority of which are women's perfumes. Towards the end of its longevity, the scent becomes relatively pleasant, as it no longer comes off as so cloying and sticky. Therefore, it can possibly be worn in small doses in everyday life. In principle, I perceive Individuel as a pure going-out fragrance, especially since the sillage seems to be made exactly for that occasion.

Longevity: outstanding; lasts easily 12 hours, hardly any scent change

Sillage: with several sprays, like a punch; filling the room in the first hours

Bottle: looks far too understated for the fragrance; well-made; sprayer unfortunately sprays very centered

~Conclusion~

I can completely understand the many negative reviews. I also cannot fully grasp the hype and high rating of this fragrance. Individuel is primarily one thing: not individual! Most of the time, it is an artificially enhanced mixture of a whole bunch of fragrance materials that have been meticulously brewed together in the lab. This synthetic aspect radiates the scent outward very powerfully, where it is also received much better than by the wearer, who unfortunately has to stay in the middle of this cloying scent cloud. Only subtle dosing tames it a little. Nevertheless, Individuel remains under the hood just a rather ordinary fruity vanilla scent, which I even associate more with women's fragrances. Even though I really like fruity and sweet scents, I have to give significant deductions here for the incredibly synthetic implementation. I would have gladly sacrificed the knockout sillage and stunning longevity for less chemistry."
Individuel,07/28/2020,DerJulian,M,7,,1,"""Is this supposed to be an office scent???""","That's what I wondered when I, motivated by a certain Mr. Fragrance, smelled this fragrance from Montblanc for the first time.

The reason: In the top note, it exudes such a penetrating and, at times, aggressive bubblegum sweetness (like those cube-shaped Hubba Bubba gums that were often found right next to the candy aisle for the ""colorful bags"" at the kiosk), which it only sheds in the heart note and somewhat ""calms down"" with more tasteful floral tones.

So, after the initial shock, there follows a ""positive sobering up,"" and the blend of the initially described sweet components with violet, amber, and delicate vanilla works surprisingly well, although I have different ideas about an office scent (this status is predominantly attributed to this fragrance based on my research of many forums and YouTube channels) (not necessarily more subtle, but definitely drier, less sweet).

Calvin Klein (""Contradiction,"" ""Be,"" or most of the other fragrances from the same house), Lalique (Encre Noire Sport; White), Guerlain (Homme; L'homme ideal Cologne), or Creed (Himalaya) have repeatedly shown how diverse fragrances for this application area can be while maintaining a certain sweetness, fruitiness, or freshness in parallel.
Balance is the keyword here, and I must say that ""Individuel"" comes across as a bit too angular for me in this regard.

Definitely recommended for summer, but due to its wildness, in my opinion, not as versatile as I would ideally like it to be. However, given the excellent price, it is definitely worth a look."

Individuel,06/07/2021,JohnnyScents,M,11,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,"""Southern German"" Comfort","Mont Blanc Individual is one of those fragrances that evokes a feeling in me that I cannot describe. The closest would probably be a kind of ""safety"" or ""pleasant warmth"" on cold autumn and winter days. I only wear it in the cold seasons and preferably with a black turtleneck sweater. Why? Because it does something right for me that few fragrances can: it remains clean despite its sweetness (which never becomes too much). I don't perceive it as really fresh, but very clean. Like laundry detergent with a slight raspberry-chocolate aftershave touch. Incredibly wonderful. The sillage and longevity are also good, and the price-performance ratio is excellent. You often smell unique, indeed Individual. It is well-received and enjoyed. As for the preferred clothing style with the fragrance, I also wear it with any other clothing, as long as the season is right. But because I feel comfortable in a turtleneck sweater and it is also cozy, it fits doubly well. You can't go wrong with Individual; I have also received compliments. I perceive the scent as rather masculine, although not typical. The name of the perfume fits perfectly. The bottle is pretty, clean, elegant, and has a high recognition value. The somewhat mechanical German style, similar to bottles from Hugo Boss. Professional indeed, but not too much, because Individual builds a bridge. And to clarify my association, here is a description of the ""perfect Individual feeling"":

It is Monday morning, in the middle of November. It is a freezing morning. The sky is clear, you can see the stars. I step out of the shower and put on my black, comfortable turtleneck sweater. It hugs my torso like a shadow. When I open the closet, the elegant bottle of the Montblanc fragrance catches my eye. I don’t hold back when applying, but I don’t overdo it either. The perfect amount. I grab the car keys and head outside. The top note of the fragrance in my nose, along with the icy winter air. A wonderful combination. I am ready for the day; Individual is my loyal companion, it does not let me down. In the car, I turn on the heating, slowly warming up the chilled vehicle. As I drive, a brilliant scent spreads in the car with the warmth. What a luxury. I feel pleasantly warm, not too much, not too little. It’s perfect. Arrived, Individual accompanies me as expected throughout the day. Clean, well-groomed like the turtleneck sweater and the morning appearance. But through the scent, also a little different, unusual, a bit Individual. I can confidently focus on my tasks; Individual is always there. Maybe today will bring another compliment, perhaps even another special one? Ah, here it comes. Warms the heart. The charmer in the bottle also hides playful facets, skillfully embedding them in the clean and professional. Another successful day is coming to an end. I go to bed. I look in the closet and see a stack of turtleneck sweaters and not far away a silvery bottle. I think I’ll do it just the same tomorrow; after all, winter lasts a few more days."
Individuel,12/07/2015,Rolfii,M,6,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Noble, masculine, sweet and fresh","I am totally in love with this scent. It is simply perfect; quality at an extremely high level (a la Dior homme) and for the price it is available at, in my opinion, it is a must-buy. By quality, I mean the composition, not necessarily the ingredients themselves. There are few fragrances that appeal to me, which is why I think my collection will always remain relatively small, but this one competes with the very best for me.

It actually smells a bit like fresh bed linens... when I close my eyes, I associate it with a bed standing on a colorful meadow, nearby you can see a snow-covered mountain. The weather is icy cold. Berries and various flowers are growing nearby. Funny enough, my girlfriend said when I wore it that I smell like a ""meadow full of love.""

I am unsure if it is a scent that younger women would go for (my girlfriend compliments me on pretty much every fragrance I wear), but that’s not why I wear it occasionally. At least it is rumored that older women would love it, and I can wholeheartedly confirm that after seeing my mother's reaction.

Why not 100%? I miss a certain sexiness that I simply want in my fragrances (think Ch Men). But it has certainly earned a solid 90%."
Individuel,07/28/2019,Jamie2896,M,12,,4,1 or 0,"Montblanc Individuel - one of the fragrances with an extremely large difference between the batches. Be careful, because you either get the full blast of raspberries that come out of the dryer, or you get something soapy, watery, strange..
How do I know this difference? I ordered a decant that contained an older batch - then I ordered a new bottle and I knew right away ""Now I've been caught."" Unfortunately, this one was watery, soapy, and it's hard to compare these two fragrances. What a pity.

The scent:
Fruity raspberry mixed with something clean, like you would expect from clothes that come out of the dryer. So a fruity clean guy. You can definitely compare it to Joop Homme - but it leans more towards the youthful side. In my opinion, this makes it very mass-compatible. You can wear it anywhere and anytime. Caution: Synthetic notes cannot be avoided here either, you can smell that - but I find it not that bad.

Longevity/Sillage:
Good! For the price, you can expect worse. It lasts about 4 hours on me with decent projection, then another 2-3 hours close to the skin.

Bottle:
Different! But nice. It looks good and definitely does not seem inferior to me.

Conclusion:
Get the older batches, because they are really good! The new batches seem to be diluted across the board, no comparison to the good old batches.
Otherwise: A great everyday scent that is wearable anytime and anywhere. If you don't like Joop Homme - still give it a try! This one has a Joop Homme vibe, but is implemented in a much more modern way."
Individuel,10/17/2017,Olfakto,M,21,,3,Individuel vs Legend,"In direct comparison, Individuel is the younger brother of Legend. Bright, sweet, and fruity, he screams for attention and goes out during the day and in nice weather to tell everyone how good his mood is.
Legend is the older, seductive brother who has left his youthful experiences behind and wants to appear a bit more serious.

Both brothers are still young and regularly go out. They can party, but they cannot distinguish between natural and artificial notes. It doesn't really matter at the party anyway, as all the scents mix together into a mush.

Individuel is sweet, fruity, and fresh. However, I can't pick out individual notes from the huge mix. The sweetness fades over time, making the scent feel a bit rounder on the skin. It always remains bright and cheerful.

Legend also starts fruity-fresh, but less sweet and a bit darker. It also smells artificial; I have to look up the notes, as I don't recognize them. Legend is a bit heavier, darker, and less sweet than Individuel.

Perhaps they are not brothers at all, but rather someone who wants to be Individuel during the day and Legend in the evening. Will he ever achieve this?"
Individuel,12/24/2016,Olips,M,9,,5,The Better Joop! Homme,"The scent smells almost identical to Joop Homme from the top to the base note (including the one-dimensionality), so I will spare myself the attempt to describe the fragrance, as the Joop! Homme scent is likely known to everyone. The difference is that Joop has a stronger cherry scent, while Montblanc Individuel is more mild and berry-like. As for the sillage and longevity: it lasts significantly longer than the currently watered-down, reformulated Joop, and the sillage is better too; even after 4 hours, you can be detected within a radius of 10 cm with the fragrance. In comparison: the current Joop is only barely perceptible close to the body after 2 hours. Conclusion: a perfect Joop Homme clone that is superior to the current watered-down version in terms of performance and sillage, but inferior to the original Joop from 1988. However, since the original Joop is no longer available, Montblanc Individuel should be the first choice for nostalgics of the pink juice :)"
Individuel,08/19/2016,Elbduft,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Does Individuel mean it smells different on every nose?,"I read the classification of this fragrance with surprise and wonder, because I don't smell most of it. Then I read the notes, and again, I don't smell most of them.

Could the ""Individuel"" stand for the idea that there is something for everyone, and depending on one's nose, circumstances, and personal state, different notes from the wild mix are perceived?

Right at the spray head, I smell the same as in the first minutes after application: something reminiscent of cough drops.

For one or two hours, a somewhat Al-Rehab-""Silver""-like fresh floral scent follows, which I like. And apparently women do too, even at high temperatures near the 30° C mark.

Then, soap sets in, which lasts for many hours and is accompanied by a mix that I can't distinguish. This is the clean, fresh, synthetic, but not unpleasant part, where I see parallels to Dior Sauvage. It gradually weakens, changes slightly into something again undefinable, and eventually, it is only perceivable with the nose on the skin.

I don't perceive disturbing synthetics, nor do I find it too strong. It spreads out, is noticeable, but not intrusive. I find it okay and have the impression that women like it more than I do.

Does it smell interesting, complex, and/or profound? No.
Does it come across as clean, unobtrusive, not overwhelming, and suitable for many occasions? Yes."
Individuel,04/18/2022,Alex1337,M,3,,3,Fresh Laundry with Raspberry,"I was actually made aware of this scent by Jeremy, and it piqued my interest (as he praised it highly a few years ago), and I must say that the description ""Fresh fabric softener with a sweet raspberry touch"" fits very well.
At first, it smells very strongly of ""artificial"" raspberry, which, however, transitions after a while into the described, more pleasant sweetness and the scent of laundry. It is not particularly complex, but it simply smells fresh.
Overall, the fragrance smells very pleasant throughout the opening with a sweet note, is not at all overpowering, and is therefore, in my opinion, also suitable for the office.

The longevity is really long due to it being a synthetic scent (about 7-8 hours for me), and I could still faintly perceive it the next morning.
The price-performance ratio is really very good; you get a fresh, sweet fragrance with good longevity for comparatively little money!

Overall, for the low price, it is truly worth recommending if you want to smell clean/fresh!"
Individuel,09/28/2020,CrazyIschy,M,1,,3,The Slightly Different Office Scent,"For my work at a Swabian car manufacturer, I was looking for a fragrance suitable for the office environment. Since my department consisted only of men who were not really into perfumes, scents like ""L'Homme"" or ""Boss Bottled"" were not an option for me. Every meeting smelled of those, and I didn't want to be a part of that.

Through my first office scent ""Legend Spirit,"" which was recommended to me in a perfume shop, I came across the Montblanc brand. Since I already liked Legend Spirit very much, I searched online for more fragrances from Montblanc, and ""Individuel"" caught my eye. I was intrigued by the rather rare raspberry note. After further research, I learned about the quality differences among various batches, but I found a small online shop that provided me with the batch number before shipping.

As for the scent itself, I can only say that it fully meets my expectations. Thanks to the lasting raspberry note, it stands out from the crowd of office fragrances without being too intrusive. During my time at the car manufacturer, I constantly received compliments, and my boss even asked me which perfume I was wearing.

For me, ""Individuel"" is a perfect office scent for anyone who wants to stand out a bit from the crowd and doesn't mind a rather atypical fragrance note. Additionally, the H/S is appropriate for an office scent, and the price is unbeatable. If you get the right batch, you can't go wrong with this fragrance."

Oh no, not at all.

I don't know Original Santal by Creed, so I can't make a comparison!
Joop! Homme, yes I know that, so I can definitely say that the first 10 - 30 minutes of the scent are quite similar.

Individuel has quite a few notes, it would definitely make a very tasty dish in the kitchen!
( let's leave out the amber and oakmoss ;) )
With all this chaos, it's difficult to perceive all the notes over time.
Clearly, I find raspberry, mint, orange blossom, sandalwood, cinnamon in the foreground.
In my opinion, the scent remains the same for me at least for several hours after the initial application; after 10 hours, I can still faintly smell the same scent as shortly after spraying when I sniff my wrist! (that Joop! Homme similarity, fruity-woody)

Longevity:
On the skin, quite good: 10 hours were already in.

Sillage / Projection:
I find it strong in the first hour, not overwhelming but clearly noticeable.
After the first hour, it pulls back close to the skin (at least for me)

Conclusion:
To put it briefly, the scent is a bit more robust, more masculine than Joop! Homme!
It could have been so nice between us, you really appeal to me.

wishing you a wonderful holiday season as the year comes to an end... how time flies!

Today, I would like to share a few (very few) words about a fragrance that has been a part of my life for many years, the Individuel EAU DE TOILETTE.

I can't even say how many bottles I have emptied, but we're definitely talking double digits soon.

What makes this fragrance special and why I loved it so much is the FACT that it always works, always fits, never clashes/disturbs/annoys you, and on top of all these positive aspects, the performance back then was really quite good! A normal workday, a date, or a night out at the disco until the next morning - all of that was no problem.

The scent is generally sweet, fruity, floral, lightly fresh, pleasantly soft, and has a slight fabric softener note or a clean VIBE, which is why I celebrated it so much. Yes, it does have a certain synthetic quality due to the price, but it is FAR from being bothersome.

It is very well received by women, and that was always one of the main reasons for me (+ back then) why I always chose it, as I also met my wife with this fragrance.

The current or last batches haven't been as great (good) in terms of performance. If you see a batch from before 2017, then feel free to buy it blindly, and YOU will experience the MAGIC of the fragrance, and the performance is a whole different story.

A truly beautiful fragrance, and thank you dear Individuel EAU DE TOILETTE for the wonderful moments!

Wishing you a nice day/evening, or whenever you read this review, best regards, Benny

Individuel,04/06/2016,Avdalim,M,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,The best blind buy I've had in a long time! Performance and all-rounder,"Do you like Joop! Homme? No? Then Montblanc's Individuel is not for you.
However, if you like the idea behind Joop Homme but are looking for something that isn't overly penetrating and sweet for everyday wear: then your search ends here.
I made it my mission to put together a good fragrance collection on a low budget, and after purchasing Nautica Voyage, Al Rehab Silver, and many others, there was no way around Montblanc's Individuel.
About the scent: Raspberry, vanilla, and mint create an incredibly good, sexy, and MASCULINE fragrance that, although sweet scents often do, doesn't get on my nerves. It's a tamed Joop! Homme with more depth and maturity.
Regarding sillage and longevity: I get very good longevity from this scent (around 8 hours), and my T-shirts still smell of the fragrance the next day, even though I haven't sprayed anything on them. The sillage is also very good for the first few hours, creating a pleasant medium-sized scent cloud around you.
Bottle: A very elegant and well-designed bottle that is flat and well-crafted.

Conclusion: Great everyday scent for younger gentlemen in the 18-30 age range. Very good for university/school/work, also suitable for dating and partying. Incredible quality for a ridiculously low price (22 euros for 75 ml)."
Individuel,10/07/2020,Indexmanager,M,4,,5,Suitable as a signature scent,"The fragrance is somewhat synthetic on one hand (which is not surprising given the raspberry note), yet it offers an unexpected complexity and depth. Nevertheless, the scent is not heavy, but rather light with its sweetness. One could also say it is easy to wear and mass-appealing. It fits well in the office, on a date, and in other situations."
Individuel,09/08/2021,Giggs1980,M,81,,2,"A good all-rounder, but………","I have been testing Creed for some time. I have always liked “Original Santal.” Only the price of the “harder” and “more masculine” Joop put me off.
Until I stumbled upon the original scent and its description here.
I blindly ordered the MBI for a tenth of the price of Creed.
My nose can’t detect any significant differences between the MBI and the COS. The Santal is probably a tad fresher. But I can’t confirm this. Both are wonderful scents. But……………. I can’t wear it two days in a row. After wearing it once, the scent rather haunted me on the second day than accompanied me.
As a nice change for occasional wear, it is certainly suitable. But for multi-day wear sessions, it is too straightforward and unsuitable for my nose."

Individuel,01/11/2013,Skywalker,M,5,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Raspberry Spirit in a Flask,"that's what I thought when I sprayed Individuel for the first time and held the bottle in my hand.
Holy moly, this stuff is sweet! It practically knocks your fillings out! The raspberry clearly dominates the fruity top note. Too sweet for me, I thought it was a bad purchase.

But if I've learned one thing here in the forum, it's that you have to take your time with a fragrance and see it as a whole. And that's exactly what happened. After about an hour, the raspberry takes a step back and a fresh, slightly minty, sensual scent emerges that completely convinced me.

I still need to get used to the start of Individuel, but the rest is simply heavenly!"
Individuel,12/01/2019,TomKeanu,M,2,,3,Somewhere between Creed and Joop,"...this fragrance can be categorized. If you get the right batch, then you’ll experience the full blast of raspberry fabric softener. The scent itself is fresh with a clear inclination towards a ripe raspberry. The longevity of 4 to 5 hours and even still noticeable after 7 hours - at least with my batch - is really solid for this price. Especially in everyday life, this fragrance is just right and you can't go wrong with it. For those who want a more modern version of Joop Homme paired with a bit of Original Santal, this fragrance is exactly the right choice."
Individuel,06/21/2012,Helios,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Beautiful fragrance!!!,"As already mentioned absolutely accurately by my predecessor, this is a perfume that smells strikingly similar to Original Santal by Creed, and in my opinion, it even smells better.

I am actually a big admirer of the fragrances from the house of Creed, especially appreciating their high quality, but here I find the ""imitation"" even better.

The OS is, in my view, a bit sweeter, while the Individuel smells fresher and more harmonious than its counterpart. For some, the fragrance might be a bit too sweet, but that is always a matter of taste.
The longevity of the scent is also very good.

For a third of the price of the much more expensive Creed water, you get a high-quality perfume here that invites you to dream."
Individuel,01/09/2023,Theokhlm,M,1,,3,Fresh Laundry with a Hint of Raspberry,"It was my first perfume that I ever bought for myself and wasn’t given as a gift. I chose it because it was supposed to have a very good price/performance ratio, so I bought it blind.

When I first sprayed it on a warm summer day right after showering, the fresh scent filled my nose; it simply smells like freshly washed clothes with a hint of raspberry. If you pay close attention, it does smell a bit synthetic, there’s no doubt about that, but you can hardly blame the perfume for the price. That day was also the day I received my first compliment for smelling good, and I always fondly remember that.

I can definitely recommend the perfume for those who don’t want to spend too much on a fresh fragrance in the warmer months. And it’s also great for going to bed and always smelling fresh, so it’s not a waste :)"
Individuel,02/15/2012,Iceted,M,10,,2,affordable original santal,"I don’t need to write much here! Anyone who wants to know how Individuel smells just needs to read the comments on Original Santal.
The top note of Individuel is a bit fresher. After an hour, however, the scents are almost identical to my nose.

Great fragrance and an excellent alternative to the much more expensive Original Santal by Creed."
Individuel,01/13/2024,Dankop77,M,21,,4,Original Santal for Low Budget,"I recently snagged a bottle at the Souk for a good price. The batch is from 04/20. It was listed here in first place as ""similar to 'Original Santal | Creed'."" I thought I’d give it a try since Creed is really expensive. I have a decant of that from a nice Parfumo. The Santal and the Montblanc definitely go in the same direction scent-wise. The Montblanc becomes relatively sweeter than the Santal quite quickly. The Santal is more fruity, slightly tart. The Santal definitely comes across as more high-quality. It should be at that price. However, I think I still made the right choice. The huge difference that would justify the massive price difference is simply not there. If you like it quite sweet and fruity, this one is a good option. Otherwise, it’s better to go for the Santal. I find the longevity to be very good. It was detectable on my little test sprayer on the wrist from noon until evening. The Santal held on even longer and was still faintly noticeable the next morning. I didn’t find the sillage to be that extreme in either case. But with one spray, that wasn’t to be expected either. The sprayer works great. There are worse ones in expensive perfumes. The bottle looks simple but solid.
I don’t need to emphasize the price-performance ratio here. 75ml for under €30 is already great.
Conclusion: I don’t regret the purchase and probably won’t buy the Santal again since the Montblanc is a good substitute for the Santal (with some compromises) for a small price. My tip: buy a sample of the Santal and the inexpensive Montblanc bottle and then decide. And don’t wait too long, it has been discontinued.
By the way, I can’t see the similarity to Joop Homme (which I read often here). For me, it’s much more artificial, sweeter, stickier, and less fruity. I didn’t like that at all. I hope I could help those who are undecided ;)"

Individuel,04/15/2021,MrMagic,M,33,,1,Montblanc Belanglos - now also available in your stores!,"Dear friends of individuality,

today I want to talk again about Montblanc Individuel. There isn't much to say about the fragrance, but since I believe it is completely overrated, I still want to share my thoughts in a review.
One major point that comes up repeatedly with this fragrance is its similarity to Joop! Homme. Is Montblanc a twin or not? No, it is not!
However, it does contain a significant part of the fragrance DNA of Joop! Homme and has reminded me of that scent from the very beginning. Montblanc also has a large portion of its own fragrance DNA, which comes across as fresh and synthetic-fruity.
So, take a good portion of Joop! Homme, mix in some freshness, and round it off with a synthetically intrusive raspberry. The result is a confusingly sweet-fresh medley with a lab-created raspberry. I don't know the Santal from Creed, but if it really smells exactly like the Individuel, then I understand the popularity at this price even less.

With Montblanc, the price is manageable, but there are so many good fragrances in this price segment. However, I am also not a fan of Joop! Homme, so you as a Joop! fan may see it differently.
I would love to elaborate on the character of the fragrance based solely on the notes, but this scent is so generic, cheap, and olfactorily exaggerated and confusing that I find it neither possible nor necessary. It's not a truly unpleasant scent when viewed by the general public, but it is one that you smell today and forget tomorrow. Montblanc has created nothing of individuality here, so the name completely misses the mark.
Another prime example of why Jeremy's recommendations rarely resonate with me. But well, he also suggests Bleu de Chanel edT in the club...

The sillage is at best average. Freshly sprayed, the scent does rise from the forearm to the nose, but it quickly settles in close to the skin. Likewise, the longevity of 5-6 hours is not exactly impressive.

The bottle offers what is inside, namely absolutely nothing special.

Conclusion: If you love Joop! Homme or at least like the fragrance direction, you should take a look at this one. I cannot recommend this concoction to anyone else.

Thank you for reading!"

After receiving 50 ml of Montblanc's Individuel for about 20 € including shipping, I thought during the first test: Oh dear, you can pass this on right away. So sweet, so floral, so berry-like... I even tried to wash the ""stuff"" off me, I found it so..."
Individuel,02/06/2015,DONRICKONE,M,5,,2,Third-Class Trash Scent / No Comparison to Creed Original Santal,"I can only agree with Fabiano's comment, but I must add that the comparison made by some dilettantes to Creed's Original Santal is severely flawed. Only a part of the top note vaguely reminds (but only for the first few minutes) of Santal. Otherwise, these two fragrances are worlds apart. Creed is undoubtedly overpriced, but qualitatively it is definitely of much higher quality, less synthetic. Unfortunately, I bought this scent as a blind buy due to the comparisons to Santal... I totally regret it. I am now ordering Santal, the sample convinced me. With Montblanc, after 30 minutes, there are bizarre, artificial ""aromas"" that I am desperately trying to eliminate with soap."
Individuel,04/08/2020,Nils2502,M,7,,2,Montblanc the Alps,"Montblanc has created a fragrance here that will remain modern for many years.
The scent resembles Creed Original Santal.
I affectionately call the Creed Unoriginal Santal, as Montblanc was the first to see the light of day.

The fragrance has a lovely raspberry note, with mint and vanilla. It is fresh yet also fruity and spicy.

For the price, this fragrance is an absolute must!

Anyone looking for a Creed alternative will find themselves very well served here."
Individuel,04/29/2020,MichaNase,M,17,,0,Sweet - Woody - Synthetic - But where is the raspberry?,"After I got to know Parfumo and read through various reviews, I actually decided to go for a blind purchase. What could possibly go wrong with a fresh raspberry potion? Back then, Individuel was still in the Top 100! I thought I would surely like it.

So what went wrong? Well, my nose went wrong. I sprayed the scent on my wrist and sniffed. Briefly fresh, then sweet-woody. What about fruity? The fruit is rather overshadowed. And what about the raspberry now? I have frozen raspberries every morning, and what I smell in Individuel as fruit does not smell like raspberries. Okay, I can imagine that someone might think the fruity component could smell like a raspberry. At least it goes in the berry direction.
I also don't see any similarity to fabric softener; the sweetness is too heavy and penetrating for that - and above all, the sweetness is too boring for me because I miss the playfulness. Just too well-behaved, the boy.

In any case, I was disappointed. The scent remained quite linear sweet-woody. Over several years, I have repeatedly tried to get closer to the scent. But we have not warmed up to each other until today. During the last spray, I was finally annoyed by the sweetness and was glad when the smell was gone.

However, my colleagues liked the scent! They found my Lacoste pour Homme by comparison not nearly as good."
Individuel,11/18/2013,Fourcid,M,6,,5,Raspberry Cinnamon - Vanilla Horror,"When I first read the comments about this apparently great fragrance, I thought it could be something special for us, but I was far from correct.
The perfume is greatly overrated. I find nothing about the scent that smells fresh; it immediately goes into an extremely overpowering powdery direction, which I do not like at all. After 10 minutes, I already had a headache, so I tried to wash it off. The sillage is too extreme for me; considering it as an everyday scent feels almost dangerously unfair.
But tastes do differ. The fragrance pyramid sounds very exciting, but something went wrong here, as I only smell raspberry vanilla cinnamon, and it’s to the point where it’s no longer enjoyable.
On the other hand, the longevity is very good, as after 6 hours it became somewhat more pleasant, but it still won't be for me.
The bottle, on the other hand, I like very much; it looks like a small flask that is very well done.
I truly cannot understand why this fragrance is so hyped here."

Individuel,11/29/2013,Rumpel,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Fruit Punch with Mint Liqueur,"Due to the lack of availability in local stores, I once again ordered a perfume blind.

This time, a representative from Montblanc, which, based on the descriptions and the fragrance pyramid, should match my taste perfectly.

And what can I say, it did. I can understand the often-cited resemblance to Joop's Homme in the first few minutes. A surge of fruity notes floods the nose and surroundings. An opening that, considering the cold and clear shape of the bottle, I wouldn't have expected.
Well, that shouldn't deter me. I'm curious about what will happen next. And quite a bit happens.
Whether the nose is just slowly recovering or the fragrance is only gradually settling down, after about 20-30 minutes a calming freshness blends into the berry cocktail, giving it a fresh elegance that should fit smoothly into almost any life situation.
As if adapted to the normal daily rhythm, Individuel transforms again as the hours progress. This time, the freshness fades a bit, and in its place comes a cozy mix of warm vanilla, amber, and tonka bean, which conveys a feeling of coziness and a pleasant atmosphere.
If a hint of woody vetiver had peeked around the corner here, the fragrance would have scratched the 90% mark.

It is likely due to its pompous appearance that Montblanc's Individuel does not only receive affection. For my part, I find it extremely successful and look forward to experiencing the versatility of this perfume anew each time."
Individuel,04/12/2021,Daniel1323,M,22,,4,Individual? Unfortunately not,"Rather a typical and sweet everyday fragrance that can only ""convince"" through a synthetic freshness and an almost overwhelming raspberry.

With this number of fragrance notes, it is already to be suspected that hardly any are truly identifiable. With a lot of imagination, perhaps juniper and chocolate break through, but otherwise the scent strikes me as quite linear and one-dimensional, despite the seemingly complex fragrance pyramid.
Longevity and sillage are, in my opinion, rather disappointing. To truly enjoy the scent, you have to reapply it every 3 to 4 hours; otherwise, it's a short-lived pleasure.
The bottle has a cool shape but is otherwise absolutely unremarkable. The glass feels quite thin, and the spray head is nothing special.

Overall, Montblanc Individuel is not a bad fragrance. I really enjoy wearing it on cooler days in autumn and spring, as the mix of sweet raspberry and freshness particularly comes into its own for me. However, the scent is neither unique nor does it have noteworthy performance. At €23 for 75 ml, this purchase didn't hurt, but there are significantly better candidates for this price.

Edit: By now, I actually like it much more than I initially thought. The freshness compared to a Joop Homme is, in my view, the biggest reason to buy it."
Individuel,06/03/2024,Powder,M,2,,5,My Ticket into the World of Olfactory Experiences,"It was 2015, and I was in my mid-20s searching for a perfume that stood out from all the stuff that was uniformly worn by the young men I knew at the time. Even though I know today that the scent is no longer a hidden gem, the design of the bottle and the name ""Individuel,"" along with a few recommendations from larger perfume YouTubers, made it a good decision to buy the fragrance blind.
I opened it, sprayed it, and it was love at first sight.
I never had associations with cotton candy or syrup. I felt like the cleanest person on earth; with this perfume, you can't lose a court case... I never had to test that, but I wouldn't be surprised. The blend of spices and the metallic undertone were a novelty for me back then, as I had only been a fan of Paco Rabanne's Black XS and Boss Bottled until that point.
Unfortunately, after the first bottle, I purchased my second one from a less reputable site. The scent was not quite as good as I remembered, and the longevity and sillage left much to be desired.
When I learned that my favorite scent was to be discontinued, I wrote to Mont Blanc and sadly received the heartbreaking confirmation that I would have to say goodbye.
When I think back to my studies, you will probably always remain in my memory. If it is ever re-released, I will definitely spend money on it, and I mean seriously.
For anyone who still has an old bottle in their possession, consider yourself lucky."
Individuel,09/01/2021,Dennis79,M,27,,2,Raspberry with a Laundry Detergent Vibe,"This was one of my first fragrances that I acquired this year as an office scent.

SCENT:
What does it feel like to wear *Montblanc Individuel*?
- Like wearing fabric softener (probably the lavender) with raspberry aroma. It also has a synthetic undertone to my nose. It doesn't have any particular association with a specific moment for me - it's just a clean man scent. Nothing more, nothing less. I don't perceive the comparison to Joop Homme at all. The latter is significantly stronger and smells strongly of sour cherry rather than synthetic raspberry.

When do I prefer to wear *Montblanc Individuel*?
- Preferably during the daytime and in the office. However, I wear it less often now since I own Prada Lhomme, which handles the *clean man* use case much better with its luxurious iris note.

How does this scent differentiate itself from other soap/fresh laundry/office scents that I have smelled so far?
- Dior Homme Intense: alongside the soapy scent, also wood and vanilla (more of a date character)
- Prada L'Homme: significantly more luxurious iris scent, which for me is in a different league.
- Prada L'Homme Intense: for me, more of an upgrade to a date scent, as the vanilla is very prominent here.
- Prada Amber pour homme: also very soapy and for me the number 2 soap, which also smells luxurious.

SILLAGE/ LONGEVITY:
- The sillage is good.
- The longevity is good.

BOTTLE:
- Looks like a field flask. Very elegant and well-designed. However, I don't associate the scent (raspberry) with the name and the bottle together. But okay.

PRICE/VALUE:
- I bought the 75ml variant for just under €25. The price/value ratio is really good.

CONCLUSION:
For everyone who has a tight budget and wants a solid laundry dryer scent for the office. However, those who invest about €50 more will get Prada L'Homme, the number 1 for the office, and will surely receive a promotion soon for the top-notch scent :-)"
Individuel,01/30/2022,Philipp91,M,219,,1,Raspberry Fabric Softener in the Tumble Dryer,"Montblanc Individuel is also an EdT that is rightly hyped on YouTube, available for little money yet offering good scent quality. Fragrance Dawg has mentioned several times that the fragrance bears no resemblance to Joop Homme. This is not entirely true, as there is a slight association present at first. However, it does not veer into the overly sweet territory like JH; instead, it is less heavy and simply smells cleaner. It is, however, far from being fresh. Individuel reminds me of a classic fabric softener used for towels and bed linens. When these come out of the tumble dryer and the laundry is still warm, you have to imagine the scent somewhat like that.

Individuel is suitable for rather cool to mild days, not for the height of summer. If worn then, it should be applied discreetly and reserved for the evening. The EdT is also suitable as a club scent. In the office, I find it usable as well, but here, just 2 sprays are sufficient. The longevity and sillage are really good; Individuel lasts about 7 to 8 hours on me. If you want to smell clean and well-groomed without spending much money, you should definitely consider this or at least give it a try. Montblanc fragrances are true price/performance kings!"
Individuel,02/22/2019,DerNeue,M,3,,3,Price/Performance,"The price-performance ratio of this fragrance is quite good, in my opinion. It's nothing special but also not generic. The bottle is well-made and fits perfectly in the bag, as it is quite slim. Longevity and sillage are not very impressive."

Individuel,10/23/2023,Dennis1104,M,995,,4,An absolute classic and rightly so,"I haven't had Montblanc Individuel under my nose for years and I regret it a little. This scent is still so good!

A fresh-fruity fragrance with a pleasant sweetness and a very, very subtle spiciness.

Delicious juniper berry with various herbs (mint is worth mentioning), a pleasant raspberry that adds a nice fruity sweetness and your floral nuances. The floral notes, however, do not make the scent overly floral. They are very subtly crafted.

As it develops, you increasingly notice this wonderful raspberry note, which gives a really nice fruitiness.
Although the scent already has a certain fruitiness from the juniper berry.

Individuel is simply an absolute ""No Brainer,"" as people say nowadays.
This scent works every time.
It just smells good, it is well-received, and I think the ""clean man scent"" fits here just as well.
The impression of ""freshly showered"" might also fit.

Many may find this scent boring, but I do not at all.
I just think this scent is really good!"
Individuel,02/20/2021,Schmidde,M,10,,0,Good and Affordable,"For me, one of my favorite scents. Smells very, very delicious with sweet raspberry, vanilla, and freshness. I would love to eat such a fragrance. For this low price, you get quite good longevity of about 4 hours. On clothing, it lasted about 2-3 days for me and is a guaranteed compliment magnet.

What makes the scent truly special is the blend of sweet and fresh. You get a clean fragrance, thanks to lavender and a bit of citrus, which gives off some shower gel vibes but has a certain twist from the raspberry.

The longevity is solid and the sillage is okay as well - which also describes the character of the fragrance well, as it is by no means intrusive. For me, it is the perfect office scent.

Individuel,01/30/2021,Yayayaya94,M,4,,1,Floral-Fresh-Raspberry-Individuality,"I bought it for the second time at Notino and I don't recognize the scent anymore. I previously had a version from 2016. In the meantime, the scent could no longer be perceived after 1 hour.

Scent:
Nevertheless, this scent that I originally bought is a very special one. I understand why it is associated with Joop Homme. In both, you cannot perceive all the components, but you hear a jumble of several sweet and floral notes. This one is significantly fresher compared to Joop.
Mainly, the scent starts off fresh for me, then becomes sweeter over time. The floral component also becomes stronger as time goes on. The raspberry note is not common and makes the scent stand out immediately and come across as individual.

Occasions/Seasons:
Generally, a scent that can be worn in any season. However, I prefer to wear it in autumn and spring. For me, it's an everyday perfume, as you will hardly encounter any negative reactions with it. I've also received consistently positive feedback at work. As someone over 40, I definitely wouldn't wear it anymore, as it is just too playful.

Conclusion: Great price, you can't go wrong at all. I'm just surprised at what version I ended up with. Reformulation?"

Individuel,12/20/2021,Smith11,M,6,,1,Individuel,"Starts fresh, clean, and airy (probably from lavender + mint) and sweet, then quickly adds a bit of spice; the sweetness from the raspberry note (like raspberry candies, not fruit) mixed with the spiciness of cinnamon adds a unique accord to the fresh-clean notes. I also discover a faint powdery note that slightly enhances the airy-fresh, clean scent of the fragrance; fresh-clean candy-sweet and lightly spicy-clean, straightforward and not very evolving (although the fragrance contains many different notes), it has a fresh clean aromatic quality with moderate sweetness, mainly candied raspberry but mixed with nuances of chocolate-vanilla and amber, while cinnamon and sandalwood add some spice. GOOD SMELLING ""mass appealing"" fragrance that is still unique, subtle enough to wear in the office or casually during the day, but loud enough to stand out and sweet enough to be worn at night and/or by a woman.

* Very similar to Sander for Men by Jil Sander, it has the same fresh, clean laundry + sweet atmosphere; MB Individuel has raspberry that Sander does not have, and is just a bit sweeter and spicier."

I had to let that sink in for a moment, but I wasn't ready to throw in the towel just yet.

Yesterday morning, just before work, I went all out and applied a generous amount (chest, neck, hair, behind the ear, etc.), fully aware that this could be my last day at work due to a massive scent disturbance. Although both men and women are quite used to my choices. ;-)

And lo and behold, in this quantity, the actual scent revealed itself to me. A delicate mix of various berry types with a hint of vanilla, and I even think I can detect a very slight note of chocolate. Very (re)freshing and in no way overpowering.
None of my direct colleagues, who have to endure me, and there are quite a few since I sit in an open-plan office, said a word about this scent, and I've had my share of comments before. :-)

I myself could perceive this wonderful fragrance all day long in a very pleasant dosage, but the sillage on my skin seems rather weak and is in no way comparable to other ""powerhouses"" like A Men, Le Male, or Fahrenheit. For this reason, it will surely not be an evening or going-out scent for me, but it is definitely suitable for every day, every season, and regardless of whether it's work, sports, or play.

Anyone who enjoys this fragrance direction (Gourmand?) can buy it without hesitation and shouldn't be deterred by the initial scent test.

I give it a clear recommendation, even though I wished/expected a stronger sillage."
Individuel,01/07/2023,Freeflight,M,3,,2,Actually Suitable for Layering,"It was a failed blind purchase. The first time it smells disappointing, the second time a little better. Solo, it smells strongly of laundry detergent to me. It layers well, for example, with Mesmerize Black - this makes the scent a bit sweeter and gives it a peach-like note. I definitely advise against a blind purchase."
Individuel,03/16/2021,Aaron95,M,8,,1,Best Price-Performance Winner,"Sweet but still very fresh.
I think these words fit very well when it comes to describing Mont Blanc.
I have had the fragrance for a short time and have already had several opportunities to test it. It progresses quite linearly and shows not many changes from the opening to the dry down. It is fresh and has a certain berry sweetness that I simply find great.
It is very suitable for everyday use, regardless of the season. I have received some compliments. It lasts about 6 hours on my skin and even until the next day on clothing.
I find it perfect for when you come straight out of the shower and just want to chill with a friend.
However, a major drawback: I personally find the bottle simply ugly and very, very awkward."
Individuel,09/15/2024,Lucas209,M,196,,1,Take 08/15 shower gel and throw in a pot of raspberries,"The scent starts with a typical 08/15 men's shower gel note, which quickly changes as a very dominant raspberry note joins in. This is really intense and feels quite synthetic.

At this moment, the scent strongly reminds me of Joop! Homme EAU DE TOILETTE as it has a similar sweetness.

There isn't a significant change in the course of the fragrance.
The longevity and sillage are fine, but you need to reapply throughout the day.

For me, the scent is ideal on rainy days."
Individuel,01/15/2020,Sengajaa,M,1,,2,Disappointed,"I was blinded by the good reviews. It smells extremely pungent only of soap and that for hours. Unfortunately, I only read later that it was reformulated and watered down.. According to the batch code from April 19. I will dispose of this cheap soapy mess."
Individuel,01/06/2024,Lauser93,M,1199,,2,"Burning Top Note, great remaining scent development, poor longevity :-(","Now I have an original manufacturer sample of Individuel EAU DE TOILETTE in front of me and I am a bit disappointed but also intrigued. Strange feeling, right? Yes, the scent development was a bit odd and possibly due to the age of this sample. However, I did not expect the longevity to be so poor at 4 to a maximum of 5 hours. The sillage is only marginally better.

The top note is burning, quite synthetic, and initially sour-fruity with a lot of bergamot. Then, green and herbal aromas of mint, rosemary, and coriander creep in. The heart note, however, smells very nice, floral, and sweet with lavender, geranium, iris, and violet. Then a lovely cinnamon aroma emerges. I really like the base. The raspberries surprise me, and I also detect vanillic, creamy, sweet, woody, and balsamic hints of tonka beans, amber, and sandalwood.

Since the longevity and the top note were so poor, I will have to retest the fragrance at some point and then revise this review. But the rest really offered a lot and was quite nice for me."
Individuel,06/30/2025,HendrikLamar,M,2,,1,Mexican Memories,"I have been a Parfumo user for several years, but I am only now writing my first contribution. To match this, I chose one of my first fragrances - Montblanc Individuel.

Back then, promoted by the ""old"" Jeremy, I ordered it and was indeed not disappointed.

Today, after a long time, I opened the bottle again, sprayed once in the air and bam… throwback to Mexico.

It’s Friday evening, in a small town on the Mexican Pacific coast. The mood is excellent and the weather perfect. Full of anticipation for the upcoming evening and date, I get ready and finish everything off with a generous amount of Individuel (yes, the performance is unfortunately weak, so please a bit more!).

On my way down to the hostel bar, I run into my group. A colorful mix of Europeans, Americans, and a few Latinos. It took no more than a minute and I was already collecting the first compliments. The scent develops in the tropical warm summer night, with a fresh sea breeze, into a real magnet. I enjoy the fragrance with every gust of wind, and so does my date. ;) For the setting, the scent is perfect. Relaxed and not too intrusive. Exotic and laidback. Just like the Mexican coastal town.

It may be that I am particularly enthusiastic about the scent because of the memory. In any case, it is worth a try!

In my opinion, Montblanc smells fresh, but also slightly sweet. Not aquatic/spicy like Sauvage or Coolwater. Much more like freshly washed clothes, fruity and simply absolutely pleasant. Definitely unisex and appealing to everyone, but I would still consider it very special, as it stands out from the big mainstream fragrances.

At first, it is clearly noticeable in the air. Unfortunately, that fades after 1-2 hours. After that, it may still be perceptible on the skin for another 5 hours.

From me, a clear recommendation and perfect as an office scent or on a summer evening near the sea.

Hasta luego."
Individuel,08/28/2013,Zaknafein21,M,16,,2,Brrrrr.... we won't be friends!,"The fragrance pyramid sounded really exciting, the reviews all read wonderfully, and I so wished it could be a scent for me. Something fresh that I could wear well at work, so I had a sample sent to me.
So after a shift, I took another shower and applied it, and wrinkled my nose. Brrr, I thought, this is dreadful! Give it some time, the top note is already slightly not your favorite. It does get better, but we simply can't become friends.
Unfortunately, I don't like it at all, as I find it extremely artificial and it reminds me a bit of bathroom cleaner.
A week later, I tested it again to be absolutely sure, and my reaction was unfortunately the same.
Now a colleague at work is getting the sample as a gift, and in this way, the fragrance might find a new admirer, and I get the chance to smell it on someone else.
P.S.: My fresh scent for work has become Superdry Steel, by the way."
Individuel,09/23/2025,SmellWell05,M,11,,1,MB Individuel,"Montblanc Individuel strikes me as strongly reminiscent of classic aftershave in the opening - fresh, clean, but also somewhat old-fashioned. The often-mentioned raspberry note is something I personally do not perceive at all. Overall, it is a fragrance that one can certainly wear, but does not necessarily have to. It remains subtle, unexciting, and rather unremarkable, without any significant edges or angles. For me, it's not a must-have, but also not a misstep. The longevity is solid at about 5-6 hours. The bottle has a nice design. The price is affordable, but not a blind buy."
Individuel,07/05/2024,Vimes,M,10,,1,Raspberry Syrup,"Hard to describe: first sweet, synthetic, then fruitier - especially raspberry.
Then a light, airy freshie, while the sweet note remains.
This transitions into a bitter-spicy base without completely losing the sweetness.
However, the projection and longevity are not impressive."
Individuel,06/26/2025,Carsten87,M,11,,2,Washed-Out Raspberry,"It must have been around 2011 and one of my first fragrances. Back then, I stood in front of the Douglas shelf full of Creed bottles and had fallen for Creed Santal. When I saw the price (today we would fight over it), I quickly averted my gaze...
Then I heard about Mont Blanc Individuel as a substitute and found it to be a great alternative without having to leave the store with a tear in my eye.

At this point, I would like to mention that production has NOT been discontinued. Sometimes it’s harder to find, and sometimes you can get the fragrance for a throwaway price. I had a similar experience with Missoni Wave.

However, Individuel has already undergone several reformulations, and my recently purchased bottle brings back some memories, but with a distorted image.

I remember it being much fruitier (raspberry) and a bit longer-lasting.

As several previous reviewers have aptly described, it is now noticeably ""cleaner."" Not bad at all, but it used to be better. Otherwise, you can't really go wrong with this fragrance - it fits almost any occasion, any season, and you won't offend anyone with it. At least you still smell like Individuel, as it flies under the radar among the masses."
Individuel,07/20/2012,Rivaner,M,3,,1,Raspberry Spirit,"Some time ago, I received a bottle of Individuel as a gift. Oh nice! I had always wanted to test it. The story of that day is quickly told. The lady of the house often hung around my neck, sniffing and repeatedly getting carried away to make enthusiastic comments. Well, it could be worse.

However, this enthusiasm has not quite transferred to the wearer. The fragrance undoubtedly has a certain elegance - it is not a troublemaker, it doesn’t scratch, it doesn’t cling, it is not synthetic - but in its development, it is overall too one-sidedly sweet for me, without a balancing counterpart being provided. From the listed top notes, I can only smell homeopathic doses of vanilla; the scent clings to the base after a very short time, with the cinnamon-raspberry mixture showing extraordinary endurance. Somewhere, a few violets also sprout. Unfortunately, spicy aromas do not come through to my nose.

In contrast to some others, I don’t like to spray it on in warm weather, especially not at the office, because then it starts to annoy me due to the already mentioned cinnamon raspberry. This can lead to slight headaches. In such situations, the good longevity (up to 10 hours) turns negative. However, since my surroundings, both at home and at work, perceive the scent very positively, I wear it from time to time. If we do get a hint of summer now, it will first move to a back corner and will only be brought out again in autumn."
Individuel,07/23/2025,ornn,M,11,,0,solid budget alternative,"Montblanc Individuel has pleasantly surprised me. The scent starts off really fresh and fruity, with the raspberry note standing out nicely for me, not too sweet, but beautifully balanced. It's not a fragrance that completely breaks the mold, but fundamentally solid.

I like to reach for it when I need something quick and don't want to indulge in an expensive perfume. For around €30, I think you can't go wrong here. Solid quality, decent scent.

Is it a wow fragrance? No. But in my opinion, it doesn't have to be. For me, it's the better and cheaper alternative to Joop! Homme.

Perfect for everyday wear when you want to smell good subtly without overthinking it."
Signature,03/07/2024,DogiCoco,F,637,,6,Mandarin cheesecake and clean musk,"Fluffy, creamy, cuddly vanilla and musk with a lovely sweet clementine on top. The combination of warming vanilla and lively citrus often puts me in a good mood, and this is no exception. It gives me mandarin cheesecake vibes, but with enough musk and subtle florals to make it easy to wear. None of the flowers in the heart really stand out, they just keep the scent from becoming too literal of a gourmand. A touch of benzoin in the base adds extra warmth.

The musk in this is not the typical white musk that many drugstore scents have, it's a bit sharper and more modern.

I understand the comparison to Initio Musk Therapy, but the intense vanilla in Montblanc Signature makes it easy to tell them apart.
Other aspects of the scent are similar to Lattafa Yara, which I absolutely love. The color of the bottles of these two is very telling, Yara smells like the pink version of the white-yellow-gold Montblanc Signature.

This would work on most occasions and temperatures, so it would make a good signature. It's not the most complex, sophisticated scent, but it's not a super girly and playful sugar bomb either. Just a happy, creamy-clean, delicately sweet, femine perfume. The character of the scent is soft, but it's not weak, I actually find it quite dense texturally.

It's totally worth the upcharge compared to Zara Frosted Cream, which isn't as smooth and has an artificial note that this doesn't have."
Signature,12/23/2023,Gourmandgrl,F,307,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"""Soapy"" marshmallow + citrus + ylang-ylang","Best way I know how to describe this is a ""clean marshmallow"":

- A little bit soapy-musky (like a white musk - very inoffensive, but also with the indistinct floral blend of a white soap)
- A pillowy, soft, vanilla marshmallow cloud as the base

It's calming, classy, soft, slightly sweet, and clean. As the scent evolves, more of the clementine and ylang-ylang show up - a bit of sharpness cutting through the fluffy-ness.

The dry down feels a little confusing, as the clementine and ylang-ylang seem to compete with the overall softness of the other notes - so it wasn't for me personally. But I know this is a love for many, so it's still worth sampling."
Signature,09/21/2022,JSpines,M,177,,8,Montblanc Signature,"The first day that I wore this, I had worked a 6 hour shift and afterward, joined 3 of my friends at Starbucks for coffee. We were there for a couple of hours and at the end when I hugged everyone goodbye, my one friend said, ""Ohhhhhh, you smell GOOD!!!"" My other friend then said, ""So that's the smell I kept smelling!"" She then asked me to text her the name of the perfume, along with a picture of the bottle and box.
After 8 hours, I could easily still smell it on myself and others could smell it on me as well, which is a testament to its strength, lasting power and projection.
First and foremost, this is a musky perfume but it's not a pungent smelling musk. It's refined, classy, alluring, sweet and creamy. Beyond the musk, I get something floral. It almost has a rosey vibe to it, so I'm assuming it's the peony. I believe the vanilla note is what's giving it that sweet touch but it's not at all gourmand. The ylang ylang chimes in to give it some depth. I don't smell the other notes. Everything mixes nicely for an overall pleasing and almost addictive effect.
This really is a beautiful fragrance, especially for the price. You can easily find this online at a reasonable price point.
The bottle itself is stunning, the white and cold combo is so pretty and expensive looking.
The fragrance reminds me of a Narciso Rodriguez creation at a fraction of the cost.
A very successful blind-buy for me indeed!"
Signature,01/17/2024,Mlleghoul,F,458,,5,the phantom limb of someone else's life,"Montblanc Signature is a weird one in that it's not really weird at all (it's pretty basic in composition and execution, right?), but it makes me feel some weird, twisty things. If that makes sense. It's a sort of echo-y, empty, fresh, woody,- dewy-floral melange that smells like you're using someone else's shampoo, a pearlescent lather of white musk more expensive than you care to consider. You're sleeping under a stranger's crisp white sheets, cool against your skin, the lingering dryer sheet scent of magnolia petals and fat peony blooms, their honeyed sweetness clinging to the fabric.

Maybe a friend of a friend has an apartment for rent while they're off being an influencer in France, so you're availing yourself of their expensively furnished, minimalist-chic accommodations for a few months in a particularly hip part of town. You spend a lot of time lonely in the apartment, trying on her silk blouses and cashmere sweaters, picking through her curated book selection of vintage Vogue and art photography books, and trying to get a sense of who she is. You're also stalking her social media a fair bit, and like a magpie hoarding glittering scraps, you gather up her turns of phrase and mannerisms, embellishing your own reflection with borrowed plumage. You begin ordering Door Dash deliveries under her name, all the culinary delicacies she'd artfully Instagrammed in her travels, noodles slick with sauce, and hundreds of tiny, bitter cups of coffee. You imagine her beside you, laughter echoing in the sterile silence, a phantom limb you ache to touch.

The line between mimicry and metamorphosis blurs. The creamy magnolia unfurls, a faded photograph of intimacies never shared. The luminous musk, clean and faintly powdery, becomes a shroud, a borrowed identity that both suffocates and intoxicates. This fragrance doesn't just smell like wearing someone else's perfume; it smells like the unsettling alchemy of becoming someone else. And in that borrowed skin, in that stolen life, the question lingers: just how far will you go to become more than just her shadow?"
Signature,09/20/2023,Sopelka,F,40,,4,Surprising quality for an affordable price - signature scent worthy,"Mmmm! This is delightful. Reminds me of VS Tease Cream Cloud, but much more nuanced and with better performance. I love the heavy bottle and the simple yet addictive vanilla and mandarin combo.

Signature,05/21/2024,Ringtale,F,133,,1,Sweet scent,"Sprayed some on the back of my hand this afternoon, just out of curiousity.
I would have sworn there'd be Tiare flower in this, but apparently this is not the case. It reminded me of Guerlain's Terracotta a little, only with a more plasticy (doll-head) vibe and even a little of my Intense Tiare, but way less strong, less fresh and ozonic and less vibrant; more creamy. I wonder which note made me think of Tiare flower. Could this be the Magnolia?
Anyway, I find it just 'okay' not groundbraking. I think it is because I'm very sensitive to vanilla, don't like that note when it is too obviously there."
Signature,04/24/2025,Akira1005,F,221,,1,If only they'd cut down on the synthetic musk a bit...,"It's a great scent. It's based on orange, with vanilla, magnolia, peony, and ylang-ylang. It's the kind of scent that any perfume lover would imagine, and it doesn't disappoint. I think it's okay to buy it blind. However, as I get closer to the end, I get a little squeaky feeling like a synthetic fragrance...it's a little bit stinging in my nose. And it gives me a headache. If it wasn't for that, it would really be a signature fragrance. I think it would be a much more amazing scent if the precision of this scent was improved. It's a minor issue for people with less sensitive noses. I can't buy a full bottle because it bothers me.
But the bottle is very cute. A white ice-like ink bottle. It's a good taste."
Signature,11/27/2024,Madeliv,F,6,,2,A true love/hate for me,"I’m very much into the sweet and clean part of this perfume. I love the creamy vanilla, the marshmallow and magnolia scented soap make me think of sunny rooms where a fresh breeze blows through the curtains.
But on some moments something awful happens and the magnolia bumps into the musky benzoin notes. The soapy undertone smells like old lady SO bad I wish I could scrub it off wherever I am at that moment.
I’m terribly fussy but these moments always make me hesitant to grab my bottle of Signature, even though I really enjoy the most of it."
Signature,04/24/2021,Scentsbox,F,13,,2,Signature by Montblanc,"Withe bottle full of sweet innocence. I bought this fragrance after reading a reviews that compare it to the scent of Nivea cream . After a full day wearing I must disagree. It starts as very fresh, slightly sweet white musk with good projection . With the time floral notes are disappearing giving a way to more sweet vanilla and some creamy notes At that point it smells like vanilla/ coconut creamy dessert with white musk Longevity is very good and projection is fine, leaving nice trail behind you throughout whole day. On the first day of wearing i had a woman following me only to ask the name of my perfumes. Its perfect everyday scent for spring and summer. Highly recommended."
Signature,11/11/2025,Almondie,F,7,,1,Fluffy Orange Musk,"This smells so good. On my clothes it smells like a very fluffy and smooth orange musky cloud. I’ve heard reviewers call it an orange milk bath and that’s pretty accurate. It’s very comforting and clean. However, I only get that beautiful scent on my clothes. I cannot stand this scent on my skin. It’s like it breaks a part on my skin and becomes unbearably synthetic..."
Signature,04/09/2025,SeabirdFly,F,5,,1,Exactly as described,"Love at first sniff! It’s everything described, but no one thing super strong. So it’s kiiinda creamy, it’s vaaaguely fruity. White is the perfect color to describe this fragrance. It’s delicate, sweet, comforting. It makes me want to roll around in a puffy white comforter in bed after showering on a Sunday morning."
Signature,10/06/2020,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,32,Beautiful Writing,"For some certificate, I received a Montblanc fountain pen from my parents - in green and black with a real gold nib.

This gem had already accompanied my father through his school years, and I was instructed to take good care of this treasure.

And I must say, the gold nib glided effortlessly over the writing paper - like a sailboat over smooth water.
It did wonders for my handwriting, and it also increased my desire to write.
I think, anyway - there should be more handwritten notes again.

But one day, my precious writing instrument was gone - and to this day, I don't want to accuse any of my classmates of theft.

In any case, I was sad about the loss - and I have not found this design in stores to this day.

But I found the scent to match the valuable fountain pen - which also greets me with skillful curves.
If the pen was made for writing poems and love letters - then Signature is perfect for a rendezvous.
The counterpart doesn't necessarily have to be a man - a private conversation with a girlfriend works just as well.
Wherever a dignified setting is given, the bright, softly vanillic scent feels at home.
The flowers remain transparent through the aquatic mandarin - and musk refines this noble fragrance even further.

Its elegance is round and has momentum - refined with poetry - just like the word ""Back then"" is written."
Signature,05/27/2020,Serres74,F,30,,21,What now?!...,"...am I the first to write about this scent?! Admittedly...it seems to be quite new...I received a fragrance sample during my last purchase and initially left it aside. I first thought it was a men's perfume because the scent card came across as...well, um ""masculine?"" Today I realized that it is intended for the ladies.

The scent card says Floral-Oriental-Musky...so absolutely my type...sprayed it on and...yesssssssssss...how amazing is THIS?! According to the fragrance pyramid, there should be Clementine in it...nope...I don't smell it...I don't know why, but the top notes of perfumes vanish on my skin like various ships in the Bermuda Triangle. What I smell is something floral, light...maybe the Magnolia?! Ylang Ylang takes the lead, the Rose remains subtle but present in the background...the Vanilla makes it creamy, the Musk gives it longevity. Overall, a beautiful, well-balanced scent.

It fits spring, but definitely also for summer...in my mind's eye, I see a woman walking along the beach in the evening...her skin still heated and warm from the hot day, exuding this sensual fragrance...it has something flirty...light...she gets invited for a drink by a James Bond look-alike and yes...it will probably lead to a one-night stand...why not?! This scent promises enticing summer evenings and nights...

The fragrance can definitely still be worn well in autumn, as long as it hasn't gotten too cold yet. Longevity is 4-5 hours, decent sillage but could definitely be more, because it really is a great scent...it's definitely on my wish list..."
Signature,07/29/2020,Machica,F,60,,25,"Delicate, floral, powdery, creamy, clean, and soapy","Recently, I discovered this fragrance in the perfume shop and was immediately taken with it (which is rare for me, almost never happens). This scent is so wonderfully delicate! I usually don't like most floral fragrances, but this one is different. The floral notes are very subtle and not overpowering. For me, it is a “fresh scent,” creamy, powdery, and slightly soapy in feel. So pure... Along with this purity comes the delicate peony. Still, it doesn't fall into the “smells like fresh laundry” category, because that’s not my thing, at least not on the body. I don't perceive the clementine at all. A sweet, fine, and very feminine fragrance with good longevity. Suitable for everyday wear, in the office, for going out, and in my opinion, ideal in spring or on not too warm summer days (which we have right now ;0). The bottle is also very beautiful. For the gentlemen: your lady will surely appreciate this fragrance! :)
Edit: I have now used it almost daily for a while, so I’m raising my rating to a solid 10! Super beautiful scent, I’ve worn it quite often in the fall, even though I initially associated it more with spring."
Signature,01/22/2022,Jantja20,F,13,,28,"Pssst, this one is underrated!","I became aware of Signature about 6 months ago, but I can't quite remember where.

So, I was on my way to the perfume store and somehow already knew that I would like it. Me and creamy scents? Bring it on! The fragrance pyramid sounded exciting, Ylang-Ylang paired with vanilla? I'm definitely in! And then white musk added? A dream.

The scent caught me right from the first spray. At first, I get a very light citrusy clementine, but that fades away quickly. What remains for me is a light tropical climate. No worries, there's no sweat involved here. Every time I smell it, I think of my beloved Ylang in Gold by Micallef, which I always say is somehow tropical and summery (am I the only one who sees parallels?). This is due to the sweet Ylang-vanilla combo, which makes the scent feel very dense. You have to like that, no question.

Still, the scent is never too much for me, not even for the warmer seasons. It stays in this clean/powdery/creamy genre. More creamy than dry and powdery. I also think that the bottle reflects the scent quite well with its white color. In my eyes, the scent is super feminine!

I often wear it to work, and every time I get close to my jacket (I often spray it on the collar), a warm sweet aura surrounds me, giving a really cozy feeling. The sillage is definitely there, but it's not a beast mode scent (the Ylang in Gold is definitely not that for me either). Longevity is okay.

The price/performance ratio is fantastic. That's why for me, it's an absolutely underrated designer fragrance that I don't want to miss. A 30 ml bottle is not enough for me here.

Anyone who likes scents in the direction of Zadig & Voltaire - This is her, Micallef - Ylang in Gold, and TF - Soleil Blanc should definitely check out Montblanc! I prefer it to Soleil Blanc, especially because you can get it for a fraction of the price. And if not, then I'm still glad that I don't smell it on every corner :D"

Signature,04/22/2021,Beere,F,54,,19,A new scent moves in...,"...I actually wanted to buy nothing and just browse online.

This Corona....
They say Germans are saving more and therefore have more money set aside. This unusual surplus in some people's accounts can also be attributed to the current Corona measures. People are spending less....

Yeah, right! All those who are currently saving a nice surplus are either very careful with their money or not fans of online shopping, which I unfortunately am.

Thus, this white, bulky-looking bottle has now moved in with me, of course in 100ml, because it was ""cheap"" and as a German savings model, I wouldn't have saved anything otherwise if I hadn't seized the good price.

Now I have once again become the mother of a new scent for me. It was a spontaneous blind buy, no risk no fun.
I was all the more eagerly excited about my surprise fragrance.

At the beginning, a fruity clementine immediately unfolds for me, and the magnolia also flashes with slightly citrusy peaks. But the vanilla is right there for me and stays. The scent becomes creamier with a pleasant sweetness; I also perceive the slightly citrusy notes every now and then, but only very subtly.
Overall, it feels warm, creamy, sweet, and vanillic to me, and yes, a bit of bright floral comes through as well.
It fits well on nice, sunny but not too hot days, like right now in spring.
I find the sillage very pleasant for this type of scent; it envelops you without being overwhelming to others, and the longevity is good; it stays with me all day.
Phew.... I was lucky. I find it beautiful, and fortunately, my partner does too.

Until the next bargain buy"
Signature,11/06/2024,Puderperle,F,55,,26,Letting Go,"With my hand on my chest, I tried to calm my racing heartbeat. Phew, why was I suddenly so hot? He had smiled at me. And he had flirted too. I closed the door and made sure it was securely locked. “He loves me,” I squealed in the highest pitch into the voice message for my friend. “I knew it,” I concluded my hysterical outburst with a spin on my office chair.
“Just because Erik returned the pen and said thank you, you think he loves you? But that’s normal among colleagues. Don’t exaggerate, he just has good manners,” she replied. As much as I appreciated her opinion, I didn’t want to hear that. “You should agree with me,” I grumbled to myself and threw my phone roughly onto the paper-laden desk. She had a talent for pouring a bucket of ice water over me verbally.
And even if she might have been a tiny bit right, I still didn’t want to leave anything to chance. Men are not just visual types; they also respond to sensual scents. In the perfume store, I looked for a creamy fragrance with a coconut note. Isn’t it attractive when you’re reminded of a cozy vacation and the dream woman is sitting right in front of you? Sometimes you have to give clueless men a little nudge. Signature smelled wonderfully creamy, soft, and cozy. The saleswoman assured me it would have a hint of coconut in the background. The bottle resembled an iceberg. Completely convinced after testing on the scent strip and my sleeve, I sprayed lavishly into the air as the lady looked away and walked ecstatically through the cloud of fragrance to the checkout.
I received comments about my new scent from all the mechanics in the workshop, but not from him. That only heightened my hunting instinct. So instead of 15 sprays, I now applied 30 pumps to my ample décolletage, just like in the perfume store, and walked extra slowly with a sexy hip sway from the office to the lift, where he was busy installing new brake calipers on a blue BMW.
“Lilly, watch out, don’t end up in the pit with your shoes,” he called out, gesturing with his muscular arm to keep a distance.
Awwww, he’s looking out for me, I thought, melting inside. He seemed to like my platform shoes too, as he stared a little longer than usual at the heels with wide eyes. “Do you like them?” I asked, trying to move along the car body like a cat. Unfortunately, my blouse got caught on the side mirror. I lost my balance, crashed against the driver’s door, and flopped quite inelegantly onto the ground. Of course, right in the middle of an oil stain. To make matters worse, the alarm system started blaring terribly. I couldn’t understand his words as he bent over me in shock. He was surely explaining how he had been terrified for me and that everything would be alright again. I was like wax in his hands, which were fumbling to help me sit up again. For a moment, I considered pretending to faint so he would carry me away, but I was already disillusioned when he pulled an Allen key from beneath me. “Not that it gets lost,” I heard him say as a colleague at that moment turned off the deafening alarm. For my taste, he was handling the metal thing a bit too lovingly. But how could one be jealous of an Allen key… The truck driver Günther came around the corner and lifted me under the arms to help me back on my feet. When he noticed the dark oil stain on my mini skirt and the torn blouse, he threw me a huge coverall out of pity. Bad-tempered that the handsome Erik seemed to be harder to impress than I thought, the unpleasant workshop smell of the coverall hit my nose. Signature came to the rescue. This time, 50 sprays. Aileen, our apprentice, strolled in, drawn by the “immense cloud of fragrance,” as she said. She grabbed the white, asymmetrical bottle and examined it for a while before spritzing it on her neck. It took no more than 10 minutes, and I heard giggling from the workshop. Of course, I immediately shuffled with the monstrous piece of clothing to the customer glass window. I thought I was going to have a stroke. There stood Erik with his outstretched sooty hands, leaning forward and sniffing Aileen’s neck, which she coyly presented to him. Erik rolled his eyes with a grin, and it was easy to see that he really liked what he had under his nose. Since when could Aileen be so shy? I had never known that trait before. I burst through the iron door and called out in a voice that was way too high, asking Erik not to put our apprentice in danger. The oil stain was still there, after all. Before I knew it, I grabbed the girl by the scruff and pulled her into the office. There, she first received a lecture from me about the dangers in the workplace. I made sure she was busy for the next 7 hours reading all the safety instructions of the company and writing a summary. I would then present this at the next team meeting with an impressive display of my bruises, which by then would surely have turned a nice blue-violet.
No matter how hard I tried to establish safety and a good collegial atmosphere, especially between Erik and me, the situation slipped further out of my control.
It broke my heart when I heard that Aileen and Erik became a couple. He fell in love precisely at the moment he sniffed her scent on her neck. Since then, it has been her signature, and he only called her creamy pearl. “Pepepeee Fruchtkwaaaahk,” I couldn’t help but mock him internally with a jutting chin. At some point, she casually mentioned that he had said I always smelled like sour tangerine and that he had been very busy avoiding the tangerine box. It was just too much of a good thing.
It was so unfair. I had discovered Signature and Erik first. They both actually belonged to me. If they were a piece of cake, I would have licked them and loudly proclaimed that everyone would be disgusted and they would surely stay with me. But that’s just not how life works. On clothing and in the perfume store, the scent worked wonderfully creamy, slightly sweet, and indeed with a hint of coconut in the background with a bit of imagination. The fluffy creamy musk cloud is lightened by a touch of zesty tangerine. The subtle fruitiness fits well and reminds me a bit of a delicious dessert or a skincare product. The flowers included in the pyramid are so well blended that I don’t really perceive them. But in the overall composition, they seem harmonious. On my skin, however, Signature instantly transforms into a tangerine overload that becomes so sour that it repels rather than attracts. Neither creamy, floral, nor coconut components come into play. Even the sweet vanilla completely drowns in the sticky acidity of the citrus fruits.
Since then, I have understood a lot. In the presentation on workplace safety, I mentioned that with all ambition, letting go is also part of it. Not everything fits together. Blouse and oil, for example, do not. The other examples like Signature and me, or Erik and, well, whatever - I kept more to myself. After all the bruises had healed, I wanted to give my Signature bottle to Aileen as a sign of my blessing. Unfortunately, I found out that it was already empty. No wonder with 30 ml, I thought, and aimed in a high arc for the trash can. Bam, sunk. At least I can hit, I patted myself on the shoulder and hoped fervently that Cupid would also drop my Signature right into my lap. The rest would then come by itself."
Signature,07/08/2021,MariReniRena,F,32,,15,Orange Cream,"I tested the scent when it was newly released. Although I thought it might fit my preferences perfectly, unfortunately, I didn't like it that much. It was a bit too sweet for me, and somehow it smelled like a standard drugstore fragrance. So, I wrote it off for a while. However, as it often happens with me, even though I didn't like it, it stuck in my mind. It has been on my wish list for a long time. There was something familiar about it that imprinted itself in my nose. When I was browsing here in the souk, I ultimately found a great offer that I couldn't resist. I'm really happy about that, as I suddenly like the scent so much that I will definitely get the large bottle. I no longer perceive that standard drugstore scent note, thankfully. The scent doesn't have much of a progression on my skin; it smells the same from the top note to the base note. I mostly perceive clementine and vanilla, hence the association with an orange cream. Does anyone know the Balea hand soap Raspberry & Magnolia? For me, it's the same scent.

I first sprayed it on a paper strip for testing, 2x. The entire room smelled incredibly good afterward. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long on the skin, but it lasts very, very long on fabrics. In my opinion, it's a year-round scent, not too extreme even in summer.

Despite the initial difficulties, this is a scent I no longer want to miss in my collection!"
Signature,03/17/2023,DeeLen,F,7,,22,Please cut me a slice,"Before I became part of this wonderfully fragrant community, I spent quite some time in various perfumeries. Whenever it was time to shop, it was clear (at least to me) that a visit to some perfumery was a must. I always thought I knew almost all designer fragrances. Until I came to Parfumo :). Again and again, I read in various threads about Signature EAU DE PARFUM. Whether as a compliment, a recommendation, or even as the scent of the day. Well, the reviews spoke for themselves, and I ordered a sample. After ""Angélique Noire | Guerlain,"" Signature EAU DE PARFUM also convinced me after the first spray. I can't actually say that about every fragrance - especially since these two still remain among my favorites!
Montblanc has truly managed to create a fragrance that perfectly balances the fine line between sweet and creamy, zesty and calming, fruit and flower. Like some others, I perceive the clementine (could also have been a mandarin ;-)) from start to finish. This light citrus with a minimal bitter hint is, in my eyes, the icing on the cake. In late autumn and winter, it feels most comfortable, thanks to the vanilla that conveys a sense of warmth. This fragrance is the epitome of sweet-creamy; it couldn't have been described more accurately.
What does all this have to do with my title? Well, it’s also the case that Signature EAU DE PARFUM lasts for hours with just one spray and becomes more and more beautiful with each passing minute. Warm, sensual, yet still present. It is noticed without having to overwhelm with it! An incredible sillage!
And at this point, I must say that quite a few niche houses could take a slice from this. Here, affordable goods are delivered. I am truly impressed by this fragrance, by this price, and by the presence it offers! TOP!"
Signature,06/28/2020,Marquise27,F,232,HELPFUL REVIEW,13,The New Favorite Companion,"I have to say this is a very noble, feminine, and pleasantly subtle women's fragrance - not a girly perfume. It may sound like that, but there’s no ""but"".... just a convincing message from me about this new perfume;
The first spray brings light fruitiness and a lot of Ylang-Ylang. A tropical flower that promises fine sensuality. The whole thing is elegantly underlined with a floral touch that subtly recedes into the background. After about half an hour, everything becomes very creamy due to the vanilla and musk; it gives me a clean, creamy feeling. Personally, I feel clean, fresh, and in an extremely noble and elegant way, kissed sensually by the scent. It quickly becomes close to the skin; it could last a moment longer for me; I would say about 5 good hours, then it noticeably bids farewell, which is a pity because I find it beautiful. There have been some compliments from gentlemen but also from ladies, it stands out very positively. The large white bottle with the golden accents is just super pretty and a real eye-catcher!
My tip to the gentlemen reading this.... perhaps a new, very noble and elegantly sensual-clean favorite companion for the lady of your heart. Prices are moderate; I chose this companion because it is so clean, different, and elegantly sexy!"

Signature,11/10/2023,Shepilein,F,59,,17,The Most Beautiful Toothpaste Smile,"I bought this fragrance blindly from Notino. And let's be honest, how often do we let ourselves be influenced by social media and then think that a scent, just because it sounds so grand in the descriptions of others, must also suit us? Personally, I tend to advise against blind purchases. Because as tempting as a fragrance description may be, in the end, we are all quite particular about our perceptions. What is a fragrance dream for one person might be a fragrance nightmare for another.

Signature by Montblanc has been described by many as a cream cake with a hint of clementine. But that's not entirely accurate. Anyone who conjures a cream cake from musk and vanilla is, in my opinion, a charlatan. The true star here is the clementine, which accompanies all the nuances throughout the development. So it's more of a fruity fragrance. And then there are the floral notes, which certainly do not shy away from lingering in the background.

But what brings about a love-hate relationship for me with this fragrance is this constant cool, almost menthol-like touch. I have no idea if it's due to the ylang-ylang (Soleil Blanc has this synthetic cold as well), but it feels like I’m being laid on ice. Still, it’s a lovely sweet scent that smells a bit like fruity body lotion, but with a little twist.

If the fragrance were a person, it would be a dental assistant. Totally well-groomed, in her pastel-colored work attire, super nice and pretty. When she leans over to put on a bib for you, you catch a whiff of her floral, creamy perfume, along with that typical dentist smell that lingers throughout the practice. That cool, clean scent.

I personally like the perfume, but it is simply not what it claims to be. Whether I find this specific association good or bad, opinions differ for me. It depends on the day. In any case, it is a fragrance for warm days when you could use that cool refreshment."
Signature,08/03/2021,Loo,F,10,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,A Bed in a Cotton Field,"A bed in a cotton field and a coconut cream meringue in hand. The scent is fruity, floral, sweet, and yet clean. The bottle couldn't be more fitting for the fragrance.

No one can definitely be bothered by this scent...because you can't even say whether it's the perfume or a nicely scented, freshly washed piece of clothing that you're wearing.

An absolute feel-good fragrance for home or the office...but after 4 hours I already need to reapply. The sillage is subtle.

Also very suitable for young ladies and affordable."
Signature,11/03/2022,MinesOfMoria,F,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,17,Fresh-Creamy All-Rounder,"Ah, the scent from Mont Blanc has been my long-time ""signature scent""; at a time when I didn't know anything about perfume and was the only one in my circle of acquaintances who had even the slightest interest in fragrances.

I can't even remember how I stumbled upon it back then... maybe it was a lucky coincidence because I found the bottle so beautiful?
Well, who knows, but now to the actual review:

The first impression is always the bottle of the perfume, and here it really matches the scent perfectly! The fragrance starts off softly citrusy, you can immediately smell the clementine. Along with that, there's a slight creaminess, yes, it could be vanilla. The fresher top note can be enjoyed for about 10 minutes, after which the musk and vanilla come into focus and stay there.
The clementine remains ever-present but rather caresses the creamy heart and loses the slight acidity from the first few minutes.

With this scent, I feel like I've just applied lotion and stepped out of the shower; I then put on a white blouse or a sheath dress.
It's definitely impossible to offend anyone; with 2-4 sprays, I'm ready for the next 8 hours. The scent is ideal for work in the office, going out to eat, meeting friends, or even for a cozy evening on the sofa.
If you're unsure in the morning, you can't go wrong with a reach for the ""signature."" Even with a headache, it gently caresses the nose and has a calming effect with its creamy-clean heart note.

I will definitely always have a bottle on my shelf, even if I now reach for it significantly less often. Because every few weeks, I have a day when I hardly feel like wearing perfume or just can't decide in the morning. And then I know who I can reach for with a clear conscience; I simply know my all-rounder :)"
Signature,06/23/2022,Bascoco11,F,59,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Nomen est omen,"I became aware of this fragrance from Montblanc through a video on the well-known platform. It was described as suitable for a signature scent. Creamy with musk and vanilla notes. Due to the lovely description, I ordered the perfume blind from the perfumery. I was not disappointed. On me, the scent smells very creamy and exceptionally pleasant from the first spray. I smell coconut in its best form, even though coconut is not listed here. Creamy, sunscreen-like coconut oil. Vanilla and musk are clearly noticeable. I don't perceive the floral notes, however. Some report that Signature smells slightly sweaty or artificial on them. That is not the case for me at all. My skin loves this scent. I have to keep sniffing my wrist when I wear it. So beautifully coconutty, slightly sweet, yet elegant and like I've just applied lotion after a shower. The sillage is close to the body. Longevity is about 5 hours, definitely no longer. For me, the name is fitting for this perfume, and therefore I wear it more often and in every season. However, not at work. Signature would distract me too much in the office :)"
Signature,03/11/2022,Ninili,F,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Dupe to Musk Therapy or the more expensive version of Impulse Vanilla Deo?,"I really had high expectations for this scent after hearing in so many YouTube videos that it is a dupe for Musk Therapy by Initio or at least strongly resembles it. For my nose, it does not. There may be minimal similarities regarding individual notes, but that's about it. Musk Therapy is truly a ""luxury therapy"" for my nose... the Signature by MontBlanc, on the other hand... ""Vanilla OVERDOSE""!
I often like vanilla notes in the base, as they tend to make fragrances softer. However, here the vanilla takes over from the very beginning and is the most dominant note from the first second.
I didn't have to think long about the associations this scent evokes in me... my 14-year-old self, in the locker room after gym class, the entire locker room smells like Impulse Vanilla Deo. I apologize to all Signature lovers & I hope you forgive me for this comparison - maybe my nose is just strange in this regard... However, the scent actually smells exactly like this deodorant or perhaps leans more towards a VS body spray. Although at around €30 for 30ml it is a cheapie, even these €30 would actually be way too expensive for this scent and already a good investment for the piggy bank for Musk Therapy.

Feel free to let me know if you share my view, or if you also had initial difficulties with the scent, whether you later gained other notes/a different impression of the fragrance!"
Signature,09/07/2023,FrauMieze,F,277,HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Poesy,"In a fragrance full of splendor and shine,
Clementine dances in a crown of sunlight.
Magnolia blooms in a delicate glow,
Peony lets its heart blossom fine.

Ylang-Ylang, so enchanting sweet,
Like a kiss that greets the senses.
White musk, gentle and pure,
Wraps the skin with tender pain.

Vanilla, like a fine dollop of cream,
Seduces the senses, makes them linger.
Benzoin, with its warm sound,
Emits an aura that captures hearts.

Naive creaminess, so lovely and clear,
A sweet fruity start, wonderful.
Vanilla-musk mousse as a topping on top,
A fragrance that enchants, a heavenly flow.

Light synthetic notes, yet hardly felt,
A cream bath for the senses, to seduce.
Nurturing and flattering, at any time of day,
A scent that simply feels beautiful, feminine, and tender.
______________________________

The poetry of this fragrance says it all. Signature EAU DE PARFUM is a lovely, almost tender everyday scent that never seems out of place. With it, you simply can't go wrong.
Wearable at any age, at any time of day, and for any occasion. It is neither flashy nor inconspicuous; you always smell well-groomed, and Signature flatters its wearer immensely.
Sillage and longevity are superb, and price/quality is unbeatable.
The cream fragrance lovers among us have a gem in this one for their collection."
Signature,04/19/2022,AnnaMariee,F,18,,10,"Sweet, sweeter, SUGAR","Creamy-sweet? Yum, bring it on!

Here it is now thanks to a generous perfume. Straight onto the wrist! Spritz, spray. Smell.
Yes, it is sweet. Sniff sniff. Deliciously sweet like powdered sugar on warm fluffy heart-shaped waffles.

A quick glance at the fragrance pyramid. It's a lady. She rushes over. ""Clementine,"" calls the pyramid. Hmm. Sniff. Hmm. ""Sugar?"" I reply cautiously.

""Magnolia, peony, ylang-ylang!"" booms the obviously advertising-savvy fragrance pyramid voice, now a bit louder. I shrug apologetically. ""Sugar?""

The pyramid loses patience. It fires ""Benzoin!"" then, in staccato ""White musk!"" I slowly shake my head and duck. It screams: ""VANILLA!!""
""Ah,"" I say, ""yes, that could be mixed in with the sugar.""
The fragrance pyramid sulks away.
The sugar stays, though. Quite a while. Just as it is, no transformation in Sweetbeak's house included.
Yes, for so long that ""delicious"" has turned slightly intrusive.

""Goodbye sample, you may move on,"" I bid farewell. Then a deliberately cheerful voice thunders behind me, ""Whooo"" -
The fragrance pyramid is back! It thunders with mouth corners pinned up: ""Who likes SUGAR?"""
Signature,06/03/2024,Paloma58,F,17,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,My Style Break,"A little inkwell from Montblanc, filled with fine perfume, was something I absolutely wanted and ordered it blindly. I don’t like sweet scents at all, which I completely overlooked. Since I ordered the small bottle, I didn’t receive a little inkwell, but a slim version (I’ve posted the photo below). Only the content could comfort me. However, the first spray was not a comfort, but rather a shock. Powdery sweetness spread across my arm - as I said, I’m not a fan of sweet perfumes and definitely not of powdery ones. I was disappointed and the bottle disappeared into the cupboard for a while. Weeks later, I made another attempt, again this sweet powderiness, but this time I couldn’t help but keep my nose on my arm. Something was different from other sweet scents, and suddenly I liked what was rising to my nose. Today I can describe it like this: Magnolias and peonies hook onto the ylang-ylang and keep it in check, and over time a dry vanilla appears, and I smell something woody, even though nothing of that is mentioned in the pyramid. It’s exactly this combination that makes the scent so completely different and I like it very much. I don’t smell mandarins at all, and I don’t miss them. I am surrounded by a fine veil,
that stays with me for many hours. I would say Montblanc Signature polarizes and definitely has niche potential. I will still get the inkwell - I, who cling to chypres like glue."
Signature,06/23/2023,JackyBo,F,2,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,New Love!,"I ordered the fragrance blind, after all the recommendations and reviews I had read, I thought to myself, this must be my scent. Ordered it quickly and waited impatiently for it to arrive. Once it arrived, I sprayed it on and thought wow, this is exactly my thing. At first, the clementine greets me, which then slowly transforms into a creamy fruit vanilla ice cream. For me, it's a very beautiful feminine scent that fits perfectly in spring/summer but is also quite wearable in autumn/winter. I wouldn't have thought it, but I actually like it even a little better than ""Musk Therapy | Initio,"" as it is a bit sweeter/fruity. Now I have a new favorite fragrance that lasts about 7-8 hours on me and is noticed by others without being overwhelming. Price/Quality is also top!
For me, a blind buy that was absolutely worth it"
Signature,10/18/2023,ChezNatalie,F,16,,11,Best Allrounder,"It feels like there is no more uncomplicated women's fragrance.

Montblanc Signature starts off light and airy, then comes this clean creamy note that almost resembles a good body lotion, only to become softer over time with musk and vanilla.

The best allrounder for the cold seasons! Whether for work, a date, shopping, or Netflix & Chill.

Only in summer would it be too powerful for me."

I tested both and initially, my attention was drawn to the other fragrance. Montblanc sat in the display case for several months. At some point, I tried the white crystal mountain again. I sprayed it on and let it develop for a bit. Somehow, I actually liked it quite a lot and I noticed it on myself from time to time, thinking that it really has remarkable longevity. After testing it several times, I liked it so much that I became downright addicted to it! When I didn't know which fragrance to choose, I reached for Montblanc and felt good! Additionally, I find it very invigorating and somehow youthful. It has a fruity - creamy and also well-groomed quality to it. The longevity is really great too. I love it when I can smell my applied fragrance for several hours - even days on clothes. The scent is also never too much for me! A truly wonderful fragrance :)"

I followed her beautifully well-groomed, fragrant cloud and had to know what had enchanted me so.
It gave her such a polished, angelically pure aura, which is also emphasized by the bottle.
She revealed to me what she was wearing, and I made a firm decision to check out this scent for myself. That was during my training, and a few years later, it has become my cleanly maintained fragrance of choice and sits in my locker at work.
Since I work in a hospital, it always gives me a sense of cleanliness and lightness and has become a lovely companion in my daily life, which patients also find very pleasant.
Layered with the matching body lotion, I can still smell it at the end of my shift.
Montblanc Signature calms me and simultaneously gives me a cheerful feeling, making it one of my favorites that has enchanted me for a long time and gives me the feeling of radiating light!️️"
Signature,05/28/2022,Fulidu,F,19,,6,Flashback with Barbie,"Once upon a time at Easter a long, long time ago - probably in 1991. My sister and I received the long-awaited Ultra Hair Barbies from our grandma - Barbies with hair down to their ankles. A small pink comb and a mini tube of hair gel were included in the packaging for styling the dolls. Out of (not entirely unjustified...) concern that we might apply the gel to our own hair, our mother immediately confiscated it. However, my sister found it a few days later in the bathroom cabinet and of course we had to test it - but indeed on the Barbies, where it didn't hold very well. However, it smelled quite nice: sweet, soapy-clean, a little citrusy. And that's pretty much how ""Signature"" smells - a blind buy on my part, prompted by the good reviews. Just to be safe, I only ordered 30 ml. I usually do that when I'm not sure if I'll like the scent and this size is available.
I can't really detect a scent progression on me, only the clementines disappear relatively quickly. After about three to four hours, the scent is close to the skin, and after another two hours, it has vanished from the skin. It lasts a bit longer on clothing. Unfortunately, musk hardly comes through for me, which might have given ""Signature"" a bit more edge. So it remains a subtle, light, and clean scent that has given me a nice flashback to the early nineties. It doesn't blow me away, but it's quite pleasant and not intrusive. It will surely work well in the office."

Signature,03/18/2025,Dionysos2022,M,945,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,I still need to...,"... buy a bouquet of flowers. So I go to a good flower shop and have a beautiful bouquet made for me that includes both peonies and magnolias. It’s simply a wonderful bouquet that exudes its scents enchantingly. I arrive at my invitation and the lady of the house opens the door for me, and I hand her the bouquet. She smiles at me and says I am the only one who has brought her a bouquet of flowers so far. She smells it and is simply delighted.

When applying this fragrance, the first thing you notice is a slightly citrusy, fresh floral accord that blends with the creamy note of musk and the woody scent of vanilla. A hint of resinous notes comes through as well. The composition is enveloped in a touch of powdered sugar. For me as a man, the floral accents are noticeable and remain, but at least on my skin, it’s not as strongly feminine as one might expect.

The longevity and sillage are good.

Here we have a women’s fragrance that men can also wear (imagine a 2-meter tall guy with a full beard and chest hair, and I’m not talking about just three hairs on the chest; he’s a bear, not just a regular guy) without becoming feminine. I would say the right age to start wearing this is around 21 years. It can be worn all year round. During the day, in a women’s suit or outfit, it works well in the office, at a meal, a meeting, or just while shopping. In the evening, I can also imagine it on a man when both are at a dinner, or in a club, or just at a party.

This is a fresh floral creamy slightly citrusy resinous woody sweet vanilla scent. If you like that, this is just right and at a reasonable price."

What a shame, it seems not to work on my skin. I know this feeling all too well when that happens.
Out of sheer frustration, I spontaneously picked up another fragrance.

Later in the day in the city, I sniffed my arm again... and wow, what was that? Suddenly it was warm, creamy, and a bit sweet. I thought I was imagining things... it was wonderfully fresh. But not too fresh, rather powdery fresh.
Now I regretted not having taken it with me. I would have endured the initial minutes of disgust.
So the fragrance was promptly ordered online.
And when it arrived, there was great joy upon spraying it, it smelled so wonderful right away. No more musty scent. I don't know what changed, but I'm glad I stuck with it."

The refreshing, creamy opening with the subtle citrus note is like the first ray of sunshine in the morning - light and invigorating, yet never too overpowering. But it is the heart note that unfolds the true magic: vanilla, so soft and sweet, that it reminds one of the scent of freshly made vanilla pudding, filling the room with its warmth. It is the perfect blend of innocence and sophistication that gives the fragrance a wonderful lightness, but also a seductive depth.
I love to smell it on her. When she comes home from school, I am enveloped by the gentle veil of Montblanc ""Signature,"" which hangs in the air like a whisper of memory. At school, she tells me, compliments are pouring in. Her classmates call it ""dream vanilla,"" which aptly reflects the character of this fragrance: a dream of vanilla that gently but persistently floats in the air. The scent is never too loud, never too sweet - it remains subtle and elegant while still making an unobtrusive statement.
It is fascinating how this fragrance connects with my daughter. It has become a part of her, like her favorite jeans or her unforgettable smile. And it is no wonder that she already has her third bottle of it - Montblanc ""Signature"" has become a staple in her daily life. It is not just the fragrance that beautifies her day, but also one that accompanies and underscores her self-confidence.
""Signature"" is a fragrance that carries her into the future like a precious, handwritten diary. Each spray is like a gentle flutter of wings, reminding her that she is unique. The scent is delicate, but not inconspicuous; it is sweet, but never kitschy. It is the perfect blend of youthful freshness and elegance that she already radiates. This fragrance has evolved from a gift into a familiar, intimate companion that exudes warmth and lightness.
It is a fragrance that makes her world a little more beautiful - and I can only hope that it accompanies her for many years to come."
Signature,09/06/2022,GiuS,F,20,,6,Signature...,"First, I want to address the ""DUPE"" (Definition by Christina Aguilera).
They both smell really similar BUT it’s the ""consistency"" and scent development that, in my opinion, is different but relevant. The Definition lacks this creaminess that I love so much in Signature...
This beautiful creamy vanilla musk that blends with the skin is completely missing in Definition, so even though it’s cheap, it’s not an alternative for me personally.

The opening is clearly mandarin,
After a short time, finally this soft vanilla musk mix appears, which blends so wonderfully with the skin.

Longevity + sillage are also good.

I had sold it at first. But I kept thinking about it, somehow I missed it, and so I had to get it back.
I will definitely get a larger bottle as soon as my 30ml is empty."
Signature,03/12/2023,CuteButton,F,5,,8,Do I want to smell like ice cream? YAAA,"If the Cuja Mara Split Ice were a perfume, it would be Signature by Montblanc... Super delicious, unobtrusive, fruity and fizzy while also being creamy. This scent always makes me think of summer, watching the sunset with ice cream in hand.
Longevity is about 5 to 6 hours for me, but what I enjoy the most is that the lightly fizzy clementine always remains present. Sillage and projection are rather minimal, more intimate."
Signature,05/07/2022,Mariposa0910,F,2,,6,Creamy Summer Love,"I don't know why this fragrance is talked about so rarely.
Such a pleasant sweet, creamy scent that slightly reminds me of sunscreen.

It reminds me of ylang in gold or Nivea sun, both of which are among my absolute all-time favorites.

Price / performance is also more than acceptable in my opinion."
Signature,07/13/2024,Maiber,F,47,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,This is a real gem.,"Montblanc Signature has personality and character, but above all, it is extremely elegant and refined. It does not try to grab your attention, but it has a gentle power.

The white color suits it - ideal for the office, work, every day, at the theater, on a date. Suitable for the strictest dress code. Despite its delicacy, it lasts 3-4 hours. It has no long sillage.

The scent is very pleasant, light, cozy, soft, and calm. It reveals more interesting aspects on the skin. It is powdery, floral, very soothing, intimate, and pure.

From the very beginning, there is a strong citrus note. And in the base, vanilla provides sweetness and warmth. White musk is pure, soft, and slightly powdery. Maximally filled with light and air. The overall result is a wonderfully soft perfume that can become a signature scent.

The bottle feels nice in the hand and looks good. It is a smooth, heavy piece of glass, shaped like a Montblanc ink bottle. The inside is white lacquered, and the transparent glass on the outside captivates with the play of light at its edges.
On the light gray box with Saffiano pattern, the name of the fragrance is handwritten in golden letters, as a reminder of the power of words and that handwriting is unique, just like people.

The perfume is ideal as a gift.
Furthermore, it has unfortunately already been discontinued."

I hadn't encountered this one before, so I sprayed it on right away...

Wow! Signature is a scent that I quickly grew to love. It is extraordinary and has something uniquely special about it. No other perfume smells like this!
Yes, I have some fragrances that lean in the same olfactory direction, but they are still not comparable.

The zesty clementine in the top note provides a fresh, fruity, and slightly tart start that instantly lifts the mood. Then the floral heart note unfolds with magnolia, ylang-ylang (very subtle), and peony, soft, elegant, and simply beautiful. But the best part comes with the base: white musk, vanilla, and benzoin merge into a deliciously creamy warm combination that feels both cozy and sophisticated.

I just can't get enough of it and have to keep sniffing my wrist. Signature is a scent that imprints itself in your memory.

By the way, the name fits perfectly; the fragrance definitely has signature potential.

Thank you so much for the generous sample, dear A. It’s going straight into my handbag."
Signature,07/03/2024,LauraA,F,37,,6,Cuddle Fragrance,"The scent is supposed to be similar to another very well-known fragrance, but I simply don't see the resemblance. I prefer the Montblanc Signature much more. For me, it's an everyday companion that accompanies me in all situations. Nice and soft, creamy and slightly sweet, and you can definitely smell the musk.
The fragrance is great as a Mother's Day gift as well as for personal use. Gentle and beautiful! Every time I wear it, it feels like I am being enveloped and lovingly embraced by the scent."
Signature,10/23/2024,MineMinchen,F,67,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Mandarin Cream Dream,"Truly worthy of a signature, as the scent is not strong and you don't get tired of it quickly.

I had some concerns about the Ylang Ylang, as it can easily take over the composition. But no, here it holds back in moderation, allowing the Clementine to take the lead, which comes across pleasantly delicate.

The Magnolia and Peony are also so subtle in the background that they all harmonize well together.

The Vanilla adds a slight sweetness, but it doesn’t make the scent too sweet.

All the components blended together make the Clementine come across rather creamy, which feels refined.

On me, the scent lasts for 6 hours, after which Musk and Vanilla linger close to the skin for a good hour."
Signature,04/16/2024,Emminoelle,F,1,,7,Acquired taste but genius,"I initially had difficulty warming up to the scent, which was probably due to the vanilla. Once the vanilla takes the lead, I can no longer stand the fragrance. Mont Blanc has managed to change my opinion with Signature.
At first, I felt the usual aversion to the scent. But the dry-down convinced me - suddenly I wanted to spray it again. And a day later, everything in me was screaming for this fragrance!

It is such a light scent that goes wonderfully with casual, airy outfits. A lovely spring fragrance for mild days."

At first, I found it quite likable, and now it has truly become a love.
The top note starts with strong mandarin, which I already find beautiful, but what I love the most is when, after about half an hour, this wonderfully maintained, creamy fresh scent spreads through the warmth of the skin. Such a pleasant and beautiful experience.
I also received compliments for the very first time when I started wearing this fragrance.
It is currently carrying me through many warm days. I would also say that it can be worn year-round.
The longevity for me is about 7 hours with 6 sprays. The sillage is quite moderate, but it lasts as well.
I love it and don't want to be without it anymore."

I find it to be a simply pleasant floral scent, slightly pear-like for me, that is neither intrusive nor particularly special. But it is nice, with medium longevity and sillage, so you can't go wrong with it, and it's quite suitable for everyday use."
Signature,09/22/2023,TamKhiara,F,2,,7,Clean Sweet Scent,"Mont Blanc Signature was a blind buy. I was completely surprised by the light fruity note that surrounds the sweetness. A great evening summer scent that is perfect for wearing to dinner. The musk scent comes out later, very sensual and seductive.
All in all, I am positively surprised and will probably wear it more often."
Signature,09/02/2023,Cloudy03,F,7,,5,Creaminess at Its Finest,"I was surprised by this perfume. A wonderful perfume enthusiast sent me a sample through a swap.
At first, I was very skeptical as creamy and fruity scents are not really my thing. I prefer lighter and fresher perfumes.
Now I dared to spray it on. My first thoughts were: oh no, not another fruit basket. But then it unfolded into a very pleasant creaminess.
A beautiful scent emerged. I felt completely comfortable and happy. One could think I had just showered and applied an expensive body lotion.
I was also totally surprised by the longevity and sillage. It lasted through an entire workday, and in the evening I could still perceive the scent.

A great all-rounder perfume, no matter if for work or leisure. I would wear this on warm as well as on cold days.
Good mood is guaranteed.

It's admirable how diverse tastes can be."

Signature,08/06/2023,Lillivanille,F,5,,4,Crème de la Crème,"If ""Signature"" were a color, it would be a light, orange, -almost white- pastel shade, mixed with a bit of beige.

""Summer vacation in Spain, freshly showered, enjoying the evening sun, on the way to the terrace for a light, Mediterranean dinner. Waiting for the sunset, inhaling the warm, yet fresh summer air.""

I have been searching for a while for a fragrance that is creamy, fresh, a bit fruity, but definitely not too powdery and sweet.
""Signature"" is the fulfillment of my desires, it combines all of that:
This scent is so harmonious, clean, slightly fruity, but not too sour and - wonderfully creamy! (Hardly could the fragrance direction ""Creamy"" describe a scent better!)

For the final touch to the ""Signature scent,"" it lacks a bit of that certain something, as the fragrance is very straightforward, and not ""extraordinary"" enough, perhaps also a bit inconspicuous.

For me, this is not bothersome-
""Signature"" is a well-groomed, pleasant women's fragrance, as velvety as the fuzz of a peach. A scent that is not cloying or intrusive.
It is a skin-close fragrance (sillage not really outstanding), which is my only point of criticism.

""Signature"" by Montblanc is, for me, the number one among all fragrances in the ""creamy"" scent category:
The Crème de la Crème of creamy fragrances!"
Signature,06/09/2025,Naemhami,F,4,,1,Flashback,"I sprayed the fragrance and found it pleasant at first - creamy, clean, and sweet. Exactly what you would expect from the scent notes.
Then came the obligatory test on my husband (he gets headaches from some fragrances, so I usually hold new perfumes right under his nose):
His comment: “Smells like girl’s deodorant.”

And just like that - there it was, the most intense flashback of my life: sports locker room, 8th grade. Impulse Vanilla Kisses.
The first good impression was gone. Since then, unfortunately, all I smell is: cheap deodorant with a nostalgia factor."
Signature,11/05/2024,Puttchen,F,13,,3,Fruit Yogurt,"This summer, I spontaneously tested Montblanc Signature in the large D, without having it on my radar beforehand.... this creamy and slightly fruity yogurt freshness immediately captivated me!
As the name suggests, it could easily be a signature scent, as I find it quite unobtrusive and somehow wonderfully well-groomed and creamy, especially in the dry down.
In the end, the beautiful vanilla remains, with a pleasant longevity of about 7 hours.
It reminds me of the fruit yogurts I often ate as a child....

I find this pretty and sweet scent quite special; I haven't smelled many of this kind, so it definitely has to join my collection!"
Signature,09/09/2025,Jessie69,F,26,,3,My daily signature... literally,"The Montblanc Signature was recommended to me in a perfume store. I would never have thought of it myself. And then I was shockingly in love and had to have it. It’s somehow creamy but also has a fresh sweetness to it - hard to grasp for my ""beginner's nose"" but just a great scent. Montblanc ""Signature"" has since become my daily signature fragrance that makes it clear I’m around. Leisure, work, no matter what. It's there. For me, it’s more of a spring to summer scent, but it might accompany me a bit into autumn. Great love."
Signature,12/18/2023,Rina88,F,11,,1,Passionate Seduction,"Signature is a passionate, seductive fragrance.

The scent is sweet and creamy. It is thoroughly accompanied by vanilla and musk. The fragrance truly feels very soft. But the floral notes are not lost in this scent either.

It is a fragrance that can/could always accompany you…….but I also have criticism. As beautiful as the scent is, and I really like it, where is the longevity? I have never had a fragrance with such low longevity. Even in my surroundings, the scent was hardly noticed, if at all. That is unfortunately very disappointing.

So in conclusion: a purely passionate fragrance that will seduce you but unfortunately not for long."
Signature,03/06/2025,Jantje,F,5,,2,Another Cozy Scent,"It's rare for a fragrance to catch my attention on the first sniff, but when my colleague wore this one, I couldn't keep my nose away from her and had to buy it immediately.
Apparently, I particularly like creamy cozy scents, because that's exactly what we have here. Definitely a new treasure in my collection that I won't part with."
Signature,07/27/2023,Lallelara,F,9,,2,A Fruity-Gentle Summer Breeze,"My first impulse buy! I smelled the fragrance at Douglass, without knowing the pyramid. On the paper, I detected a dominant, freshly cut green pear that quickly became powdery, creamy, and clean.

After testing for a while, the clementine is definitely very present in the top note, but it evaporates quickly - just like the rest of the perfume, unfortunately.

The powdery note remains in the end, but unfortunately, after 1-2 hours, I can't smell anything anymore... I spray it 2-3 times again during a workday.

What a pity! I will use up the fragrance because I like it so much, but the longevity does not encourage a repurchase."
Signature,05/31/2024,Dani1981,F,9,,2,Beautiful Everyday Scent for Spring,"Very wearable and pleasant everyday scent. I perceive orange and vanilla and find that it smells a bit like a body lotion. Initially, there is a lot of alcohol, which, however, evaporates within a few minutes and leaves behind a nice citrusy creaminess. For me, it's more of a scent for daytime, especially in spring and summer."
Signature,08/19/2025,berballa,F,2,,0,vanilla floral,"For me, or on my skin, this fragrance is primarily vanilla, or it ultimately remains rather vanilla. I find it very pleasant and rather light. One could say that at first it even smells a bit fruity. The top note should be clementine, and the heart notes are magnolia, ylang-ylang, and peony. The base notes are vanilla, white musk, and benzoin resin.

I can wear rather heavy, ""oriental"" or vanilla scents well. The perfume is also said to be categorized as Oriental-Floral, and is therefore perhaps more feminine. The perfume has been available since 2020. I have long been using mainly Moncler pour femme, and Montblanc reminds me a bit of that.

Recently, I have also enjoyed using Montblanc as an alternative. However, for a lasting signature scent, it is unfortunately a bit too boring in the dry down for me."
Starwalker,10/17/2017,MrHonest,M,118,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,"Cool, Metro, Citrusy Niceness.","This had been my signature scent since 2007, until it was recently dethroned by Bvlgari Man Extreme. It's an excellent office frag because it seems to evoke modern architecture with that crisp, well-blended mandarin-ginger combo, with a touch of aquatic-ness from the bamboo. It's a little sharp off the top, but when it dries down, the cedar comes out and gives it a solid base to hold onto. In fact, the overall feel is one of pencil shavings amidst a bowl of citrus fruit. At least, that's what I get.

I don't know why, but this frag always reminds me of academia. Maybe it's the pencil shaving analogy reminding me of elementary school, but I can totally see this being the signature scent of Principal Seymour Skinner from the Simpsons. It's just got that blue, sharp and proper feel about it, with and air of reliability and calmness. An easy dumb reach if that's what you're looking for. Perfect for most occasions and all ages. Plus, the longevity is good for a freshie. I just wish they had made the bottle bigger."

Starwalker,07/07/2021,ScentSlave,M,246,,5,It is definitely similar to Versace Man Eau Fraîche,"But much less intense… from opening to dry down it’s quite a few decibels below the Versace it replicates.

I actually prefer this one though… as it dries down it becomes smoother, and that bamboo note has me wanting more and more.

Performance wise, though, it’s quite weak. MAYBE a 1-2ft radius for a half hour or so, and then it sits on the skin leaving a very faint whisper of a sillage trail, for 4-6 hours or so.

For the price you can find it for, you shouldn’t be complaining… but you WILL be wishing it could go a little louder, for a lot longer."
Starwalker,03/01/2013,Miaw2,M,339,,1,Great opening,"Opens beautifuly with a nice bamboo note but then it just disappears. Big disappointment.

Lasting power is like 1 hour. Sillage and projection are average.

This could easily be between the top ones if the notes were better worked.

This becomes more bearable after it dries down a bit. It's got a cheap vibe, If I wear this on my neck it will just annoy me. Other people seem to love the smell when I wear this. That and great versatility/appropriateness are reasons why this will stay in my collection anyway. A dumb reach for me which apparently smells good in the air but not so pleasant from up close. I can not wear this on my neck because it chokes me, so I wear this on my shirt and arms. Lasting power below average. I'd say there are better options for the money (Explorer?)."
Starwalker,10/27/2018,Fresh21,M,95,,14,Hype-worthy ?!,"When I first wore Starwalker for a day at the office, I thought: Damned, this is good ... and not just hit but hype-worthy! It immediately reminded me of Aqva Amara, which smells completely different but still shares something in common with this Montblanc: It should not be discontinued until Bvlgari was so hyped this year that it made an unexpected comeback. And while Starwalker is also a discontinued model, I felt: This exceptionally good fragrance deserves to be hyped as well, so that it continues to be produced. Because taking it off the market would truly be a sin!

Right from the start, Starwalker impresses with a fresh, bright fruity opening, a refreshing mixture of the top notes of bergamot and mandarin. However, it is not too citrusy, as one might assume, but equally bright, soft, and slightly sweet, which is mainly thanks to the mandarin - very pleasantly light, friendly, and likable. I liked this scent from the very first second, but it gets even better ...

For the first three-quarters of an hour, not much happens, and you simply enjoy the beautiful atmosphere that this Montblanc creates. But then the heart notes gradually come through, forming a -albeit very subtle- counterpoint to the initial fruity sweetness: Ginger and nutmeg (perhaps also the pine resin) make it a bit spicier and thus more transparent, more differentiated. There’s more going on in the fragrance, which now increasingly feels stimulating and revitalizing, yet remains bright and fruity. Just a well-rounded affair. Nothing drifts off in any unwanted direction; instead, it ""matures,"" gaining depth - well done!

But then, after about 1.5 hours, this Star-Walker becomes a Star-Climber by playing its true trump card: The wood! Because on its journey, sandalwood and cedar now join in, giving it increasing presence, which after another half hour becomes a bit sharp and crackly due to the cedar, although it always remains embedded in the soft-creamy sandalwood - a very attractive duo.

Thus, Montblanc's Starwalker develops into a woodier, more expressive, and contoured scent in the drydown. Yet the fine freshness always remains, as the top notes never disappear with about 30-40% of the fragrance share. This final mélange, the mix of a clear, bright-dry wood base and the fruity freshness of the top notes lasts unexpectedly long (on a shirt) with a distinctly noticeable sillage - at arm's length.

In my opinion, this fragrance is neither particularly green nor metallic, nor does it smell like ""almost only mandarin,"" as stated in other reviews. Sure, Starwalker is fruity and initially does lean somewhat towards Versace's Man Eau Fraîche, but at most 40-50% of its citrus freshness. Because the top notes of Starwalker do not constitute its dominance; rather, wood makes up nearly 2/3 of the fragrance's progression. Primarily, it is a sweet wood scent with a (citrusy)-fruity overlay.

So Starwalker is a bullseye that will surely accompany me for a long time, also because it is a good all-rounder. Perfectly suitable in spring and autumn, especially during the day in the office and leisure time. Because for me, the woody freshness of this wonderful scent is simply

hype-worthy!"
Starwalker,07/20/2019,Mantus,M,487,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,The Relief,"First, one can perceive an intense and powerful refreshing citrus note, which also brings a fine clear, pure-acting sour herbal undertone thanks to the bergamot.

At the same time, the bergamot is accompanied by another citrus note that carries very tender sweet, rather floral traits and conceals a pleasantly warming, bright wooden aura in the background, which I would never have attributed to bamboo.

These two notes are accompanied by a subtle sweet fruity nuance that lends the fragrance a beautiful softness and comes from the mandarin.

A little later, the citrus aura has changed slightly; it has indeed become more typically lemony and has pushed its sour aspects a bit into the background to give way to a fine, smooth wooden nuance that stems from the ginger.

The ginger is accompanied by a beautifully pronounced masculine aromatic note reminiscent of white pepper, which I believe is responsible for the fragrance not drifting into insignificance but truly providing relief in sweltering hot temperatures.

These two notes are accompanied by a pleasant ethereal, almost aquatic, softly perceived shower gel association that surprisingly fits wonderfully with this scent, and I also would not have thought of pine resin here.

In the far background, and only detectable on my skin, there is a lovely nuance that feels warm on the skin, carrying a very subtle sweet spicy hint, which is thanks to the amber.

In the last 3 hours, I cannot detect any of the aforementioned notes, but only:

Balloon!

This balloon is not fully inflated yet, but only halfway, and do I find that bad? - No - It's just something different, and I find that extremely pleasant and yet interesting :-)

You wonder if I have inhaled the helium from the balloon? - But of course! :-)

No, seriously now, the ""balloon accord"" becomes pleasantly soft woody and subtly bitter, where I can very well imagine that this comes from the sandalwood in conjunction with the vetiver, though I would have never thought of these two notes, I would rather have leaned towards vetiver.

Unfortunately, I could not perceive musk, but I can very well imagine that this note was used for complementation.

Overall, the fragrance lasts 7 hours on my skin.

The sillage is designed from the beginning to be clearly noticeable at half an arm's length, and this is maintained for 2.5 hours before it gradually diminishes until the fragrance fades away.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to our Parfumo ""Honk1510"" for the decanting."
Starwalker,12/15/2013,FabianO,M,1008,,5,Invigorating metallic coolness...,"...and stylistically positioned somewhere between ""L'Eau d'Issey"" and ""Luna Rossa"", although clearly ""brighter"" than the former.

""Starwalker"" comes across quite pleasingly, the opening is energetic, fitting well with spring and would accompany the weeks nicely when the last snow disappears and the first longer sunny days arrive.
The well-perceptible, soft musk aroma is noticeable quite early and is well integrated.

A slightly metallic touch gives the whole composition a minty feel, contributing to the vital aspect. However, I always have a bit of trouble with this, as such fragrances seem somewhat distant to me.
So, ""Starwalker"" is definitely nice, it seems more interesting than ""Luna Rossa"", although it tries to please quite a few tastes, which clearly results in a lack of individuality and edges."
Starwalker,05/31/2017,Minigolf,F,2512,,9,Mountain Stream in the Coniferous Forest,"OOOCH, some might think, Another forest again. Yes, that's right. But this time it's a different forest. In the mountains. And with a rushing stream.
A pleasant coolness envelops me, the crystal-clear water bubbles and hops over sticks and stones, gurgling and murmuring silvery to itself.
A hint of the south lingers in the air. Bergamot, ice-cold, citrus, and a grassy note.
I am still in a meadow landscape, the forest lies ahead of me.
I dive into the shady green world, surrounded by tall fir trees. Like small speckles, sunlight penetrates the treetops and dapples the path before me. Spicy air surrounds me, it smells almost ""metallic"" and cool. (Could it be due to the ginger included?) and very woody-needled. Once I stop to quench my thirst at the stream. The water is cold, and I have to drink slowly. It refreshes immensely and gives me new strength to continue hiking. The stream accompanies me for a long time through the forest. Until evening falls, and the stars twinkle.
Why ""Starwalker"" is no longer produced is a mystery to me.
It has a rather long-lasting, pleasant scent for me, and I use it when my nose needs a break from complex perfumes."

There is no one there to disturb him, no one who wants anything from him. All he desires and what enriches his life is her, the little beautiful rose, which he guards like a treasure.

Lost in thought, he lies on his back, looking towards the sky and gazing at the starry sky. He counts them as he dreams away and wonders how long they have been there and who placed them there. They illuminate his face like lights and cast shadows on his planet. He feels so free up here, away from all the tragedy and heaviness of life. Down on Earth, it is hectic and restless, but he is unaware of it.

The next day, riding on a shooting star, he flies through the familiar universe to discover unknown corners
But he realizes that he prefers to be at home, dreaming, caressing, and cherishing his rose, the light life indeed, the life as it should be, he chooses
Yes, he is a true connoisseur, a star walker and daydreamer, that blond-haired prince, one who does not have to grow up at all costs. And it is this way of life that I think of when I hear ""Starwalker."" A fragrance - similar to ""Dreamer"" by Versace - that awakens eternal dreamy youth. A scent that transports you to fantasy worlds and makes you forget all heaviness. Yes, it exudes such lightness that it carries you and reminds you of the little prince gliding on a shooting star. It doesn’t take much, just a bit of bergamot, cedar, and bamboo, and we have a light fresh-woody mixture of infinite delicacy and purity. Completely straightforward and a gentle, albeit pleasantly potent, companion through the heaviness of time.

So, for those who like to dream and, it must be admitted, still want to smell damn good and pleasantly masculine, this is the right choice. You get a lot for a small price and are well-equipped for spring and autumn.

Be like the little prince, remain a child at heart, enjoy your current mini-planets, look to the sky, dream, and take care of your roses.

May the stars be favorable to you like to the little prince and invite you to the imaginary star run. I've been caught, I need this.

See you soon,
Bene and the little prince**"

Legend,12/23/2023,Stacia,F,134,,9,This is what mainstream cologne smells like,"I used to work with a young man who wore Legend. He was a financial planner who drove a mid-sized sedan, wore polo shirts on his day off, played tennis and golf and had client lunches with retired rich people. If you know that guy, you know what Legend smells like. Unoriginal, mainstream, devoid of unique personality, but ""likable""."
Legend,03/16/2022,GeorgeReid,M,37,,7,The Pen Maker is Behind a Solid Office Scent.,"One day, my best friend mentioned she loved a fragrance from Ulta and thought it would be an excellent addition to the collection of affordable fragrances.

When she told me the fragrance was Montblanc Legend, I decided to purchase it and give my thoughts.

----

Montblanc Legend starts with a citrusy aroma with bergamot and lemon, with a hint of freshness that comes from lavender. After a moment, the heart of the fragrance reveals itself with light florals. The florals complement the opening that extends the freshness, but keep the fragrance light.

The woods, tonka bean, and (possibly) oakmoss give Legend a firm base that adds a warm and confident feel, without being overly sweet.

Notably, it does smell similar to Abercromie and Fitch's Fierce, which was prevalent in American malls in the 2000s. This can be nostalgic, or off-putting.

----

In terms of performance, Legend is solid as an eau de toilette.

As I say in other reviews with similar projection and sillage, Legend will not announce your presence as you enter a room. However, the fragrance may get a person to turn their head as you walk by them, or they walk by you.

The longevity of this fragrance is anywhere from six to eight hours on skin. It should last for an entire workday or a night out—but likely not both without a respray.

----

Legend is an uncomplicated fragrance that is easy to wear in any social situation, whether it is at the gym, out on a date, or as a daily fragrance.

It is also easy to wear in all seasons, but Legend works the best in the comfortable temperatures of spring and autumn, and to a lesser extent, summer. It is weakest in the winter but has enough strength to push through the cold air.

For a fragrance that costs less than $40.00 for a 100 ml bottle, Legend provides amazing versatility.

That said, Legend shines the most as a fragrance in the office, as the notes combine for a fresh professional smell that is not offensive.

----

Legend is not a fragrance for someone looking for artistry or complexity. In addition, the fragrance may not mesh well with teens, or anyone that dislikes Fierce from the 2000s.

However, for someone looking for an affordable daily fragrance that works in multiple situations, Legend is a viable option."
Legend,09/18/2015,Omid2am,M,25,,2,pineapple !,"Fruity and aquatic , fresh and clean although a little old and common .The sillage is good in the summer. i had 2 bottle of it and three different woman asked me about my perfume . women like it :)"
Legend,02/28/2020,HubertG,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,I'm confused.,"I must say that I bought Legend by Montblanc because of the price, it was quite affordable (coffret with shower gel about 45€ for the 50ml bottle), I was tempted to buy it after trying it in 1 min or so. I have the highest respect for the Montblanc brand, and I was a happy owner of a Legend Night bottle. This one has nothing to do with the Night version.
The opening is very energetic, you receive a lot of fresh citrus and a bit of lavender (which I love) like a punch in the face. Vibrant head notes.
According to me, the problem with this scent is the heart, I think the floral notes are a mess, they' re confused, you don't get them clearly, the don't complete each other very well (rose and jasmine as described cause I don't get them), there is a woody note but I don't get the white cedar.
The base remains fresh, maybe the evernyl that I don't know that much. is a bit green, maybe too green, I was expecting much more warmth. The longevity is about 5-6 hours. Not that bad. Everyday scent, not too expensive. Not a first option in that ""genre"", try it out before buying. Good average fragrance. Nothing else. Not a ""Legend"" at all."
Legend,10/05/2016,MasterLi,M,376,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,"An awesome opening, and an overall nice scent.","I did like this one. It reminded me of how much I like fruit done right in a fragrance. It reminds me a little of Aventus by Creed but only in the initial opening. I don't find this fragrance controversial or offensive at all. In fact I think that anyone and everyone would like this.

I like the apple and pineapple aspects, and the lavender mid and the woody base. Yes it's been done before in other male-marketed fragrances, but it's still a really nice fragrance. I would personally wear it. It's great, it works for almost any occasion, and is inoffensive and interesting enough for people to notice and be intrigued. This has been my first time trying a fragrance from Mont Blanc and personally I think it's a good one."

A fruity fragrance with nuances of lavender and floral notes at the base. The fruity patch reminds me Aventus a bit. But not that translucent, Legend is dust-covered a little. You may not get enough compliment, buy you never gain any negative neither. It's a safe fragrance you can wear everywhere. But don't try to expose..."
Legend,08/05/2021,Stamatios,M,15,,1,No legend,"I have to admit that I like this brand but I don't like to judge a book by its cover. Unfortunately here I can't see any legend or a hero. Legendary are the ink pens of this brand,but this send...I had higher expectations from him.It's a common fresh-citrus blend,rather synthetic and linear without own character or some clear notes.There are many intresting notes but the blend is not very well balanced and induce confusion in my nose.Performance is also average.To be fair,I will add that I had tested him many years ago and I admit that I liked him more.But now?May be a reformulation?
As I also tested twice a few days ago the Legend Intense,my opinion is that there is a big similarity between these scents but Legend Intense is more enjoyable,better balanced with nice drydown and better performance.So try before you order."
Legend,08/15/2025,Ronin47,M,47,,1,A little generic...ugh...,"Yeah I feel like this is a very generic drug store scent, because it is.

It's also very sweet and can get cloying. Sometimes I get a Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male Elixir vibe because of that sweet mintiness. I very much prefer the latter though.

Other than that, this scent lacks character and uniqueness. It smells like a combination of many other popular designer male colognes.

I can strongly advise you to get other offerings like Allure Homme Sport because this is just too mainstream."
Legend,12/17/2019,Oldish2002,M,128,,1,Your typical everyday manly scent,"I received this cologne as a gift. At first, while I was unwrapping the present, I saw the Montblanc Logo and I was like “Please, be Explorer for God’s Sake”. But it wasn’t.
As for the fragrance, It’s average for me. Average doesn’t translate into bad by any means.
I gave it a few tries and got a compliment like “you smell so fresh today”. But I am not the guy that wears anything for compliments, I would rather wear something that will get me no compliments but give me a good feeling while wearing it. (Something to give me confidence or to put me insantly in a good mood).
It’s not an expensive cologne.
I see it as a grown & mature man’ s fragrance.
30+ And up. It smells very fresh and manly just like and old aftershave would smell.
It can be a great fragrance for the right person. I mean you can’t go wrong with it as a gift for your father or your uncle.
Performance? 4-6 hours for me on the skin with moderate projection in the first hour and much more on the clothes. I mean you can leave your coat in the hanger when you arrive at the office and after the work day when you’ll put your coat on again you can still feel some of the frag going on but way more lightly. Conclusion : Average but still good for the right person.

Overall rating : 6.5 /10"
Legend,08/14/2025,GMC07,M,2,,1,A bottle of nothingness,"This fragrance is a mystery for me.
When I was younger, I had this same exact perfume, and it smelled okay, kind of deodorant-ish, but it was usable, and it lasted for a reasonable amount of time on my skin.
I recently found a closed bottle of Montblanc Legend at my dad's house, stored perfectly, and it has little to no smell and the longevity is null. To test if it wasn't just out of date, I went to a perfume shop, to test it out. The results were the same. Little to no smell and bad longevity.
Safe to say, once, or even if this bottle ends, I will not buy Montblanc Legend again.
I'd much more recommend Montblanc Legend Blue to whoever wants to buy this, because it has a very similar smell, while projecting it more."
Legend,10/21/2025,DesertTartan,M,84,,1,Review - Mont Blanc Legend,It has a similar profile to Vision by Ajmal. It’s fresh citrus with tops of bergamot and a hint of lavender. The heart cannot be defined as the tops take complete control but it’s supposed to be composed of jasmine. The base is make up of Tonia bean and sandalwood - which I really like. All in all it’s a fresh masculine scent that can be worn at work and in the evening.
Legend,05/06/2016,loewenherz,M,916,,54,"'I hope you're well insured, baby - with the dent you just made in my pants!'","I recently heard a young gentleman (heavily tattooed, lots of gel, rhinestones on a shirt that was a bit too tight) say to a young lady (not quite as heavily tattooed, gel nails, rhinestones on a pair of jeans that were clearly too tight) while riding the subway. Two stops later, he had her number (on the other hand, probably: who doesn’t?), and they got off together - the friend she was actually with, annoyed, two steps behind. And I felt like someone who had just watched meerkats mating at the zoo - or something else with a fully archaic fascination, where you can’t look away or look anywhere else.

I then imagined how that young gentleman got ready at home half an hour earlier (after first going to Media Markt and then 'working out' and afterwards having a 'hardcore battle' with a buddy in front of the Xbox or a similar device). First, a delicious protein shake, then a shower, then sixteen sprays of Legend on his tattooed chest and into the tight rhinestone shirt. Suck in the belly, phone, cigarettes, wallet - another four sprays of Legend (you can hardly smell anything anymore) - daring killer wink, gun gestures with both hands towards the reflection - yeah, tonight’s going to be something!

He is a loud fragrance, Montblanc's Legend, confidently strutting with its exuberant-juvenile sexiness. A fun scent meant to impress others and signal vitality - and availability. It does this with the full force of citrus and oak moss (or something very similar) and a lowered metallic component in its top note, which has to achieve everything that Legend is supposed to achieve on its own, as the heart and base notes noticeably drop in performance. In its character shamelessly reminiscent of Abercrombie & Fitch's Fierce, it is transparent and little surprising - but it apparently works...

Conclusion: I would have liked to believe that after the insurance dent line, nothing more could come. But: 'Nice legs - when did they open?'"
Legend,12/25/2018,Adan,M,52,,29,It's gonna be legen... wait for it...,"I must admit Montblanc Legend is - the longer I engage with it - more interesting than I initially thought. Montblanc Legend is a ""Fierce"" scent, a copy of Abercrombie's ""Fierce"".
Many years ago, a Dior representative stood in the Kurfürstenparfümerie, it must have been around 2011 or 2012, a time when I still had a great love for Creed's ""Green Irish Tweed"" and ""Cool Water"" (and the love for Cool Water is back). He said that ""Fierce"" by Abercrombie was now the ""new generation"" of these fragrances, a statement I only understand today as I smell Montblanc's Legend.
First: I have actually never smelled ""Fierce"" by Abercrombie, but I am sure I know what to expect; there are many fragrances that can be compared to it:
Montblanc Legend, Le Beau Male by Jean Paul Gaultier, Dior Homme Eau for Men, even the Axe Apollo body spray and shower gel, all these scents have a certain opening that I would describe as a ""deodorant spray"" accord.
If you take a closer sniff of Legend a few minutes later, you can smell an element that somehow reminds you of black ink, quite exactly like the black ink you can buy from Montblanc for their fountain pens. And if you take another closer sniff, you can smell ""Cool Water quotes"". However, Montblanc Legend does not turn out to be as fresh and aquatic as Cool Water, but rather a bit sweeter. If you leave Montblanc Legend on your skin longer or let it sit on a paper strip overnight, you can also smell Ambroxan here (for reference, think of ""Molecule 02"" by Escentric Molecules). Ambroxan at a very pleasant level, which was later turned up much louder in Dior's ""Sauvage"".

Legend is therefore indeed an interesting scent for me, as you can somewhat trace the development of the ""Fougere"" genre over the last 30 years:
In the beginning, there was Cool Water / Green Irish Tweed, then came Fierce / Montblanc Legend, followed by scents like Bleu de Chanel and Sauvage by Dior. And Aventus by Creed moves somewhere in between, between a very classic base like that found in Cool Water, but moving away from the aquatic to the smoky-leathery.
All these fragrances are very successful in their own right, and for each of these scents, there are several accounts that they are very well received by women.

I must conclude by saying that Montblanc Legend is nothing special to me in terms of perfume as art, but the craftsmanship, the composition behind this scent is indeed very solid, and the quality you get for the twenty bucks you have to shell out online is truly excellent.
What I have also dared to do with this scent is: layering with Dior Homme. When you layer Dior Homme and Montblanc Legend, you end up quite close to Dior Homme Eau for Men, but somehow better.

...dary."
Legend,12/25/2018,3lbows,M,66,,23,NOT bad.,"After the statement and comment reply, I must still break a lance for the legend. Because although the fragrance establishment accuses it of having a shower gel synthetic quality and it fails to shine in any evaluation category, I find it truly successful as a representative of its fragrance direction.
After experiencing the Fierce DNA for the first time in 2002 at a Kohl's supermarket in Denver - back then as parfum-averse as a cold sock - I have been searching for a summer scent that plays this tune for quite a while. Initially, because I wasn't willing to spend so much money on a fragrance in the USA, and back in the old world, because it was hardly available here.
A decade later, I stumbled upon it at Müller: a black, heavy bottle with a small but well-dispersing sprayer and a plastic cap with a satisfying click. Still no ambitions in the hobby that would catch up with me nearly a decade later, just tried it out, but immediately recognized: this other, NOT shower gel-like fruitiness (my shower gel was called Cliff), this NOT aquatic warmth, this, at least initially NOT sweet seductiveness (I'm open to suitable, existing synonyms), that was Fierce! How cheeky! Clearly the same scent! NOT! Because what Legend lacked was the performance, the endurance, the projection, the presence. Regardless, I bought it anyway, and I was happy, as I finally had my perfume. And believe me, among non-perfume junkies, it is well received and has enormous recognition value.
As I said, a few years later PARFUMO came along, and alongside many new experiences, an original bottle of Fierce arrived at my home. Directly from relatives in the USA, as one fears counterfeits. But what was that? Top note: Check. But Legend still holds its own here. Fierce: Fruitier, broader, even a bit orangey (?). Legend: The slim pineapple suits it well, makes it cooler, declutters the DNA, and gives it more freshness, although Legend appears more restrained but also more mature than Fierce. Heart note: Check. Legend and Fierce are equal here in my opinion. In the base, Legend becomes warmer and more conciliatory with the tonka, but remains fresh and summer-appropriate due to its metallic, almost pencil-like foundation, whereas Fierce doesn't develop much but simply fades away. BUT. In the reformulation (black cap), Fierce is nowhere near as long-lasting as it used to be. It doesn't even play in the same league anymore, perhaps because the dosage of oak moss has fallen victim to newer regulations?
Be that as it may, Legend is just as enduring, but at the same time lighter and more multifaceted, although it does indeed come off as a bit more synthetic.
So I sold Fierce again, and now I've sprayed down Legend to 10ml.
But the fragrance journey is not over yet. The DNA fascinates me so much, and apart from Aventus (and Fierce 2002), no summer scent has really blown me away so far.
Thus, the search for Legend (Fierce?) alternatives began: Platinum Egoiste? Too much suit, too little summer-appropriate. Tous Man Intense? Affordable and longer-lasting, but even heavier than Egoiste (and even more orangey than Fierce). Just Cavalli Him? I like it, nice de-fruity top note (paprika), but it doesn't last. Legend Intense? See Tous Man. 701 from the notorious German fragrance copier? Like all the fragrances offered there, only 128 mBit (you know what I mean).
Aside from Legend, only Police with To be - the Illusionist has provided me with a worthy alternative so far. However, that one is too close to the reformulated Fierce, and thus I can give it an unrestricted purchase recommendation for its target audience.
That leaves me with the Aviator from Paris Bleu, but I don't have high hopes (and at the moment, it seems that, although inexpensive, it's not so easy to obtain).
Therefore: Legend does what it does definitely right. It enriches the Fierce DNA in a more mature direction, making it office-appropriate and not easily replaceable for me as an over-40 year-round fragrance.
So the search goes on, as so often..."
Legend,08/08/2017,Basti87,M,1062,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Not a legend but a solid everyday scent,"Montblanc's Legend has been in my collection for 1-2 years. It started with Individuel and several fragrances from this brand followed, with a few still on my wishlist. The price-performance ratio of this brand is simply more than fair. Especially since these affordable fragrances all come with good performance. This one too.

The Montblanc Legend Intense performs significantly better than this one. I haven't tested the Intense version yet, but if it's a similar scent with better performance, the high ratings are justified. Since it really is just a nice alternative for everyday wear, I don't necessarily need to test it.
Legend is clearly a Fierce double. Right after spraying, the Fierce DNA hits you. For me, however, it's not a direct copy, but it definitely has its own character.
Fierce has also been in my collection for many years. I bought it blind for a lot of money back then. After all the praise for this scent, I was slightly disappointed. Especially for the high price. Even though Fierce is very crowd-pleasing, it's not particularly special to me. This Legend is also not the super scent that I'm mega excited about, but it serves its purpose: an affordable everyday fragrance that could also appeal to many women thanks to the Fierce DNA. There are still some differences from Fierce. While Fierce is a smooth scent without many edges, I find this one to be much more robust and masculine. The herb-fruity pineapple comes through very well here. A bit of tonka bean also adds a slight sweetness, although this scent is rather herb-fresh. The synthetics that some have negatively commented on are, in my opinion, quite limited. Definitely not significantly more than with Fierce.
For me, it's a great year-round scent with decent performance at a fair price. It lasts for several hours with decent sillage. Top.
It beats the outrageously overpriced Fierce with its poor price-performance ratio and inadequate performance. However, it might be better to test the Intense version, which is really well-received here."
Legend,07/23/2022,Zacharias,M,30,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,"Did someone say ""Montblanc""?","It’s like a dream.
There’s this scent on me.
A mild, serious, yet elegant fragrance.
I’m sitting in an office. An extremely upscale office. Men in suits with Boss ties and women in suits with Hermès silk scarves flank a huge black conference table.
Leather briefcases with a glacier logo on the clasp sit next to the chairs. A clattering and tapping sound emerges as agendas and conference folders are pulled out. All with glacier logos on the closure clips.
The boss pulls out his ballpoint pen. Black with silver fittings. And a white glacier logo on the cap. Meanwhile, the refills of Starwalkers glide over the augmented papers.
Am I trapped in a Montblanc ecosystem?, is my thought.
My last thought, until a shrill ringing at the door jolts me out of my daydream.
Here I am now. At work. But not in a consulting firm, let alone at a teak wood table.
And as I get up to open the door for the next appointment, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I catch a whiff of a fragrance on my wrist.
Montblanc Legend. So that’s where all these associations in my daydream come from.

Montblanc Legend is a fragrance that perfectly fits into the Montblanc ecosystem character-wise. A business scent par excellence. For anyone already familiar with the Montblanc brand, it’s a must-buy. Regardless of whether you encounter Boss ties or Hermès silk scarves in the halls of your company."
Legend,05/26/2017,Taurus,M,1164,,6,Between Legend and Misery,"Fierce by Abercrombie & Fitch is a scent that I actually find quite okay. It sneaks into my nose whenever I walk past their flagship store in Düsseldorf and the perfume cloud blown out from it wafts towards me. At least I can appreciate it, and if I were a few decent years younger, it might find its way into my collection.

However, I see very little resemblance to Legend by Montblanc. On the contrary: while Fierce can still show a certain finesse, Legend is rather boring for me, including disappointingly harsh synthetic notes in the truest sense of the word.

The pineapple is a shy joke without a punchline, and the rest is more readable from the pyramid than something you can seriously filter out olfactorily. The only thing that seems natural here is the reflex to immediately think of shower gel. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a flaw, but here it comes off as neither high-quality nor creative, but rather something that has been sniffed a thousand times.

At least the puristic bottle with its elegantly adorned cap stands out positively here. While it’s not legendary yet, it’s a successful approach that couldn’t be continued in terms of content."
Legend,04/14/2021,Mapete12,M,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Alter Batch - Super S/H,"The scent is very similar to the Hollister fragrance from those stores, so it should be familiar to most people. I can rate the longevity and sillage as really good. After 3 sprays on the skin, the scent still fills the room for a solid 6 hours.
All in all, a good recommendation."
Legend,08/19/2017,Grigaut,M,20,,3,It's for Other People,"I find Legend to be a very, very pleasant all-round fragrance, suitable for casual outfits and any occasion. I won't go into the individual nuances, the scent progression, or longevity, as all of that has already been extensively covered in other statements about this fragrance creation.
Personally, there are certainly many other, more appealing scents for me,
but, ........ there must be something very special in the ingredient composition
of Legend that seems to resonate more with others than with me.
The fact is, with no other fragrance have I received compliments from the (female) environment as frequently and positively as with the scent experience of Legend. I find that unfortunate, as I usually wear fragrances for myself and not for others."
Legend,08/15/2011,Skylab,M,184,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,From Tradition to Innovation,"If I am suggesting this fragrance, then it is only right to test and evaluate it:

Montblanc's new men's fragrance ""Legend"" seems to be so new and rare that even the company's own website does not list it!

In general, the search for scents from the venerable, 1906-established manufactory based in Hamburg is somewhat difficult - on one hand, many fragrance shops only have a handful of Montblanc perfumes on their shelves or have banished them entirely from their assortment.

The turquoise giant probably wanted to fill this gap and has seemingly reintroduced the majority of the fragrance line (again) into its program, adorned with the title ""New"" - yet ""Starwalker"" is 6 years old and ""Présence Homme"" is even 10 years old! The last men's fragrance ""Homme Exceptionnel,"" which has not crossed my path until now, was launched in 2008.

I was able to sniff the ""New"" for the first time in Venice, after I had not been able to find it in Germany until then. Even the Montblanc store in Salzburg did not carry it, nor its siblings at all.

The bottle presents itself, contrary to all glass clarity, mysterious and dark - yet noble and timelessly elegant!
The in-house design team designed and developed the fragrance container, which, with its deep black glass, resembles an elegant fountain pen with a glossy finish.

With the embossed, relief-like, iconic trademark, the star, the bottle emphasizes its family affiliation and is a tribute to the legendary masterpiece ""149.""
Rarely has a bottle been designed so personally and brand-specifically.
This can also be seen as a noble flask.

As grand as the bottle is, the initial perception of the fragrance is rather strange, which falls into the ""Fougére"" group:

It starts with a rather synthetic, citrus-like opening note for me.
I cannot recognize lavender here, and pineapple is only to be guessed.

This rather harsh entry feels fresh and green - I associate this scent with a fresh shave and a refreshing aftershave.

For me, the further development of the fragrance is very linear and does not make any big leaps.
Typical wood accents join in and form a solid conclusion.
Everything feels very calm and well-coordinated.

Longevity is average at 5 hours, mediocre.

For me, ""Legend"" does not represent a fragrance revolution, but offers an interesting, yet not necessarily essential alternative in the current mainstream fragrance cosmos.

For the black-and-white campaign shot by Peter Lindbergh, the Brit Simon Clark was chosen. He embodies the perfect male type and showcases the elegance that Legend is supposed to exude with his turtleneck sweater and strong hair blowing in the wind…"
Legend,02/20/2022,Philipp91,M,219,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"For me rather fresh, spicy, and herbal","I first owned Montblanc Legend Spirit and think it's great (a mix of Invictus Aqua). Now I also have Montblanc Legend here. Many say it is a fragrance twin of Abercrombie & Fitch's Fierce. I can't judge that, as I unfortunately have never owned or smelled it. However, I can attest that Montblanc Legend has a distinct similarity to Emporio Armani's He/Pour Lui. By the way, I also really like that one.

Legend starts off fresh, slightly citrusy, and somehow herbal due to the lavender. Then woods come in, but it remains fresh and herbal. The rose and tonka bean, in my opinion, are hardly noticeable, if at all. Not even at the end. For me, Legend is an all-rounder, versatile in use. One smells clean, masculine, well-groomed, almost freshly shaved. It has that slight shaving foam and aftershave vibe, but not Eau Sauvage like in your face.

The longevity is a good 4 to 5 hours, the sillage is not overly strong, but one will be noticed in the first 2 to 3 hours. For me, Legend is finally a more potent alternative to my beloved Emporio Armani He/Pour Lui, whose longevity and sillage are a complete disaster. Fruity, as mentioned above, it is not for me, but rather fine, spicy, fresh, and herbal. Wearable in any season, for any occasion."
Legend,02/17/2023,Nerudah,M,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,A Fierce Platinum Legend,"After Dylan Blue, I must advocate for another popular fragrance that receives quite a bit of hate from niche wearers who find it reminiscent of fecal oud, yet is perceived as very pleasant by 98% of the population.

The DNA is the same as Fierce or Percival, making it a younger version of Chanel's Platinum Égoïste and, in my opinion, a timeless classic.

When there was an Abercrombie & Fitch in every major shopping mall, where this fragrance was sprayed, it was probably smelled a bit too often.

Nowadays, it represents for me the archetype of a young, masculine cologne or barbershop/fougère scent.

Well... and now also in the field of fragrances. Montblanc has a name, and the price-performance ratio is more than good. The scent is really well received by women and is, for me, a must-have among fragrances, due to the price and the good image.

Legend,01/27/2016,Honk1510,M,30,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Kai Pflaume vs Anna Nass,"...yes, that’s what I first thought of with this scent :-)
I mainly smell plum and pineapple mixed with a hint of
Diors Fahrenheit. Sounds strange, but that’s how it is for me.
I find the scent better day by day. One should take some time
for Legend, as it is different from fragrances one usually knows..
But no other fragrance boosts confidence like Legend. I have no
idea why that is, especially since in my opinion there are far ""better"" scents.
But that’s just how it is for me. With Legend, I feel good :-))

I can’t say anything about the comparison with Fierce, as I don’t know it and
would never have thought of bringing such a juvenile (sorry)
bottle into my home :-D

Bottle: Really great! Heavy glass + metal cap
Longevity: 8h +
Sillage: Not room-filling, but okay...

Let's get ready to rumble..."
Legend,07/30/2012,Leimbacher,M,2870,,7,Is it well copied?,"Rarely have I smelled such a blatant knockoff - it smells exactly like the almost 10-year older, infamous Fierce by A&F.

The bottle is dull, the idea of copying a good fragrance is too, the sillage and longevity are quite strong, just like Fierce.
The scent is still top-notch, very fresh, fruity & quite synthetic, but this is nothing more than a cheaper alternative.

It's a pity, Mont Blanc can definitely do better, as their masterpiece Individuel proves. There, they were famously inspired by Creed's Original Santal, whether intentionally or not is actually irrelevant, they copied...
Perfumers & luxury brands: don't copy, forge new paths!"
Legend,11/07/2018,Farneon,M,112,,3,"I don't know what to make of this ""Legend""","Well, I don't know the much-praised ""Fierce,"" and I intend to keep it that way if ""Legend"" is supposed to be its scent twin. Alleged womanizer or not: I own three wonderful Montblanc fragrances with ""Individuel,"" ""Starwalker,"" and ""Présence,"" all of which have their own character, ranging from fruity to fresh to sweet... Unfortunately, ""Legend"" makes an exception for me and is - as so often - proof that the cliché ""If you know one, you know them all"" rarely applies in the world of fragrances.

I find ""Legend"" quite intrusive, without being able to particularly distinguish any scent note. For me, a synthetic, glaringly fresh fruit overshadows everything else. It may be a pineapple extract, but it could also be anything else. Underneath, subtly greenish and sweet notes shake hands. This endeavor may be well-intentioned, as it somehow seems like a bridge between old and young, classic and trendy, work and leisure... Only, in my eyes, it unfortunately hasn't succeeded.

I simply can't connect anything with ""Legend,"" neither the day at the office nor the cozy corner of the sofa, neither a wild night out nor activities in nature, neither a rainy city day nor the sunny sandy beach on vacation. Nothing really fits this olfactory overall picture for me. Therefore, ""Legend"" simply represents nothing for me, but costs me nerves with every spray. You can't ""make something smell nice"" that you don't like. Hence, ""Legend"" unfortunately remains a directionless and far too shrill scent mush for me."
Legend,03/17/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,5,Unnecessary Fresh Fragrance with Annoying Synthetic Note,"Once again, a fresh scent from the annoying ""Hugo"" category.

The opening is reminiscent of a pineapple cocktail, not really something you can call natural. The pineapple comes across as quite sharp, making it penetrating. Litsea cubeba, an Asian, lemongrass-like essential oil, doesn't improve the situation, rather it adds to the sharpness.

The overall arrangement is annoyingly fresh, synthetic, and overloaded, comparable to ""Hugo."" Lavender struggles against this lab-like note but barely makes an impact.

Even the mossy heart and base phases are overshadowed by the surprisingly long-lasting annoying tones from the opening. Even after more than an hour, the unpleasantly sharp and piercing artificial pineapple-lemongrass mixture prevails. Friendly is different.

Only the tonka bean takes a bit of the edge off with softer, creamier nuances.

Far from a great success and truly one of the weakest men's fragrances that Montblanc has released so far. Legends look different."

Sorry, but this is legendary boredom: A sweet-citrusy note, incredibly unoriginal, quite artificial, cheap in its impression, and ultimately completely insignificant. I have pens from Montblanc, and with them, every application, every curve in the shape, every detail feels carefully and consistently thought out. Why would such a company then release a fragrance that seems so passionlessly cobbled together? In such cases, the marketing department should actually be up in arms - to prevent the scent of this loveless execution from potentially sticking to the brand name and thus to the other products. Unfortunately, this is not the only example of luxury manufacturers who are completely off the mark olfactorily outside their actual terrain... Jaguar and Porsche Design are also quite good in this race."

Legend,03/09/2023,Mindstrobe,M,5,,5,Great but Overloaded All-Rounder,"The scent has been with me for a long time. Whether as Abercrombie Fierce or later from Montblanc.
(For simplicity, I consider both fragrances the same here; the nuances don't matter)

After I smelled Legend for the first time at a friend's place, I had to buy it that very day. So much nostalgia for little money. Since then, it has been sitting in the drawer. It feels too young, too ""masculine,"" too Abercrombie, too loaded with memories. Too many associations with awkward teenage years are tied to it. I'm sure many others feel the same way. I don't want to trigger those associations. It would almost be embarrassing for me. Still, I always enjoy smelling it on others. Even if I involuntarily make a bit of fun of it.

A&F Fierce was my only perfume for a long time after its release as a teenager. Compliments poured in, but I remember always feeling a bit out of place with the scent. Even back then, it felt too 'dominantly masculine' for school life. Over 10 years later, with sensory training, more social intelligence, and insight into the world of fragrances, I can confirm that feeling.

But Legend/Fierce is actually a very nice scent. Also for adults. Wearable year-round, more suited for fancier days and outfits, with the leather jacket. Women* love it.

I just can't get my 15-year-old self out of my head."
Legend,03/12/2014,Chico,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,My First,"Before I get to my comment, I must say that I am completely new to the perfume junkies and what does one look for at 18 years old? Of course! A ladykiller scent that you don’t smell on every street corner like our well-known 1 Million or Le Male.

After weeks of research for a seductive fragrance that would linger in the minds of women, I concluded to buy A&F's Fierce. Since this scent is unfortunately not available in any Douglas, I continued my search and lo and behold - I found its twin.

According to the comments, my expectations were set very high since Fierce is such a popular fragrance and this one is said to have a very strong resemblance.

So I made my way to the nearest Douglas. I tried to evaluate the scent as objectively as possible and didn’t think about the bottle or the copy of Fierce; I just wanted to know how it smells. I gave Legend 30 minutes to develop and took my first sniff of my strip. Well, what can I say? To be honest, I am disappointed. It’s not a bad scent, but also not one that really blows you away, and with 70% I think I’m still being quite generous. You can smell a woody note that doesn’t make the fragrance feel very feminine. Then there’s a bit of citrus and a hint of a spice stand - that’s it.
Nothing bad, but nothing special. I finally got confirmation from 4 colleagues, including 2 girls who felt the same way I did.

I can only hope that the highly praised Fierce actually has some scent, otherwise I’ll stick with my Sculpture, which has been loyal to me for months and has never let me down in any situation."

Legend,06/09/2024,Rene878,M,7,,3,My Favorite Scent - for about 5 years.,"For me, nothing really comes close to this authentic freshness with depth.

Montblanc strikes the right balance here between ""clean"" aka laundry/fabric softener and citrusy freshness with masculine sandalwood as the foundation.

In the first few years, I was simply blown away; I always felt completely empowered and confident, yet at the same time unique and special. I get almost sentimental when I think of all the travels and experiences where this scent accompanied me.

At some point, you just want something new, but I have absolutely nothing to criticize about this fragrance. The longevity is very good, and even on long nights, my shirt still smelled ""legendary"" when going to bed. A little bit more complexity might have brought me to 7 years of favorite scent, but otherwise, everything is perfect.
The bottle is also of high quality; I really like the design of a flask, silver and black fit the ""legend theme,"" and it has fallen a few times, with only a small dent appearing after years. The spray also works great.

So all in all, one of my best recommendations. If you want something fresh but not standard - go for it!"
Legend,04/29/2024,MackMan,M,24,,3,Allrounder,"I really like the scent. That's why I also see a lot of similarity to Percival - just in a designer style and not as intense.

You can find differences in my review of Percival.

Regarding ""Legend"": fresh, green, spicy, masculine.
Contrary to what some say here, this scent is absolutely not for teenagers. It's a very masculine fragrance. It has to suit a mature man.

For me, it's an allrounder. It works anytime. Also perfectly fine for everyday use.
Longevity is good. On some days, I can still smell it after 10 hours. But that's not always the case.

Despite everything - great spicy fresh scent. Not a fragrance bomb, but it doesn't always have to be that way."
Legend,02/21/2014,Flavorite,F,241,,1,Don't Do It,"This is a hot mess! The notes don't indicate the depths of harshness, synthetic over-the-top bitter sweetness and redundancy in this fragrance. ""Hello"" Axe body spray called and they want their formula back!"". My husband got bored in ULTA Beauty while I was enjoying shopping for body scrubs, lotions and potions. Like a skunk spray...I didn't notice the smell until I got back in the car. I had been sampling Fahrenheit and reminiscing on the rich petroleum nutmeg, lavender leather and decadent carnation honeysuckle and Tonka notes and then I smelled what he was wearing. Windows down all the way home in spite of it being 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It was like a slap in the face. Although this fragrance has massive sillage and machismo, it is just a big pineapple express with an unruly funky sticky Tonka syrup note. Loud and linear and just unrefined migraine-inducing chemicals. I would typically expect more from the Montblanc name, but I guess times are hard."
Legend,09/27/2025,RomeoBlue,M,12,,0,Sexy Quickie,"Fruity, synthetic pineapple, artificially zesty lemon, spicy herbal lavender. Throughout the entire scent development, there is a pencil-like, metallic Iso-E-Super note that reminds one of Chanel's Platinum Égoïste. Oakmoss is, of course, also essential. In the heart, the sweet, sticky tea-like fierce note and in the drydown, woody + creamy tonka bean. Voilà! Here comes the bitter-fresh Fierce Pepsi.

I like this synthetic, metallic-seeming, sexy, smooth Confidence Booster, and based on the female reactions, the DNA is still very well received, making it one of the most attractive fragrances in its price range!

Now, let's address the major negative point: the sillage. After 30 minutes, it drops steeply, with a maximum of 45 minutes of effectiveness, which is unfortunately a complete failure. Either you have to constantly reapply it or you just spray it consistently on your clothes. The longevity on the skin, however, can be extended by the number of sprays. In direct comparison to the fruity woodruff Abercrombie Softie, the Legend, fitting its main target group, comes off as the more masculine bad boy."

It's got fruity apple with a woody base. The ladies though, I can tell they like it and i got a compliment first time wearing it. Plus I can tell when women and people get into my space to get a better whiff. This is a great and cool add on to my collection."
Legend,03/13/2023,PedroCabral,M,147,,3,It's ok,"As a connoisseur of this line, I can start by saying that between the EDT and the EDP, the latter is clearly ahead. Even compared to the Emblem, another one I've had, the Legend EDP turns out to stand out.

Pleasant and fresh smell, right on top. The bergamot stands out in an initial phase, but minutes later comes the scent of very smooth leather, with a light but elegant touch of cedar. It doesn't smell like animal leather, far from it, it's almost aromatic. Even the notes of wood are very delicate.

During one day (around 12:00, assuming I applied it the first time before leaving for work at 8:00 am), I had to reapply once more during the afternoon (around 3:00 pm) because at lunch time neither I nor anyone else felt the fragrance (it was close to the skin). But that doesn't surprise me, even though it's an EDP (still way better than EDT).

The projection is reasonable, but if we consider the fact that it is an EDP it leaves something to be desired (in the first hour it's good, but then it's just close to the skin)."
Legend,06/16/2024,Smirky,M,483,,2,"Easy reach, great fragrance for men","Legend is a really nice, generic masculine fragrance that pretty much any guy would like and most people would like smelling on a man. Easy go-to grab for any time of the year, day or night, and for any occasion. Legend doesn't make a statement but that's what makes it so versatile. True EDP performance that doesn't disappoint. Very reasonably priced. Tested from a sample and have a full bottle on order for myself."

A masculine fragrance that is attractive to women and suitable for moderate and spring weather.
The fragrance bottle is elegant as usual in the Legend series."

Legend,06/21/2025,Greatfaults,M,25,,1,An Easy Reach,"Performance: On skin that isn't making contact with clothes or surfaces, you can still get recognizable whiffs after 7-8 hours, but you have to get right up close. Generally, I get 6 hours out of this, with the first hour having a medium to slightly more than medium projection, and then it's a closer bubble for another 2 hours, and then a skin scent for the remaining 3 hours. Surprisingly, not much longer performance on clothes.

Scent: Overall, this smells like shaving cream with a bit more astringency from the oakmoss and leather notes. In the opening it really smells like shaving cream. That specific combo of fresh and ozonic, but with a just a bit of bite hearkens back to barber shop smells, but updated for the 2020s. I don't really get a magnolia note. There might be floral notes, but I have a hard time singling them out. The woody note is also hard to identify because different wood notes smell so different. I'm not sure what ""generic woods"" smells like. Most of what I get is the combo of violet leaf and oakmoss. Many contemporary fragrances don't usually have such a recognizable oakmoss note because of IFRA, but it's definitely recognizable here. As for the leather note, again, hard for me to single out, but I think it becomes much more noticeable after a few hours of drydown. Sometimes oakmoss and leather notes can have similar effects, so hard to tell if this is just the character of the oakmoss changing and the leather isn't overly noticeable, or if the leather is noticeable. The opening is brighter than the drydown, but by and large the drydown smells quite similar to the opening. It opens as a brighter, clean shaving cream, and dries down as a less bright after shave balm-type scent.

Bottle: It's a good bottle. The top black piece is plastic, which is a bit disappointing given the nice heavy metal-over-plastic cap. I kind of don't like that I can't see how much liquid is left, but I respect the blackout aesthetic. Sprayer is very respectable, and the bottle is easy to hold."

It's so good that it's almost ridiculous.
It's so good that it's simply my wife's favorite fragrance.
It's so good, so simple, so clean - so linear. Delicious, fresh, spicy, masculine.
I use this stuff in every situation - and for various occasions.
When meeting friends. In the office.

And just now, I'm putting on a sweater that hung in my office wardrobe for about two weeks. And the scent is still in there. And so perceptible. This has happened to me once before with the perfume. And I wondered why I hadn't already typed out a review like this to give voice to my enthusiasm, making your mouths water so much that you can't help but create a demand in your mind that screams for the scent! I want percentages! :D

And I'm always - always fresh with it. No matter where.
We often go camping with the rooftop tent, and those of us who know camping sites and bad weather know how good it feels when you come out of the shower in the morning, which is simply a blessing compared to the rough weather and the adversities that you encounter outside much more than in a warm hotel room.

And then you put on the scent and are instantly wrapped in a feel-good cloak of lasting freshness like shower gel and ready for anything! It sounds cheesy, but that's exactly how ridiculously simple the story is. No poetic influence. I love this perfume and will stock up on it royally in the hope that it will never be discontinued."
Legend,06/20/2025,DerScentinel,M,11,,2,Fades Away,"He actually appealed to me during testing after I had been walking around the perfume store for some time and had tested a few.

Fresh, powdery, and simply clean and straightforward. You can't say much more about it... actually.
Well, I got it because I wanted a clean and freshly showered scent. But the title is there for a reason. To me, it smells like a man who has just showered and put on his suit.
Unfortunately, maybe it's due to my skin type, it doesn't project as I had hoped. I need 8-10 sprays for it to be noticeable, and unfortunately, it fades quickly.

The bottle is very simple and comes from the Legend line, except that it is lined in black on the inside and has a very masculine and chic appearance due to the overall black design.
But unfortunately, it will remain the first bottle of the Legend EDP in my collection."
Legend,11/06/2025,Salimidan,M,5,,0,"Abercrombie, Percival and now this","I originally got this fragrance because it is considered a budget-friendly alternative to Parfums de Marley - Percival. And yeah. That's somewhat true. That I wouldn't shell out hundreds of euros for the former is obvious to me. After all, it's ""just"" a fresh, shower gel-like everyday scent, heavily inspired by the legendary A&F Fierce. So really nothing that reinvents the wheel. Still, it just smells good. So if you're looking for an alternative, you quickly find Montblanc. It smells very similar, although a bit spicier and unfortunately also a bit more synthetic.
Longevity and sillage are also not comparable in any way.
Nevertheless, considering the price difference - which is really enormous - one has to ask:
Is it worth it? In my eyes, clearly no. Montblanc Legend serves its purpose as a Fierce substitute almost better, even if it can't reach the quality of the luxury knight."
Explorer Platinum,06/23/2023,Razvanyke,M,215,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Open message to Montblanc,"Montblanc, if you read this .. you must get your thoughts together, the market is flooded enough with uninspired creations like The Phantom - Paco Rabanne, K from D&G or Y from YSL. We know you have the money and the talent to come with awesome products like The Individuel, Signature or Explorer!

Why bring this brand to insignificance with perfumes nobody want and making them more expensive with each launch?

Like many of you, I like when a perfume house offers value for money and for many years I was under the impression that Montblanc, licensed by Inter Parfums (Sisley, Ferragamo, Van Cleef & My Origines, etc) should have mindful investments.

Since the Explorer for Men and Signature for Ladies, Montblanc only launched flops:
- Explorer Ultra Blue (6.5),
- Legend Red (6.5) and
- Signature Absolute (7.2) which my wife likes but flies away in 2 hours.

When I saw the bottle design and the IFF Perfumer Bruno Jovanovic (Rose Incense, Bad Boy Le Parfum and Fierce from A&F) behind this creation, I had high hopes and was so curious to try it.

It starts with a strong stale smell of clary sage (similar cold mettalic one like in the H24) and nothing much else, the violet petrol like smell is very weak and some synthetic cedarwood is also barely there. And it develops into a dry sweaty gym bag after a few minutes, I had to use vegetable oil and soap and scrub this from my skin like my life depended on it.

There is absolutely nothing to like about this scent and it seems like it was launched without a clear mission in mind and why was also Natalie Lorson (Bentley Intense for Men, Lalique Encre Noir Extreme and Gentleman Givenchy Réserve Privée) needed for this?

We, Parfumos and perfume lovers, should VOTE with our money and not encourage anymore the perfume houses to launch soulless creations like these and still buy them anyway."
Explorer Platinum,06/07/2024,Smirky,M,483,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Easy Reach Perfume,"The opening of Explorer Platinum gave me a creamy vibe with a subtle sweet coconut scent. At that point, would have classified it as unisex. As it settled and the wood scent became more prominent, changed my mind - it is definitely a masculine fragrance. Around the 30 minute mark, it really became nice with a wood note making it sharper, less creamy. Longevity is very good with decent projection - around arms length and gradually diminishing to around the 4-5 hour mark when it's down to a skin scent.

I can see it as an easy reach for everyday for a guy wanting a straightforward, pleasant scent, not trying to make a statement. Could work anytime of the year, day or night, most all situations."
Explorer Platinum,05/18/2024,Tracershy,M,121,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Disappointment,"I was eager to test it after the first promising opinions right after the premiere, which led to growing expectations that in such a weak year as 2023, some nice, masculine premiere would finally be released. And what happened? Well, that's a bummer because Explorer Platinum is unfortunately a very average, generic scent, there is absolutely nothing interesting about it. Secondary, repeating patterns that have been used dozens of times in recent years.
The scent is simple, fresh, cedar, a bit metallic, slightly herbal, smelling like a lot of other blue perfumes with a hint of fougere. There is a note here that is already well known from Sauvage and similar products, but in any case it is an average, common scent.
The parameters are good, although the projection is low, the bottle is impressive, but what's the point if there's just something inside. Versatility may be a plus, but Explorer Platinum is so colorless that it's only suitable for a quick trip to the store or to the gym."
Explorer Platinum,01/25/2024,Marmot57,M,9,,3,Montblanc Explorer Platinum - An Intriguing Scent,"The first time I tried it was on a tester strip in a mall. I was immediately surprised by the scent and although I did not try it on skin at that time I knew it was something that I was eventually going to get.

In terms of scent, Explorer Platinum is masculine, lightly sweet, herbal-camphorous and woody. It does share something in common with the Original Explorer and that is the Akigaliwood/Suede component. Therefore, the far dry down can be felt as synthetic due to these notes, as it was also the case with the original one. You will go nose blind on this, but not as much as with the original; I also perceive it as having more depth than the first one and not being as minimalist.
It is a creamy or buttery scent but I personally don't get any coconut, which is a good thing because I am not really a fain of it in perfumes. This is not a safe blind buy as I can see how some people might perceive the greenness which is present here as dill or even parsley! I was lucky to see their commercial months before I purchased it and because of that this one inspires to me winter, forests and snow.

In terms of performance, I got 7-8 hours on my skin but if you spray on clothes is will surely last even more. During the first hour it will be quite loud, like most of them are and then it will settle down to 1 feet for most of its life duration.

I find it very relaxing and enjoyable, definitely an office scent but can also be worn casually, of course. The scent goes into a direction of sophistication and elegance to some degree and, although you don't need to suit up for it, you can't use it with any kind of random outfit.

This is not unisex, this is for men and I think it's a solid release, to which I am going to rate as an 8/10."

After application, one can immediately perceive a kind of coniferous freshness, rounded off by a light sweetness in the background from a green violet scent. Shortly thereafter, the top freshness dissipates, and from this point on, the fragrance remains green-warm, dry-woody.

Explorer Platinum is so skillfully composed that the green, leafy sweetness of the violet leaves gives the fragrance a depth, while simultaneously carrying the darker note of sage in the background.
The cedarwood subtly adds a lightly dry, minimal smoky note to the whole composition.

When the fragrance has faded in the evening, a pleasantly sweet sage scent remains on the skin."
Explorer Platinum,06/07/2023,AlbertAUT,M,2,,7,In hopeful anticipation,"Dear community!
Since the fragrance was announced, I have been searching almost daily for a way to get my hands on it. Finally, a few days ago, I found it, and today I finally received it. The black predecessor, Montblanc Explorer, is a very successful fragrance for me, which is why I have very high expectations for the new one. I generally really like the packaging and the design of the bottle from Montblanc. Everything feels very high-quality. But now to the most important part. Removing the heavy cap, I pump it 3 times, and the first fine spray mist settles on my skin. The scent first reminds me of Gentleman Givenchy Eau de Toilette Intense, just not quite as sweet and powdery. Then, for me, the basil comes to the forefront. However, the top note disappears quite quickly, and the fragrance becomes sweet. For me personally, only the woody/sweet and very subtly citrus component remains. Montblanc still needs to work hard on the longevity and sillage. After a few minutes, the scent is only very close to the skin for me. It is possible that it will develop a bit more in warm temperatures.

All in all, I find the fragrance successful.
Best regards from Austria"
Explorer Platinum,08/04/2023,Donnergott,M,7,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,A Walk in the Licorice Forest with a Coconut Water Stream Flowing Through It,"What? Violet leaf, clary sage, cedarwood... This can't be.

When I first smelled the fragrance, I thought more of a Pina Colada or Coconut Kiss that I spilled on my clothes. A little later, something strange happened, as the scent developed into a light, fresh licorice forest fragrance with a coconut water stream flowing through it, and after 2 days, it is still on the polo shirt.

Don't hold me to it, but after 2 days in the drydown, I perceive a mix of Creed's Silver Mountain Water and Virgin Island Water.

Definitely a bold scent that lasts extremely long for a fresh fragrance."
Explorer Platinum,01/01/2024,Shark007,M,62,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,With the Dog in the Underbrush!,"Montblanc is probably only considered in passing by many. I felt the same way. Then I came across Explorer Platinum, and although it wasn't love at first sight, I learned to appreciate the quality during the second test.

I spend a lot of time with my dog, and sometimes we end up in the underbrush. Suddenly it struck me… this is the scent of this MontBlanc creation. Very harmonious, green freshness with a hint of sweetness and the somewhat harsher note of cedarwood. This is forest and nature in its perfection. A little fun fact on the side: My dog noticeably comes to sniff around when I wear it.

Unfortunately, the longevity and sillage are weak points of the fragrance. After 4-5 hours, it is only very subtle on the skin. On clothing, it lasts a good hour longer. However, the price is absolutely top-notch, and for those who don’t want to spend too much money on perfume but still want to wear a nice, somewhat unusual scent, Platinum is perfectly equipped.

Conclusion:
Top price/performance ratio and a lovely everyday fragrance for spring and autumn. I just had to have it - says my dog!"
Explorer Platinum,04/15/2025,Dermikem,M,6,,7,Relatively Unique and Good,"There aren't many fragrances that I smell that are relatively outstanding. To get straight to the point, Explorer Platinum is exactly one of those. When thinking of independent scents, one might quickly think of Aventus or BR540. However, in terms of uniqueness and class, Explorer Platinum holds its own against the big names.

Of course, you have to like the DNA, but the fragrance impresses with a wonderful freshness and a woodiness that I have never encountered in this form before. The scent development is relatively linear, and what you smell after 30 minutes is still what you smell after 6 hours. No surprises along the way, but sometimes that's not necessary.

I associate this scent with class and style. I don't envision a teenager in baggy jeans and a baseball cap, but rather someone over 30, whether in a business suit or in a white shirt, jeans, and sneakers. In my eyes, it is a mature fragrance that has class through understatement and is one of the most unique scents I know.

For me, it's one of my top 5 fragrances ever."
Explorer Platinum,04/30/2023,RAT6EBER,M,73,,4,Sunny Forest Clearing Moment Break,"This perfume could be a variant of Bentley's Momentum Unbreakable that is warmer and woodier with a coconut-like note and less of the artificial mandarin inferno.
I associate 2 hours of concentrated orange juice with a lot of wood in ""warm"" tones, cypress, and sage.
I find the top notes - calculated for frequent use - more pleasant than in Momentum Unbreakable, which starts as an extreme synthetic-focused orange bomb, later shifting towards dill like in Zara's Tiveden, which does not happen at all with Explorer Platinum. That one smells herbal and natural from the very beginning and is consistently milder or more balanced. You ""explore"" more ""plants"" here. From orange to wine berry to sage to cedar wood to ""warm"" coconut elements. By the way, I don't detect violet leaf like in Fahrenheit and Simply here.
Fragrance description as a scene: Bentley parked;-), backpack on, let's go. Clean air while walking in the forest on a nice day. Moment, ;-)Break! Hiking pause in a sunny warm forest clearing. Sitting on the sun-kissed sturdy grass, a little picnic. Peeling a mandarin, drinking grape juice - oh, I still have that little coconut cream orange shot in my backpack -, seeing birds and squirrels, smelling wildflowers and tree resin, onward we go. As the sun blinds me, I briefly dream of vacation by coconut palms with the scent of the sun-warmed pine bark. How important it is to have some silence and breathe fresh air from time to time."
Explorer Platinum,10/09/2025,Profumorist,M,77,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,"S**, damn it!","Thank you for your attention. Since you’re already here, you might as well stay a bit longer and read to the end. And don’t worry, this is not an ordinary comment. But let’s be honest, without the headline, you wouldn’t have read the comment about this “normal” fragrance. See.

Aren't we all searching for that one extraordinary scent? Don’t we all want to smell like no one else? Something that makes us unmistakable. And why does it smell like Imagination, Naxos, or Ombre Nomade on every corner? Why do we let way too many influencers talk us into something? What’s unique about that? Especially when you can buy a similarly scented fragrance in one of the many dupe shops for little money, which you wouldn’t want to afford in the original. Therefore, many people today smell the same, even though they believe they are wearing something extraordinary. Whoever has found the irony in this game can keep it.

Montblanc is not exactly known for producing creative fragrances. Most of the time, they create scents that are inspired by successful and trendy fragrances. Just to get a piece of the big perfume pie. This one is probably an oversight. Because it is extraordinary. Violet, clary sage, and cedar. That’s all that should be in it. It is said to remind one of Santal 33 EAU DE PARFUM. That wouldn’t be my first choice to rake in money through sales. And to get straight to the point, this one does go a bit in the direction of Santal 33 EAU DE PARFUM. It’s not a true fragrance twin. It’s softer, not so straight-in-your-face, not so leathery.

The Montblanc is aftershave-fresh (I just love it), green, woody paired with just the right dose of sweetness. Minimal, but just like you need sweetness in a beer or a really good wine to keep the overall experience from being too dry.
Violet (I just love it) gives the scent this cool, sharp freshness. The clary sage takes on the green and the minimal mineral sweetness, and the cedar wood - what a surprise - brings the woodiness. It simply smells different, extraordinary and yes, extremely masculine. It’s somehow a modern old-school scent.

The longevity and sillage are top-notch for me. A workday without reapplying is no problem. The bottle is, as always, a matter of taste.

What can I say in conclusion: It flies completely under the radar and, in my opinion, unjustly so. Testing is a must if you want to discover something extraordinary.

And to all those who think only niche counts: It’s not bad to wear Montblanc."
Legend Night,01/29/2022,Elysium,M,898,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,A Person's Charisma,"Legend Night's bottle has an intense cognac color with contrasting black details inspired by a fine liqueur. And there is an ambery-type scent in Legend Night. It has a morsel of everything you would expect from a woody, aromatic, and spicy cologne for men. It has a smooth and powdery texture, even though it has a fresh/spicy opening with cardamom, mint, and cedar. Night is the fourth chapter of the Legend saga, after the original Legend EAU DE TOILETTE, the Legend Intense, and the Legend Spirit.

On my skin, it opens up with a big blast of candied green apple spiced with a puff of green cardamom and a dab of mint. I can pick up the caramel nuance and lavender from the very beginning. The minty feeling adds deepness but lasts only a moment; it almost immediately disappears. The opening is bright, reminiscent of the natural radiance of man's aura. The start will remind you of something familiar if you are anything like me. Having mint, sage, and cardamom together adds a lot of spice to what would otherwise be another vanilla and apple scent.

The scent turns powdery as the minty edge tones down because the violet creeps in. The violescent lavender is more prominent now, and the apple moves to the back. It shares the herbal facet of the middle stage with the vetiver. The middle notes immediately counterbalance this first impression of refreshing coolness with their warm nobility. This is the point at which the floral notes really come into their own. The precious scents of dry cedarwood blend well with the floral lavender tones and slightly powdered violet.

When the scent approaches the dry-down, I get vanillic sweetness with a touch of warm woods, while fruity apple and spicy cardamom still linger in the back. I pick up a lot of sweetness, but sweet without crossing into gourmand territory. The vanilla note is an exciting take on today's trendy, charming vanilla-centered men's scents on the designer market: it has a dark vibe. Honeyed would be the closest term. Sweet, vanilla, tastes of honey and caramelized sugar, with a bit of apple, sage, citrus, and vetiver. I can smell vetiver and patchouli near my skin, accompanied by subtle notes of dark vanilla and velvety musk.

It is a scent with a masculine slant, but not in an alpha-male way and free from aggression. It best suits the fall and cold winter seasons, definitely an evening and night out type of cologne, but I can wear it even during the day. While the performance will not last an entire workday, it is acceptable for most evenings out and most date nights, quite a good cuddle scent. Although advertised as a night cologne, the fragrance is, to me, very smooth. I think you can get away with using this as an office fragrance. The scent is delightful, sweet, and woody at the same time. Yes, I actually like it a lot.

I base the review on a bottle I have owned since June 2019.

-Elysium"
Legend Night,09/29/2023,JavSantana,M,65,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Grown up Eros,"I got this bottle of Montblanc Legend Night because my father stopped wearing it and instead opted for Christian Dior, Versace, Man In Black and YSL's La Nuit De L'Homme L'Intense. (Amazing leather / iris frag btw, way better than Valentino Uomo or Intense)

And a few days after getting it, i break it down here.

Citrus / Spicy opening with bergamot, cardamom and slight aromatic mint / sage nuances
Ambery, powdery heart (Has some kind of iris / orris nuance way heavier and more pronounced than in ""iris"" bombs like that La Nuit De L'Homme Intense or Gentleman EDP by Givenchy) with touches of apple
Vanilla / woody base

It's an interesting fragrance. Not particularly unique by any means but it does have a particular dna that you do not find in other fragrances. Yet being close to Versace Eros (It doesn't smell much synthetic to me but anyway) it's like a grown up, refined and more elegant version of it. If Eros is the minty, citrusy vanilla kid oversprayed in the club, Legend Night is the same kid several years later (8 - 10?) wearing a tailored suit and an open shirt while drinking some fine cognac or whisky, neat. It's the best way i have found to describe it.

Bottom line: Great fragrance for the price. Montblanc always giving a great bang for buck ratio. And worth pointing out that the performance to me is ok. Not bad by any means, nor a beast mode, projects quite silently but it's great for a date. Also if you're more subdued and instead of going out to blast a club with 20 sprays of a loud scent, you go to cafés on cloudy days to meet reader girls and say you're a writer and a photographer, it's a better scent for that as well. (Maybe not as good as JPG Le Male Essence de Parfum or Givenchy Gentleman EDT, both classic and vintage) Not a heavy projector in my experience, but i guess that with it oversprayed, you can go clubbing or to a party without any trouble. Spray on clothing for extended longevity and you're good to go. Great budget winter and night scent"
Legend Night,11/09/2019,Vmitsopoulos,M,10,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Fall/winter under radar scent,"I bought this the other day after hearing about it.
It opens up fresh with the mint and bergamot to my nose. Then I get the Apple and vanilla combo
And the dry down is beautiful.
As per other people’s concerns even though it’s a edp the performance can be a bit to be desired.
Although it does stick around and you do get nice reminders that it is still there I do wish that it projected a bit more as the scent is awesome and I have received some good compliments since my purchase.
All in all an under the radar scent if it lasted longer projection and sillage wise it could have been an absolute winner
Would recommend it if you are happy with 1-2 hours push for sillage and about 5-6 hours as a skin scent"
Legend Night,12/09/2018,Vilar,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Night Bomb,"I tested this out on a paper strip at my local Hudson's Bay. The first thing I noticed was a wonderful mint note layered over the darker ones. It was quite delightful. After a while I noticed there was a real gourmand quality to this scent. After a few hours I experienced one of the most satisfying dry downs ever. Beautiful wood spicy scent. Real masculine. This scent is definitely for nights out and preferably in colder weather. If you want an alternative to the Dior L'Hommes of the world, this is it."
Legend Night,08/30/2017,FabianO,M,1008,,12,Unassuming Whispered Fruit-Spice-Wood All-Rounder with Certain Solidity,"With Montblanc, I usually see things in black when it comes to fragrances. Their wonderfully old-fashioned designed ballpoint pens glide effortlessly across the paper, smoother than any other, but with the perfumes, it has mostly been a clash of cloying synthetics or overly sweet concoctions so far.

""Legend Night"" seems to actually be above average. Here is something quite wearable for the autumn in the mainstream.

Right off the bat - the scent is relatively simple. However - and this does set it apart from the other unpleasant offerings of the brand - it largely avoids laboratory-like notes or headache-inducing sweetness. It comes across rather modest and balanced.

At first, there’s a dab of apple, gently embraced by sage and cardamom with a mild spiciness. In the sillage, it is rather body lotion-like creamy, and after an hour, a very delicately drawn mix of cotton candy and a hint of wood unfolds, perhaps the aforementioned Akigalawood, which is said to be patchouli-like in construction.

What might be most surprising is indeed the unassuming nature of ""Legend Night,"" which I consider a small step forward, as I don’t have to be annoyed by synthetic notes for the 333rd time."
Legend Night,11/21/2019,HennyB93,M,6,,14,Who ... wants must wear Legend Night!,"A scent as if being poured again on the bear skin in front of the fireplace. Seductive, understated, assertive, with a slight caramel note enriched by a splash of ten-year-old Talisker. Next to a neck that smells like Legend Night, there are most likely two shoulders to lean on. And the lady of the heart must lean, because otherwise this perfume is hardly noticeable after just..."
Legend Night,12/05/2018,Schnix,M,7,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Legendary Night by the Fireplace,"Scent Impression:
""Legend Night"" by Montblanc is a spicy-sweet fragrance, perfect for the darker time of the year.

The emphasis here is more on spicy than sweet, although fans of sweet scents will also find something to enjoy. Nevertheless, the strengths definitely lie in the pleasant spiciness of sage, cardamom, and balsamic woods, rather than in the sweetness of apple and vanilla.

I find the comparison to Herod by Parfums de Marly to be quite fitting, as it also gives me that cozy feeling of security. However, I perceive ""Legend Night"" as significantly more versatile, as it is not only perfect for a cozy fireplace in winter or a family Christmas party, but just as suitable as an evening fragrance in autumn.

Longevity:
The longevity on the skin is average, while on clothing it is above average.

Target Audience:
This fragrance might be a bit too sweet for older men, but that is a matter of personal taste.

Occasion:
This cuddly, warm, cozy scent can be worn for all evening occasions during the dark season.

Conclusion:
A spicy autumn-winter fragrance that can be perfectly applied at sunset and truly enjoyed by the fireplace or campfire. The bottle colorfully expresses exactly what one can look forward to: a cuddly, warm, cozy scent with a light sweetness."
Legend Night,12/01/2021,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Zaghafte Zuckerwatte,"""Legend Night"" is another (and at least visually the most appealing) offshoot of Montblanc's most successful fragrance line - and it moves even further away from the Fierce-like DNA of its original perfume. Which is not a bad thing. Here we have a subtle candy scent that doesn’t hurt anyone, fitting well into the autumn on still quite fresh young men's skin. From the office to the club. An unabashed crowd-pleaser fragrance. Not one that stands out. But certainly well made, and it doesn’t always have to be the big hit.

""Legend Night"" ranks in the second league somewhere behind ""Eros"" and ""One Million"" clones, representing the Sugarboy style cleanly, commendably understated, and somewhat pale. Definitely synthetic - but never piercing. Definitely very sweet - but for noses (like mine) that can still handle it, anything but disturbing. A minimally tipsy (indefinable) fruit. Dusty vanilla. Adapts very much to the wearer, has little character of its own or special strengths. Smoky or distinctive should not be expected here. Simple, wearable, an affordable cuddle blanket between sexy and interchangeable. There is definitely worse in the mainstream. However, it will likely remain forever a maximum of a hidden gem, as it does not linger in my memory or on my collar, neither positively nor negatively.

Bottle: a highlight, great color gradient!
Sillage: more discreet than many other such ""sugar product uniform slush"" (harshly put)
Longevity: 6 hours, no top rating here either

Conclusion: sweet and solid mass-market goods that are not unpleasant at all. For young boys, it’s certainly a nice entry-level and signature scent. For advanced users, it’s a passing item."
Legend Night,01/04/2021,Mantus,M,487,,6,Finally Free!,"At first, one can perceive an intense and powerful ethereal sweet herbal note that exudes a certain prominence, thanks to the 'sage'.

At the same time, the sage merges with a delicate citrus nuance that gives the fragrance a note reminiscent of red apple, although it is not a red apple at all, but likely comes from the interplay with 'bergamot'; as well as Madagascar vanilla and patchouli in the right mix creating full milk chocolate, or it could also be the base DNA of the fragrance, so I am absolutely not sure whether the red apple in the fragrance pyramid was simply not published by the manufacturer; everything is possible.

And it reminds me that I gifted my 16-year-old little brother (he's not so little anymore, he has more bicep than I have thigh :-) ) a Montblanc fountain pen, and he also likes slightly sweet fragrances, not too extreme, so I sent him a Montblanc Legends Night bottle, and it really worked out that he received this bottle exactly on his 18th birthday.

- I love it when my plan works out! :-)

A little later, the fragrance becomes deeply floral and also spicy, accompanied by a fine Mediterranean, almost sweetly tinged smooth note, and I also suspected the use of 'violet' and 'lavender' along with a hint of 'neroli'.

In the last 3 hours, a 'vanilla' sweet creamy, delicately woody touched 'cedarwood' remains, and the question of whether it is now also free from that abominable creature that dares to call itself human has finally been answered with ""Yes""!

I could not perceive 'vetiver' and 'patchouli', but I can very well imagine that these components were used for completion.

Overall, the fragrance lasts 7 hours on my skin.

The sillage is designed from the beginning for a very noticeable half-arm's length for 3 hours, before it gradually reduces until the fragrance fades away.

""Honk1510, thank you for the decant!"""
Legend Night,08/29/2021,Badh3ad,M,0,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Sweet, very sweet, sugar-sweet","Montblanc is not exactly known for creating and launching highly attractive fragrances.

Their releases often align with already well-known, extremely successful scent compositions.
Generally, they are so-called crowd pleasers!
Perhaps to grab as large a piece as possible of the sweet-tasting cake.

At first, a slightly spicy, herbal note emerges briefly, stemming from the sage.
Then, the lavender and violet quickly come to the forefront.
They form a slightly creamy, almost balsamic enveloping with the vanilla, patchouli, and cedarwood.

Models for this fragrance composition can be found in D&G The One or also at Valentino.
Qualitatively, they are probably executed a bit better there, but also cost 1-2 euros more.

Bottle: quite sturdy - with a metallic cap

Longevity: also relatively stable in this price segment (mid-range designer) - 6h+

Sillage: quite close to the body quickly - maximum 3h then close to the body - if desired, reapplication

Conclusion: spicy/sweet fragrance - particularly well-suited for cool/wet & dark autumn evenings - more suitable for a younger audience - but this ultimately remains a matter of taste."
Legend Night,06/05/2024,Carnazos,M,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,The Warm Blanket No One Talks About,"I would like to write about my favorite evening scent.
I am 34, have a wife and kids, and I don't really go out partying anymore :D
I still like to take the time to shower in the evening and then crash on the sofa after a tiring day.
This is usually the time when I apply this fragrance - not because it refreshes me or makes me extroverted, but because it confirms my mood that I want a quiet evening lying on the sofa with my wife, watching TV or talking about life and everything.
The scent never takes control over me or leaves me frowning; instead, it gives me a cozy feeling that nothing bad will happen today. It fits me, especially in such life situations.

You can tell that the production doesn't quite match the quality of other perfumes, but it doesn't clash and lasts pleasantly long.
I have sprayed it several times before sleeping, which is rather unusual for me.

It's a shame that some people here criticize it; I think for the price, it is unbeatable in what it does!

All the best
Your Andreas :)"
Legend Night,01/29/2022,AbuMisk,M,2,,3,Woody-Fresh Winter Scent,"This fragrance is a pleasantly slightly sweet, woody, and fresh winter scent. Unfortunately, the longevity is very low, and it is only worth wearing if you spray it generously and want it to last for 1-2 hours, because it hardly lasts longer. It's a pity, a typical problem with Mont Blanc."
Legend Night,05/08/2023,Sun,M,47,,6,Incredibly Soothing Woody Sleep Fragrance,"Legend Night is one of the few fragrances that I have repurchased multiple times in my life, and it is also one of those scents that do not reveal their full potential at first sniff. Unfortunately, fir balsam and rosemary, which together with sage create an extremely calming effect for me, were forgotten in the fragrance pyramid, so I often use it as a sleep fragrance.

Fragrance notes: Bergamot is only very faintly noticeable at the beginning, while violet, vetiver, and patchouli, thankfully, I do not perceive at all. Vanilla and cedarwood are subtly felt in the background from the heart note. As I mentioned, the dominant notes for me are primarily sage, rosemary, fir balsam, and also lavender, which only makes a very subtle appearance.

Fragrance classification & intensity: This is a slightly distinctive, fresh, spicy, and woody scent that I still consider to be the best fragrance from Montblanc, even ahead of Legend Spirit.

Comparison: Those who enjoy very vanilla and slightly distinctive yet pleasant scents, such as One Million Privé by Paco Rabanne, will also feel comfortable with this fragrance."

Legend Night,11/15/2024,Moritz007,M,6,,3,Montblanc Legend Night - The best Montblanc for me,"Montblanc Legend Night is for me the most relaxed scent in the range and exactly what I need when I want to unwind at home and still smell good. The fragrance starts off soft and pleasant with a warm blend and a hint of lavender. Cozy, but not too heavy.

What makes Legend Night special is this comforting warmth, which is perfect for quiet evenings. It doesn't impose itself, always remaining subtle and pleasant. That's exactly why I love wearing it when I relax at home and still want to smell good even though I'm not going out. I always enjoy smelling it!!

The longevity is okay, but nothing extraordinary. For longer days or nights, I would reapply, but for my own four walls, it's completely sufficient. Legend Night is not a party scent, but a true comfort companion.

Legend Night is the perfect fragrance for relaxed evenings. Warm, subtle, and just right when you want to unwind - for me, the best Montblanc!"

Explorer,06/07/2019,ScentSlave,M,246,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"I’d never thought I’d be into a knockoff,","But this one knocked me off of my feet when I got the whiff... if you can’t tell it’s totally trying to be Aventus you’re kidding yourself, but if you aren’t tempted to shell out the cash, you aren’t human. I like the real version, but I couldn’t bring myself to spend the $$ on something so many people already have... cut that price down THIS much though? Hell yes I’m in...

Again, you can tell it wants to be creed, and as the notes pass it becomes MORE obvious, but I don’t care... I’m loving it, and I didn’t even spend HALF the cost.

Projection? Check. It’s a good 3-4ft reach for a good 2-3 hours. Sillage? Check; they will know YOU were there. Longevity? Checkmate! Easy 6-8+ hours on a 3-4 good sprays.

Explorer,04/26/2022,Demetera,M,21,,3,The best ladies reactions ever.,"Well I blingbought this one - just because the 30mil bottle looks soo damn good. As a first impression the fragrance is ookay-ish, but nothing special. It smells a little bit similar to the Dior Sauvage but its much more fruity, much less sharp - lets call it Ambroxan triangle: The [sharp Sauvage], the [creamy LunaRossaCarbon] and the [fruity Explorer].

So as a first impression lets call it nothing special, its a versatile ambroxan-based fragrance.
What about the longetivity? Its pretty bad, lets face it: 30 min normal and 2 hour time as a skin scent, and its gone, so its longetivity is really poor, but the 30mil fits well in the pocket, so I think Montblanc is prepared the bottle format for re-spraying.

Allright, and why am I writing a review if the smell is ""nothing special"" and the longetivity is pretty bad? Because of two reasons: the reactions and how the scent changes with temperature.

The most of the fragrances smells suffocating in hot weather or disappears in cold weather - there is only 1-2 parfumes are useable in hot and cold weather - but Montblanc Explorer is one of them, because its smell changes with the temperature.

But the biggest reason to talk about this fragrance is the reactions: well I used some mainstream hits before: Dior Sauvage, Prada LR Carbon, Bleu De Chanel, Bvlgari Aqva Marine, Jimmy Choo Man Ice, Tom Ford Noir, D&G The One, Zadig&Voltaire This is Him!, D&G Light Blue, YSL Y, YSL La Nuit, YSL L'Homme, and so on, but I have never, NEVER received so many positive feedbacks on a single fragrance like this, and especially from women."
Explorer,04/22/2021,Giles,M,87,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Ah so good for the price...,"Yup no matter what the Creed snobs say, this is Aventus-esque and just as good. I mean look at the perfumers for a start. I can't believe how good for the summer this is and soooooo cheap. I get a full days performance, unlike the Creed masterpiece that varies with every batch made and I have had a few bottles. There's not much more to say than just buy a bottle it will not disappoint."
Explorer,10/18/2021,Wpietri34,M,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,It's aight.,"I came across him not to long ago when I was looking for a new scent when I was about to run out of my beloved Bleu de Chanel Parfum. It opens with a sharp bergamot which for some could be a bit synthetic but in my most humble opinion it's prob the best part of this fragrance. The mid is also very lovely, as it settles it turns into a woody/ aromatic scent which is also very clean. About and hour into the drydown it transitions into and ambroxan bomb which I can no longer detect any nuances whatsoever, just a screeching ambroxan base that still projects and linger very well. After that point it really is nothing special. As for compliments this will get you noticed and garner compliments and to be fair my better half absolutely loves this. Value for money is very good, you can gets this for 40% at times on online discounters having said that it would be a hard pass for me at retail.The bottle presentation is very elegant in my opinion with the classic Montblanc minimalism. All and all a pretty decent scent if looking for an all year-round scent and you don't want to break the bank."
Explorer,02/20/2024,Advantage01,M,16,,5,Guilty pleasure for an admitted snob,"This fragrance makes me realize I need to step off my high horse of $300 fragrances every so often. To put it simply this is just a really great fragrance. Sweet and citrusy with a really potent woody/leather backbone. Smooth and easy-going, not a typical ""cologne guy"" scent like most designer releases.

This is not an Aventus clone, but it does fit the category and is clearly an inspired scent with its bergamot and heavy ambroxan. Aventus is fruity and musky, whereas this is dry and woody."
Explorer,01/06/2022,Connoisseur6,M,8,,3,It's ok for the price,"As pointed out by other reviews here, Explorer isn't exactly a performer... The scent is pleasant enough, but I am probably a bit of a snob since Explorer gave me a headache after not too long of wearing. One of the issues is since longevity is so bad, two sprays are far from enough so you'll spray at least five times. Sadly it makes it just smell more, not longer. The..."
Explorer,09/15/2020,ScentGrail,M,108,,5,Montblanc Explorer: Hail to the King,"It is official. After nine years, we finally have a designer fragrance based on the most popular fragrance(s) in the world. This Montblanc Explorer review is my fragrant journey during the last five months.

Here are my 5 quick takes:

- An all-year-around fragrance
- Fruity Aromatic composition
- The natural interpretation of the most popular niche fragrance
- Versatile fragrance suitable for anyone
- High-Quality presentation

I found it quite pleasing and was my most used fragrance during the summer.

The oblivious influence is straight-up visible, but it differs enough with its natural smelling notes.

If you are interested in my perfume work, you can find me on the web and social media's under the Scent Grail name. Cheers."
Explorer,05/11/2024,StarA1,M,136,,3,Creed Aventus Without Pineapple,"A fragrance on the path of Creed Aventus, but without the pure, smoky scent of pineapple which found in Aventus. It’s not completely similar but rather follows its path, the pineapple has been replaced with citrus and Italian bergamot.
Rather, the fragrance comes closer to Club de Nuit Intense Man Armaf, L'Aventure Al Haramain, and Supremacy Silver Afnan, all of which followed the path of Aventus, but didn’t reach its purity and quality.
Perhaps Explorer Montblanc is better than its predecessors, as the similarity here in the stages of the fragrance, except for the opening, is very similar to Aventus, at a rate that may reach 40%.

Definitely suitable for summer, as it is a lively fragrance that stimulates activity, and suitable for men over thirty years of age, can be worn on any clothing, whatever it is, and at all the summer times, It is an easy and unpretentious fragrance.

The performance of the fragrance is somewhat average:
- Longevity: around 4 hours and often less
- Sillage: around 2 hours at best

The fragrance bottle is ordinary, not special, and gives the luxury impression of somewhat."
Explorer,06/09/2024,Smirky,M,483,,3,Nice Scent and an Easy Reach,"Tested from a sample. Opening has strong citrus scent which mingles with a herbal accord. More herbal I'd say than spicy. As it settled the citrus went to the background and a smooth vetiver-leather scent became obvious. As it further evolved, about 20 minutes, a wood scent started to dominate which was backed by a softer musky scent. The wood scent eventually became less smooth and more sharp - maybe sharp/sour is a better way to describe it. Longevity was very good with decent projection - around arms length and gradually diminishing to around the 6 to 7 hour mark when it's down to a skin scent.

Overall, a great masculine fragrance which gave me a similar impression as Montblanc Explorer Platinum even though they smell different - an easy reach for everyday for a guy wanting a straightforward, pleasant scent, not trying to make a statement. Could work anytime of the year, day or night, most all situations. A definite keeper with a very reasonable price.

I do not know Aventus, so can't say how Explorer compares to it."
Explorer,05/24/2023,LukeM99,M,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Mont blanc explorer,"Absolute banger. I've slept on Montblanc thinking they were kind of an off brand, but everything I've smelled from them is worth every penny. I own genuine Aventus from 2015, and I will say on opening these are almost indistinguishable. Explorer quickly shows a different character on the dry down, however, with more pepper and patchouli and a distinct woods base. It's hard to..."
Explorer,04/13/2025,Pakistanstar,M,18,,4,My dad is not a lawyer,"Montblanc are madlads. Not because they ""copied"" Creed but because they did it better. Aventus is a beta fragrance and Explorer is a chad. I like that it smells better, costs less and has a better bottle. No need to waste money on Creed, I'll get this instead then use my savings to spoil my girlfriend. You know, because I actually have a personality. How are those triple digit collections going team?"
Explorer,02/19/2019,Archie34,M,1,,0,"“Montblanc Explorer” the clone, the myth, the legend?","Call montblanc explorer whatever you want but this is my two cents. I received a sample of the juice luckily before it’s release and used it for some time now. I’ve tried heavy sprays, light sprays and everything in between and this fragrance performs nicely, right where I want it to be and of course that’s on my personal skin. My first impression of this slightly smoky wave of aventus made me think of a man like Beowulf, someone back in the older days that is a warrior but some part of it is very modern too like I hate to say it on here,.. Sauvage. I’m not sure if I’d say this a mix between creed aventus and sauvage because it’s not, but the very peppery feel I get from this is mixed also with the ambroxan to create this sausage-esque comparison that many would say is main stream to some extent because of dior’s Sauvage. This pepper and ambroxan when sprayed lightly on my clothing changed into a smell that sort of resembled a candle and is something that I’m not rather a fan of, but when left on skin with a few sprays (meaning 3) as we all should wear this mixture creates a lovely aroma that slightly resembles pineapples in the top note. Having all that said I must say a solid release this fragrance is a solid release from this house and although people give this frangrance backlash for smelling like a bottom pick aventus (considering all the other great clones out), this is a addition to Macy’s and more maintstream retailers for their own feel for aventus and have something new-smelling unalike from all the scents at stores like Macy’s. Let’s be honest, Montblanc is showing that this Creed Aventus the community speaks of is merely an overpriced exclusive, that all the ingredients within Creed can be replicated with rarely even using any of the same notes! I respect this aventus clone the most for that fact and I encourage perfumers from all over the world to create. I respect Creed Aventus more nonetheless because of its completeness, quality, and heritage but Montblanc merely opened the door for a glimpse at this masterpiece of a niche fragrance."
Explorer,05/10/2021,Topfpflanze3,M,64,,3,Aspartame Aventus,"Explorer is the most mainstream and mass pleasing interpretation of Aventus. No smokiness, hardly any woodiness but instead a good dose of Ambroxan. However, the sweetness in there is strange to my nose. Imagine an original coca-cola in comparison to a sugar free no name cola product. These super cheap diet soda stuff sometimes has this scratchy almost bitter and artificial taste. That is how I experience Montblanc Explorer. Its maybe muscs that provide this strange sensation. In the air it definitely smells better than of clothes or skin which makes me believe that some of the heavier base notes are the problem to my nose
In my opinion its successs comes from the fact that this is the only designer Aventus available in stores to smell..."
Explorer,09/29/2021,Smora,M,155,,3,"Trendy (Jordi Fernandez, Antoine Maisondieu & Olivier Pescheux, 2019)","Explorer is like a best-of compilation of trends in perfumery nowadays. It takes already known and beautiful Aventus DNA and pairs it with the molecule of the moment – Ambroxan that gives that shower gel, musky and clean vibe. Explorer opens up with sweet bergamot and this fleeting leathery notes, to my nose very similar to Zara Vibrant Leather. Like Jerome Epinette was a part of the team. While Vibrant Leather continues to follow Aventus’ footsteps, Explorer deviates a little bit and successfully introduces a note of clary sage which I really like. From now on Ambroxan takes the main play, accompanied by a light touch of pepper and some discreet synthetic woody and green patchouli aspects.
I have to admit, Explorer smells good. The scent profile is pleasing and versatile. Every occasion is a good occasion for Explorer. It is not good as Creed Aventus. I personally even prefer Zara Vibrant Leather, but somehow in my opinion is upgrade from Dior Sauvage and Dior Homme 2020. There is nothing to dislike in Explorer, except for the complete lack of originality. Does somebody with a bog collection needs it? No, but Explorer is an ideal fragrance for people who only needs one fragrance and wanted to smell good, trendy and fun. Nothing more, but nothing less. And the bottle looks great.

Rating: 6/10"
Explorer,02/25/2025,Nephq,M,18,,1,Aventus with Sage?,"I've had the chance to try Aventus lately and went downstairs, grabbed the 30ml bottle I gifted my father and brother, so they'd have something versatile to wear whenever they go out.

Are they similar? Yes. They are both woody citrussy but I don't like the smell of Sage. If it wasn't there, Im not sure how the woodiness would be complete. Still, I think it's way better than Aventus.
I think this bad boy is an amazing gift for your boyfriend,father or even grandfather. Such versatile Perfume that you could never go wrong with it. Absolutely inoffensive and really chill. Thanks to my classmate in Uni who made me get this.
I find it really classy and nonchalant and for the price, it's definitely way better than Aventus. At least there are no batch issues."
Explorer,05/23/2025,RustedFish,M,3,,1,A cheap parody of a modern classic,"Montblanc Explorer EDP opens with a pungent, synthetic, chemical pop that smells like a tire garage mixed with salty sweat.

To me, it’s unpleasant all the way through and headache-inducing from start to finish. It lingers for ages, which is great if you enjoy the smell, but for me, it felt like being followed around by the Michelin Man after a long run in the hot sun.

I kind of understand the comparisons to Aventus, but they’re completely different beasts with only vaguely similar DNA. Explorer lacks the crisp, fruity elegance of Aventus and smells like a cheap parody of a modern classic.

2/10"
Explorer,05/11/2025,Hem4n,M,3,,1,Can’t go wrong with this,"Explorer is a highly versatile, crowd-pleasing scent that punches well above its price tag.

From the first spray, you’re greeted with a fresh burst of bergamot and a hint of spicy pink pepper, which gradually gives way to a rich heart of vetiver and leather. The dry-down leans into ambroxan and patchouli, delivering a modern, slightly woody base that lasts all day on my skin.

Yes, the DNA is inspired by Creed Aventus. But Explorer holds its own. It’s smoother, less fruity, and more grounded, which I prefer for daily wear. This is a fragrance I reach for year-round, whether I’m heading to the office or out for dinner or even to the gym.

If you’re looking for something safe yet refined, familiar yet still well-crafted, Explorer delivers. It’s not niche, but it doesn’t need to be. Just solid, reliable rough masculine elegance in a bottle."
Explorer,08/30/2024,Shady205,M,6,,3,"Harsh opening, better dry down and weak performance.","I tried this fragrances multiple times in the store. I always got a strong synthetic cleaner vibe from it and it deterred me from buying it. But always after it dried down it smelled much better, so I finally bought it. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to last long on my skin. But as an office fragrance (which I was aiming for) this will do."
Explorer,12/22/2020,MrLawman,M,56,,3,Revenge,"Finally, Mont Blanc took the long waited but oh so sweet revenge on Creed, for what the latter did with Individuel.

For a fraction of the price, Mont Blanc made the Aventus DNA very accesible to a lot of people. A great addition to the fragrance market. Love it."
Explorer,07/08/2025,Smellzer92,M,7,,1,Save Your Money,"Save your money and just pick up a bottle of CDNI EDP or Limited Edition. The scent off this is nice, but the longevity is pretty trash for an EDP, and it seems that Montblanc are upping their prices now too. The longevity is far too weak on most of their perfumes to even consider raising their prices lol"
Explorer,04/22/2025,tjsc,M,7,,1,"A good fragrance, just not for me","I bought this on a whim after seeing how well-liked and cheap it was. I was wowed by how powerful the opening was. I love a good citrus opening. It dried down into a strong wood and leather, with the citrus lingering in the background. Nevertheless, I was disappointed to say that this wasn't for me. It's smells too old, generic, and masculine-leaning to my nose."
Explorer,04/14/2025,Tihomir,M,25,,1,Oriental Freshness.,"Explorer always stood out as a great choice for spring, especially for me. It's strong, and its zesty lime is just perfectly balanced with the Haitian vetiver, creating a great, almost ethereal breath of freshness with a feeling of ritualistic warmth haunting it. It's a great pick that definitely needs to be tried, especially due to its bold exoticism."
Explorer,04/09/2025,Pranay07,M,32,,2,A better clone,"On the first sniff it gives off the aventus vibe but the dry down is completely different. I absolutely have no complaints with this scent as long as I am not comparing it with Aventus and you shouldn't too because the price tag says it all...Maybe you can go ahead and compare it with Armaf CDN but then the quality of ingredients come into play, the ONE downside is there..."
Explorer,09/27/2024,WolfHunter,M,67,,1,The Do It All Safe Bet,"Montblanc Explorer is one of the most versatile fragrances that sits on my shelf. When I don’t feel like putting much effort into matching my fragrance with my mood or my outfit, Explorer always works. It is no secret that Explorer is heavily influenced by Creed Aventus, so it doesn’t win any awards for being at all original. But out of the many fragrances I own, this is the one that makes my wife weak in the knees when I wear it. It is quite a simple formula. Zesty citrus off of the top that comes off as pineapple with a dash of lemon. When it dries down, it goes into woods, oakmoss, and good old ambroxan.

Explorer is not a heavy projector, nor does it project for very long. It becomes a skin scent at around the 2 to 3 hour mark. It does tend to stick to clothes more than my skin.

The bottle design is fine. It’s easy to hold. I do wish the atomizer sprayed more and the black “leather” wrap on it becomes a little annoying when you are trying to see how much juice is left in the bottle.

At about $40 for a full sized bottle on discounter websites, this is wonderful value. If you want something that can get you close to the Aventus DNA without the $300 price tag, this is your best bet. Many people will recommend Club de Nuit Intense Man for the better performance, but with Explorer you avoid that super irritating lemon house cleaner opening of CDNIM."
Explorer,02/01/2024,Rassem2006,M,2,,2,Best casual freshie,"I'll be honest it doesnt smell too wow but its gets more compliments then I expect. Its clean and classy, nothing crazy. Its woody too. That's what you need in a everyday fresh fragrance. Fresh and wood = compliments. Plus look how cheap it is compared to others. It's worth it and lives up to the game"
Explorer,08/22/2023,LTSmells,M,2,,1,Montblanc Explorer,"A very easy wearing fragrance. The citrus off the top is almost bitter, which gives way to to a creamy synthetic leathery base. There's a bit of smokiness in this too as it dries down. Performance is ok though falls short of a full work day wearing.
I really don't get the comparison to Aventus other than the fact it's a citrus over woods composition. I'd say this is more akin to a muted and less fruity Cedrat Boise.
Not my favourite, but evidently a lot of others favourite as this is one of my most complimented fragrances in my collection."
Explorer,08/04/2025,rah835,M,9,,1,Aventus Alternative,"After some research, I settled on Explorer as an alternative to Aventus. I love Aventus, but don't want to blow through my bottle too quickly due to the price, so I bought Explorer as a substitute for a typical day.

When I first tried it, and especially when I first tried it on, I was very surprised at just how similar it is to Aventus. The one thing I noticed is that it lacked the pineapple sweetness that is so prominent in my Aventus. Comparing them side by side, it is also a little more harsh, and leans a little more into the masculine side. However, I asked to people (women) to blind smell them both and tell me which they prefer, one preferred Aventus, and the other preferred Explorer because it was a little more poignant.

I got a 200ml bottle for about $115 at a retailer. To me, the scent and the bottle quality at that cost is a great deal. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to last as long on my skin as Aventus. Overall great value, and if you like Aventus, a great alternative."
Explorer,02/20/2024,SimplyWil,M,3,,1,So Close..,"I absolutely adore the smell of this cologne. It's fresh, and woody, with a slight smell of leather. This is a fragrance you could easily wear in nearly every occasion. The price is also amazing. After all these amazing things this seems like an obvious purchase right? Not so fast. Sadly this suffers greatly in its longevity and projection. If you're okay with your cologne becoming a skin scent within an hour, and then completely leaving your body in 4-5 hours, then this is a great purchase. However, if you're looking for an amazing everyday fragrance that performs well, this isn't for you. Overall I would still recommend this cologne for those who love the smell, but I believe there are other better options with a similar price tag.

Scent 8.5/10

Longevity 5/10

Sillage 6/10

Value 7/10"
Explorer,01/17/2021,Zah1231,M,4,,0,Not for me,"I don't own Aventus so can't comment on the similarity. The smell is good, but very weak. It projects for only about 30 mins or so. Longevity is ok, 3-4 hours as a skin scent. Overall, not happy at all."
Explorer,07/23/2025,Killsocket,M,29,,1,Exploring Explorer,"My first and last blind buy....

Opens with citrus and herbal spices. Leather sort of hints around by the heart combined with a clean vetiver note . Dries down to a peppery musk.

I mean, it's that simple. It will be my only blind buy, not because it's bad, because it's not. But I don't want to gamble of average scents like this.

Obvious comparisons are to Aventus and having smelled both, I get the comparisons, but isn't a 1:1 match. A pretty well constructed scent for the price."
Explorer,03/24/2025,micmerc,M,4,,1,Great Scent,"Looking for a Creed Aventus Clone? This isn't it. Don't get me wrong, it's a really great scent, it's just not creed.

If I were to describe this, I'd say put 50% creed aventus in a bottle and 50% dior sauvage in the same bottle and you'd get Mont Blanc Explorer. It's a nice fresh every day kind of scent. Unoffensive, versatile, easy grab.

I like it, it's worth a sniff, maybe you'll like too."
Explorer,02/14/2024,Gfxdaddy,M,5,,1,"Great frag, but performance severely lacking …","Aventus DNA, but not an Aventus copy or clone — it’s in its own distinct lane. All-year round citrus freshie that’s inoffensive and very office-friendly. Lacks performance, even for a freshie, my only criticism of this fragrance; on my skin lasts just over an hour before settling into a skin-scent for another hour before I’d need to reapply. I imagine it would last a little longer on clothes. I’d probably gift this but won’t be re-adding it to the rotation as the performance leaves a lot to be desired."
Explorer,09/11/2024,Monstaro,M,41,,1,"Slightly above average scent, slightly below average performance","Fruity/citrus but not overly bright, sweet or fizzy. More succulent and bold. It's pretty nice. I haven't smelled aventus but I can definitely sense a pineapple in here. It's kind of an earthy, bold, fruity fragrance. It's my introduction to this type of DNA and it's definitely its own type.

I've worn this in a few different settings. I don't love it as a daily driver especially when I'm working. But I do love it when I'm out of the house. With friends, or general outdoor recreation. It's a happy scent. You can layer it with something like anOther 13 if you want to make it a bit bolder.

Does not last long...like at all, which is also why I like to layer with anOther, since that one lasts a while and keeps some of the Explorer with it. But it's okay, for the settings I prefer Explorer in, I don't want it to be overwhelming. Just some nice whiffs.

Fairly safe blind buy, but may or may not blow you away. To me, it was a blind buy, and it's overall pretty average, but definitely on the nicer and higher end side of average."
Explorer,04/13/2025,cht,M,7,,1,Insane quality for its price,"Montblanc Exporer was my second ever purchase. At first I get a pretty sharp peppery opening, but this calms down quickly and transitions into the bergamot and ambroxan, which I feel are the most prominent notes for me. Super easy to wear, might be a bit weak on the sillage for some, but if you like a more understated scent, this is perfect.

The quality for the price is really good too, you can get a 200ml bottle for 60 euros on discount"
Explorer,08/28/2025,skirby0203,M,8,,1,Awesome scent to men,"awesome scent, i can really pickup the pink pepper in the beginning as well as that citrus smell. I find most of my male friends love this on me(no homo) but me and my brothers girlfriends both told us we smell like grass!! so id say overall 70% of people should enjoy the smell of this, but it may be hit or miss when talking about just women. The bottle is super cool too, one of my favorite bottles in my collection. i was able to snag 200ml for 60$ on jomashop"
Explorer,07/19/2025,Janrav26,M,10,,1,That pineapple note,"The opening act of Explorer is where the overlap with Aventus is going to be the most noticeable. Do the two smell alike? Yes, but let’s get the differences out of the way, and focus on Explorer in this post.

That pineapple note from Aventus is absent. Along with, the birch wood. Explorer isn’t nearly as sharp, deep, or smoky as the Creed fragrance. Also, no vanilla undertones. But, as a woody citrus cologne? Quite similar in terms of aroma.

Explorer starts off with its bergamot citrus note and it’s fresh spices. I mainly get the sage, but there is also a prominent pink pepper.

Underneath this, sits leather, ambroxan, wood, and vetiver. It comes across as bright and fresh with the a level of smoothness.

To me, the leather and cacao notes in the base, also give Explorer a resemblance to Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme. The D&G has tonka bean and tobacco, instead, but shares the citrus, sage, and it also has a pepper note.

It’s not too complex. The final dry down has less of the citrus and pepper and more woods and a somewhat chocolatey finish from the cacao note. Definitely doesn’t have the same depth or development as Aventus."
Explorer,06/23/2025,WZ05,M,22,,1,More Spreadsheet Than Safari,"The opening notes in Explorer made me sigh in disappointment. As I continue learning and understanding my note preferences better, this one just wouldn’t make the list right off the bat.

It opens with a strong burst of vetiver, along with some other deep, unrecognisable notes that evolve into that classic masculine scent I dread the most. I'm still on the fence with vetiver. For now, I can tolerate Haitian vetiver, but not its woodier, deeper counterpart, Java vetiver. Fortunately, the vetiver in Explorer is Haitian, and it does become more subtle and toned down over time.

The bergamot disappears almost instantly. I couldn’t help but chuckle; it vanished like a breeze. Ambroxan steps in, replacing vetiver as the lead solo until the very end. It’s quite linear from start to finish, and I can definitely catch a bit of that Sauvage vibe.

My nose is still pretty green, and right now I’m leaning more towards freshies, so it makes sense why this one isn’t really hitting for me.

I expected bolder notes or riskier transitions, especially for something marketed as an ‘Explorer’ but it turned out to be a safe, mass-appealing ‘City Dweller’ that wouldn’t even dare venture down an alleyway, let alone the countryside."
Explorer,02/07/2023,Fynnwrld,M,2,,1,Frisches Parfum für jeden Tag,"Mont Blanc Explorer ist ein Parfum, für jeden Tag und jede Jahreszeit. Für wenig Geld bekommt man hier einen Frischen Duft.
Er ist sehr künstlich, was manche stört. Außerdem hält er nicht all zu lange, nach 4-5h ist er nahezu weg, also am besten in ein Travelzerstäuber umfüllen und dann wieder auftragen.

Für den Preis bekommt man ein gutes Produkt welches aber nicht mit Aventus Creed zu vergleichen ist, da manche diesen als Klon oder Dupe bezeichnen."
Explorer,10/17/2025,dfragrance,M,10,,2,"Interpretation of Aventus, yet it stands on its own","Explorer can be characterized as an interpretation of Aventus, yet it stands as an independent fragrance distinguished by its light and aromatic qualities, enhanced by the notes of bergamot, vetiver, and patchouli. It is an ideal fragrance for both everyday wear and formal occasions, exuding a smooth and masculine scent. While not overpowering, its presence is subtle and noticeable throughout the day. Wearing this fragrance is not intended to impress others; rather, it is a personal choice for enhancing one’s aroma. Unlike fragrances sought after for compliments, Explorer simply captures attention in a positive way.

Explorer is particularly suitable for office wear or travel due to its moderate intensity. Its projection is not overly strong, lasting approximately two hours at arm length, and its longevity is approximately five to six hours, with a lingering skin scent of Ambroxan thereafter."
Explorer,07/21/2025,Mattydoel,M,4,,1,Pretty good masculine fragrance,"I have never smelled the real Creed Aventus so I cannot compare the two but while I enjoy this scent, it does not blow me away. It is very fresh in the opening and then it becomes this masculine scent. While the price is certainly a standout and the bottle is quite nice for me this is just not signature worthy. Longevity is very good I can still pick it up after 10 hours."
Explorer,07/31/2024,Jpgglazer,M,6,,1,it’s alright,"this is okay it smells similar to aventus and it’s inexpensive but it hardly lasts it’s worth the extra money to just get aventus if you like the dna, but if you’d rather get this i wouldn’t recommend it for anything other than going to the gym or running quick errands. i need more characters but there’s nothing else to say ignore this"
Explorer,12/13/2020,MPLondon,M,4,,0,I explored the explorer,"After good word of mouth and reading reviews and similarities with creed etc I thought to try out this perfume. With a fair price I thought why not?
Tbh it's a nice smelling fragrance but it does not last long. You can get a bit of headache with this too. I will keep this review short and give this a ratinf of 3.5 /5. Club de nuit is far better"

My nose is untouched by the Creed primus, and so I dare to draw an unbiased conclusion based on my personal taste. The fragrance is predominantly torn apart as a dupe and, in my opinion, has a worse reputation that does not do it justice at all. The first time I sprayed it on a strip in the duty-free..."
Explorer,03/22/2019,Mdan87,M,5,,14,The Affordable Aventus for Non-Smokers,"Mont Blanc Explorer is the first fragrance for which a statement simply isn't enough.

I had already tried a sample of Aventus and was torn. This interesting scent kept coming to my nose, but then there was also that smoky note that reminded me of damp ashtrays. Unfortunately, I realized that as a former smoker, I just don't like smoky fragrances at all. The same goes for By the Fireplace or Noir Ambre.
Aventus therefore ""failed"" for me. The same was true for me with twin fragrances or dupes.

But now finally to the Explorer. The similarity to Aventus is clearly present, but it is not a complete copy. Especially the Ambroxan sweetness at the end is noticeably different.
I am particularly pleased because the smokiness in the Explorer has been dialed back to a minimum, so it doesn't bother my sensitive non-smoker nose. What remains is that interesting note that I always found so great in Aventus.

As well-known as the DNA is here, I have never smelled it on anyone in my surroundings. Therefore, I am genuinely excited about the release.

With four sprays, I get a good sillage of three to four hours. I also noticed that the fragrance smells even better in the cloud than directly on the skin.

After that, the scent noticeably fades and lasts on me for 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature. It could be better, but it's not bad either.

In my opinion, the fragrance can be worn by any man from about 25 years old (I find it too mature for younger ones). It can be worn on any occasion except for sports.

I really like the bottle, and the sprayer is also fine. There's nothing to complain about.

For me, Explorer will be my leather jacket fragrance for spring and summer this year.

Conclusion :
I recommend Explorer to anyone who likes the Aventus DNA but, like me, doesn't want the smokiness and instead can handle a bit of mainstream sweetness."
Explorer,04/16/2019,DerDefcon,M,132,,15,"Considering the price, it's good.","It was a torture, it was tedious, it was exhausting. Out there, it seems there are actually more perfume enthusiasts than one can imagine. The new scent from Mont Blanc simply did not want to be tested by me. No matter where I was - Karstadt, Douglas, Galeria Kaufhof - everywhere the testers were empty. The hype surrounding the fragrance as the ultimate Aventus clone seems to be real.

Well, I actually found a store where there were still minimal remnants of the scent in the bottle. After the third attempt, one is allowed to be lucky. The procedure of first using a test strip and then weighing whether to bless one's wrist with the scent was skipped. Instead, it went straight to the wrist.
I was truly amazed at how well the top note is done here. It really smells almost 1:1 like Aventus. I am not the biggest fan of it - I already mentioned this in another comment. It is indeed a good scent that always works, but it hasn't blown me away. For me, it is a little bit sour and could be a bit softer. Over time, it does become a bit softer and slightly smoky, which is also pleasing, but I still maintain that this is not a scent for which I would lay down several hundred euros. The Explorer is a significantly cheaper alternative here, but it doesn't quite reach Creed's bestseller. Why is that?

I already wrote that the top note, to my nose, is almost exactly what I also perceive in Aventus - namely a very fruity, yet slightly sour, piercing affair, where one hopes that something changes a little bit. While Aventus became a bit softer, but still not as much as I wish, the Explorer remains very linear. The bergamot is omnipresent, but it does experience a little bit of contrast as vetiver comes in slightly and adds some freshness. The next and also last big step is the Ambroxan, where I was afraid that it would be used as excessively as in Dior Sauvage EdP. Fortunately, that was not the case, but still, something else could have been used instead of Ambroxan to imitate the slight smokiness of Aventus. Unfortunately, the Ambroxan brings a certain, albeit not overwhelming, synthetic quality that is not particularly bothersome but is still noticeable, which results in the Explorer not reaching Creed's level. Aventus is simply more rounded, more sovereign, and above all - and this is the crucial point - a bit softer in the scent development - not by much, but still perceptibly so. Thus, Mont Blanc's new creation always has a slight scratchy undertone that diminishes the overall impression a bit. One must still acknowledge the really good price-performance ratio. Because considering the price, this Mont Blanc is not that much worse. Despite my criticism, it is better than many other mainstream options (like Sauvage, for example). The longevity is also very good, considering that fruity scents always have a bit more to struggle with. There is also nothing to complain about in terms of projection, as it projects absolutely sufficiently.
Conclusion: It doesn't quite reach Creed's cash cow, as it shines through increased sovereignty and roundness. If I had to choose between the two scents, I wouldn't choose either, as my taste is not 100 percent met here. However, if I were forced to choose one of the two scents and had to spend my own money on it, I would definitely go for the Explorer, as the differences in everyday life, while focusing on other essential things alongside the scent, are only marginal."
Explorer,08/22/2020,61K,M,5,,29,No fragrance to write fairy tales about...,"but a solid everyday scent that swims along with the current of the times.
In fact, I am someone who enjoys writing stories about fragrances and letting them take me on a journey, but with this one, it just doesn’t work. The scent progression is about as linear as a broomstick, and reading the notes feels like just having taken half a box of Hoggar™ Night.

“Laaaangweilig!” many are now shouting, and they are right, because they are perfume lovers with an ""eLeGaNt TaSte"" who probably douse themselves in Andy Tauer every day. They say Explorer is copied, “How can anyone like this? Yuck! Ugh! Never! 1 star!”

In reality, however, it looks different. Most people are not elite noses and simply do not care about the rarity or uniqueness of a fragrance; they just want to smell good for half a day, and for that, Explorer is perfect.

Fruity-fresh with a bit of smoke and vetiver for character, great longevity and sillage, and all for little money:
Your friends like it
Your parents like it
Your bank account likes it
and especially Chantal from the secretariat likes it ;)
only you don’t like it because your ego won’t allow you to appreciate something from the mainstream. Sad, really."
Explorer,11/22/2020,Basti87,M,1062,,27,Pleasant Fresh Cheapie in Aventus Style,"Something new from me. Like most fragrances that resemble Aventus, scents quickly come into the spotlight. This one too. I briefly tested it a few months ago, and now I have a small 30ml bottle in my collection. This small bottle is very affordable online, and even the larger bottles are not too expensive. Montblanc is a brand I find quite likable with a great range. Anyone..."
Explorer,03/20/2019,Jilly,M,14,,12,Aventus? No.,"Not quite. Let's put it into perspective. It's the nephew.
After my rather attention-grabbing comment on Aventus, here’s one about a supposed clone. Of course, I had to get a sample (thanks Kitho!) - the Explorer is currently all the rage.
This time, I took an analytical approach. Sprayed it on. Hmm, I smell nothing - so I had to resort to a paper towel. Sprayed the paper. Uh yeah, it’s masculine. I get a fresh pineapple note and a lot of spicy/peppery elements. Good. Set the sample aside and did some sports first. I should mention that I sprayed three fragrances on different cloths and they all lay in my kitchen. While I was working out, I kept getting a little breeze, and it smelled strongly of Explorer. The other two fragrances didn’t register at all (they were Atkinsons samples). I was already aware of a certain polarizing effect. It’s room-dominant and has a decent sillage. Good - showered and then thought I’d just give it a try. Sprayed on - 4 full sprays and off to the dentist. In the car, I could constantly smell myself. It wasn’t unpleasant. I had a mental battle with the pineapple (I still don’t like it) in combination with the masculine undertone that comes strongly from the Ambroxan (vetiver, pepper, patchouli, and Akigalawood). Unfortunately, I don’t notice any leather.
Well, off to the dentist. The dental assistant was taken by my perfume. I’ve never experienced that before, but it was an interesting experience....
Back home. Scent assessment: still smells the same as at the beginning ;).
Update: 9 hours later and I can still smell myself. The longevity is thus already at an extreme level.
However, when I got home, I couldn’t resist applying Aventus on my right arm and Explorer on my left for a direct comparison:
Aventus: not sweet, rather fresh, help, the pineapple is there and there’s musk. I still don’t like it :(. Too old, too heavy...
Explorer: sweeter than Aventus, fresh pineapple, the vetiver plays a stronger role here and the Ambroxan does its best. It’s brighter and sweeter but already quite similar to Aventus in the top notes.
In the drydown, it becomes clearer. Explorer remains sweeter, fresher, and for me has no noticeable smoky/leather note. There’s more synthetic quality here than with Aventus. When I look at the price-performance ratio, I don’t have much more to say. Explorer will soon join my collection as a full bottle.
Test it yourself - if you don’t like Aventus, you might find something to enjoy here.
P.S.: Note to myself - I’m slowly warming up to “pineapples” - um, the plural of pineapple, I guess... maybe also to “pineapple nuts” ;)."

Explorer,02/20/2020,MKopinec,M,4,,9,Inspired? Leaning? Imitated? - As long as it smells good!,"Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the similarity to Creed Aventus, as I haven't had the opportunity to test it yet. A comparison with Sauvage? - Well. I have to admit that I've received reactions about how good I smell like Dior Sauvage while wearing Explorer more than once. For an untrained nose, which is unfortunately (because I also think Sauvage is great) flooded by the world of young men wearing Sauvage, this is not objectionable. There is a certain similarity.
The opening of Explorer is slightly fruity and pleasant, which does fade a bit over time, but makes the further development of the scent - which heads towards Sauvage - a bit more playful and lighter. This is also the reason why I believe Explorer can definitely be worn during the day and on warmer days without leaving a ""heavy"" scent.
Visually, the bottle of Montblanc Explorer is definitely an eye-catcher! Sturdy, simple, and the artificial leather? really adds to it, especially suitable if you like to wear black.
Longevity and sillage could be better, but the scent experience for me is definitely a 10/10!

Final thought: Is it really that important whether a fragrance might be inspired by another or ""imitated""? Perhaps for the perfumer, I won't dispute that. For me as a user? Definitely not! Because in the end, we all want to wear perfumes that we like!"
Explorer,03/08/2019,MajorTom,M,108,,13,"Mass or Class, Mainstream or Niche?","One thing you have to give to the Montblanc people: when they do something, they do it properly. And I mean really properly, typically German, I am inclined to say, and certainly with a penchant for perfection.

This starts with the writing instruments, which are not only visually impressive but also top-notch in their craftsmanship. When I first came into contact with the brand's watches, I was more than skeptical. However, I was quickly proven wrong after I had the chance to watch a watchmaker from the Swiss canton of Jura work while inserting the spring. Manufacture instead of Eta movement, great craftsmanship like that of the fountain pen nibs, so here too, no skimping but going all out. And then the first fragrances. At first, I was still on the track of ""a strong brand that now wants to squeeze the last cent out of the consumer."" But: I found the ""Legend"" convincing (and thus it found a place in my home), so I was quite curious about the ""Explorer.""

The Explorer starts a bit impetuously; the bergamot quickly gives way to a fine blend of leather and vetiver. And then Ambroxan spreads out, and quite a lot of it. You can like it or not; I do, and in combination with patchouli, I find the dry down simply well done.

Many say that it is all synthetic and therefore of inferior quality. Of course, Ambroxan is fully synthetic nowadays (and can, depending on which synthetic pathway was chosen, be of quite appealing quality). Ultimately, perfumes are products of experts in the laboratories of Givaudan, Firmenich, IFF..... anyone who has ever watched a chemist at work at these producers starts to wonder what we are spraying on ourselves daily and what kind of food we are putting into our bodies.

But, to return to the Explorer, these are not the cheap, inferior outputs from some reactors that equip so many shower gels with some scent, but here, brand-typical, they have approached it with a certain minimum requirement for quality. This is also reflected, for example, in the above-average longevity on my skin and a sillage that can let your surroundings know, hello, I have a new fragrance. The look and feel of the bottle are simple, elegant, and 100% brand-authentic.

My conclusion: A successful further excursion by Montblanc into the world of perfumes. Price-wise and qualitatively, in my opinion, it is exactly in the middle between niche and mainstream. A fragrance for every day, for every watch and time of day, for every occasion. That's already quite a lot. And typically customer-friendly, as mentioned above (the Montblanc people do it properly), they have also thought of a travel spray (30ml), which has also made its way directly into my carry-on trolley.

Montblanc-typical, simply really good."
Explorer,02/27/2019,Bakerscookie,M,6,,12,"Aventus without smoke, but with Ambroxan... a bumpy experience.","A little rant: I don't understand why Montblanc decided on such a marketing move. Everything was actually going great!? Legend Spirit and Individual are, if we set aside the bottles, quite good fragrances in the designer sector. So why does Montblanc feel the need to copy Creed Aventus? I just don't get it.

The scent itself is, as has been mentioned in several other comments, a kind of mix between Aventus and Sauvage... at least in the drydown. Because to be fair, I must admit that in the first 90 minutes, there is hardly any Aventus present, and the parallels only show up later. It's as if I have a fruitier version of Aventus in front of me, where ambergris has been swapped for Ambroxan and where the smoke is missing or the woods have been toned down. Explorer starts fresh-spicy with a hefty dose of Ambroxan, then after a while, it increasingly shifts towards Aventus. Except for the hefty dose of Ambroxan, which remains very prominent for a long time.

For me, a lot of things just don't fit together. Aventus is so much finer and more balanced, more transparent and complex, and so beautifully LIGHT simply. This one never comes close for me. It just feels synthetic and cheap, the Ambroxan doesn't fit and is too present. Explorer is only worth a blind buy if the fragrance eventually falls into the same price segment as Legend or Individual. I hope I can get rid of it again without losing too much value... :-D"

Explorer,02/16/2019,Haitauer,M,1,,10,The King is Dead.,"That's it.
Over.
Final.

What has been troubling me for a while is now a fact. Aventus is mainstream and on its way to meet a similar fate as so many before it.

For years, I was infatuated with JPG Le Male in the 90s. When the wear became apparent, I satisfied my urge for individuality for years with Allure Homme Sport. And I had grown fond of Dior Homme Intense; it was my signature.

Aventus was my entry into niche fragrances; it had everything I was looking for: strong performance, unique DNA, and a scent that always fits.

Since I received Montblanc Explorer as a gift, I know that it's over. Anyone can buy Aventus now. And they will. My search starts all over again...

Explorer is from the start Aventus, with a bit more citrus and synthetics.
But the longevity and a bit more leather make it almost more interesting than the original.
I will continue to test it because I still like the composition. Only the pride and the feeling will be different from now on.

Goodbye King, it was a great time with you..."
Explorer,09/23/2020,Alex54,M,13,,11,"Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité","Liberté:
The freedom to develop a fragrance that should smell as the marketing suggests. Whether it is to be a 1:1 copy of the original or a ""inspired"" scent. As far as I know, everything is allowed when it comes to the pure fragrance. But now let's get to THIS scent.
Explorer opens with a juicy bergamot, pepper, and a small amount of sage (at least to my nose). I would describe the top note as fruity - fresh, and for untrained noses in the local perfumery, this is certainly a convincing argument. The heart note in the form of leather and vetiver quickly comes to the forefront, and the Eau de Parfum immediately feels a bit more masculine. In the base note, Ambroxan and Akigalawood join in. From this point on, it is supposed to smell like the one it is ""inspired"" by. In conclusion, it only feels dry and woody. The longevity on my skin is about 5.5 hours and the sillage is 1.5 hours. For an Eau de Parfum, I find the longevity a bit disappointing.

Égalité:
I wouldn't claim that Explorer is a clone, as it lacks many fragrance notes like the prominent pineapple, apple, and blackcurrant. The birch, which gives Aventus its slightly smoky note, is also missing. Nevertheless, one must admit that the drydown surprisingly reminds untrained noses of Aventus.

Fraternité:
Solidarity in the sense that more and more people wish for an Aventus for the slimmer wallet. Those who like this type of fragrance DNA can go for Explorer, as it is mass-appealing, unobtrusive, and affordable. It brings compliments and is a good all-rounder.
In conclusion, it must be noted that it cannot compete with Aventus. BUT it doesn't have to as a budget-friendly alternative."
Explorer,07/17/2020,Sockosophie,M,8,,13,"The king is dead, long live the king","If a perfume were to hold the status of ""god-king"" within the community, it would probably be Aventus.
You can feel however you like about it, as opinions are known to differ. However, each of us can still acknowledge the titan status of this rather fickle beauty.

But when a perfume is so good that the myth surrounding it calls forth an armada of imitations, that is indeed concerning. Aventus remains the most copied fragrance in the world, and the original is increasingly falling into disrepute.

Naysayers would claim that Creed, in their hubris, is summoning the downfall of their house, and they wouldn't be entirely wrong.

This brings us to Explorer, as there has never been a designer clone of Aventus, marking a milestone in the history of men's fragrances.
Regarding the scent itself:

Explorer starts with a combination of bergamot, ambroxan, and akigalawood, and when you look at these and other notes, you don't necessarily come to the conclusion of what is actually being attempted here.

No pineapple, no apple, no blackcurrant, and no birch tar, and yet: after the first sniff, I could have immediately told you what this is supposed to be.

Explorer is more synthetic than Aventus, of lower quality, but no less pleasing. The top notes are undeniably pleasant for untrained noses and a stroke of genius considering that ""normal"" customers do not wait for the heart and base notes, provided a fragrance does not unfold non-linearly.

As it dries down, the bergamot takes a backseat, and what emerges is a typically synthetic men's wood scent, like those found in every drugstore. It lacks everything that makes other clones something special.

The longevity is decent at 6-7 hours. After one to one and a half hours of mediocre projection, it transitions to a skin-close level. For a fresh scent at this price, that's quite alright.

It definitely makes an impression right away, especially in the first hour, but the longer you wear it, the more banal it becomes. I actually have enough ""crowd-pleaser"" fragrances that this one didn't really need to be there.

Explorer marks a turning point for me: Aventus is no longer a niche fragrance.
Even if the copy is meager, it is still a copy and indicates how much we have reached the end of the line here.

Aventus had a good decade, but perhaps we can now lay it to rest, let it enter the annals, and wait for the next holy ""grail fragrance.""

Explorer,06/20/2024,Cambro,M,5,,19,Why do people buy CDNIM when this one is available?,"So right off the bat, anyone who likes Aventus and is looking for a fragrance that represents the same kind of perfume and is generally a bit more approachable should go for this scent. I would say MB Explorer is not an exact copy but rather a really good fragrance.

I had CDNIM myself and I somewhat fell for the hype; at first, I thought it was soooo great, but no, Club de Nuit is the product of a HYPE and influencer scene that sells people a strong feeling and not a good product. CDNIM is one thing, and that is LOUD, which the original simply is not. I have a 2019 batch of Aventus at home, and I must say that CDNIM does hit some notes and overall is similar to Aventus, more so than the Explorer. As a musician myself, I want to make a comparison that targets the same mistake many buyers make with fragrances:

!!!!!LOUD IS NOT BETTER, IT'S JUST LOUDER!!!!

Many people buy ultra, extremely super bass headphones and speakers and associate that with good sound; if something is loud or extreme, then it is automatically better. But that's just not the case. Anyone who has heard a really good sound system with a well-produced song will notice that the bass, mids, and highs are all there, and indeed all of them are balanced and not overly exaggerated but just well mixed. Everything is clear and easily audible, and above all, you can hear every accent and every note without it being overshadowed by unnecessary bass thumping. So much for that......

And that’s exactly the issue with Club de Nuit Intense Man; Aventus has lemon/bergamot? Okay, we’ll throw everything we have in there, and while it may smell like mosquito spray, the CUSTOMER WANTS MORE, MORE, MORE and not good. Fine smoky aroma from birch? Okay, we just give the customer the feeling they are in the middle of a forest fire. Longevity? Well, then we’ll just skimp on the quality of the oils, for MORE, MORE, MORE!!!!! And every time someone walks by me wearing the scent, it smells like Aventus mixed with mosquito spray and toilet cleaner. And that’s the problem: fragrances/dupes should be as similar as possible and much longer-lasting than the original, but whether it’s a good fragrance in itself is irrelevant. In other words, if CDNIM existed but Aventus did not, no one would buy CDNIM. Because it’s simply not well blended. But precisely because there is Aventus and the hype, customers buy it because it is so much LOUDER (POWERRRR!!!!!!) than the original and cheaper. But sorry, the scent is really only decent after 5 hours, so I think, okay, that’s how I would wear it, still not a super awesome fragrance, but okay. The same goes for all the Dior Sauvage clones that smell like toilet sprays, but at least you can smell the person from 15 meters away, and they all smell the same with that one synthetic note.

Now to Mont Blanc Explorer. No annoying opening, pleasant citrus note, oh wow, even a slight pineapple, slightly woody, slightly herbal, and above all, smooooth. All notes are balanced; none overpower the others. Fresh, not heavy, pleasant, and yet not boring...... Summer 2024 can come. And the best part, in contrast to CDNIM, you actually get compliments with this one because it’s simply a good fragrance, so Creed Aventus as a designer fragrance, and that’s totally okay because it’s rounded and good without being unnecessarily expensive. And the best part is yet to come: I wear it more often than the original now because it fits everywhere. Disco, bar, gym, university, work,.....

Sorry, but CDNIM is just hype. Aaron Terence Hughes (a real perfumer) also made a video about all the Aventus clones, and he said that MB Explorer is simply nicer and rounder.

Explorer,05/21/2020,Medianus76,M,32,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,What Remains of the Day...,"I have become a relatively new resident and a true fan of this community, and have been fascinated by great fragrances my whole life.
Now I want to write down my impressions, but about the Explorer, as there are already so many reviews about Aventus. However, I want to compare both fragrances.
I received the Explorer as a sample card, and was already impressed after the first test how much it reminded me of Aventus. I sprayed the fragrance for work, relatively little, but I could perceive the scent well throughout the day.
That's why I wanted to compare both fragrances, Aventus and Explorer, directly via test strips. I came to the following impressions...

For me, the Explorer starts off very strongly alcoholic. It has an almost piercing note.
From the typical Aventus scent, I can't perceive much on the test strip yet. Rather, almost nothing.
When I then sprayed Aventus on a test strip, this phenomenally wonderful fruity pineapple vibe immediately came through...simply outstanding.
I couldn't detect that with the Explorer.
Also, the overall presence and radiance of Aventus is much stronger. This characteristic of Aventus remains in the foreground, especially in the initial phase.
As time goes on...as I said on test strips, the characteristic scent of the Explorer slowly develops more. However, I notice another thing very strongly. And I can always pinpoint this with Creed fragrances. It is this wonderful creaminess. I’ll just call it that, because Aventus feels so soft and smooth compared to the Explorer.
This means that the Explorer is and remains simply more angular.
Nevertheless, the Explorer catches up over time. The scent becomes more tangible and present, which leads to a relative alignment of both fragrances as time goes on. At least according to my perception.
I think that the Explorer, when considered as a whole, definitely smells great. I also like it in terms of longevity and sillage. Even at the end of the day, I can still perceive it well.

To answer my headline, what remains of the day is a scent that is quite similar to Aventus, which is probably hardly distinguishable from the great original in everyday use. When you also consider the price component, I find the Explorer worth considering.
Nevertheless, I miss the presence, the glow, and also the creaminess of the original..."
Explorer,03/12/2019,DermüdeJoe,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Similar to the original yet unique,"So, let me try my hand at my first comment.

I already have three fragrances (Legend, Legend Spirit, and Individuel) from Montblanc in my collection, of which the last two were blind buys. However, I like all three.
A few weeks ago, I discovered an advertisement for the new Explorer. I looked it up online and checked out its fragrance notes. My curiosity was piqued, and I quickly ordered it.
When it arrived, I immediately liked the bottle. Certainly, there are more beautiful and higher-quality ones, but this one is really well done by the creators at Montblanc.
But let's get to the scent itself.
From the very beginning, it smells very much like Aventus, which intensifies after a while. Towards the end, however, it develops its own unique scent note that sets it apart from Aventus. This is very pleasant and likable, as it does not merely represent a dupe scent but also has something of its own. As a dupe, I find it very successful, if not one of the best, even though it lacks the smoky note, which is not necessarily required.
The longevity and sillage are very solid. On me, the scent lasted 7-8 hours.
Price-performance ratio is top-notch.
In my opinion, a great new fragrance from Montblanc."
Explorer,10/12/2021,Highcell,M,37,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,The Better Inspiration,"Often mentioned and recommended from the social media stage, and always referred to as a ""clone"" of the big brother from Creed, I couldn't help but give it a try.

I was quite familiar with the big brother and could never fully understand the hype surrounding it. Sure, Aventus has its charms ... but perhaps this scent just isn't for me, which is why I could only muster a shrug: ""Nice enough, but not for that price."" Stone me for that.

After work, I like to stroll into the usual fragrance shops. And then there was the frequently mentioned Explorer on the shelf next to all the other designer fragrances at a price that, due to its mentions, should be worth a test on the skin. I sprayed it on, and the opening immediately reminded me of its mentioned predecessor, but with a more citrusy twist. However, during the drive home, I had that typical scent moment, having to bring my wrist to my nose again and again to ""sniff"" - that is the crucial indicator for me when it comes to a purchase - the ""wanting to smell it again"" feeling versus all rationalities.

The Explorer is certainly inspired, but in my feeling, it is not a clone, but an independent fragrance. It is more reserved, subtle, and gentle. What I appreciate much more about it are its individual notes in the mid and dry down. Stone me a second time, but I would prefer the Explorer over its predecessor - completely independent of longevity, price, or anything similar. I simply like it more because it could evoke more than just a shrug."
Explorer,05/08/2021,Sebbusch,M,8,,8,Ambroxplorer,"In search of an everyday fragrance, I decided on a blind buy of this scent, which I managed to snag at a low price in a 30 ml travel bottle. And yet, it was a mistake.

The scent smells far too unnaturally artificial to me.

I don’t even want to describe the notes further because I smell dominant Ambroxan in all phases. I would even go so far as to question the expertise of anyone who considers this fragrance successful.

To end on a positive note: The idea of the fragrance is good. The notes used are sensibly combined, paving the way for a successful scent. However, in my opinion, it fails in its execution."
Explorer,10/15/2022,Lecker234,M,27,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Lonely Peak of the Aventus Clones,"For me, this is by far the most pleasant of all Aventus clones. I would even go so far as to say that I prefer it to Aventus itself.

Why the best clone?

No overpowering citrus, but a pleasant, well-tolerated bergamot - which at no point is as piercing as the lemon in Armaf's Club de Nuit Intense, which never lets up throughout. In contrast, Montblanc Explorer: After the top note, the citrus subsides, which would also become too much for me in the long run, and a pleasant fresh-smoky note develops, which occasionally reminds me of the scent concept behind Dior Sauvage.

So: Less ""Club de Nuit"" shouting, better to reach for this far more tolerable fragrance."
Explorer,02/17/2019,Vladiii,M,2,,3,"Creed Aventus, Dior Sauvage or Zara Vibrant Leather?","Just a day ago, I secured a sample of Creed Aventus. Yesterday, I was in Düsseldorf and had the chance to pick up Montblanc Explorer at a bargain price to compare it with my other clones.

The surprise is that it smells like a copy of a copy. To my nose, it smells like Zara's Vibrant Leather! If you want to be precise (Sauvage + Vibrant Leather + a bit of smoke)

For those looking for an Aventus copy, I clearly recommend Club de Nuit or Rasasi pour Lui Zebra. This scent, while similar to Aventus, is more of a knockoff of a knockoff, which, by the way, still smells pretty good."
Explorer,05/02/2020,DomCorleone,M,5,,6,A copy is never as good as the original,"I bought the fragrance a year ago in the hope of finding a cheaper alternative to Creed Aventus.
The opening is very reminiscent of Aventus and quickly convinced me. A third of the price and no difference to be recognized?! Well... too early to celebrate: Because in the drydown, Explorer gains (or rather loses) its individuality and develops a strange, cheap-chemical bite.
The more often I wore the fragrance, the more this ""chemical bomb"" bothered me. Even as a standalone scent, I wouldn't be able to recommend this Montblanc.

Bottle/ Packaging:
Wow, what a great presentation. Montblanc really doesn't have to hide here. A very high-quality looking bottle rounded off by a heavy, anthracite-colored cap. The spray button works excellently and sprays what I consider to be just the right amount of the content.

The fragrance:
The opening is very fruity and, a rascal who thinks ill, just like Creed Aventus. That's how you catch buyers... unfortunately, like me too.
However, the drydown is very chemical in nature and at least has its own scent character. However, it doesn't come across as particularly high-quality. The longevity is decent for a fresh scent, though not outstanding. The price/performance ratio is still good.

Conclusion:
For ""just going shopping"" or as a cheap all-rounder, Explorer by Montblanc is not a bad choice.
However, no miracles are to be expected, and it is definitely not an alternative to Aventus.
Especially the bottle is excellently designed and makes a statement. In the end, however, the content is decisive, and here it fails due to the unfortunately very piercing chemical bomb at the end of the opening."
Explorer,12/19/2020,Batemans,M,11,,9,Amateurs love this scent,"Yes, amateurs love this scent!! While fragrance enthusiasts are indecisive and argue about the chemistry of the scent, some regular person out there is falling in love with it. Montblanc Explorer is my best-selling fragrance, but why is that?

The Explorer simply smells masculine and fresh to me, yet still diverse. It has a really good sillage and longevity that is definitely above average. Additionally, it comes in a nice, high-quality bottle, and last but not least, the truly unbeatable price; you can get this for about 30 euros for 60ml, which is really impressive for a perfume with this performance from a designer house that usually offers writing materials, backpacks, etc. for several thousand euros."
Explorer,03/11/2019,MarkCross1,M,15,,7,Ambroxan Aventus,"I was able to test the new fragrance from Montblanc - Explorer - on Saturday; the name promised a lot, the packaging and the bottle are appealing, and the sweet smile of the turquoise Mademoiselle, who praised the scent in the highest terms, promised something as well - so I applied the fragrance to my wrist and off we go; I reached for a tissue, just like with Dior's Sauvage, an ambroxan overdose that unfortunately overshadows and kills the entire fragrance, leaving a sharp sensation in the nose; otherwise, Explorer starts off citrusy and slightly spicy and later becomes a 1:1 copy of the highly praised Aventus by Creed, although not as rounded, but that is probably due to the ambroxan - I am happy for young people who do not want to spend so much money on a fragrance in the price range of Aventus, they have here a perfect fragrance twin that caters to the mainstream and has the potential to be a real hit; unfortunately for me personally, it's the wrong direction, as I am not such a big fan of Aventus either."
Explorer,11/24/2020,Qlimax,M,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Explore the Ambroxan,"The Montblanc Explorer starts off fresh upon application and quickly develops into a woody Ambroxan bomb. And bomb is really the keyword here, as the sillage is brutal. I was asked outdoors from about 1 meter away, 4 hours (!) after applying (two sprays on the neck, one behind each ear, and one in each elbow), what that wonderfully fragrant scent was and if I had showered in..."
Explorer,04/12/2019,FunkyPhoenix,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Herb Spring,"I actually just wanted to write a statement, but then I ran out of characters and wanted to get a few more things off my chest.

Explorer is, for me, a slightly herbaceous spring or summer fragrance that has an above-average longevity for a fresh scent. The fragrance itself is rather simple, but just right for my workday. From the notes, I mainly smell bergamot at first, and later Akigalawood and Ambroxan. I don't smell the sage or the cocoa at all.

Unfortunately, I had to realize in the last few days, when it finally got a bit warmer, that the Ambroxan became very overpowering and the other notes were hardly noticeable. Now I will probably only wear Explorer on cloudy days and likely relegate it to the bench in the summer."
Explorer,09/02/2022,Taurus,M,1164,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,The Inner Compass,"Everyone knows it - almost everyone appreciates it: Explorer by Montblanc is an excellent copy of Aventus. Above all, it is affordable and of consistent quality.

Recently, I had L´Aventur by Al Haramain, which I found relatively decent. However, Explorer seems to me to be significantly more refined, rounder, and a bit richer.

It starts with the lemon, which here refreshes with a slightly spritzier note, then merges into a pleasant symbiosis of synthetic background noise including Ambroxan with the other fragrance notes that are hardly distinguishable and should probably not be taken 1:1 according to the pyramid.
In between, spicy and especially fruity-fresh nuances sparkle.
Sage and vetiver components are possible, but hardly anyone would sniff them out without assistance. The same goes for patchouli, but leather and cocoa are present only in homeopathic doses. It doesn't matter, because everyone is reminded of Aventus, even if neither pineapple nor blackcurrant are mentioned.

Thus, Explorer forms a crisp summer refresher with absolute justification. One could argue whether well-copied is better than poorly composed oneself. I like it - not only because it elicits positive reactions, but because it is a pleasant companion for hot days and tropical nights. Explorer is not a classic feel-good fragrance in that sense, yet the Inner Compass appreciates it."
Explorer,04/05/2021,Theris,M,18,,4,Pineapple without Juice,"After recommendations from various YouTubers and good reviews, I went on an ""exploration.""
I got a sample and off I went.
With the first spray on my arm, my nose sensed a sense of well-being. It smelled fresh and a bit like pineapple, I liked what I smelled. After a 30-minute walk, I wanted to smell my arm again, but I couldn't smell anything anymore. At first, I thought I had forgotten where I had sprayed the stuff because I couldn't believe it. No matter how hard my nose tried, the scent was gone after 30 minutes. I tested the fragrance again at Müller, but once again, the scent was gone after 30 minutes. For others, it seems the scent lasts longer on the skin, but that's not the case for me. Unfortunately, it's a disappointment for me, even though I quite like the fragrance."
Explorer,09/02/2021,Achillez,M,2,,7,"You smell good! Oh yes, you smell good... wow, you really smell good!","Hello friends,

Yesterday, my wife gifted me this perfume for my birthday. I smelled it and was immediately fascinated because it reminded me a bit of Dior Sauvage. Since I have that at home too, I compared both and was surprisingly struck by how much I preferred the Explorer. My wife made a good choice :)
Well then: this morning at 10, I had to go to the doctor to pick up my sick note for work. As always, I had to put on a fragrance, so I decided on the Explorer. When I arrived there, I naturally had to go for the consultation and promptly received the first compliment from the doctor. Of course, I thanked her and continued on my way to work to submit the sick note. I walked into the office and immediately received more compliments, as you can read in the headline :))) I've never received so many compliments before. Totally amazed, I went home, and my colleague texted me that the office still smelled like me... I thought, huh, is the Explorer that strong? Because it was only 5 sprays, and exactly 4 and a half hours had passed, and the scent is still very present.
I am so impressed with the Explorer.
Regarding longevity, I can say after 4 and a half hours that I can still smell it, and my wife is confirming that right now.
If it lasts a good 7-9 hours, that would be great, and even if it doesn’t, the perfume is still worth the money.

I would really recommend it to everyone. In my opinion, it can be worn in any season and for all occasions, and it suits every age. It's a very masculine scent with a compliment factor.

So, conclusion after a good 11 hours:
The scent was very present after a good 5 hours. After 8 hours, it was relatively close but still noticeable. Currently, it’s the 11th hour, and it's still very close to the skin but still smells good. So either the Explorer projects wonderfully on my skin, or I got a good batch :) haha"
Explorer,05/17/2025,TheMitcher,M,13,HELPFUL REVIEW,14,The Most Beautiful 60 Minutes…,"Goodness, how good can an opening and a top note be?! The Montblanc Explorer: “Yes!”.

The well-known and popular pineapple-bergamot combination from the large and sinfully expensive model from Creed hits just as hard in this significantly cheaper version as it does in the original. The differences primarily show in the development: the Explorer feels a bit bumpier and less rounded and harmonious than the Aventus. The components blend together a bit more seamlessly in the original. If the two fragrances were cars, one would say that the gaps aren’t quite right. I hope you understand what I mean.

My predecessors hint at it: longevity is indeed not the core competence of the Explorer, but reapplying is possible without immediately booking an appointment with the insolvency administrator.

At least on my skin, after about an hour, it’s not really perceptible anymore, while others can still smell it. Up close, it becomes noticeable from 4 hours onward.

A super pleasant daily office scent, and in spring and summer, a few people will surely turn around sniffing to find out who smells so fantastic.

Clear recommendation to buy."
Explorer,09/01/2020,JayKalinka3,M,4,,5,Businessman instead of Explorer,"I noticed the scent in public. The young gentleman kindly wrote down the name and recommendation for me. A really good fragrance that enchants from the very beginning. The bergamot at the start gave me a wow effect, which I miss in many perfumes.

Fruity is rather the impression that embraces the nose upon the first sniff. The real star here takes the stage in the heart note. Haitian vetiver, rounded off by the leathery scent, and the transition to the base note with patchouli and cocoa makes the performance an unforgettable experience.

An explorer who collects the ingredients during his continuous journey and offers them to the businessman at the bustling harbor with a radiant, confident smile. The businessman carries on the scent and the legacy.

A successful perfume for the self-assured and victorious man. Montblanc, gladly again!"

The similarity to Aventus is unmistakable; however, the scent is not better. The fragrance opens with a naturally smelling bergamot note that reminds one of fruity Aventus batches.

Explorer,10/31/2024,FelixScent23,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,The Better Aventus,"In the past, I always used a leftover bottle of Aventus by Creed as my signature scent. Then there was an almost 1:1 imitation. But something always bothered me. Somehow, the DNA was too fruity for me. After a while, I always perceived a sting in my nose. And then I tried Montblanc Explorer. Instead of a fruity pineapple, we have a fresh bergamot here. The scent comes across as significantly fresher and calmer. However, it is also flatter than Aventus by Creed, which is a positive aspect for me as a daily wear. Overall, the scent is an all-rounder and can be worn at any time. On top of that, there's the unbelievably good price and many compliments, as the scent DNA is very pleasing."
Explorer,08/11/2023,Oliwood,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Montblanc Explorer - From a Mispurchase to a Valued Classic,"Back then... years ago... at the beginning of my niche discovery journey... I was on my way to the perfume store to grab Aventus when I was persuaded to give Explorer a chance. Once home, I sprayed it on and immediately put the scent up on ""eBay"" :)
However, since I didn’t want to sell it off, I kept it and must say today, after about 400 samples, that I give it at least 8-9 out of 10 fragrance points.

By now, Montblanc Explorer has undoubtedly convinced me and deserves a strong rating. This scent is well-known in competition with some big names in the scene, but it has carved out its own place and impresses with an excellent price-performance ratio.

Content-wise, one cannot help but notice the striking similarity to Creed Aventus and Armaf - Club de Nuit Intense. The refreshing combination of citrus notes and spicy accords is 95% reminiscent of these classics.

What Montblanc Explorer does just as well, if not better, is its unmistakable masculine presence. The woody nuances and the slightly smoky note give the fragrance a depth that lends it a distinctive and masculine flair. This is one of the aspects that has led me to perceive this scent as the best of the three. Similarity to Nishane - Hacivat perhaps 85%.

In terms of longevity and projection, Montblanc Explorer has also impressed me. The scent lasts for hours and can confidently be worn in the office if one wants to be noticed.

Considering the overall package, Montblanc Explorer is an amazing ""discovery."" Its similarity to top-notch fragrances like Creed Aventus, combined with its masculine aura and unbeatable price, makes it a true gem. Clearly, the uniqueness is somewhat lacking by now.

Nevertheless, for anyone looking for a high-quality fragrance that won’t break the bank, Explorer is definitely worth considering."
Explorer,02/01/2021,Mballers,M,7,,6,Clone or Standalone Candidate,"Often we ask ourselves what exactly a clone is or what can be considered standalone. In fact, the Explorer bears a strong resemblance to Aventus by Creed. But it is incorrect to refer to it as a clone; rather, it is a kind of zeitgeist fragrance. All fragrances, whether it’s Molecule 01 or even Sauvage by Dior, come dressed in the guise of aquatic freshness. It was clear that Montblanc would come up with its own offering to launch on the market. Unlike, for example, Aventus, the Explorer is available in every regular store, and the pricing practically invites you to buy. Someone once described the comparison between Porsche and Twingo; actually, the comparison should be: Porsche vs. Mazda RX-7. Both are not just cars that drive, but both are sports cars.

The Explorer even has slight advantages over Aventus in daily office use. Aventus is so high-quality that the wearer practically fills the room with its scent. With the Explorer, the sillage and longevity ensure that it lightly settles in the space. A really good colleague, indeed. Always there, not too intrusive."
Explorer,03/24/2021,Carthago911,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Compliment Magnet,"As many have already written, Explorer should not necessarily be labeled as an ""Aventus clone."" There is a certain similarity present, but it does not lean towards the smokier ""Club de Nuit.""

Sillage and longevity are okay to good, but just right for wearing the fragrance in the office. However, those hoping for a Sauvage-like performance will be disappointed. In my opinion, it could perform a bit better; then it would be nearly perfect.

Nevertheless, I have received more compliments for this fragrance than for any other. In the office, female colleagues asked me several times what a wonderful scent it is, as they would like to buy it for their partners.

The bottle looks good, but unfortunately, it is hard to see the amount of contents. Better to check several times; you don't want to end up living without it for a short time ;-). Those who like this fragrance will keep buying it again and again."

This scent is just so good for teenagers and young adults, it smells fruity fresh with a cool aftershave vibe.
After a few hours, you can smell the light leather and cocoa (could also be because I know what's inside ;) )
You can wear it anytime and anywhere, as it is strong (but not overpowering), you could even wear it in winter. However, I prefer spring/summer and autumn.

The bottle is really very stylish with this leather-like wrapping and the chic Montblanc emblem. The cap feels very high-quality and heavy, also in the shape of the Montblanc emblem."

Abel became a shepherd, Cain a farmer.
Cain brought an offering to the Lord with fruits from his field, Abel sacrificed the firstborn of his flock.
The Lord looked graciously upon Abel's offering, but not upon Cain's, and Cain was furious about it.
God noticed his anger and urged him to moderation, but Cain invited his brother to his field and killed him there.
When God asked him about Abel, he replied that he was not his brother's keeper.
God condemned him:
Because of the shedding of blood, the earth would no longer yield him fruit, and he would be a fugitive forever.
Cain went away.....

In this case, Montblanc Explorer is the younger brother of Creed Aventus, but let's not get hung up on details.
First: The bottle does not need to hide from its brother.
I must admit it has been a while since I tested Aventus, and I didn't take any notes or anything..
What I do know is that Explorer comes pretty close. There may only be nuances where Aventus is ""better"".
The crux of the matter, why the younger brother here surpasses the older one, is quite simple for me:
These nuances do not justify a price increase of over 200 euros..for that money, you can get SEVERAL other beautiful fragrances."
Explorer,04/12/2021,Homak1,M,1,,4,"So cheap, So great, Want it","I would like to dedicate my first comment to MB Explorer. I am relatively new here, but I am itching to share my thoughts since I am not quite sure what to make of the whole ""(Aventus) hype"".

First of all, I have absolutely no idea how Aventus smells. I have never smelled it. Many people talk about how great MB Explorer is, what a good price-performance ratio it has, and that it resembles Aventus quite a bit. Especially on YouTube, it is praised by influencers, and here on Parfumo or Fragrantica, it is rated very well. How closely it resembles Aventus in the end, you can probably judge better if you know both fragrances.

While searching for a new scent, I stumbled upon MB Explorer for the first time in a drugstore. I had done a bit of browsing online beforehand and knew that it was supposed to be very similar to the famous Aventus. So I sprayed it on a test strip and tried it out. I can still clearly remember what I thought: ""Well, a bit fresh and smoky. Is this how Aventus is supposed to smell? That's nothing special.""

Due to a little online shopping addiction caused by Corona, I eventually decided to buy MB Explorer for cheap. So cheap, why not treat myself even if the first impression wasn't that great. After all, it is rated very well, so the argument goes...

I received the fragrance, sprayed it on, and found that my first impression had not changed. Citrusy-fresh bergamot with ambroxan in the background. This is how the entire fragrance unfolds for me, from opening to end. Monotonous. Boring. About 1 hour of projection and 6 hours on the skin, that's it. Not detectable on clothing the next day. The bottle, by the way, is quite stylish, feels heavy in the hand, and has a quality feel to it.

I will probably test Aventus in the near future to form my own opinion. But I believe this fragrance direction simply does not suit me. Tastes are different, and maybe I will remember this next time I make impulsive purchases.

BM Explorer, in any case, will be given away."
Explorer,01/13/2021,PapNoah,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Sought and Found; the Great Love,"I stumbled upon this wonderful site quite by chance over the past year.

Since then, I have spent countless hours here in anonymous (unregistered) mode. I’ve gathered inputs, expanded my perfume horizon, and annoyed my wife when I was once again on my phone and she asked me what I was doing. ;-)
At the beginning of this year, I finally mustered all my courage and created an account.

Parfumo, thank you for existing!

So, here’s my first comment on a perfume. I’m almost a little nervous thinking about all the high-quality comments I’ve read, but it will be fine.

Montblanc Explorer, what can I say? I stumbled upon this perfume quite by chance. On a free day after Christmas, feeling a bit bored, I decided to go buy a new perfume. My wife’s enthusiasm was somewhat limited: ""What, another new perfume?!"" but I didn’t really care.

Once I arrived at the perfume store, I ran like a tiger between the shelves, looking at all the different perfumes, and suddenly my eyes stopped at the Montblanc Explorer packaging (a tester was not available). Spontaneously, as I am, I decided to buy this perfume without testing it first.
I still have the habit of buying a perfume without trying it beforehand. Sometimes I do it like with wine; nice label (or beautiful bottle/packaging); yes, this one must be good! Most of the time, I’m right, or lucky! Hahaha

Barely in the car, I freed the bottle from its packaging and treated myself to one spray on the back of my hand. WOW! What is this?! WOOW!!

Rarely have I been so blown away when spraying a perfume as I was with Montblanc Explorer. I don’t yet have the experience to distinguish individual notes, but what flowed into my nose was simply incredible. Fresh yet sweet, new yet familiar. A scent I had never smelled anywhere before. It was love at first sight; I fell in love, we found each other; One Love!

Yesterday, I sprayed Montblanc Explorer for the office (3 sprays). Sprayed at 6 AM, and I perceived this wonderful scent throughout the whole day. Even when I got home in the evening, I could still smell it, not just on my shirt, but also on my skin. I was and am thrilled!

I have already tested and bought several perfumes, but I was often disappointed by their weak longevity; that is very important to me. Rarely have I noticed the scent in the evening after work. Not so here.

I have often wondered if I would ever find MY perfume; or as most here say, my signature scent.

I believe now, after yesterday, I have found my office signature scent."
Explorer,07/15/2022,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,7,Waldausritt,"Since I like the women's fragrances from Montblanc, I decided to explore the men's fragrances as well.
I came across Explorer, which I liked immediately.
No, not for me - it's too masculine for that - but it would suit my boyfriend well.
He is a nature-loving man with whom I enjoy going on rides in the forest.
The woodiness of the trees blends well with the leather of the tack.
You feel secure on the horse's back - and free at the same time.
Moreover, Explorer radiates a pleasant calm.
You ride at a walking pace and keep an eye out for the animals of the forest.
The deer are not disturbed by us and continue to graze peacefully.
A relaxed scent for nature-loving gentlemen - who are at peace with themselves."
Explorer,02/14/2022,TheMonaco,M,14,,5,Very Good Aventus Homage,"I have been testing Aventus and Explorer in parallel for days, and for this beautiful close-to-the-original homage in a much more premium bottle (for those interested) at a comparatively bargain price (about €40 per 100ml), I give both thumbs up.
We don't have a 1:1 clone here (of what, when each Creed batch smells different from the other...) but the almost euphorically fresh-fruity-spicy scent is just as present, as well as the similar drydown including the two inherent longevity (6 to 7 hours) and the rather polite, skin-close sillage.
In my humble opinion, perfect for the office and everyday use. One always appreciates a waft.
If you have one, you don't need the other in my opinion... unless, of course, Creed as a status symbol in the mirrored cabinet for the initiated. ;)"

I tested it because I simply love ""Aventus | Creed,"" but the batch variations and the associated H/S inconsistency..."
Explorer,12/19/2021,Dali97,M,9,,5,The Best All-Year Fragrance,"Well, tastes are different. Whether it's Aventus or not, I find that Explorer has nothing to do with Creed. It does start off very much in the direction of Aventus, but it develops completely differently in the drydown. It is very versatile, and I even find it quite good now in December. You can't go wrong with Montblanc fragrances, as you get a lot of quality for little money. I would always prefer Explorer over Club de Nuit, as I find it much more pleasant and it doesn't scratch like Armaf. The performance is really solid too; it lasts about 6 hours on me, which is really strong for the price.

In conclusion, I can say that the fragrance is really great, and I wear it more often than, for example,
Sauvage, Bleu de Chanel, Dylan Blue, etc. If you're looking for a fragrance for everything and don't want to spend much, this is the perfect choice.
An absolute must-have for everyone."
Explorer,03/02/2022,Rephlex,M,3,,1,Good for Others,"I initially resisted buying it for a long time, and now I want it to stay. By that, I mainly mean in my nose. I was once again looking for affordable everyday scents for the office and finally got this fragrance.
At the first spray, I thought, wow, this is exactly what I wanted. Lightly citrusy at the beginning, clean, and it develops very rounded on the skin; there’s nothing that bothers me about the scent itself, quite the opposite. I’ve been wearing the MB in the office for 2 weeks now and have surprisingly received a lot of compliments, which of course makes me happy. The problem I have with the scent is that I can completely spray myself in the morning and feel like I can't perceive or smell it at all after about 2 hours... maybe a little if I go outside and the wind blows past me... which I find quite curious since people have approached me even after 7 hours or longer and asked what I was wearing. I've heard of fragrance blindness, but I haven't experienced that yet. Well, now I'm looking for a scent that smells just as good but performs stronger for me personally."
Explorer,07/16/2020,Swagger91,M,25,,2,The Aventus Twin That Isn't Worth Mentioning,"Montblanc Explorer:

The new Montblanc. When it came out, I thought to myself, WELL! Has Montblanc once again copied a fragrance and interpreted it themselves? A comparison with Aventus is not worthy, as this scent is quite synthetic. You wouldn't compare Mike Tyson with Manny, would you? Different weight class, thus different rules. But let's get to the scent and packaging.

The packaging is nothing special, but you get the impression that the bottle is well-made. A metal cap with a leather strip around the bottle does make an impression! When you remove the cap, the vaporizer is also quite good; I've seen worse. The opening is unfortunately very close to Aventus; I would even go so far as to say that perfume novices wouldn't recognize the difference in the opening.

The scent starts with a sweet Ambroxan opening and develops after about 1-2 hours more into a minimal leather-woody direction. A little later, you can also detect the cocoa note, but the Ambroxan is ever-present. I would estimate the longevity and sillage to be in a good range for a designer. The scent is still noticeable after 6 hours before it becomes more skin-close after about 3 hours of spraying. I can't perceive a significant development in the drydown; rather, it's a linear scent intended for the masses. After about 3-4 hours, only a sour synthetic scent remains, which might be reminiscent of green apples but comes off more leather-woody. It even gets so extreme that I get headaches from the scent in summer. Longevity for me is the standard 6-8 hours, and sillage is quite good in the first 1-2 hours for a designer! The season is more spring and autumn, as it is too fresh for winter and simply too synthetic for summer. With the fruity Aventus-like opening, it's a signature scent that one could wear on any occasion. Especially suitable for work, as you don't want strong niche fragrances in the job.

I would recommend this scent to someone looking for an affordable Aventus alternative, as I rate it too low in character as an independent fragrance. There are better scents in this price range that show more edges. For me, however, due to its overly strong synthetic nature, it has become a clear pass."

Before that, I didn't know Creed Aventus at all until my passion for collecting perfumes developed.

Now, to the point, this scent is truly the best you can have in a men's shelf! I've easily had it three times already and will gladly buy the next bottle when mine runs out. It's just such a fragrance, the fresher version of the original model and at an unbeatable price, it's almost like a gift.

I don't really notice the cocoa, maybe a hint of leather could be detected. But the bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, ambroxan, and a touch of woods, this combo is just so incredibly awesome and simply fun.

Sure, the scent isn't dominant, it's just a freshie with a duration of about 2-4 hours, but hey! Just transfer it into a 5ml perfume spray and always have it with you for a quick refresh, I always have it with me ;). It's also a scent for any occasion, an all-year-allrounder for every season and event.

It also brings in mega compliments, one of my favorites: it smells so fruity delicious, what is that?

I spray it on my arm even when I'm not going out just to smell it because it smells so incredibly good. But it does have a few issues... the longevity is relatively good; I can still smell it a bit after 14 hours, although it's almost only ambroxan after 6-7 hours. The sillage, on the other hand, is less impressive; right after spraying, you can smell it at arm's length for about an hour, and then it's very close to the skin. Still, it's an absolutely good fragrance, and a blind buy is allowed as long as you purchase it at a discount online."

One of the first perfumes I bought after extensive research, and I still see myself in it. This slightly peppery scent paired with the lightly fresh bergamot at the beginning still makes me melt. The drydown develops into a more mature character. For the price, as a Creed clone, it's always recommended!

As my first real perfume, on what I hope will be a long, diverse journey, it will always hold a special place with me. (Even if it's mainstream and just a clone/dupe, and even if this criticism is valid.)"

I am a fan of Legend Spirit: A better and fruitier version of One Million. Explorer is another successful release and in my opinion a weaker version of Creed Aventus.

Citrusy opening, then a lot of Ambroxan comes in. A bit of pepper. There’s really not much more to say.. It immediately evokes associations with Aventus. Unfortunately, the scent doesn’t last as long as Creed. Good 3 hours, more subtle sillage. I like to use it around sports and in everyday life on warm days.

Explorer,04/10/2021,Julien1993,M,5,,2,Brief Delight,"The scent starts off fruity/fresh for me, it smells very clean and carries a certain masculinity that I really liked.
Unfortunately, in the somewhat shorter scent progression, not much really changes in my opinion. Only the Ambroxan becomes a bit more prominent. After 4 hours, it can only be perceived close to the skin.
Still, it's a good fragrance and the price-performance ratio is also top-notch."
Explorer,06/05/2024,Gilptix,M,4,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Designer Aventus,"I have almost finished the 100ml of this fragrance. It is a great scent that fits best for work/school as it is not too strong or overwhelming.

I think it is no secret that it is inspired by the legendary Creed Aventus. However, in my opinion, it is not an identical dupe. You definitely get the Aventus DNA with the citrusy spicy top note and the smoky slightly green base and heart note. With Aventus, I get more pineapple, which I miss in the Explorer. I would describe the Explorer as a designer version of Aventus, as it contains a lot of ambroxan and the smokiness is more pleasant.

It is actually always wearable and at around €40 for 100ml, you can hardly go wrong. Of course, it is a bit synthetic and not as good as the original. However, anyone looking for a nice office scent should check this out in a perfume shop."
Explorer,12/30/2021,EvbPARADISE,M,5,,2,Good cheapie and everyday scent!,"First time for me. I received my first perfume as a birthday gift years ago. I chose it myself, and it was Versace Eros Flame. I didn't know much about perfumes and slowly started to dislike it. Until this summer, my interest in perfumes was awakened. After a super fun hour with a Douglas employee, during which he showed me many perfumes and I was able to expand my horizon (and his too, as I was probably the first customer who could associate a place, people, a memory, etc. with each scent, which he could also feel).

The ones that brought me back are 1. AdG Profumo and 2. our cheapie here.

This one is especially similar to Aventus in the opening, no question about it. It is an Aventus clone, period.

Explorer opens very citrusy, with a hint of pepper and a kick of Ambroxan. Sometimes it unfortunately starts off very alcoholic as well. Give it a little time, though, and it gets better! But this perfume doesn't give the wearer much time either, as it seems to fade after about 3-5 hours. So spray a bit more than usual if you want it to last longer on you!

It’s a typical freshie, just like you know it and many others. Not complex, but still nice! It feels really good in the summer.

The price, especially for the small bottle outside of perfumeries, is great, so you can treat yourself to it ;)

If you know someone who only wears Bruno Banani and other discount scents, be so kind and upgrade this regular Joe to Explorer ;)"

Longevity: Unfortunately, the longevity is not very strong, but for the price, it can be accepted.

It also doesn't have a smoky note like CDNI. It smells pleasant and has a certain Sauvage twist due to the Ambroxan. I find it a pity that there is no pineapple note included.

For me personally, it smells a bit more alcoholic at first and then develops into a synthetic kind of freshness, yet still fruity and light.

I personally smelled it for the first time at Douglas and I can still remember it well: I was really surprised because it somehow smells different from the conventional perfume that everyone has in mind.

For me, it's a really good, affordable perfume! The only thing that bothers me is the somewhat weak sillage and longevity. Of course, it's not extremely bad, but you do compare it with the scents from the top league ;)"

But a bad one.,"First, let me clarify: the quality differences between Explorer and Aventus are huge, and therefore a comparison is actually quite difficult for me.

Nevertheless, I kept comparing the two in my head and was a bit annoyed, I must be honest, because the scent at the spray..."
Explorer,05/28/2022,Canoblanc,M,16,,1,Good/Okay for the Price,"Initially a bit citrusy, with wooden/leathery notes in the background. I like it for everyday use, you can wear it anytime. I expected it to be stronger, but I was surprised when I put it on that it comes across rather softly, hence many sprays are needed. Unlike the well-known and similar CDNIM, it is not as strong/overbearing as the latter. It is also known to be a double of Aventus; to that, I can say: Yes, it is definitely inspired by it, but I would consider Explorer more of a designer Aventus than a 1 to 1 copy. Which is not a bad thing. Explorer does what it’s supposed to do, an affordable designer for any occasion and any season. It doesn’t blow you away, but it doesn’t disappoint either."
Explorer,10/24/2024,Dufti1985,M,43,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Seriousness with a Twist,"Now that I am at a certain age, but of course still peppy and interesting and by no means boring and stale ;) I am currently reorienting myself and trying out new fragrances.

When I held my wrist under my wife's nose again today, she initially said, ""Do you have something new on again?!"" Then after a quick sniff: ""Oh, that's good!""

That was also my spontaneous thought. At first, I smelled leather and spices - good for an older and experienced man - but then some slightly citrus notes came in, which lightened things up and made it more vibrant.

After 7 hours, I can still perceive the fragrance very well on my wrist. Perfect for today's autumn day, but surely also wearable in the warm season, perhaps for a barbecue evening with friends or while enjoying red wine and a cigar on the terrace."
Explorer,02/04/2023,JewelsCook,M,3,,4,Super all-rounder even without the big A,"When I first smelled the fragrance, I was immediately taken by its freshness. It is the perfect blend of sporty, elegant, and business. In direct comparison to Aventus, it is much less smoky, which makes it, in my opinion, significantly more pleasant and likable. I also find the longevity to be very good, as with Aventus, only the smoke remains at the end of the day. Clone, dupe, or reinterpretation, however you want to call it, the Explorer is (almost) perfect, which is also reflected in its high-quality bottle.

You can get 100ml online for under €50, which makes it a real no-brainer for me."
Explorer,04/29/2025,DanosBananos,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Fragrance-wise: A Marvel,"What a scent! The most beautiful bergamot I have ever smelled in a top note and in general... What a top note! In my opinion, this is also the absolute strength of this fragrance. I could spray it on myself constantly!
And unfortunately, you have to. The longevity and sillage of Explorer are unfortunately below average. I understand this with a citrus scent and am sure that the perfumers have done a lot to improve the longevity (Ambroxan). But unfortunately, the scent on me is just a skin scent after half an hour and hardly perceptible after 3-4 hours. Such a shame for such a scent experience.
In the heart note, woods and an aquatic note come into play, with the woodiness further intensifying in the base note.

My dream would be: Montblanc Explorer with the longevity of an oud fragrance. Then I would be in heaven!"
Explorer,02/24/2023,Parfümheinz,M,15,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Not a Clone but an Alternative,"Montblanc Explorer, a highly hyped fragrance. It has been marketed by many influencers as an Aventus clone. And yes, the scent does have similarities to Aventus. However, if you are looking for a 1:1 clone, you should go for Club de Nuit Intense.

I see the Explorer more as an alternative rather than a clone. The bergamot is particularly prominent in the opening, and in the drydown, we have a lovely citrus-woody combination. A fresh scent that, for me, is simply a top all-rounder.

Sillage and longevity are good, comparable to that of Aventus, although it even surpasses the newer Aventus batches in terms of sillage and longevity. With a price of 40 to 50 euros for 100ml, it comes highly recommended."
Explorer,11/23/2020,Michaelmssnr,M,7,,2,90 % Aventus,"First of all, it's clear that the scent is a definite Aventus clone, but I find it a bit more bitter and woody. Aventus, on the other hand, is noticeably creamier and fruitier, which doesn't mean that I think Aventus is significantly better. I like both scents very much, but since Explorer is significantly cheaper, I would always prefer this one; however, Aventus lasted a bit longer on me. H + S are definitely solid and are absolutely sufficient for a day in the office, which is mostly how I use it. You can't go wrong with this scent regardless of the season and situation.

Absolutely recommended!"

The Explorer is rather a calmer, quieter version of Aventus. Maybe this is preferred by some, as the Aventus..."
Explorer,08/06/2022,Minigolf,F,2512,,5,Ross und Reiter....,"....Or how a fragrance concept becomes a rider. One might think that a novelty that started in 2010 with ""Aventus"" has triggered a great wave of similar scents, just as was the case with Coty's ""Chypre,"" Guerlain's ""Shalimar,"" or Chanel's ""N° 5.""
Only today, there are many more ""competitors"" in the fragrance industry, and the market share of an individual scent from a company in the ""segment"" is becoming ever smaller.
Now there are very affordable ""alternatives"" to the original that can certainly hold their own. Mid-priced ones, like this one, which still lacks some elements to come close. Finally, the high-priced ones, which vary greatly.
The ""original"" is a benchmark that is (almost) reached or not. Many fall short, some establish themselves, remain for a while, but eventually disappear again. Only a few ""winners"" remain who can assert themselves permanently.
Whether the ""Explorer"" can achieve this remains to be seen. It follows the motto: ""A good horse doesn't jump higher than it has to.""
But whether the rider stays in the saddle is yet to be determined.
As a fresh-fruity-citrusy and slightly herbaceous-smoky-woody scent, the ""Explorer"" can indeed be a good representative. Those who know the ""original"" will likely be inclined to compare.
I try not to do that, but rather focus on the ""Montblanc"" as a ""neutral"" representative of its kind.
What strikes me here is the immediate presence of the ""fruity-fresh"" scents, which can be recognized long beyond the ""top note."" The scent itself acts like a subtle, fine mist hovering above everything else. Fresh, moist, and cool.
Bright, fine smoky notes accompany it, laying like dew over grass (vetiver) and bitter woods. Embedded in a slightly earthy aroma that provides the entire fragrance structure with a solid foundation that goes deep but does not drill in, bite down, or get stuck. A kind of ""airy lightness"" gives the composition enough room to avoid drifting into heaviness. The initially slightly ""synthetic"" appearance of the fragrance quickly dissipates, so it does not ""bother"" further, as it shifts more and more towards a natural character over time.
It does not lack in endurance, as the longevity is about 7 hours, placing it in the upper middle range. As for the projection (sillage), I would describe it as ""strongly subtle,"" the ""right"" measure of being well perceivable without being overwhelming. Enough time to locate the ""scent source"" and track it well. A pleasant ""Aha effect"" that does not disappear immediately....
Here, ""the rider stays on the horse"" until the course ends and he can safely dismount :-))"

Explorer,11/30/2024,lunala,M,11,,4,My Journey to Aventus...,"So as a perfume newbie, I had often heard about Creed's Aventus. However, the price was always way too high for a fragrance for me, so I never really looked into it.

My uncle works at Chanel and managed to get me some samples. YSL Y, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Prada Ocean, etc. were included. And then I saw a bottle with the name ""Montblanc - Explorer""... Never heard of it, seen it, or smelled it. So I tried it - and was thrilled!

I didn't know that Explorer is considered an Aventus dupe, as I hadn't smelled Aventus at that time. So my mindset was completely vanilla, and I made no comparisons. The opening blew me away; I couldn't stop smelling my hand. Fresh, fruity, and positive. The dry-down remained similar but became more subtle. Well, then I informed myself about the fragrance and inevitably came across Aventus. Countless comparisons about what is better, worse, cheaper, more expensive, blah blah blah.

Then, out of the blue, I received an offer for Aventus (even with an inscription, wowow!), and since I read that it shares a very similar top note with Explorer, I did something that some might stone me for: I blind-bought Aventus.

In this price range as a newbie, it really wasn't smart and could have backfired; it didn't. I find the top note even better, and the smoke in the dry-down is successful for me. But enough about Aventus.

I own a 60ml bottle of Explorer, as it works for me as the ""Daily Aventus"" - mostly for university. Through Explorer, I actually got into the niche game, and it plays a significant role in my fascination for niche fragrances now. So I am really grateful to Explorer to some extent.

Thanks for reading, and thanks to my uncle for the sample :)

(Oh, and Absolu Aventus has already made it to my display case - I freak)"
Explorer,09/03/2024,Lauser93,M,1199,,5,An Old Acquaintance,"When applying ""Explorer | Montblanc,"" I immediately thought of one of my absolute favorite fragrances: ""Aventus | Creed."" The Explorer is a bit more synthetic, doesn't come across as quite as luxurious, but in the end, it is still a fabulous scent and very affordable. The longevity on my skin is a solid 6 to 8 hours, but it becomes quite close to the skin after about 4 hours. The sillage is still very impressive at the beginning, and I received several compliments for it.

The top note smells beautifully refreshing with lemon, bergamot, blackcurrants, green apples, and a subtle peppery touch. There is a certain synthetic quality present as well. In the heart note, I detect pineapple, leather, and a fine smokiness. In the base, I catch whiffs of birch water, ambroxan, and an indefinable woodiness.

I find the original or the clones from Armaf to be overall more elegant and beautiful, but Explorer is still a wonderful summer fragrance. I thank Manuel for the sample."
Explorer,09/30/2024,XScentleman,M,4,,3,Wonderful Allrounder,"Montblanc Explorer... The fragrance was recommended to me a while ago, but I never really had any interest in it.

I then tested it a few times and realized that it simply fits into every conceivable life situation. Whether in summer at 30° or in winter at -degrees, it fits everywhere. It is also very masculine and serious, which makes it suitable for wearing at work as well.

Conclusion: Wonderful allrounder fragrance for work and life. Full recommendation from me at this point. Feel free to write me a situation where it doesn't fit, I'm waiting..."
Explorer,08/06/2021,Hujo77,M,32,,1,Citrus / Wood / Ambroxan Bomb,"Montblanc has created a super pleasant and uncomplicated everyday fragrance with this scent, which is well-received everywhere and always easy to wear.
Its fresh citrus opening gives the wearer a nice freshness kick and initially reminds one of (Versace pour Homme), but then quickly shifts into a woody direction and, with a strong Ambroxan note, adds a slight sweetness and depth to the whole.
In the drydown, the fragrance slightly leaves the famous Aventus vibe and has solid longevity and sillage; nothing special, but for the price of about 35 per 100ml, it's quite acceptable.

Fun fact:
I was recently asked by a stranger if I was wearing Aventus, even though it was Explorer.
Apparently, the scents in the air do smell somewhat similar; otherwise, I can't explain the situation.

Conclusion:
Great fragrance at an affordable price that promises compliments and is wearable for any occasion.
Longevity: 7 hrs.
Sillage: 2 hrs. well noticeable, then subtle."
Explorer,05/14/2023,Misanthrope,M,7,,6,A Fleeting Ode to Summer,"Recently, I had the pleasure of experiencing the essence of summer adventures in bottled form: Mont Blanc - Explorer. It was like wandering through a vibrant landscape, where each breath revealed a new, exciting chapter.

The opening is like the first morning ray hitting an untouched landscape. Fresh and invigorating, it brings a hint of optimism and boundless freedom. It feels like the beginning of an adventurous day under the dazzling sun.

Then comes the gentle warmth of the midday sun, reminiscent of a soft sea breeze with a deep yet uplifting melody. It is in these moments that the fragrance truly shines and fulfills its promise of an unforgettable journey.

But like the most beautiful summer evening, this scent also carries a melancholy that cannot be ignored. As quickly as it arrives, it also fades away. Its transient presence is like a sunset that briefly bathes the sky in vibrant colors before yielding to darkness. It is a sweet yet heart-wrenching tragedy that leaves one with a longing for more.

Mont Blanc - Explorer is a perfume that captures the joy and adventure of summer, while simultaneously reminding us of the transience of all beautiful things. It is a true delight for the senses, a scent that takes you on a journey, only to bring you back to the ground of reality too quickly. It is this bittersweet dichotomy that makes it so unique and unforgettable."
Explorer,06/23/2023,KurtCHose,M,4,,2,Aventus Alternative? Yes and No.,"When I first applied the fragrance in the perfumery, I didn't notice any difference from the significantly more expensive ""brother."" However, when I had a sample at home, I had a different opinion. The opening surprised me with a nearly piercing citrus note. Later in the drydown, the similarity to Aventus becomes quite apparent. For me, though, it is not an alternative, as the citrus note remains too prominent and even reminds me a bit of toilet cleaner. Aside from that, the pineapple note is missing. Taken on its own, however, it is a quite wearable and pleasant fragrance for the warm days of the year and, given the noticeable similarity to Aventus, very affordable. Moreover, the bottle is quite good for the price."
Explorer,01/11/2025,Owlmaster,M,8,,3,"Unassuming fantastic, obviously excellent...","Due to the predicted similarity to Aventus, I got Mont Blanc Explorer some time ago to expand my collection. At first, I was a bit ambivalent about the scent. Upon the first spray, it hit me rather hard and had an indefinable composition of heavy fragrance notes. However, I was all the more surprised after a few moments of dry-down...wow! An elegant yet masculine scent that neither seeks unnecessary attention nor wants to fade into the background. A gentleman and a loyal companion for any occasion! I love wearing it in the office and appreciate the different layers of the fragrance. It consistently has a certain freshness and purity, but also knows how to emphasize masculinity and remain grounded. It has become one of my favorites, and I don't want to be without it!"

Explorer,10/08/2024,ITX,M,91,,3,Walk through the Needle Forest,"After several aquatic-citrus fragrances, I craved some variety. By chance, I stumbled upon Montblanc's Explorer - a perfume that some dismiss as an Aventus dupe, while others celebrate it as an exceedingly successful insider tip. Ultimately, the consistently positive reviews convinced me enough to order the perfume blindly from Flaconi.

Both the packaging and the bottle are adorned with a black, leather-like relief, which gives the scent a very masculine design right from the start. The cap is held on the sprayer by a magnet, which is also of very high quality, and the spray bursts are strong.

To test it, I treated myself to a few sprays on my neck. At first, the projection is very strong, and the scent notes unfold intensely. Right after application, a spicy-citrus cloud of pine needles and bergamot fills the air. It immediately reminded me of a walk through a pine forest during our family vacation in Crete. A Mediterranean needle forest - that’s how one could summarize the scent overall.

As it develops, the scent ""calms down"" and moves in a slightly leatherier/woodier direction. Nevertheless, a hint of the initial spiciness remains until the end, forming the popular signature characteristic of this perfume. The sillage and longevity are okay for a fragrance in this price range; after about 2 hours, I can only perceive it close to the skin and have to overspray significantly for it to project properly.

Conclusion: Blind purchases are always risky, but in my case, the plunge into cold water was more than generously rewarded: Montblanc Explorer is a truly noble scent, whose spicy freshness makes a good impression both in a board meeting and on a Sunday walk through the woods. It is not as outrageously overpriced as its distant relative Aventus, but offers a similar scent profile and an equally diverse, spicy freshness. I can recommend it almost without reservation!"
Explorer,01/16/2024,Romekmercury,M,44,,2,What bothers me about it?,"The scent notes smell excellent.

The bergamot, pink pepper, and sage sound exciting and thrilling at the same time. Paired with the following leather and vetiver, it should actually be a fragrance just to my taste.

But far from it. Something, perhaps the ambroxan, truly bothers me about this scent.

To me, it smells fresh, citrusy. I love citrus scents. What I don’t like here is the distinctly synthetic aspect of this fragrance in my eyes.

In my opinion, a fresh summer scent should ideally not smell synthetic.

Then it unfortunately comes across as relatively ""cheap"" very quickly for me.

The scent is okay... no question. But absolutely overhyped, in my assessment/perception."
Explorer,02/05/2025,Halolo,M,67,,4,"More than just a good Aventus clone - affordable, balanced, but weak in longevity/sillage","It’s no longer a secret that Montblanc's Explorer is one of the best Aventus clones out there. It comes off spicier than its supposed predecessor and -clearly- has no fruity component, but it has that certain ""roundness"" that Aventus lacks in its fresh-citrusy (initial) phase. For this reason, it is more than just another Aventus knock-off for me; it’s an affordable daily fragrance with a dominant citrus-pepper DNA that is absolutely suitable for everyday wear and the office, and is truly likable.

Upon spraying, the dominant pepper and citrus fruit (here: bergamot, but it could have also been lemon due to its strength) greet you, paired with a hint of mint. The Ambroxan really kicks in, giving the sage and citrus even more ""foreground.""
Shortly after spraying, Explorer cools the skin nicely; even now, you know it will shine in the (high) summer like no other season.

After about 45-60 minutes, the mint fades away, and its main DNA crystallizes: a peppery citrus paired with (synthetic) patchouli.
What’s also noticeable: After just 1 hour, the longevity begins to decline. The drydown is very pleasant up to this point, but it brings forth few other notes.

After 1.5 hours, the pepper becomes more dominant. The ratio between the pepper and bergamot is now about 60:40. The vetiver grass finally has a chance to show itself. Already after 1.5 hours, I feel like we’ve reached the peak. Longevity and sillage have significantly decreased.

Half an hour later, after 2 hours, it’s time: we have reached the zenith. It won’t get any better from here. The citrus comes back a bit, and there’s a tie.

After 4 hours: It’s only barely detectable on the skin. There’s a bit of sillage left, but you really have to stand right next to me.
I think I can still smell a bit of wood... possibly cedarwood or something mossy?

Now, after 8 hours, the scent has nearly vanished. It has lasted through its workday and is ready to rest, or for the evening, it’s time for something else ;-)

----

Conclusion:
• Is it ""Aventus-inspired""? - Yes.

• Should it be reduced to that? - Clearly: No!

• Does it smell exactly the same? - No. For the first 15-30 minutes, it has some resemblance, but after that, it completely lacks the fruitiness.

• Can you still buy it? Absolutely (!) You don’t have to hide or hesitate to go out with it. It’s simply too good, and the best part: you can wear it (primarily in summer) at any time of day or night and you can’t go wrong.

Points are deducted for the -at least on my skin- weak longevity and sillage, as well as the unspectacular (but by no means bad) drydown.
I smell 0 cocoa and the leather is a very light, inconspicuous note, introduced only in homeopathic amounts.

The 100ml bottle of Explorer is already available for around €50 (as of 05.02.2025) -- it’s worth every penny.

Later on, the fragrance becomes more spicy/green for my taste.

I always find it interesting how a perfume lover discovers a scent. In 2020-2021 (I can't remember the exact year ;) ) I attended a training session one evening. A colleague entered the room and sat down. Behind him, someone created a super pleasant, well-scented cloud. Immediately, I became curious, and during a break, I asked the colleague what fragrance he was wearing. It was Montblanc Explorer.
Here, I find it very exciting to have smelled a fragrance without knowing exactly what it was. In 2020, I wasn't as deep into the perfume bubble as I am now.

Well, now that you know where I know this scent from, let's talk about the fragrance itself. It is very fresh, citrusy, woody, and also spicy. I was immediately taken with it. I don't find the perfume synthetic as some here claim. The Montblanc can be worn regardless of the season or occasion. However, I think the wearer should be wearing a shirt or at least a polo, as I find the MBE more suitable for high-quality outfits. In my opinion, this scent is not for teenagers. The person should be over 25. The longevity is okay for such a universal and affordable fragrance. It lasts about 6 hours, and in the first 3 hours, it is also quite noticeable. However, I myself don't perceive the scent as strongly after a while. Since this is very important to me and I don't want to keep reapplying the fragrance, this is the only downside I found.

Regarding compliments, I can say that my girlfriend and actually everyone likes this scent. You can't go wrong with it. However, many have already rocked this perfume. A colleague told me, ""Wow, not that one, my buddy has worn it every day for the last few months."" So you are not particularly unique with it. In my opinion, you don't have to be, as this Montblanc really smells great.

Conclusion:
A price-performance hit (40 € max. 50 € per 100 ml) for a great all-rounder that you can't go wrong with and that really fits all occasions. Unfortunately, the longevity is too weak for me, which is why I have sold this fragrance again. Niche fragrances can spoil you ^^ hehe.

Thank you for your attention and for reading."
Explorer,02/18/2025,Finn1012,M,4,,2,Affordable Creed Aventus?,"The Mont Blanc Explorer is a very fresh perfume, in which, in my opinion, the bergamot stands out the most.

It is known for its Creed Aventus-like DNA. This classic, highly popular DNA can definitely be found in the fragrance.

Additionally, the Mont Blanc Explorer is comparatively very affordable.

Only its sillage and longevity leave something to be desired. However, this problem can at least be partially countered with a few more sprays. Otherwise, the scent unfortunately lasts no more than 1-2 hours on my skin.

In summary, the Mont Blanc Explorer is a very nice, fresh scent that comes very close to the Aventus DNA. Only the sillage and longevity can be criticized. However, considering the price, this is completely acceptable."
Explorer,09/16/2023,Marah,M,4,,2,Sharp Sage,"A citrusy sharp opening followed by sage in the base and then smoky wood.
Longevity is okay. Sillage is strong at first, then becomes more intimate!
The fragrance has little development and quickly becomes boring. However, it can be worn for any occasion.
For me, it's just a modern office scent, nothing more."
Explorer,01/29/2023,Max66,M,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Ideal for the Office,"Yes, this fragrance has a bit of Aventus vibes in my opinion, even though it starts quite citrusy; however, it lacks the smokiness, which makes it perfect for the office in my view… this scent is well-received, and I often get compliments when I wear it. The longevity is quite okay for me, even if I can no longer smell it, it is still often perceived well.
For the price, I find it worth buying if you are not willing to spend money on the more expensive alternatives."
Explorer,10/06/2022,Tomekk1990,M,2,,5,The Perfect Blend?,"When I first wore the fragrance, I wasn't so sure,
I really had to warm up to it.
But the more often I wore it, the more it became one of my favorites.

The citrus notes with the bitter/sweet undertone are simply amazing.
Especially, I can imagine this scent in the height of summer but just as well in autumn :-)
It definitely brings compliments :-)
The sillage and longevity are also not to be underestimated; I've already convinced two people to buy it within the first few weeks.

If I had to associate the fragrance with a situation, I imagine myself sitting on a quad with my partner, exploring an island like Mallorca with all its beautiful facets, here a lemon tree, there a small mountain range, or just standing on a cliff and gazing at the vast sea. The senses are definitely filled with impressions, and the blend is simply perfect.

One should note that this type of fragrance is quite mainstream, but I can completely overlook that, and it has definitely become a love at first sight for me."
Explorer,11/23/2024,LukiKati,M,3,,2,Teen Spirit with Depth or Life-Wise Freshness,"From gift to staple:
I didn’t discover the Explorer myself; instead, my father gifted it to me a few years ago for my 18th birthday. After I had already developed a small passion for fragrances and diligently tested new designer perfumes in drugstores, the Explorer opened a door to an unknown fragrance category for me. I only knew aquatic-fresh or spicy-warm-sweet.

The Mont-Blanc Explorer surprised me right from the first spray with a new combination, a kind of fresh spiciness that is nonetheless carried by a sweet lightness. What was this light tingling in my nose, this certain fiery quality that the scent brought with it? After several years of further fragrance experience, I can clearly attribute this feeling to the pink pepper. I am still fascinated by how distinctly I can identify pink pepper notes in fragrances through this tingling sensation, and I love it! It conveys purity and cleanliness, especially in the top note.

For me, the Explorer has been my go-to scent for YEARS and several bottles. In my opinion, it is the ultimate all-rounder for the lukewarm to hot days of the year; there is nothing better than applying the Explorer after a fresh shower and stepping out of the house, knowing that you are surrounded by this wonderful tingling aura (one cannot escape a compliment or two during this phase).

As it develops, the scent becomes a bit softer and more delicate when the leather and vetiver notes come into play. Overall, it is quite subtle. For me, the fresh, sweet spiciness only becomes more beautiful and rounded over time. It’s almost as if the scent merges with the skin, and one feels absolutely untouchable.

But not only in everyday use is the scent a staple; in my opinion, it can also be worn by almost any age group. For me, the scent represented the beginning of adulthood back then. I think everyone remembers well the phase when one began to take oneself a bit more seriously than one actually was. Suddenly, one started to think about whether one actually appeared more mature on the outside.
The Explorer embodies this developmental phase for me; it conveys a youthful lightness, a fresh creativity, all perfectly wrapped in a certain order and structure as well as maturity. I can’t quite say whether the Explorer gives the necessary maturity to the teen spirit or rather adds a bit of freshness to established wisdom.

One thing is clear: the Explorer flatters its wearer with a touch of elegance and strength - one feels at home in oneself and radiates self-confidence that arises from within. For me, it is the constant companion I no longer want to miss."
Explorer,10/26/2025,K2Deluxe,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Not a Clone, but Character","A very pleasant hint of fresh sage and semi-sweet, sharp citrus fruits upon the first spray, and it’s done very well. The Ambrox is clearly present, but not as overpowering as in Sauvage and other ambrox-heavy fragrances. It simply plays its role like a steady bass that holds everything together. Vetiver and leather are listed as notes, but they do not stand out individually..."
Explorer,07/21/2025,Louiss10,M,2,,2,Good Everyday Perfume for Men,"At first, I mainly perceive a woody note, but I also notice a woody note in the background. This woody note becomes more prominent over time. In my opinion, the perfume can be worn well for any occasion and any season, but for me, it is most definitely a fragrance for everyday use, especially in spring. The longevity on my skin is very good; however, I feel that the scent quickly becomes detectable only in close proximity to the skin."
Explorer,08/23/2024,Maikomat,M,5,,3,Aventus for a Tenth,"During my first test as a beginner with Aventus, I was really impressed. I didn't know many fragrances yet, but I understood the hype early on. The more I delved into Creed, the more I noticed that this scent is worn quite often. Nevertheless, I liked it, and the search for dupes began. This led me to Explorer, which smells very similar but costs only a fraction of the..."
Explorer,07/13/2024,Dionysos2022,M,945,,4,Is it him?...,"... no, it is not. Yes, this scent leans towards Aventus. However, it is not a true dupe of that fragrance. It has an independent character.

Upon application, the citrusy bergamot with pepper and sage first hits the nose. It gains a dry quality from the vetiver and a daring aspect from the leather note. Later, a woody element from Akigalawood follows, and the patchouli makes this scent even drier and darkens it a bit. The cocoa makes this perfume a little daring. It is very masculine here.

The longevity and sillage on my skin are very good, about 10 hours.

It is a nice alternative to Aventus but not a real dupe; this perfume is too independent for that. This scent can be worn by any man, regardless of age. It is also suitable for any occasion.

Those who enjoy a fresh citrusy scent with a certain woody accord will not go wrong here."
Explorer,07/26/2024,Philipp1683,M,5,,2,The best Aventus dupe?,"Montblanc Explorer starts off very citrusy with a pineapple note.
The citrus notes gradually fade away, and the scent gets closer to Aventus.
It develops into a woody fresh fragrance.
However, there is a major problem: the longevity.
It's a great scent, but you can't perceive it after 3 hours.
To answer the question in the title: No, due to the lack of longevity, for me, Club de Nuit Intense is a bit better.
Still, it's a great fragrance for little money."
Explorer,04/27/2024,Davidspn,M,5,,3,boring and flat,"I find the citrus opening a bit piercing, but I'm not a fan of citrus in many fragrances. Unfortunately, I don't pick up on the leather at all, and the heart note could actually be omitted. It is skipped over directly. The scent starts citrusy and somewhat reminds me of pineapple, but then it quickly jumps to a typically masculine smell. It reminds me of a 40-year-old family man who is an office worker or teacher. I strongly smell the Ambroxan, and like with the leather, patchouli and cocoa in the base note somehow seem to be missing, making the fragrance smell purely synthetic.

I understand the comparison to ""Aventus | Creed."" However, for me, it is so dull and yawningly boring that the fragrance can only be suitable for the office or as an everyday scent, and there are many better fragrances for such occasions. For me, the fragrance would be completely irrelevant without the cheap price, unless I want to smell like everyone else running into Douglas and buying the first scent suggested by the staff."
Explorer,07/17/2025,MrJay,M,11,,3,"Smoky, Citrusy - as a Creed Aventus Alternative","Right from the first spray, the scent reminds one of another fragrance that gives you a stomach ache when you look at the price. The reference here is, of course, Creed Aventus. Those who have been searching for an alternative might have found it now.

The top note starts with Italian bergamot, pepper, and sage. Fresh with a slight spiciness and softness. In the top note, we then encounter vetiver and leather.

In the base, warmth is created through cocoa and Indonesian patchouli, which also defines the fragrance.

I must say that the scent performs better compared to the more expensive one. If you like this fragrance or Creed Aventus, you should definitely try Club de Nuit.

I think it even comes closer to Aventus. However, every nose has to sniff it out for themselves, as all three smell quite similar."
Explorer,03/05/2023,Parfumlegend,M,9,,1,Alternative to Creed Aventus,"Here is my assessment of this fragrance.

First of all, I find Explorer by Montblanc to be a very good and affordable alternative to Creed Aventus.

Bottle:

The bottle is very simple and beautifully designed. There's not much more to say about it.

Scent:

The scent is a clone of Creed Aventus, even though the pineapple is missing from the notes. You can really smell the bergamot and pepper in the opening. The sage nicely rounds off the top notes. In the heart notes, the vetiver and leather come through well. In the base during the dry down, the ambroxan comes out very strongly along with the patchouli. (The ambroxan is very pleasant and also good because it lasts longer, see also Dior Sauvage.)

Longevity:

The fragrance is in the medium range; it lasts a good 8 hours. It is well perceivable even if you become olfactorily blind at some point, but for others, it still smells good for a long time. On the skin, it comes across well, and on clothes, it lasts almost an entire day.

Price:

The price is really good here. The price/performance ratio fits as a cheaper Creed Aventus alternative. The Aventus is way too expensive and not really good anymore in terms of longevity and performance. (Since the sale of the brand, it has unfortunately become rapidly worse in my opinion.)

You can't go wrong here; it's a good fresh citrus alternative.

Best regards and have a nice day, everyone.

Explorer,12/10/2024,Leohrst,M,4,,2,"Average at First, Convincing in the Dry-Down","Explorer by Mont Blanc was my entry into the world of perfumes. A scent that I still enjoy using today. At the first spray, it seems a bit too fruity and synthetic to me, but as soon as it transitions into the dry-down, it unfolds its full potential: warm, distinctive, and inviting. Especially when you sniff the clothing the next day. (In the dry-down, one of my top fragrances). That’s when the blend of citrus freshness, spicy pepper, and a warm woody base comes into play.
This very blend gives the fragrance a distinctive, masculine aura without being overwhelming. The sillage is noticeable but pleasant, making it a true compliment magnet.
All in all, a modern, versatile scent that I enjoy wearing again and again despite the slightly synthetic opening. Without this note, Explorer would be nearly perfect for me."
Explorer,01/15/2025,Dtonnii,M,1,,2,Desire for More,"Incredibly beautiful scent that made me want to engage more with perfumes. I bought it because I heard it was a candidate for a blind buy, and it certainly was. I get the most compliments with this one, alongside Jazz Club, because it radiates so well and even lasts after 2 hours of sports. Super fresh and woody at the beginning but also pleasant and warm in the dry-down, where the cocoa comes through nicely. I can't compare it to Aventus, which it's supposed to be similar to, but I would also like to try that one if it goes in the same (more expensive) direction."
Explorer,02/28/2024,INxsty,M,4,,2,Thumbs up,"A perfect scent for the general public.
Wearable for any occasion and a good everyday fragrance.
Anyone who likes Aventus Creed will definitely like this one too!
Unfortunately, the longevity and sillage are not outstanding.
I find the 30 ml bottle beautiful and I’m happy to have it in my collection.

At first, it’s nicely citrusy, and over time the lovely woody notes come through.
Aside from the longevity and sillage, the price-performance ratio is good.
The fragrance is recommended for everyday use, and you can’t go wrong with it!"
Explorer,02/21/2024,Ndacope7,M,16,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Good Discreet Scent,"Montblanc Explorer starts off citrusy fresh, underlined by green notes. I find the scent extremely well-balanced between citrus, green, and spicy notes. Not too much or too little of anything. You get exactly what it says on the label, although one must say that the composition is nothing extraordinary. Nevertheless, one should enjoy the interplay of citrus and spicy notes."

Not that this has to be something bad, but in this case, it bothers me quite a bit at the..."
Explorer,02/06/2024,Oscarruf,M,3,,2,1A Price/Performance,"For me, a very successful fragrance, especially in this price category. I have already gifted it to friends a few times, as it is personally a scent that you can't go wrong with. And then this price... Really 1A!! The scent is very fresh, mixed with a hint of something ""herber."" For me, it actually performs above average on H/S. After 2 hours of intense sports, I could still perceive it well. This is not the case for many stronger fragrances I have. Despite all the praise, I do have two small points of criticism: On one hand, the bottle, which unfortunately does not appeal to me personally. Sure, the fragrance is really not expensive, but still, the bottle is very boring, and I’m not particularly fond of the black ""coat."" Secondly, the scent is very linear. This is not particularly bad (I think no one expects such a fragrance to develop significantly).
Overall, a really successful fragrance. Chapeau Montblanc!!"
Explorer,03/01/2023,Kevin2001,M,1,,1,Creed Aventus without Smoke,"If you like Creed Aventus/ CDNIM, you might also enjoy Montblanc Explorer.

Upon spraying, you are greeted with beautiful fresh citrus notes, and it retains this quality until the end. A fragrance that is perfect for work or for summer. Longevity and sillage are average, but nothing more is expected from it.

I wouldn't consider it a clone of Aventus, as it lacks the smoky notes. However, it is a very good alternative for someone looking for a fresh-citrus scent without wanting to spend much."
Explorer,02/11/2023,MLSfragrance,M,5,,2,Top Allrounder and Alternative to Creed Aventus,"What can I say: Simply a top all-rounder scent, works always and everywhere and receives many compliments.

Price-performance ratio is excellent. Longevity is solid. Sillage is good.

It just smells clean and super fresh, fruity, slightly woody, and slightly aquatic, especially citrusy. In my opinion, overall very masculine.

Moreover, especially considering the price, it is a great alternative to Creed Aventus, which I believe is much more worthwhile."
Explorer,01/28/2024,Marandris,M,16,,1,Perfect Everyday Scent,"If you're looking for a fragrance that has a woody scent but still brings a freshness, Montblanc Explorer is just right. Personally, I love this scent for everyday wear. It simply smells fresh, elegant, and clean. It gives you a good sense of confidence. In my opinion, you can't really overspray this fragrance depending on the occasion. In school, I would recommend 3-5 sprays since the scent isn't too strong but is still noticeable. I've always received good feedback because it's a fragrance that simply smells classic, nothing extravagant, which means you won't annoy anyone. There will always be people who don't like the scent, but I think you'll get 90% positive feedback; strangely enough, this is the fragrance that has received the most compliments for me. So if you're looking for an affordable everyday scent that delivers, you're in the right place!"
Explorer,03/30/2024,Ich1,M,4,,0,Under the Radar,"This fragrance combines summery pineapple with fresh citrus and a pleasant woody note. It bears some resemblance to Club de Nuit Intense Man or Creed Aventus.
Explorer is a price-performance killer.
Unfortunately, the longevity is not outstanding, about 5 hours on me, after which it is only perceptible up close. The sillage is good.

An unobtrusive and fresh scent, perfectly suitable for everyday wear or sports.
This fragrance offers incredibly much for the price, which can only be said of very few. I would buy it again and again; unfortunately, in my opinion, it receives far too little attention."
Explorer,10/27/2022,AfroMagath,M,3,,2,International and Jovial,"My first short review here:

I don't know Aventus, but the scent that a very professional fragrance seller at Galeria Kaufhof offered me as a last resort was impressive: Mont Blanc Explorer.

I was looking for something leathery that could compete with Tom Ford Ombre Leather, but was less overpowering and much more jovial. Something for the office as well as for the couch at home.

The fascination with this fragrance lies in the top note, fantastic, and the heart note is also noteworthy, but the base is rather mediocre. The longevity is, in my opinion, not to be overestimated; it fades away. I don’t mind, though, because I treated myself to the 200ml for €70. I find it incomprehensible why this fragrance, especially if it is supposed to be a clone of Aventus Creed, is so inexpensive.

Maybe it’s because Mont Blanc is seen as stuffy and reminds one of ballpoint pens and very expensive paper; Mont Blanc thus represents more of a notary vibe than sexiness, fair enough.

In many YouTube reviews, the fragrance is often rejected by women, perhaps too musty and lacking sweetness and not aquatic at all. So so...

Anyone trying to impress women with this scent is digging their own grave. However, since I want the fragrance for myself and it is well-received by men, and I am heterosexual, it is not a no-go for me.

Lastly, I want to emphasize that the name does justice to the fragrance. It feels like a universal scent that is accepted in all corners of the world."
Explorer,03/26/2024,Jannis24,M,1,,3,Super Allrounder,"Montblanc Explorer is a super fresh citrusy yet slightly fruity fragrance. A great allrounder for any occasion and every season. Very masculine scent that often gets compliments. Sillage and longevity are also absolutely satisfactory. Personally, I prefer to wear it in spring and summer. For the price, an absolute 10/10."
Explorer,09/02/2025,Qzbriel,M,136,,2,A Remarkable Interpretation of an Icon,"At first sniff, one might think they have sprayed on Aventus. However, upon closer inspection, one notices subtle differences that reveal the clone.

The Explorer comes across as somewhat more aromatic and a bit less zesty. One could say it feels a bit smoother and more refined than its predecessor. This can be seen as a positive or a negative, depending on the occasion one is pursuing.

Additionally, it also resembles a typical cologne a bit more: Very Ambroxan-heavy and a good hint of Iso E Super (even though it's not listed) is noticeable. While this makes it quite fresh and aquatic, it also comes across as distinctly synthetic at the same time.

What stands out as well is the bergamot, which has a slightly higher dominance compared to Aventus. In that fragrance, the pineapple is more in focus.

All in all, it feels like a designer-appropriate version of Aventus, with an emphasis on light aromatics, paired with a fine-synthetic freshness. Certainly a good and affordable alternative, where one doesn't need to feel guilty about spraying it for a lesser occasion.

H/S is definitely good for its category and price range. One should just be clear that they are not getting a 1:1 copy of Aventus, but rather an Aventus-like cologne."

All in all, a good scent that can be..."
Explorer,08/22/2025,Bjack,M,2,,2,Affordable Aventus in a Beautiful Outfit,"Of course, there was a well-known model as inspiration here, that cannot be denied. However, I will still try to evaluate it on its own merits.

It starts with a lot of lemon and then becomes increasingly woody, unfortunately a bit too much wood for my taste, so it slightly veers into bitterness. Otherwise, it's quite one-dimensional, well composed and balanced, but nothing special or outstanding, just a good fragrance and nothing more.
Explorer honestly sounds like more to me; it could also be a good shower gel.

The price/performance ratio is of course excellent, and one is nitpicking at a high level here.

Wearable in almost any situation and a people pleaser, if you're looking for a balanced, affordable scent that smells more expensive than it is, then it's definitely a good choice.

The bottle is also very heavy and feels high-quality, with one of the best designs in recent times, perfectly fitting the brand and looking nice on the shelf.

Anyone looking for an affordable Aventus should definitely give this a sniff; in my opinion, it doesn't fall short of its famous brother in any way, except for the price. But Aventus isn't for everyone; you have to like this mix of sweet and woody.

Still well done!"
Explorer,07/28/2023,Spatz1567,M,5,,0,Fresh All-Rounder,"I was looking for a no-brainer scent that I could also wear at the gym. I found it: Explorer.
First, let's talk about longevity and sillage. If you're looking for a long-lasting, strongly projecting fragrance, this is not the one for you. For me, it serves its purpose perfectly, lasting about 3-4 hours and being noticeable, but then it fades away.
Another advantage: it doesn't create a scent cloud around you, but is very close to the skin. Perfect for the gym, you don't annoy others with a strong perfume smell, but you can still smell it on yourself enough.

Now, about the scent itself, it starts off very citrusy and artificial, with the bergamot coming through nicely. The pepper makes its presence known, and you can tell that ambroxan is in there. I can't pick out much more. At the same time, it reminds me a bit of aftershave, in a positive way. Although I would describe the scent development as very linear, it becomes slightly softer and almost creamier over time. Nevertheless, you get exactly what you smell when you spray it on. There's not much scent evolution. I don't detect any leather or cocoa.

Conclusion: I would buy it again and again, great price-performance ratio, fits in almost any situation, and is also a good entry-level fragrance.

Regarding the Aventus topic: The explorer lacks the pineapple and is not smoky. Otherwise, there is a similarity. Still, it is a standalone fragrance."
Explorer,07/23/2024,OmbreJaeger,M,8,,2,"He is it, but also not... maybe he is?","Just to clarify, he is not really Creed Aventus.
You could probably tell some people who are not that knowledgeable about perfumes that it is Creed Aventus, but that’s about it.
My girlfriend personally loves this scent and I use it as a ''Straight Outta the Shower'' fragrance, as well as for non-special occasions, like the office.
Nothing special, but also not wrong.
I managed to snag 60ML for 21.00 euros, you can't complain about that.

Now to the scent composition:

It starts fresh with bergamot and pink pepper and then transitions into a robust blend of vetiver and leather.
The dry down is warm and pleasant thanks to ambroxan and a hint of cocoa... (cocoa if you really get into it ;-))"
Explorer,11/10/2022,Emral,M,15,,0,"New, in its own way","A modern man smells like this. MB Explorer is an absolutely brilliant fragrance; the beginning is very fruity with orange. You can imagine a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, really phenomenal. After that, the scent develops into a woody note, but always remains fresh. I have had the fragrance for a while now and have experienced a lasting power of about 6-8 hours each time, and it logically lasts even longer on clothing. But for me, this longevity is ideal because you smell good during the day and in the late afternoon, no one at the gym is bothered by your scent. The fragrance is generally suitable year-round, but I see it as a scent for moderate temperatures in autumn/spring."
Explorer,10/14/2022,GIBBI,M,7,,1,Aven...what?,"I discovered this scent at an airport and sprayed it on for testing, but the fresh synthetic opening didn't excite me much at first.

At that time, I was not familiar with Aventus or any other niche fragrances and didn't know that it was inspired by something.

Shortly after, on the plane, I realized I couldn't keep my nose away from my wrist; the scent developed very well and was then ordered immediately at a very reasonable price.
I had a similar enthusiasm back then with Sauvage EDT; apparently, I like Ambroxan.

Now that I know exactly what the scent is and have also tested others like Rumz and CDNI, I must say that Explorer is my favorite on most days.

It avoids the extremely smoky notes and is thus a good all-rounder that I can wear on warmer days.

For me, it’s basically an Aventus that is ""even more mainstream"" and perfectly suited for Western noses.

The longevity for me is a good 8 hours, during which it projects nicely.
I also like the bottle itself, and the sprayer is okay.

For the price, it's a no-brainer for anyone who enjoys this fragrance DNA! :)"
Explorer,09/24/2025,ParfumFl0,M,5,,1,Absolutely Solid Everyday Fragrance,"For me, this is truly an all-around solid scent. It won't blow anyone away or particularly surprise them, nor does it need to. Especially not for the price.
It is often said that it has the Aventus DNA, and I must say, yes, there is definitely a resemblance. Since Aventus is personally too expensive for me, but I still wanted to know how similar the two are, I sprayed Aventus in a perfume shop and compared it at home.
In the opening, I think you can smell most of the differences. The Explorer lacks the distinctive pineapple, which I actually find very nice in Aventus and miss just a little bit. It is lightly peppery fresh, paired with bergamot. Overall, a very nice fresh start.
In the drydown, however, the differences become less apparent in my opinion. It is somewhat more synthetic, but completely acceptable for the price. My girlfriend thinks I smell like a needle forest. I don't find it that extremely woody or smelling of pine needles, but I understand the thought. The Explorer is definitely woody, no question, but there is also a bit of leather that rounds it off very nicely.
You can tell that the Explorer is inspired by Aventus, but it is not a 1:1 clone.
The sillage is unfortunately a bit disappointing, but that also makes it a good scent for the office or sports, especially since it is not an overpowering fragrance that should offend anyone. On the contrary. I have even received compliments for the Explorer!
In my opinion, a good, affordable alternative to Aventus. Those looking for a bit more performance might want to reach for the Arabic clones, like Club de Nuit Intense, although I must say I haven't been able to test it myself yet.

The Explorer is actually available in almost every perfume shop, so anyone who wants to test it should be able to do so everywhere. I think even a blind buy is justifiable here due to the price. However, one shouldn't expect too much. It's simply a well-rounded fragrance, unfortunately with weak performance ):"
Explorer,02/23/2023,DerKadir,M,12,,2,Always Wearable,"As already seen in the title above, Montblanc Explorer can be worn at any time.

I must honestly admit that the scent did not impress me much at first. But as it often happens, I have come to appreciate it. It is particularly pleasant when it lightly lingers in the air after the drydown. Explorer has something clean about it; at its heart, it is clearly masculine due to the combination of some woodiness and leather, quite citrusy in the top note.

Associations with pineapple are definitely present, even though it is not listed in the fragrance pyramid. Consequently, it also reminds me a bit of Aventus. I can definitely agree with my predecessors on the point that Explorer is not as smoky as Aventus. I think this makes Explorer even more suitable for any situation.

I find the bottle really beautiful. I have the 30ml version, and it is just a real pleasure to hold.

I got the fragrance for 24 euros including shipping. It was also a blind buy. I would buy it again."
Explorer,12/27/2022,Sijey18,M,6,,1,Good Everyday Fragrance,"The fragrance opens with fresh citrus notes that create a lively and energetic atmosphere. At the heart of the scent, there are spicy notes of bergamot and pepper that add depth and character to the fragrance.

The finale of the scent consists of deep and woody notes of vetiver, leather, and patchouli, giving it a masculine and seductive touch. Overall, I would describe the fragrance as woody-aromatic, and I think it is especially suitable for men looking for a scent that reflects their adventurous spirit and the essence of discovery.

I wore the fragrance at work, and many of my colleagues noticed it and were taken by it. I rated the performance as average, but still sufficient for everyday wear. Overall, I would say that Montblanc Explorer is a solid fragrance."
Explorer,12/23/2022,Ogami,M,8,,1,My house is my house,"Every time I smell the bottle, it whispers softly in my ear: “Take me to the office!” I would never wear Explorer on a date. But I would wear it when sitting across from my boss and saying, “Trust me, I’ve got the project under control!” Explorer is, for me, the epitome of seriousness and grooming.

It has a certain spiciness and sharpness that creates a polite distance from the other person (hence also unsuitable for a date). At the same time, however, a subtle sweetness sneaks in, preventing one from appearing aloof and grumpy. It is a formal invitation that says, “Feel free to come by, but don’t feel at home. My house is my house.”

Therefore, Explorer might not only be unsuitable for a date but is generally more of a scent for formal occasions. Anyone wearing Explorer in their free time might give the impression of either having a stick up their a** or being forced to try to be perceived as particularly serious by others. (No offense to anyone who wears Explorer in their free time; you still smell good!)

In summary, Explorer is the perfect scent for things like: the office, the baptism of a nephew/niece, the wedding of a not-so-intimate acquaintance, a funeral, or the opera.

Addendum: A review is always subjective and based on the perception of the reviewer. Therefore, please do not take statements personally or generalize them to all people. Every statement should actually begin with “Within the horizon of my perception…” But then reviews would be unreadable."
Explorer,09/04/2025,ascalP,M,12,,2,The Rider in the Shadow of the White Mountain,"The fragrance brings a pleasant freshness that feels modern and versatile. At the same time, it is harmoniously balanced and feels rounder than the expensive model. It is a scent that can be worn almost anywhere.
Montblanc Explorer impresses mainly with its excellent price-performance ratio. For me, it is not just a cheaper alternative, but better than its more famous counterpart with the rider.
Overall, a clear recommendation for anyone looking for a high-quality, fresh, and masculine scent without having to dig deep into their pockets."
Explorer,08/17/2025,Bamoida5,M,6,,0,Price/Performance?,"I personally perceive the scent for a maximum of 2 hours. In my opinion, it doesn't matter that the fragrance is sometimes available for just ~60 euros per 200!!! ml. Otherwise, it is a pleasant citrus scent, but you can't really find anything special about it. Just test it out in person. I must say that there are significantly better alternatives - like Turathi..."
Explorer,02/16/2023,Emikae,M,29,,1,No alternative to Aventus …but I find this one better,"So it happened that I stayed over at a friend's place yesterday, woke up today, took a shower, and was just about to leave the house with him on our way to school. Just before I was about to put on my jacket, he spontaneously asked me if I wanted to spray on one of his perfumes for a moment. Of course, I couldn't pass that up. Instinctively, I reached for Explorer, but with low expectations, as the performance of most, including my friend, was rated as not very impressive. Following his instructions, I sprayed on three spritzes. The scent was very good at first, but also very subtle.
Half an hour later came the surprise; suddenly, an immense cloud of fragrance enveloped me, which didn't seem to fade away. My friend shared this surprise; the scent had never performed so well on him. Even now, 9 hours later, the scent is still wafting around; at least in terms of performance, it is ten times better than Aventus.

However, I think that the two fragrances can be compared in very few other areas; they differ too much. In the drydown, I smell a lot of pepper in Explorer, while Aventus, for me, tends to fade away with a creamy scent. The first 20 minutes are admittedly very similar, but after that, the two fragrances go in very different directions. Interestingly, I prefer the development of Explorer much more than that of Aventus.

P/L is excellent. Performance is at least 10 hours with a sillage of initially 2 meters and later (after my 9 hours so far) just under a meter."
Explorer,02/20/2024,Arthurretep,M,4,,0,Cleaner Everyday Scent,"I mainly wear Montblanc Explorer as an everyday scent when I don't feel like overthinking what would suit me best today. It smells fresh and clean, yet it is not characterless like some other aquatic fragrances. Overall, especially for the price, it's quite a no-brainer."
Explorer,09/28/2024,Scentlemam,M,2,,1,Wonderful Allrounder,"Montblanc Explorer... This fragrance was recommended to me a while ago, but I never really had any interest in it. One day, while helping a woman at a Douglas store to arrange a few bottles, she gave me 2 perfume testers as a thank you. Jpg le Male le Parfum and Montblanc Explorer. I then tested it a few times and realized that it simply fits into every conceivable life..."
Explorer,07/11/2024,Terko7474,M,4,,1,Signature Scent for All Occasions/Seasons,"The Aven… I mean Explorer is a beautiful perfume that stands out with its fresh and spicy notes. The top note is dominated by notes that immediately unfold a refreshing and invigorating effect. A hint of pepper gives the fragrance a subtle sharpness and makes it the …
… yes, the Aventus!
There’s not much more to say about this awesome scent. The affordable Aventus par excellence. Light smoke paired with a citrusy freshness that makes everyone take a second look. Perfectly suited as a signature scent. Montblanc has done a great job here."
Explorer,09/16/2025,MattNope,M,1,,0,Unfortunately Disappointed After All,"Now I feel compelled to write the first review, unfortunately not from a positive motivation. I got the Explorer last year based on so many recommendations and found it great as a daily scent or for the office. I was even complimented on it, which is rather rare for me. Since this year the bottle ran out and the price is still very attractive, I naturally ordered another bottle, this time even the 100ml (last time only the 60ml). Unpacked, sprayed on, 1 to 2 hours later...nothing. There was nothing left of the scent except for the biting/stinging smell that often remains with fresh cheap perfumes due to their longevity (I think that’s Ambroxan or something, feel free to correct me). That was not the case with my old bottle at all, I really can't stand that. What a disappointment, I have no idea if I just had bad luck with the purchase, but if the new batch performs like this in terms of scent quality and performance, the Explorer is unfortunately dead to me. It was really solid, a coherent overall package, but as it is now, I don’t think it can be recommended anymore."
Explorer,02/01/2025,TheD315,M,21,,0,A great companion for everyday life!,"The Explorer definitely belongs to the category of fragrances that can be worn effortlessly in any season and for any occasion! It's like a Swiss Army knife among perfumes.

It is a very fresh and very clean scent, quite pleasant, but nothing that really blows me away personally.

It's an average scent similar to Dior Sauvage, Versace Eros, or Acqua di Gio, fragrances that everyone seems to wear these days. It's not a bad scent, but nothing groundbreaking, and it's a fragrance that you can often smell outdoors in pedestrian zones or while waiting in line at the supermarket. It has definitely become very mainstream, to put it briefly.

I don't want to speak poorly of the scent because it is by no means bad.

It smells very citrusy, slightly fruity with a hint of wood and a touch of leather.

The scent is definitely a safe blind buy and an ideal entry into the world of perfumes.

In terms of price, the fragrance is an absolute steal; the 30ml starter size can sometimes be found for under €30, and the largest size of 100ml for under €60. For a designer brand, that's definitely a statement.

The scent is very similar to the very expensive Aventus, but here you get a fragrance that is strikingly similar to Aventus and costs only a fraction of that!

All in all, a successful flanker, but as mentioned, quite mainstream, and there are definitely better alternatives that stand out a bit more from the crowd."
Explorer,10/02/2025,Adrian222,M,6,,0,Fresh Scent for Men,"By chance, I came across a bottle of Explorer. To start with the positives, the scent is worth noting given the moderate price.
It is a nice, not overly intrusive fragrance with pleasant fruity notes, a bit of citrus, and a hint of woodiness - a friendly men’s scent that doesn’t immediately veer into ""smoky"" or ""leathery"" territory.
The fragrance can be worn by young and old alike, and it is also suitable as a subtle companion for the office, not being disturbing or even intrusive.

A bit critical is the relatively short longevity of the scent. The composition at the beginning does come off as somewhat artificial-alcoholic, which is probably also due to the price. I don’t see this perfume as a real competitor to ""Aventus."" Aventus is clearly the more upscale fragrance for the businessman in a suit and tie (if one can describe it that way) with better essences that come together beautifully, are a bit ""smokier,"" and last significantly longer.

Despite this, Explorer is a fragrance that can be used every day and for any occasion, even for the younger generation.
It is not too harsh-smoky in the dry down, but offers a nice blend of fruity yet typically masculine scent notes with Ambroxan. The perfume will definitely remain in my collection, as it is universally applicable, possibly also for layering with other perfumes that bring a bit more masculine touch and longevity."
Explorer,09/23/2025,SmellWell05,M,11,,0,Explorer,"Montblanc Explorer opens for me with a lightly peppery freshness, immediately accompanied by a fruity pineapple note. The scent feels modern, elegant, and pleasantly dynamic. Unfortunately, the Explorer smells too synthetic to me overall, and the longevity is too short at 4 hours. A Prada Luna Rosa Carbon is better suited for everyday wear and comes without the artificial pineapple scent."
Explorer,11/01/2025,Yusuf86,M,1,,0,Great Scent for Men,"Guys, the scent is great.

Many women have already commented on it. Ladies love it.

Longevity is so-so. Overspray is a must.

The opening was even better a few years ago - much fruitier.

Still a banger.

I don't compare it to Aventus. They obviously go in the same direction [fresh, woody, masculine], otherwise they smell completely different to me."
Legend Red,01/28/2024,Pierreparfum,M,19,,2,Good scent for a low price,"Very masculine sexy scent with freshness of citrus and spices balanced with woods and tonka beans. Performances are average, not bad, not beast. You can find it 55€/100 ml on discounters websites so it's a very good price. Very versatile not too fresh, not too loud, you can wear it all year long (but better fall and spring I think) for any occasion. Nothing revolutionary but a good scent for a low price."
Legend Red,08/25/2025,ComputerMaus,M,264,,4,Why It’s Sometimes Better to Throw Your Identity Overboard,"Many designer interpretations of modern, maximally successful fragrances (Sauvage EAU DE TOILETTE, Aventus) copy, excuse me, orient themselves to their role models, but with a few minor adjustments, especially at the beginning. Sometimes this works better (Authentic Man, Explorer, Luna Rossa Carbon), sometimes less so (MCM Onyx). Sometimes it goes completely wrong. Sometimes it would have been better to just copy the foundation outright.

Legend Red starts fresh, clinically citrusy, sour, and slightly woody. This clinical synthetic quality bothers me immensely and has something of a cleaning product (but not of the pleasant kind). At this point, I am (still) very disappointed with the fragrance, which is referred to as a hidden gem by some YouTubers.
After about half an hour, the tide turns: The cedar now comes to the forefront, grapefruit and blood orange, which are so poorly executed here, recede much further into the background, and - Sauvage comes to the fore. Yes, that’s right, Legend Red incorporates a decent portion of the successful designer DNA from 2015 in the drydown (albeit without pepper). At this point, I begin to like the fragrance.
However, it is already too late for the overall rating; the creepy start cannot be redeemed by the progression.

In addition, the performance is mixed. While the fragrance lasts a solid 7 hours on my skin, the sillage leaves much to be desired right from the first spray, and on the other hand, it loses much of its already low projection power after just an hour and a half. The price is very reasonable, but this is also reflected in the performance.
The bottle, lastly, is the typical one from the Legend series in fiery red. I’m not particularly fond of the basic shape; it’s a bit spartan and looks somewhat dated in my opinion, but otherwise it’s okay. The bright color, in my opinion, rather enhances the impression of being old-fashioned.

A solid fragrance for everyday and sports, but not extraordinary, and one should first get used to the start."
Legend Red,07/05/2022,Tracker,M,7,,3,Grapefruit at the Beach Bar,"Blood orange and grapefruit in the top note. Not boring but also not interesting, just pleasant enough not to be stared at by everyone in the room.
-not at all intrusive-
I wore the fragrance on a hot summer morning. After half an hour, the juniper berries came through. The woody notes in the base were hardly noticeable to me, and the scent remained rather fresh. Unfortunately, the overall impression of the fragrance was marred by a synthetic note that made it seem somewhat cheap. Even in a closed room, I could only perceive the scent on my skin after two hours (with 4 sprays)."
Présence,07/15/2017,Manscents,M,14,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Spicy Apple and Cinnamon,"Presence is a a well blended scent from the house of Montblanc. It is a very pleasing fragrance and holds some similarities to L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent. I find it well balanced by Corinne Cachen. The scent opens with cinnamon, apple and some ginger. Once the scent settles down some of the other notes start to come through a little more. Presence is a very fresh and clean and is very versatile and it could be worn in any occasion and is ideal for the workplace.

The longevity is slightly above average on my skin, Projection is decent but subtle. I like the the bottle design but the only negative is the cap on the bottle appears to be a very loose when closed and comes off easily. This is only a minor issue.

Overall a solid 7.5/10"

It reminds me of my school bus driver from back in the day, Mid 90s. I like it. I don't love it. I did spray it on one arm about 5 hours ago and I still smell it, and get whiffs as I walk around the house. It is very much a sweet shaving cream type smell. Its not bad. I think longevity on my skin will be decent. I do not think I can pull this off in the heat though. Might be overpowering. To me, this is a fall and winter scent.

Présence,03/11/2013,Miaw2,M,339,,3,Okay cinnamon!,"Montblanc Presence smells classy and refined.

Despite being subtle, it has a good staying power and okay projection.

I smell lots of cinnamon with spices and ginger, all over a vanilla base.

Updated January 2014"
Présence,06/09/2017,Basti87,M,1062,,16,For indulging,"Montblanc is one of my favorite brands when it comes to price-performance ratio. At the top is the berry scent Individuel, which has a large fanbase. Additionally, there is the Fierce-like scent Legend or Legend Intense. Emblem, Starwalker, and this one are less known but still very good fragrances from this brand. They all have one thing in common: great performance, high-quality scent, and a low price. Where others charge a lot of money, you can get these fragrances for around 30 euros. Classy. The stationery from this brand is quite expensive and more for business people, while the fragrances, in my opinion, lean more towards the casual range.

I bought this fragrance this year. 75ml for around 30 euros. Well-spent money for fans of sweet and fruity scents. Even though it states that production has been discontinued, the fragrance is still readily available. And that's a good thing. An interesting scent that stands out from many. Really a nice blend of heavy-light. It starts with a powerful dose of cinnamon and ginger. Rather on the heavier side. But not too heavy, as bergamot, apple, and sage give it a nice freshness. However, those who do not like cinnamon or ginger should steer clear of this scent. Heliotrope is also present, and it's a note that I really like. Woods and a lovely sweetness from tonka complete the rest and round off the fragrance well. Very pleasant and delicious creation. It slightly reminds me of my first self-purchased fragrance Bruno Banani Man, which I loved and still like very much today. Not a twin, as Presence is truly unique with a high recognition value. A big plus point, as you don't often smell such fragrances and could receive some compliments if you care about that.
The performance is also very good, like all Montblancs. The sillage is really pleasant and just right. Especially in the first hours. Over time, it diminishes a bit, but still remains in a pleasant range. The longevity is also good with many hours.

Overall, Presence is a really beautiful fragrance with a lot of recognition value. Especially between 10 and 20 degrees, it is a truly lovely transitional scent that I really enjoy. This fragrance is really inexpensive and offers a lot for it. Highly recommended!"
Présence,08/27/2018,Flo92,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,15,Blindbuy Superstar!,"Montblanc Présence has been on my watch list for a while, and since the high summer seems to be coming to an end, I thought it was about time to start looking for a new autumn/winter fragrance.
So I went through my ""fragrance to-do list"" and ultimately found myself irresistibly drawn to Présence. Even though the scent is classified as a year-round fragrance, I associate cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla, and woody notes more with the colder season. Unfortunately, it seems that the production of the perfume has been discontinued, so it ended up being another blind buy. However, since I have generally liked every Montblanc fragrance so far and the notes used here match my taste quite closely, my fear wasn't too great.
A few days ago, the fragrance finally arrived, and I must say that I really cannot understand how one could discontinue the production of such an amazing scent.
The top note is characterized by a fruity-apple-cinnamon note and, due to the clearly present sweetness, somehow reminds me of the candied apples from the fair (in a positive way). In the middle, the vanilla becomes more pronounced, and after a while, the woody notes dominate, just as you would expect from the fragrance pyramid :)
Unfortunately, both sillage and longevity are a slight drawback for me. Présence tends to be perceived as very close to the skin quite quickly unless I apply it quite generously. The same goes for longevity. With ""normal"" use, I find myself somewhere between 4-5 hours. Especially with autumn/winter fragrances, one hopes for a bit more. At 25€/75ml, I can easily forgive that for the perfume. If in doubt, you can always just reapply after a while :D
All in all, I can truly recommend Présence to anyone looking for a somewhat more unusual (since lesser-known) fragrance away from the mainstream."
Présence,03/09/2024,Flanagan,M,4,,21,Time Travel,"I haven't worn this fragrance in fact for much more than 15 years. For various reasons.... To be honest, I even gave away the fragrance (98 out of 100 ml) back then. I just couldn't wear it. Not anymore. It was the last fragrance my father gave me for Christmas before he passed away. My father put so much thought into what gift I would like. After all, he knew exactly..."
Présence,03/23/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Cinnamon Aquatic Snow Globe,"Just because I was so enthusiastic about Mont Blanc's Individuel, it was time to test another creation from the luxury brand. And since the price was right and I had never seen it in stores for testing, I ordered it blind online in the 50 ml version. Unfortunately, it was not delivered in the nicer snow globe version, Mont Blanc seems to have changed that. But it still looks beautiful, and the bottle reminds me of the Individuel bottle, with the turquoise liquid shimmering nicely.

The scent is certainly unique in its composition, not everyday, and I have never smelled anything like it before. Fortunately, I tend more towards the above average note than to Joe's below comment. But I must say I like both fruity and very sweet as well as fresh perfumes. And Presence lies exactly in the triangle of these 3 characteristics. It is cinnamon and slightly spicy. It also has something refreshingly summery, almost aquatic. Cinnamon and water sounds like an acquired taste, but it is much more pleasant and could even appeal to the mainstream audience. However, Presence lacks the recognition it deserves due to its courage and uniqueness. The third strong component is the sweet and citrusy fruits that round off the scent. Namely apple and bergamot. Very delicious, likeable, and digestible. However, one must be into sweet scents, as both the fruit sugar content and the vanilla finish are sweet and youthful. At times I thought it could be good for the office, but it might be a bit too sweet after all. More of a casual scent!

The bottle is, as mentioned, typically stylish Mont Blanc, and anyone who even gets the snow globe should not hesitate long. Due to the sweetness, the sillage is strong, almost leaning towards a going-out scent and is similar to the popular Original Santal clone. The longevity is very good, typical for vanilla finishes, you get a long wear out of it!

Not at the level of Individuel, but very solid and versatile. And you stand out from the crowd!"
Présence,05/24/2018,Farneon,M,112,,8,Representing all (old) Montblancs: a true delight!,"I mentioned elsewhere that I only became aware of Montblanc as an EDT manufacturer through Parfumo. At Douglas or in duty-free shops, this brand has never been recommended to me. I don't even know if they were ever in stock. Unfortunately, with Legend and Emblem along with their flankers, there are only two fragrances left in the current offering. Presence is unfortunately no longer included, nor are Starwalker and Individuel! :-(

Presence can still be ordered for little money. I paid 35 euros for 75 ml. Like the other mentioned fragrances, this scent impresses me with a finely balanced fruitiness that I have only detected in a few perfumes so far. The sillage is by no means intrusive, but still noticeable for several hours at about half an arm's length, especially when sitting at the computer in the office and casually moving my nose towards the keyboard! ;-)

I want to write about Montblancs in general here - also because I am not a ""perfume sommelier."" Legend is certainly the most mass-compatible scent (a kind of fougère), Starwalker the freshest, Individuel the fruitiest, and Presence the sweetest. I find them all fascinating and very distinctive! Only Legend Spirit disappointed me, and Emblem seems to me, based on the reviews, to be too sweet-gourmand.

I am simply thrilled by the perfect balance of the (old) Montblanc fragrances (including Legend) and of course the excellent price-performance ratio. None of them comes across as overpowering or intrusive! The sweetness is not too cloying, the freshness not too fleeting, the fruitiness not too one-dimensional, and the fougère not too mainstream. Perhaps it was good that four different perfumers were involved here, each able to showcase their own signature, with the briefing perhaps stating: ""Do something unique, but remain brand-compatible. We like it original, but not too extreme! We stand for high class, but not for decadence!"" ;-)

In any case, I am delighted by the discovery of four wonderful fragrances that are absolutely suitable for everyday wear yet still have their own distinct character. And to return to Presence: Even when you read apple, cardamom, and cinnamon: Let yourself be surprised! It has little to do with the Christmas market... unless Christmas Eve is moved to summer and there's a roller coaster involved! ;-)"
Présence,10/15/2020,DN1982,M,75,,4,You know it...,"What am I reading here? Blindbuy Superstar, a true delight, an extraordinary fragrance that you don't come across every day.
Yes, folks, when I first get a whiff of such a scent, it truly is exceptional. But I want to write a bit about it. Ginger and bergamot are not the number 1 in the top notes; the ginger is more noticeable of the two, while the cinnamon - logically - is prominent and lingers down to the base, but fades towards the end. The apple, which firmly establishes itself in the middle, actually plays its role in the top notes. In the further drydown, as Presence approaches its end, which unfortunately comes a bit too soon, a slight restlessness emerges that tries to break the sweetness or take away its one-dimensionality. At this point, I find it hard to say whether it’s due to the sage or the bone-dry teak wood; I would tend to lean towards the teak wood.

For the price, it’s certainly something nice. But it’s not that extraordinary, as I have at least 2 fragrances in my repertoire that shoot in the same direction as Presence. The former would be RDLC from the British label Lee Cooper. Both fragrances are quite similar; however, the more successful variant is Presence, especially since RDLC has a musty, piercing note of dry willow and lime wood that perhaps a woodcarver might appreciate, but no true fragrance lover would seriously enjoy.
Another fragrance that goes in this direction was O Boticario Onix, which I loved very much. However, here the Brazilian has the upper hand, as this one is based on the crisp, tart green apple and is overall more multifaceted and spicier.
And even a classic and true nose-pleaser like Boss Soul is not entirely dissimilar to Presence, although it cannot be called a scent twin of Presence.

So, I’ve somewhat torpedoed the uniqueness of Presence, but that doesn’t mean that Presence is bad. I wouldn’t equate it with Spice Bomb, as happened in one of the comments; that’s a different ballpark.

Despite being ""discontinued,"" Presence has a decisive advantage: unlike RDLC, Onix, and Soul, this one is easily obtainable and at moderate prices!"
Présence,02/08/2021,DominikR,M,4,,4,You have to try it once,"Right from the start, I stumbled upon MB Presence and then bought an almost full bottle at a great price here on Parfumo.

First, about the bottle: It is simple, elegant, and the color of the liquid looks really delicious. Like a green apple that you want to bite into, and I had exactly that sour feeling in my mouth when I saw it for the first time. Unfortunately, the cap is a bit wobbly, but that's not a big deal.

Upon the first spray, a sharp, peppery, synthetic apple note hit me. It reminds me of Proraso Aftershave from that big bottle.
This sharpness fades away quite quickly, and you feel the transition to sweet apple and mild cinnamon, which actually holds on until the end before it transitions into an Ambroxan blend. So, not really spectacular.

Overall, it's a nice freshie that you can actually wear for any occasion throughout the year. In winter after a shower, in summer as a daily fragrance, but like many in this price range, it doesn't last long, which is why I will probably use it up and not repurchase.
One shouldn't expect much development. But for €15 you can get the bottle new, and that's quite reasonable."
Présence,02/02/2022,Daniel1323,M,22,,1,So present it is unfortunately not... But delicious all the same!,"I stumbled upon a nicely full Présence at a very good price during a group order at the Souk. The fragrance pyramid didn't blow me away, as the well-known combination of sweet, fruity, and spicy notes is anything but spectacular. But in the end, it was interesting enough to take the plunge, which was certainly also due to the good reviews here.

Upon the first spray, I was pleasantly surprised, as Présence starts off significantly spicier than expected. The fruity-fresh sweetness sneaks in later into the mix. The combination of apple, cinnamon, and ginger somewhat reminds me of licorice, but in a good way. Those who enjoy smoking shisha will know what I mean (classic double apple). As it develops, it is pleasantly complemented by a few woody notes, which, however, disappear so quickly that they are hardly worth mentioning. This brings us to the major problem of Présence:
The longevity is unfortunately terribly poor. I really can't understand how it currently has a rating of 7.2. Just when you think it’s really getting going in terms of fragrance development, it fades away again. The sillage is pleasantly strong at first, but diminishes significantly during its very short lifespan. It's a shame, really, because the scent itself is not bad. Unfortunately, this means you have to reapply regularly.

Overall, Présence is fine if you're looking for a fragrance that doesn't stand out too much in the sea of fruity-fresh perfumes, but still brings a certain uniqueness. Unfortunately, in my opinion, its performance is a major drawback. However, those who can financially afford to reach for the bottle regularly will certainly not be unhappy."
Présence,03/31/2025,Lucas209,M,196,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Not that Present.,"A fragrance that is actually pleasant in its basic DNA, but unfortunately rather reserved, starting with a sweet-spicy combination of apple, cinnamon, and ginger. The opening feels slightly minty and quickly drifts into a somewhat overly synthetic territory before the warm, spicy notes assert themselves more strongly. Particularly, the cinnamon gives the fragrance a cozy, slightly wintry nuance.

As it develops, the synthetic note continues to grow and remains in the foreground; however, the fragrance overall remains rather fleeting. After about one to two hours, it nearly completely dissipates, making it more of a short-lived companion. Those looking for a long-lasting scent will likely be disappointed here.

Despite the weaknesses in longevity, the fragrance composition itself is pleasant and quite wearable - especially for those who enjoy warm spicy notes but do not want to be accompanied by an overly intense scent. Perfect for relaxed occasions or when one just wants to briefly immerse themselves in a warm, spicy cloud of fragrance."
Explorer Ultra Blue,05/12/2021,KimJong,M,64,,11,"A familiar, clean, mineralic scent","I was quite looking forward to it even before it was released. I tested it on my skin yesterday and also brought a scented paper. Now I have to say that it is a thorough mainstream aquatic perfume but not boring. Explorer Ultra Blue can still be included in the same category with Sauvage, Y, or so, but it is not a shower gel type, rather a perfume with marine mineral elements such as Bvlgari Aqva, D&G LB Swimming In Lipari, or Invictus Legend.

We already know that Montblanc is not a brand of originality or artistry in the perfume market. Their value is to finely predict consumer demand and join the trend at the right time. But they couldn't join the ambroxan festival of the 2010s. They must have been very concerned about how to inherit the trend as a latecomer in the market, and the result is this, Explorer Ultra Blue. They didn't make the scent more luxurious or special at all. Instead, they took note of the phenomenon in which other designer brands began to accept the salty mineral use. That salty mineral use is something that niche houses have tried first, something that has already been known to the point of safety, but has not become very popular yet.

Anyway, the early opening of Ultra Blue is a fruity cocktail-like scent, which is not very refreshing but also not sticky. This opening provides sweetness for teenage consumers but does not follow the pattern of mainstream men's perfumes. Anyway, the opening disappears quickly, soon after, a salty bergamot pops out. Pepper doesn't stand out very much, but adds a little bit of sharpness to this. And the ambroxan bomb, which is already supersaturated in the market, begins, and it followed the trend of men's perfumes in the 2010s, but emphasized the salty one. It is not necessary to mention the synthetic patchouli and leather that remain in the drydown. They are not materials for a good scent, they are just to increase the longevity, I think.

However, I think there's a reason why mineralic thing can't be completely mainstream, like ozonic thing. Ozonic perfumes make citrus brighter and more beautiful under certain conditions, but when it's not very hot, they also smell like cheap wipes. Likewise, Mineralic perfumes can give different experiences depending on the wearer, but sometimes it evokes horrible unpleasant memories for a person like me. I was born in a conscription country and had to be conscripted regardless of my will. Soldiers there disinfected always, whether was cleaning a camp or grooming equipment, with iodine solution. So the mineralic perfume is the smell of iodine solution used in the army for me. Whether it calls mineralic, marine or seaweed, whatever.

Nevertheless, Explorer Ultra Blue may be the first Mineralic perfume I'll buy. It scents more familiar and wearable than other perfumes with mineral notes to express the cold smell of the sea. it's more recent than Bvlgari Aqva. Nor is it overly sweet like Invictus Legend. It's definitely more masculine than D&G Light Blue Swimming In Lipari. It lasts longer than Valentino Born In Roma and has a little more clean feeling. But surely Ultra Blue won't be my most favorite perfume, and even if I buy it, it'll be time to sell at a discount store very cheaply. Sometimes others simply abbreviate these words as ""Nothing Special"", but I thought this perfume was pretty good than ""Nothing Special"". That's because It have made the kind of smell what I hate as acceptable as possible.

PS 1: Very little resemblance to Explorer original. The original wasn't even a literally original anyway, you know, so please stop your hasty expectations about Ultra Blue.

PS 2: If it's the same price range, of course ADG Profondo is much better. However, if the price of Explorer Ultra Blue goes down to 1/3 of Profondo, the evaluation will be different.

PS 3: I'm sorry for my childish English."
Explorer Ultra Blue,10/09/2024,Smirky,M,483,,3,Average blue fragrance for men,"Liked Explorer and Platinum Explorer, so decided to try Ultra Blue. The best way I can describe it is a dialed down version of Explorer that is more fruity. It's as if the woody accord in Explorer were almost eliminated. The added fruity accord is generic, not specifically pineapple. I'd also say Ultra Blue is sorta like a watery and watered down Dylan Blue.

You can gather from the above that it's a generic blue fragrance, perfect for summer. Performance is at the lower end of moderate - got about 4 and a half hours of longevity at which point it was a barely detectable skin scent. If you don't have a blue summer fragrance, Ultra Blue could fill that hole, although I think there are others that are better. Of Explorer, Explorer Platinum and Ultra Blue, Ultra Blue is my least favorite."
Explorer Ultra Blue,07/09/2025,RatCow,M,1,,2,I am confused by the influencer hate for Ultra Blue.,"I don't get the all the negativity on this one from the toobers. Maybe my expectations for Ultra Blue were different than the rest of planet earth. Sure, the performance is moderate, but performance IS moderate on most fresh fragrances with similar profiles. Ultra Blue is exactly par for the course when it comes to avg. summer frag performance. As far as scent goes, I disagree that it smells like every other another generic blue like so many say. I think that assertion is mistaken. Look at the ""smells similar"" fragrances below. Mostly all blues yes, but the suggestions are all over the map exactly because it is hard to pin down another blue fragrance this smells like. Scent preference is highly subjective though, so to each his own. But to my nose, this is a great summer daily scent for men around 30+ with control over their libidos. Its not a chick magnet or attention seeker, but it was not designed to be. Its a nice guy fragrance. Maybe its a young married man with a steady job fragrance. We need frags like that too, not just screaming head turners. So, obviously I am a fan of Ultra Blue and think it deserves a shot. Don't pass on sampling it, especially if you live i a hot, long-summer climate like me. Consider what it is meant to be. Consider what it is not meant to be. You do have to spray a little heavier with this just like most other nice guy freshies."

Okay, so being a fan of both regular and platinum versions of Explorer, I figured hey, what could it hurt to blind buy a couple tall vials of their rarely-spoken-of cousin.

Man, this a crazy cousin.

The first blast is icy and clean but that subsides within a literal 5 seconds. What follows is a stark similarity to Nautica Voyage (which I hate) and what I'd describe as diapers or a nursery. There's some kind of non-descript mixed fruit aroma that reminds me of poopy diaper and gummy snacks. Some ripe and melting banana. The diaper changing room/nursery smell persists and the cologne does not morph or change.

For me this is one of the worst colognes I've ever smelled. I maybe did not expect to fall in love with it, but I did not expect this to go into the stinker hall of fame. Wife loves it. Go figure. I may try to send it back and order something else. At least it was cheap. I'd almost rather wear Nautica Voyage (puke)."
Explorer Ultra Blue,06/16/2021,Jo3ku03,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Why so much criticism?,"Finally, the Corona numbers are going down again and today I am eagerly heading to the perfume shop I trust for the first time. I had already looked into the new releases that saw the light of day in 2021. I particularly focused on the ""freshies,"" as I have always been a fan of blue, citrusy, and aquatic scents. Spicy, smoky, and heavily woody fragrances have never really appealed to me... God knows why :p
On my testing plan were 3 fragrances: Light Blue Forever (with the supposedly genius-smelling blood orange), MontBlanc Ultra Blue, and Cologne Bleu by YSL... I think you know what kind of scents I’m into ;)
When I arrived, the new Light Blue immediately caught my eye, as it was displayed in the shop window. My little heart skipped a beat and I went straight into the store.
I sprayed it on and smelled it. Eyebrows furrowed and sniffed again...
Well, what can I say? Indeed, a strong blood orange that I hadn’t detected in any other fragrance before. But as mega good as often described? I don’t know. For me, definitely not worth the money. I could have also cut open a grapefruit and spread it on my skin. In my opinion, it would have been the same scent... Well, there were still two left. So I grabbed Cologne Bleu and sprayed it on. A typical drugstore fresh opening and after a short time a clear similarity to the TuttiFrutti Invictus. Unfortunately, for me, another swing and a miss? So there was still one left: Ultra Blue by MontBlanc
I had heard increasingly negative things online and on YouTube, so I had no high expectations for the scent.
I sprayed it on and smelled:
The scent definitely starts off very citrusy and pleasant. If I had to describe the top note, I would say it’s a good mix of 2828 by Acqua Alpes and the green ""Skin Food"" cream by Weleda. Overall, the scent seems rather linear in my eyes, but maybe my nose just isn’t trained enough to pick out the individual components... The scent definitely doesn’t fill the room when you enter. Personally, I like that^^ It could also be due to my rather sparing amount of 2 sprays ;) Longevity for a freshie is above average. Certainly not a very unique scent, but a rating of 6.5 seems quite low in my opinion."

In 2021, it was finally time for another Mont Blanc Explorer. My expectations were for an evolution of the already known and solid Explorer DNA.

Explorer Ultra Blue,03/05/2025,Taurus,M,1164,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Ultra Ordinary,"The Explorer is likely to generate significant revenue for Montblanc or its licensee. Accordingly, it is not surprising (although somewhat questionable) that they are attaching flankers to this success. However, Ultra Blue has relatively little in common with the original Explorer, except that it could be categorized as a Freshy.

It starts off citrusy, herbal, and fresh with a noticeable synthetic undertone, like what feels like 1000 other fragrances in this segment. Recognizing detailed ingredients is pointless here; the whole thing is too diffuse. So, for anyone looking for an uncomplicated refresher for summer or the office, Ultra Blue is somewhat suitable, but one must have a considerable affinity for the Montblanc brand, as even in the drugstore, one could find cheaper and more interesting options nowadays.

What surprises me is the involvement of three equally prominent perfumers, whose interns during their lunch break or while slacking off could have certainly created the same result or even something more ambitious. Instead of spicing up the DNA of Explorer a bit, they took a super simple route here.

It's a shame for the name Explorer, a shame for the missed opportunity."
Explorer Ultra Blue,11/27/2021,Philipp91,M,219,,2,Montblanc Shower Gel,"This is a shower gel scent as it should be. Fresh maritime notes are paired with citrus accords. Lemon, bergamot, Calone, and a good dose of pepper. Underneath, you can perceive the typical amber note for Explorer. If you like such scents, and I definitely do, then this is a good fragrance. Many would say it is interchangeable. The DNA has been smelled many times before. Yes, I can understand that. But that doesn’t mean that Explorer Blue is a bad EdT.

EB accompanies me around work and sports (they blend for me). It fits really well for that. Longevity and sillage are typical for a fresh, aquatic scent, around the 3-4 hour mark. For that, the price is not high, and thus it balances out. Recommendation for all Freshie fans."
Explorer Ultra Blue,07/24/2022,Zacharias,M,30,,2,"I smell what you don't smell, and it's blue.","""Explorer"" - sounds exciting, especially as we are preparing for our active vacation. And ""Ultra Blue"" should be a revelation, after all, we're heading to an island in the ocean. So, a committed, adventurous, summery-fresh-aquatic scent for vacation everyday life? Let's see!

Upon the first spray, one immediately detects the scent of (drum roll!) Montblanc Legend - and not a variation of Montblanc Explorer, as the name might suggest. Beneath the elegantly subtle surface full of aquatic notes, a hint of incense immediately stands out. And then it's gone. Poof! Gone! Finito! No top note left after just two minutes. A weak, soapy-lemony scent remains, and a little later, one can only perceive a conglomerate of bitterness with a hint of cow grass near Garmisch.

So, the exciting naming does not do justice to Montblanc Explorer Ultra Blue. The brother ""Explorer"" has significantly better longevity and a more intense sillage, making it the better choice for anyone who can get used to peppery notes and a distinct oriental component. Ultra Blue, on the other hand, disappointed me and is, for me, the weakest perfume from the Montblanc house."

The opening smells beautifully fresh, and you almost feel like you’re by the sea; however, you can also detect a certain spiciness that, in my opinion, fits quite well and makes the perfume not just a summer fragrance.

Unfortunately, the longevity is not great, which means you might need to reapply if you want to last through the whole day. The scent fades quite quickly and is no longer really noticeable.

If you can get the fragrance at a reasonable price, then it’s definitely worth trying out; it’s not bad."

It comes across as quite sporty to me."
Explorer Extreme,05/16/2025,MrFragUK,M,9,,2,"Warmer, Sweeter and Spicier than the Original - But Not Bold Enough","First impressions.

Montblanc Extreme opens up with a blast of fresh citrus, but then develops into a much darker, warmer fragrance with much more depth than the original. In the drydown it also becomes sweeter and more resinous.

It's very much in the wheelhouse of Sauvage Elixir/Boss Bottled Elixir/Triumph Elixir and even Bottled Absolu, though nowhere near as strong or as bold. It feels like this is where Montblanc took its inspiration from. It also shares the same spiciness as those fragrances and has the same liquorice note found in Sauvage Elixir.

It's by no means a beast mode fragrance, and on me sits very close to the skin. Longevity is better, and I've been able to smell it for most of the day. Personally I would prefer it to be punchier and project better.

It's a 6 out of 10 for me at the moment, as it needs more wear. It's not a bad fragrance, it's just that there are other fragrances out there doing the same kind of thing, only better."
Explorer Extreme,09/18/2025,Dionysos2022,M,945,,5,On a Spring Morning…,"… walking through the forest with the dog. The first blossoms are already daring to come out. The first buds can be seen on the trees. It is moist, spicy, and at the same time fresh. My leather jacket is damp and exudes its aroma. My dog is frolicking on the leash and picks up a stick, or rather a branch. We are just having fun.

When applying this fragrance, the first thing that hits the nose is a scent of dark, not sweet licorice (even though this is not listed in the fragrance pyramid) that reminds one of a well-known perfume from Dior. After about 15 minutes, this is replaced by a citrusy fresh dry dark twist. To give this perfume a truly masculine vibe, resinous and woody accents are mixed in. I assume that the woody note comes from the vetiver. To really become manly with hair on the chest, the leather makes its presence known, which has a slightly moist quality and adds even more depth and darkness to the scent. However, what the fragrance always is in my nose is that it is clean and mature.

The longevity and sillage are very good.

Here, the house of Montblanc has launched a men’s fragrance that turns a gentleman into a lumberjack. Since this scent is strongly masculine, I don’t see it for the ladies. Additionally, it is quite mature, making it suitable for those aged 25 and up. I would say this is an all-rounder that is suitable for the whole year, whether cold or hot. During the day, it feels just as comfortable in a suit as it does in jeans or while exercising. In the evening, it is a charismatic guy who loves to charm the ladies, whether at dinner, in a bar, at a club, or at a ball or party.

Anyone who enjoys a licorice, citrusy fresh, dry dark resinous woody masculine leather scent should definitely check this one out. It is certainly worth it."
Explorer Extreme,08/08/2025,Lonescoop,M,2,,5,The Modern Lumberjack,"The blend of fresh bergamot in the top note and the woody-leathery finish is brilliant. Masculine, confident, not overpowering, slightly oriental but not too sweet or synthetic. In my opinion, it’s a great mix of modern and classic and a good daily driver. Anyone who likes the mentioned fragrance notes can’t go wrong here, in my opinion. Thus, it is also suitable as a blind buy or gift."
Emblem,07/01/2020,Shiron212,M,20,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Not what I expected,"Off the top, it's a fairly unique fragrance, it's light, airy and a little floral.
Then after about 2 minutes, the cinnamon makes an appearance and starts being dominant.
After it settles, it smells really similar to Invictus Aqua to my nose, but the cinnamon gives it a little backbone and makes it a bit more mature.

Not a heavy projector, but on my skin it has great longevity at least, about 8-10 hours.
Can be worn year-round, best in Spring and Summer.
Very good choice for work or school, because it's discreet and stays.

Bottom line: I'd only recommend this if you don't have Invictus Aqua yet, but you like how it smells and if you don't mind moderate performance.

This is why you shouldn't buy just for the bottle :)"
Emblem,05/25/2025,Costantinos,M,10,,3,My first Fragrance,"This was my first fragrance I bought and I used it many years. Personally I believe the scent is unique and it smells good. I like the combination fresh/spicy it gives it a personality and my girlfriend knew when I was around because its not a fragrance many people are wearing. Are there better fragrances out there ? of course but if you consider price/performance I think its a very good choice and the fact that I used this fragrance 5 years or more says a lot. Of course every skin and taste is different so don't blind buy it.

If you have any questions let me know and I will try to help you ^^"
Emblem,06/14/2015,Seerose,F,775,,0,"Sorry, I'm a woman","Occasionally I'm given men's scents for testing. The most tradional modern scent I do not like. Neither do I like them for my own use, nor do I like them on men. But there are a lot of masculin scents I love and use for myself. Like ""Kyoto by CdG"" for instance.
So, if I'm testing a scent which I consider as a men's scent only I ask myself:
1. Do I like it at all?
2. Do I like it on men?
3. Would I want to use it myself
4. Would I be intrigued by a man who is smelling with this fragrance?
5. Would I buy it for a man?
In case of ""Emblem"" I would answere on all questions with a clear: No!
There is nothing much to describe. ""Emblem"" is a ""normal"" scent for men which can be smelled on every corner every shop, supermarket, office etc. every day, everywhere.
Cinnamon leaf? I do not know how it could smell, I guess somehow green. Yes, ""Emblem"" is smelling green too. I cannot perceive tonkabean and I do not pity that.
More explanations are not neccessairy, the pyramide is not lying and maybe on a man I would perceive even tonkabean.
Because the sillage is almost evarage and is withdrawing after about 4 hours I did not suffer since I sprayed it on my skin.
But then, very close to my skin there is appearing a sweaty, sour and cutaneous note I cannot identify which ingredient is causing it. It is not oud, not oakmoss. It is not too heavy. But I know poeple who are smelling like this. I do not like that kind of human smell. And I want to stress: This cutneous note is not caused by unhygienical body-care, it is belonging to some human beings. Also I have to admit: I do not like any fragrances with the slightest hint of cutaneous notes.
Well, if a man would use""Emblem"" as perfume I would always stay away in a certain distance of him.
But maybe, if a man is using ""Emblem"" he would not percolate that cutaneous note I am perceiving now."
Emblem,09/23/2018,KLewis,M,26,,1,Quickly forgettable.,"I received a sample of this a few months ago, I remember liking the scent but I also remember thinking that there was nothing special about it.

Emblem,01/28/2019,Taurus,M,1164,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Problem,"One thing you have to give to the brand Montblanc: they stay true to their line, at least regarding the aesthetics of their writing instruments as well as their watches. And even some perfume bottles can keep up with the sophisticated design. Emblem definitely belongs in that category.

It's just a shame that, as is often the case in the world of fragrances, the elegance of the bottles does not always match the content. Unfortunately, Emblem falls into this category as well.

Even if one were to consider that Montblanc aims to establish itself more in the segment of understated office fragrances with their men's line and less in the club scene, Emblem unfortunately does not rise above mediocrity.

For higher ambitions, this Eau de Toilette is simply too plain and offers nothing really exciting besides a sweet-synthetic blend of cardamom and tonka bean. With exactly these two ingredients, it reminds me of the colossal Dolce & Gabbana pour Homme in its original version, but despite the violet leaf and clary sage, it drifts too much towards a shower gel aroma - and I find that problematic.

I think anyone who is financially well-off enough to sign their checks with Montblanc pens and check the time on Montblanc watches will surely want and find more qualitatively demanding fragrances for their status. And they don't even have to be more expensive!"

Emblem,09/17/2017,loewenherz,M,916,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Attack of the Terror Tonka,"There is hardly a brand that better illustrates what happens when a well-established and still successful brand name is sold to different licensees across various business fields. And these licensees then position themselves in completely different target segments - high-quality writing instruments for a tradition- and status-conscious clientele on one side and more or less trashy student fragrances on the other - while I am sure that the lovers of 400 Euro and up fountain pens find the scents just as unattractive as the fans of fragrances are drawn to 400 Euro and up fountain pens. The fact that this very fragrance - Emblem - presumes to transport the essence of the Montblanc brand makes the situation no less absurd. Contrary to the reduced (not necessarily retracted) design language of the writing instrument, Emblem is a fragrance of little subtlety, let alone traditional character. On the contrary, it is not shy about driving the full load of olfactory zeitgeist cheerfulness through the ring like an exhausted circus horse with a feather headdress on its head.

Essentially, it is based on two accords: a fruity-spicy intro and a sweetness with the persistence of a Duracell battery. Neither of these accords is particularly original, and neither appeals to me, and the cheap synthetic note in all its fragrance phases is a testament to a lack of craftsmanship and passion that would hardly be accepted in Montblanc fountain pens.

And then there's Tonka.

The Tonka are a warlike mountain people (not to be confused with the Incas) who torture their prisoners with sheets soaked in sugar water and - no, of course not - just kidding. Tonka comes from the Cumaru or Brazilian teak tree, whose wood is highly sought after as a material. The tonka bean is actually not a bean at all, but merely the bean-shaped seed of its stone fruit, similar to almonds or apricot kernels. There are a few fragrances that manage to coax the variety of aromas from the tonka bean and position it away from vanilla, which it has already been used as a substitute for - most settle for a pleasing, interchangeable, often poorly dosed, tooth-pulling carnival sweetness. Montblanc's Emblem is a prime example of this all-encompassing sweetness - it may only be comforting that the top note it overshadows is not beautiful enough to really miss.

Conclusion: a largely inconsequential and loud spice-tonka fragrance. Only the bottle is quite pretty."
Emblem,04/17/2014,Leimbacher,M,2870,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Predicate / Emblem / Seal: particularly worthless!,"I really like both Pieper and Müller - not because of the prices, selection, or niche fragrances, but for one reason: they always have the latest releases in no time. My eyes sparkled when I saw the black, stylish, straightforward, and ultra-heavy bottle of Montblanc's latest: Emblem. Okay, my anticipation was somewhat tempered due to the recent outputs from the writer's company (Legend :/), but still, I spritzed piously and freely on a bare spot on my arm. It was clear within seconds that it wasn’t a stinker and that it was a nice cardamom perfume. Only one thing was even quicker: the disillusionment of having to test another lab-created baby that one has unfortunately already smelled dozens of times. Best exemplified by YSL's masterpiece La Nuit de L'Homme.

I like to be the first to comment, so no one can accuse me of copying from somewhere. And with such a new release, you won’t find any reviews online anyway, so I’m happy to provide the premiere here. Sorry that I can’t generate any advertising or hype - because the unspectacular cream perfume Emblem is simply not suitable for that. An Intense version announced at the same time isn’t needed either.

As for the scent description: super soft, unspectacular, creamy, office-appropriate. It doesn’t harm a fly; it’s as meek as a lamb. MontBlanc will probably never create something as wonderful as Individuel again. It’s really sad what the brand has been delivering in recent years. Emblem is not a gate with seven seals, but deciphered and read faster than the headline of the Bild newspaper. Creamy cardamom, a skin tone, also similar to Chopard's 1000 Miglia. A bit of violet and a lot of tonka - well, one might also like Fahrenheit and Armani Code. However, Fahrenheit is the furthest removed. Anyone who likes or owns one of the mentioned fragrances can test this one, but will then move on unimpressed. Not a very good new release and as cowardly as a horde of cowards.

Bottle: heavy, bulky, and heavy again. One of the brand's strengths.
Sillage: pleasant and office-appropriate. Creamy and soft.
Longevity: a shortened day in the office - 6-7 hours.

Why 100% for La Nuit and only half for the 26th imitator? I hope that was a rhetorical question..."

------------------
How does one come up with the idea of buying a fragrance from a company known for its beautiful writing instruments?

Exactly for this reason, one becomes aware of the fragrances!
Almost everyone knows the name and automatically associates it with the proud Hamburg luxury brand.
I also discovered the beautiful and high-quality bottle of Montblanc's Emblem rather by chance at Müller. Admittedly, it is precisely the unusual and elegant design that makes you want to test the perfume and you expect a particularly unique scent with the same enthusiasm. To put it bluntly: The scent is not unique. It is not an Antaeus (Chanel), not a Pasha (Cartier), and not a Safari (Ralph Lauren).
However, one must give the fragrance its due: It lives up to the bottle and the name!
‘Why?’
Everyone somehow knows the scent and compares it with other manufacturers and fragrances, but still, it feels very elegant and lasts exceptionally long on the skin (10 hours +).

You can also somehow compare it to the associated writing instruments.
A ballpoint pen is just a ballpoint pen. There are hundreds of manufacturers, and each makes it differently. Montblanc has managed to make the same product feel more premium and market it properly.

The same goes for the fragrance.

There is nothing to add to Leimbacher's fragrance description, which is why I quote it accordingly (I hope that is acceptable). It is “super soft, creamy, office-appropriate, and doesn’t harm a fly.”

Of course, one also recognizes similarities to other fragrances, such as Fahrenheit or Armani Code. However, the biggest difference from the two scents is that Emblem works with my personal body chemistry and doesn’t start to smell bad after half an hour.

The sillage is also very pleasant. Not too strong, not too weak, and lasts throughout the day.
In short: The fragrance is better than one initially thinks."
Emblem,05/14/2017,Mantus,M,487,,4,Why am I just so strong and you too weak?,"I was able to test Mont Blanc's Emblem thanks to our dear Parfumo ""Zirkeltanz"" and I want to express my sincere thanks for that.

The top note starts off fresh, reminiscent of shower gel, nothing wrong with that in my opinion.
It doesn't come across as cheap, but also not expensive; it is in the middle range.

I can clearly recognize grapefruit, as well as cardamom, which I believe is a tad too much, as it makes the grapefruit seem a little ""old,"" but at the same time takes away its bitterness.
The clary sage appears about 3 minutes later and rounds off the top note.

The violet leaf is herbaceous - green, and in combination with the cinnamon leaf, it gains even more depth and a slight floral quality.

""Nanu, where did it go?"" I asked myself?

I could smell nothing more, so I opened my Glenfiddich cardboard box, where my coffee beans are stored, took a hearty breath three times, and closed it again.

""Aha, there you are,"" I noted.

This constellation lasts about 3 hours on my skin until the base note with tonka bean, which has a nutty - marzipan hint and is blended with several wood notes that I can't quite pinpoint, unfolds.

The base note also reminds me of another fragrance, but I just can't figure it out.

Overall, the scent lasts just under 5 hours on my skin, which I unfortunately find too little.

The scent isn't that bad at all, as there are certainly some candidates that would make you want to run away.

In summer, you can apply it generously; an overdose is hardly possible, as the scent is unfortunately really very weak on the skin.
The sillage is moderate in the first 30 minutes, but unfortunately too weak from the start.

After 1.5 hours, the scent is already a skin scent.

If the scent lasted longer and had a better sillage, it would be a candidate for purchase for me for the summer."

The inscription on the bottom of the box of the MONTBLANC Emblem Eau de Toilette for men
Packaging: The Eau de Toilette comes in a stylish, minimalist box made of thick cardboard in glossy black. The only inscriptions are the name and information about the fragrance and the manufacturer.

The bottle: Similarly understated, black, hexagonal bottle with the manufacturer's logo (the same white hexagon in the center of the cap), heavy. It distributes very easily. Due to its simplicity, the appearance of the perfume already shows its display potential (businessmen like stylish and not flashy bottles on their shelves).

About the fragrance: MONTBLANC EMBLEM itself belongs to the category of oriental fragrances or perhaps rather to woody scents.

The top notes are cardamom, cinnamon, patchouli, and pepper.

The heart note consists of woody notes and violet leaves.

Base notes are grapefruit and sage

What the manufacturer claims on the official website of the shop:

MONTBLANC Emblem is a classic, a constant play of ice and flame. The icy notes of sage leaves, violet, and cardamom meet the fiery-spicy notes of black and pink pepper and lush cinnamon. The fragrance has a beautiful hint of light wood scent and patchouli. The image of a man who chooses MONTBLANC Emblem is that of a strong and confident leader who knows what he wants in life and has already overcome many peaks on his way to reach ever new and greater heights.

As a renowned Swiss brand with a history of over a hundred years, MONTBLANC knows the fundamental requirements and desires of its target audience, confident and strong men, very well. That is why MONTBLANC Emblem harmoniously combines all the components that make an ideal fragrance for the modern man. The exclusive blend of contrasting facets of this scent is what best describes Emblem by MONTBLANC.
I would like to add for myself that this Eau de Toilette is truly meant for real, confident men who know what they want and achieve their goals. It may seem difficult to you, but it is a matter of personal preference. This is not a fragrance for boys and frivolous guys. The owner of this perfume will never lack taste and will always look flawless! And the trail of the fragrance.... Makes others give compliments (and not just the fairer sex). Men who perceive the scent of MONTBLANC Emblem often wonder about the name and appreciate this extraordinary fragrance. I love this scent very much too!

The advantages of MONTBLANC Emblem Eau de Toilette
The incredible longevity inherent in the entire range of the manufacturer.
Minimal consumption (just one spray and the scent lasts more than 2 days (even after showering, a light trace remains))
Wonderful woody and spicy scent that only real men can aspire to
Elegant and clear packaging
I definitely recommend this product and I think you can make your favorite man happy with such a bottle as a gift!

I hope my review was useful to you! Thank you for your attention!

Emblem,07/31/2025,ComputerMaus,M,264,,2,(K)not a Star in the Sky,"First of all: the bottle. What’s that? It looks like a cheap children's toy (and feels like one too).

The scent itself starts off herbaceous-spicy, yet not green, leaving at least an interesting impression. Could this possibly come from the cinnamon and violet leaf? In any case, cardamom and clary sage are involved. A sweetness (tonka) quickly develops, but it does not cross the line of good taste. Emblem now has a grassy note, but still does not smell classically green. For a while, I can still find something in the scent. But then it fades, more and more. It becomes reminiscent of Invictus EAU DE TOILETTE - slightly synthetic, palatable, uncomplicated - and simply boring.
It doesn’t excite me, has nothing special, nothing extraordinary. Everything is okay, everything is well done, but what is the selling point? Why not just go for the original? Or Eros EAU DE TOILETTE? Or 1 Million EAU DE TOILETTE? Or Ultra Mâle? Or, or, or?

And then there's the performance. 1 hour of solid sillage? 5½ hours until you can't smell it at all? Come on.

A star is born? No way, it’s not."
Legend Blue,10/18/2024,Smirky,M,483,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Nice addition to the Legend collection,"Out of the Legend collection, I started with Legend EdP which I like very much. Next was Legend Spirit, which didn't do much for me. Didn't know what to expect with Legend Blue but was pleasantly surprised. It's a really nice addition to the Legend Collection. Smooth and clean masculine fragrance.The mint freshens it up but it's subtle, not overpowering. If you don't care for strong mints, or worry about it smelling like toothpaste, you have nothing to fear with Legend Blue. Woody notes are well blended and smooth, not sharp. Also strikes me as very versatile - you can pretty much wear this anytime of the year, day or night. An easy reach fragrance.

To give you an idea on what it smells like, I did a little experiment by comparing it to Legend EDP and Dylan Blue. Legend EDP has stronger woody notes which are subdued and smoother in Legend Blue. In direct comparison, Dylan Blue is sweeter and more floral while Legend Blue is not as sweet and more fruity than floral.

Projection was moderate for me but longevity was quite good - got about 7 hours out of it. Overall, very nice. I'm picking this one up. Prices are reasonable at discounters."
Legend Blue,08/30/2025,Dennisriecht,M,3,,1,Everyone Will Probably Like It,"In fact, I approached this fragrance with low expectations.
Montblanc is not my favorite brand.
Aside from ""Legend Night | Montblanc,"" I don't really like any scent from the brand.
However, Legend Blue pleasantly surprised me.
Take the regular Legend EAU DE TOILETTE as a base and add a good dose of freshness and ""blue.""
It sounds unremarkable, but it makes a noticeable difference.
Nothing here feels cheap.
Somehow, there is just the right balance that I would say: It appeals to every man and every woman.
Maybe it's not the biggest hit, but you will still smell pleasant.
Longevity and projection are also decent, so you can easily get through a workday.
Definitely worth recommending, even as a gift."
Legend Blue,05/08/2025,Rainmaker,M,111,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,For what it is - one of the best!,"Montblanc has made its Explorer its Aventus clone and with the Legend line has also made some other popular brands affordable for many.

The Legend Blue now goes fully in the fresh direction and has - at least to my knowledge - no direct 1:1 inspiration.

The Legend Blue is one for the really hot days, for me the definition of a Freshy. A perfume couldn't smell more like typical shower gel.

Completely without typical citrus notes, the cool and synthetic bubble blows directly into your face. It becomes minimally sweet, minimally spicy, but maintains its light core throughout. Absolutely not complex or with a special progression, straightforwardly fresh without fruit.

Since there is no significant base in terms of woods, it doesn't last very long - but that's hardly achievable with this DNA.

You can't overspray this one and you can't go wrong with it at all.

In this price segment and for what it is supposed to deliver: incredibly good."
Legend Blue,12/27/2024,Rob442,M,10,,5,The adult brother of Legend Spirit,"After Legend Spirit was my relaxed all-rounder, I wanted to test the new brother.

Bottle is known, unobtrusive, practical with a usable spray.

Freshly applied, it smells like just showered. For me, it's a bit less biting than Legend Spirit and therefore a bit lighter and more casual.

It is the first and so far the only fragrance that I like to apply directly after showering with a spritz. Whether for the sofa, housework, or just a quick outing, warm or cold, sporty or sophisticated - this scent fits strikingly unobtrusively every time.

It’s not a head-turner, but it won't disturb anyone either.

The longevity for me right after showering is about 6 hours, leaving a pleasant trace on skin and clothing for a good day. Especially on the scarf, I really like it for its warm note.

Anyone who wants to smell rounded and fresh is doing everything right here at any age.

In my eyes, once again a successful everyday classic from the house of Mont Blanc."
Legend Intense,06/04/2018,DPArtist,M,18,,5,A real Legend in the making.,"The Montblanc 'Legend' fragrance line is surely one of the most consistently solid lines in the designer scent market. So far my preference has been for Legend spirit (LS) over the Legend original (LO), mainly because I'm a lover of fresh scents, particularly at this time of the year. That said after scoring samples in a store for both LS and LO it wasn't such an easy choice at first but the fantastic white freshie won in the end and I bought a bottle.

So to Legend intense (LI). I tried this in a store in (my old home town) London as it was impossible to find here in France where I live, I just didn't want to blind buy. A couple of sprays on my forearm and it was love or rather 'lust' at first sniff. It just smells so lushly aromatic and classy. Fruity, woody and sweet but not cloying. The notes of red apple, pineapple, bergamot, cardamom and tonka join forces to create something incredibly alluring. In the background are some floral notes (jasmine), ambergris and oak moss on the sturdy woodsy and resinous base. I don't know what pepperwood/hercules' club smells like but perhaps it's this note that gives Legend Intense another little something special too.

A warm spring day, walking along (the typically hectic) Oxford street catching wafts of this captivating scent (I must've looked odd in the rush hour human traffic sniffing my arm every now and then, but in this eccentric city anything goes!). The evening signaled a heavy metal concert and the excellent 'Machine Head' in a packed-out, hot and sweat-inducing venue. After the show, on the train home dripping with sweat and a change of t shirt I was amazed that I could still smell the Legend Intense on my arm. Like a previous reviewer said, it (still) smelled almost good enough to eat.

Upon receiving my bottle I tested the fragrance. Sprayed at 7pm I could still smell it on my arm at 10am the morning after, it would've lasted longer if I hadn't taken a shower, so longevity is very good. Sillage and projection are more moderate but still decent. My sprayer is stiffer than on the LS bottle so it's either a big spray or nothing (maybe I got a dud), great looking bottle though, as usual with the Legend range.

With LI I have discovered (another) new favourite. I'm really impressed. To my nose this is a magnificent fragrance, class in a bottle. It beats the original as an all round, all seasons scent and is longer lasting too as you would hope for given it's name. It seems more complex and interesting than the original too, there's more going on but it never seems too much. LI is one of those fragrances that could be worn in any situation (except perhaps extreme heat) and will garner nods of approval and turn heads rather than offend. Just bear in mind you'll be continually sniffing yourself! Here's hoping the ladies like this scent as much as I do and if they don't, well they're just going to have to miss out then!

I just hope it doesn't get discontinued (if it isn't already) as it wasn't so easy to find for me. With Legend Spirit I found a gem, with Legend Intense I unearthed a real treasure. My advice-get it now."
Legend Intense,10/31/2017,MrHonest,M,118,,2,"Sweeeeet and creamy tonka, red apple and cedar.","I made the mistake one day of wearing this while lifting weights. Strangely enough, as off-putting as the sweetness was, I could never really shake the association. Now, every time I lift, I like to wear a spray of this stuff on my left forearm and have a sniff anytime I need to get angry. Hahaha. And you wouldn't like me when I'm angry...But does this really smell like a ripped guy with his shirt off? Meh. It's too sweet and powdery, really. Fierce references aside, I think it's a very good scent that takes the original Legend and adds some density and character.

The opening blast is fruity - pineapple, apple, a tinge of spiciness and a whole lot of creamy tonka. The similarity to Fierce is obvious, but this just feels more rounded around the edges. There's absolutely no citrus that I can detect, since the overwhelming impression is sugary and casual - almost like a candy apple, without the caramel. The scent remains linear, but becomes very powdery 2 hours in, almost to the point of inducing nausea in extremely hot weather. So save this stuff for the autumn, winter and spring. Longevity is ok, but the projection is weak. Decent for cuddling, but not so much for the outdoors, unless you spray your clothes.

If you're a fan of the original, you'll probably like this even more. According to the reviews online, that's pretty much universal. Personally, I really like it for its general appeal with the youngsters. In fact, 4 out of the 5 (younger) women I asked about it, prefer the smell over La Nuit. I almost crumpled in shock, but there you go. I just wish the projection was better dang it. Plus, the atomizer on my bottle is a squirter. Not sure if that's common...but it gets the job done. Overall, I would still say it's above average, especially as an all-arounder, or whenever you need to grab a little sweeeeeeet...."
Legend Intense,03/02/2018,ScentedGent,M,3,,0,I love this scent!,"Legend Intense is an extremely versatile fragrance that can be worn any time of year, for just about any occasion, day or night. It smells incredible and garners more compliments than other fragrances costing 10 times as much. A real winner!"
Legend Intense,05/04/2024,StarA1,M,136,,1,Metallic Star,"A fragrance that is classified as having a sweet, fruity scent, You will notice a slightly synthetic scent, Consider it the sugarier and sweeter version of its brother, Legend Montblanc.

The scent of the fragrance may last for four to five hours, and it will spread around you quickly, and you will receive compliments for it, but its drawback is the presence of a slight metallic scent that is somewhat repulsive.

The fragrance bottle comes in a slightly dark silver (metallic) color, similar to the famous Montblanc Legend edition bottles.

An autumn fragrance suitable for young men and men under the age of forty.

Conclusion: Not the best Montblanc fragrances."
Legend Intense,08/02/2020,Bernard,M,15,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,20,"New York Spring 2014, Macys, half an hour shopping without my wife...","...I had already snagged a fragrance that I actually didn't find that great.

Was it the charming, professionally trained salesperson, my reluctance to buy the fourth American designer jeans, or finally getting THAT New York souvenir that could withstand the test of time and remind me for years to come of the trip of my life in the city that never sleeps? Maybe it was just my latent jet lag fatigue, the sensory overload of Manhattan, and the sticky smell of the New York subway that I wanted to escape. Whatever it was...

""You could treat yourself to a new fragrance!"" I thought to myself when my wife suggested we split up to enhance our shopping efficiency given the incredible size of the Macy's shopping temple. Any savvy horror movie fan knows what ""We'll split up here, you go that way, I'll keep looking here..."" means for the plot's progression! Nothing good.

So I wandered rather bored through the perfume and cosmetics department, being constantly approached at every stand, just like in St. Pauli or the bazaar in Marrakech. Some people like this. I don't. After my first few nerves were spent, I was really just looking for a quiet corner. In a nook near the escalators, I started chatting with an Austrian woman who was overloaded with about 47 shopping bags, and we talked about the sense and nonsense of shopping marathons. At that time, it was still ideologically free and quite amusing. But onward I went; I couldn't appear at the agreed meeting point with my wife empty-handed. I needed a NY souvenir, perfume is always a good choice. We all know that.

After the 2000s, I had finally moved past the Hugo and Boss bottled phase, and some other offshoots of this house that I had picked up in duty-free shops had long since failed to convince me. The fourth or fifth bottle of Versace pH was not going to be it for me anymore, no matter how much I had liked it as a long-time companion through my nights. Similarly, my long-standing preference for D&G had descended into the realm of insignificance, and the original version of Armani Pour Homme that I loved so dearly had vanished when I was busy with more important things in the 90s. And had I ever guessed that Jil Sander Man would stop overshadowing the fragrance heavens, I would have bought a 1000-liter IBC container full to the brim with it! I swear.

So there I stood, somewhat lost in front of a display case with elegant, beautiful, and hopelessly outdated-looking fountain pens from the house with the big white star. These ink pens, resembling unique pieces, had an unexpectedly calming effect on me amidst the noise of this hyperactive metropolis. And 'whoosh,' I was in conversation with the hyper-friendly salesperson (In America, yes, they are like that.), who praised my modest English skills and directed the conversation towards this new fragrance flanker from Montblanc. Another 10 minutes later, I had a heavy, masculine matte metallic bottle and a scent that seemed suspiciously familiar to me. This fresh sweetness didn't feel that new; I had smelled it before. But where? A little later, as the fragrance became softer, cozier, and less synthetically clean, I found it more appealing. Yet it reminded me not at all of my preferences from past years. Why did I buy this?? It was actually too blunt and pushy. No elegance to it at all. So consciously styled. It pretends to be classy but isn't heartfelt. A fraud even?

In the evening at the hotel bar on the 37th or 39th floor with a view of the UN building, I initially cursed the hastily spent dollars from our travel budget and vowed never, ever again to buy any perfume thoughtlessly or hastily. (Yes, I admit, my plan worked out great later on.) ""Oh, screw it,"" I thought after the 7th or 8th Bud Light, ""you've got the scent that will remind you of New York, you’ll never buy such soulless synthetic crap again.""

The next day, we strolled along Fifth Avenue and passed by this black-clad store, in front of which dozens of teenagers were being pushed by 20-year-old six-pack beauties on the verge of a nervous breakdown (again!). My wife and I, of course, went in because we wanted to be able to join in the next party small talk. 2014 must have been the peak of this completely incomprehensible Abercrombie & Fitch hype for me. Every city back home, from Eckernförde to Füssen, from Görlitz to Castrop-Rauxel, absolutely had to have one of those dark, cramped places with grossly overpriced clothes from the sweatshops of Bangladesh. ""Inside, the salespeople run around completely naked and you get doused with perfume to boost your buying urge,"" I had heard. Well, only the latter rumor turned out to be true. But...

...that was it. I had just bought that fragrance yesterday. ""Hey guys, do you also sell fountain pens here?"" I called out excitedly. No, they didn't. It must have been that Pierce thing that hit my nostrils. But I had my New York souvenir fragrance. I didn't care if it was Pierce, Fierce, or Legend; it smelled just like a spring afternoon on Fifth Avenue. Of course not, Fifth Avenue stinks of car exhaust. But everything my wife and I experienced together in those unforgettable moments in this crazy, equally fascinating and repulsive city during the first warm rays of sunshine in April 2014 immediately comes to mind when I wear Montblanc Legend Intense. Even though I don't find it that great, I enjoy smelling it. I'm about to get sentimental. And Montblanc Legend Intense really doesn't deserve that, the old fraud!"
Legend Intense,09/25/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,,5,Fierce after a Microwave Bath,"Actually, MontBlanc doesn't need to copy so coldly. With good to very good perfumes like Individuel or the underrated Presence, they have already proven that they can do it. So much so that even Creed copied with Original Santal and couldn't match Individuel. But it must be said clearly: the Legend series is a Fierce knockoff without any sense of shame. They are certainly..."
Legend Intense,05/01/2018,Bohannon,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Metallic Fresh,"Legend Intense has been in my collection for a while now. I often smelled the bottle, but never sprayed or wore it. Today was finally the day. Invited to a barbecue, beautiful sun, not quite warm but a pleasant temperature. So I thought today would finally be the big day. I love those days when I spray a fragrance ""blind"" (it wasn't completely blind, I had sniffed the bottle several times before). And what can I say, wow, what a great experience, fresh, it matched the weather perfectly, what struck me the most was the metallic note. I haven't read much about this, maybe I'm crazy, but I smell metal. But in a positive sense, I might be expressing myself poorly :) And this metallic fresh note lasts forever. I've read often that longevity and sillage leave something to be desired. However, I can't relate to that. I sprayed around noon, not too much, 6 sprays, and I can almost permanently perceive it on myself. I also received positive comments today. As I said, for me, longevity, both on the skin and on clothing, and sillage are truly fantastic. I perceive the scent as masculine, fresh, sporty, casual, and carefree. Good mood, simply wonderful.
In comparison with Fierce, yes, it goes in the same direction, but I find this one a bit better, I justify this with the fresh metallic note that I perceive much stronger here.
Price-wise, it's quite reasonable. Available online for a fair price. I paid around 30.-€/50ml.
Regarding the bottle, I think it fits the scent perfectly. Dark metal, feels cold and cool in the hand, just like the fragrance.
I am definitely convinced and thrilled. Thanks for reading."
Legend Intense,10/02/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,5,Yawningly boring arrangement of a basket full of syrupy autumn fruits,"My general displeasure with Montblanc's many failed attempts to push serious quality products into the perfume market is well known.

Not a single scent that I would consider from them. And no, not even ""Individuel,"" which is constantly praised here, but for me represents nothing more than an annoying, unimaginative, unnatural raspberry surrogate.

Okay, I admit, I once had ""Starwalker,"" but I never finished it because the smooth cyber-clean synthetic scent quickly annoyed me.

After the lame, artificial, piercingly fresh ""Legend,"" now comes the ""Intense.""
And once again, what a letdown!

Similar ingredient list to the base scent, where a rather fresh, artificially summery fruit basket is at the center, but here it’s one that has bundled up for winter.

Pineapple and apple are quite prominent, almost syrupy, with a hint of cardamom spice running through it.

However, it is anything but appetizing or cozily arranged; it comes off too mushy and stirred together.

Tonka bean subtly envelops the autumn fruits in a lightly caramelized shell, while cedar discreetly adds a touch of wood.

It is incredibly boring to smell, uninspired, trivial fruity-syrupy, lacking contours or any ""Aha"" moment. Weak.... What do the 78% up there even mean?"
Legend Intense,08/10/2013,Moriarty,M,150,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,A Wannabe Discovers the Fierce Land,"What were the people at Montblanc and perfumer Olivier Pescheux thinking with the Legend series? Probably something like this: Creed has completely outdone us with ""Original Santal"" and simply copied ""Individuel,"" so now we’ll turn the tables in our favor. In any case, it quickly becomes clear which DNA was to be explored with ""Legend"": Abercrombie is this time the target of..."
Legend Intense,06/16/2015,Hommey,M,6,,1,Instructions for Use,"About the scent. It really smells fresh and masculine. The fragrance is definitely successful

But here are the instructions for use so that you actually notice the scent:

Please apply 10 sprays to the neck, 5 sprays behind each earlobe, and a few sprays on each arm from top to bottom.

Done :)"
Legend Intense,12/14/2013,McQuade,M,13,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The Other Fierce,"The similarities to Fierce are unmistakable in terms of scent.
The progression is nearly identical, except for the first hour, and I wouldn't trust myself to distinguish between these two fragrances after the top note fades away.

Intrigued by the comments suggesting that this scent resembles Fierce, I wished for it blindly for my birthday. After wearing Fierce the day before, I immediately put on Legend Intense the next day.
For about an hour, I couldn't detect any similarity to the long-lasting favorite from A&F, as Legend first hit me with a ripe and juicy pineapple, or rather, wafted it around my nose.
With a tearful eye (since it reminded me nothing of Fierce) and a joyful eye (I really like the scent of pineapple), I was curious about the further development of the fragrance.
And lo and behold ......................, after about an hour, the tropical fruit bid me farewell, leaving behind a Fierce clone.
For me and my amateur nose, I couldn't detect any difference.

Legend Intense has an absolute right to exist for me. On one hand, I like Fierce, and on the other hand, the ""original"" is not available everywhere and sometimes comes at inflated prices.

The only downside, in my opinion, is the longevity, as it lasts about 5-6 hours on me, clearly falling short of Fierce, while the sillage definitely has the potential to announce someone upon entering.

For anyone who likes Fierce and this direction, I give a clear recommendation to test it. Don't let the top note confuse you."
Legend Intense,04/24/2015,Aleks,M,29,,3,Pale Story...,"or rather the development into a skin scent that can't really convince.
That's how I feel about this specimen from Montblanc.

The scent clearly reminds me of Fierce by Abercrombie & Fitch and can be compared to the regular Montblanc Legend.
However, it doesn't come across as fresh, but rather a bit muted.

After the first spray, one thinks this candidate has real power and is certainly comparable to Fierce in terms of longevity and sillage, if not even better.

I should actually revise my previous comment on Fierce, as Legend Intense is certainly not the better Fierce, but just a weak representative of it.

Initially, it made a better impression on me, as it smelled a bit finer and didn't come across as so clumsy and cheap.
But after a very short time, it simply turns into a skin scent without much impact.
It's a shame that I bought this fragrance too hastily; I should have tested it more thoroughly.

Well, with a purchase price of about 35 euros for 100ml, the scent is okay and wearable for everyday use.

Unfortunately, the sillage is too weak for an Intense version; the scent becomes too close to the skin too quickly, and while the longevity is good, it doesn't really convince me.
Conclusion:

The scent is suitable for everyday wear, wearable in the office as well as in leisure time.
Purchase is only recommended online, as it is simply too expensive in the store around the corner, and for that price, you can get something better.
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend buying it, as the scent can't really convince.
No one really needs it, unless you're looking for a toned-down version of Fierce, which is also cheaper and has slightly better longevity than the regular Legend."
Legend Intense,06/16/2018,Fresh21,M,95,,3,Fragrance Journey with a Pitstop!,"This flanker may not become a legend for me, but it is certainly more varied than the Legend.

Legend Intense starts with a crisp, fresh fruitiness that is not too sweet and brings a strong sillage in the first half hour. Really delicious, this citrusy pineapple! However, the tropical getaway doesn’t last too long, as after about three-quarters of an hour, the MLI invites us into a garage, where the mechanic's haze feels a bit too strong in contrast to the pineapple above, which is now increasingly diluted. Although it remains perceptible, it soon becomes one-dimensional and thin in the background. This mix of fruit and lead is handled better by the Legend, as it feels more harmonious and subtly balanced, albeit also more monotonous. After all, it primarily relies on the warmth of the tonka bean. While that does come through in the Intense as well, it only happens hours later, after the garage door opens again and we step out into a pleasantly woody environment, which then establishes itself as a mild base of the fragrance.

Overall, Legend Intense feels both masculine and sweet at the same time, and I can attest to its good sillage and longevity. However, I prefer linear fragrances, so it’s not for me. If you prefer variety [first fruit, then lead, then wood], this Montblanc is certainly the most versatile Legend - alongside the pitstop in the heart note."
Legend Intense,10/01/2021,MRNG91,M,2,,1,Intense,"The pineapple definitely makes this fresh and masculine scent more exciting than the conventional Legend.
Which isn't really hard, as the conventional one reminds me more of a Dior Sauvage imitation.
A little tip: To really get something out of it, you should spray on more than just twice. The scent loses its power very quickly and doesn't last long.
Have fun with it!"
Signature Absolue,07/20/2024,Thewrongbeth,F,99,,2,Tonka,"Citrus and ylang make this tropical, but not beachy. A creamy yellow floral with a huge tonka accord in the drydown. I enjoy this combo; it's laid back & easy going. Definitely ticks toward feminine, but that heavy tonka *I think* makes this possibly unisex.

Here I go again with comparisons, but calls to mind frags like Keiko Mecheri Un Jour d'Ete, Kenzo's World Power, and even Bvlgari Goldea. Has this great salted skin feel, like I've spent all day in the sun. Lasts ages. Did I mention the tonka?!"
Signature Absolue,08/02/2023,FrauMieze,F,277,,11,sunny warm disposition,"Pear and tuberose are definitely not among my favorite ingredients. I actually downright hate pear.
I don't know exactly what happened here, but I LIKE Signature Absolue. I even have to raise my rating. The more I wear it, the more I like it. I also liked Signature EAU DE PARFUM, but that has nothing to do with this flanker.

Absolue is a tuberose cream underlined by tonka, beautifully fruity, soft with a certain twist; the pear does not stand out, those fine fruity sprinkles that I like so much probably come more from ylang-ylang combined with mandarin. The tuberose here is not the typical sweet gum-like scent but rather very subtle. I don't smell any cucumber (as sometimes mentioned here) at all.

With cedar and amber in the base, it gets a stable foundation from which the fragrance is carried through the many exciting phases of its development. The sweetness decreases over time, it becomes softer and warmer, almost embracingly beautiful and cozy. The fruity sprinkles can still be smelled beautifully much later on.
The scent is continuously creamy-soft like a body butter that gently spreads around you as an aura.
Absolue is a sunny-warm floral-fruity fragrance that conveys a cheerful impression overall.
However, at over 20°, it is too much for me, and you shouldn't overspray Signature Absolue, as it can quickly become annoying, even for those around you; the sillage should not be underestimated. It radiates quite a bit but leaves behind a wonderfully sweet fruity scent in the room. Beautiful enough to make you kneel.
No blind buy - definitely test beforehand!
All in all, a really beautiful fragrance - one should not expect it to smell like Signature EAU DE PARFUM, but those who are not set in their ways and like tuberose will enjoy this scent."
Signature Absolue,06/03/2023,Anniiiii,F,5,,2,Creamy and Powdery,"Should I or shouldn't I... I kept asking myself this question while walking back and forth the whole time. The scent constantly changed on my skin, and I was curious to see how it would develop further. After half an hour, only a creamy, powdery fragrance remained from the fruity beginning. And yet, I bought it. Personally, I miss the sweetness afterwards, but with other fragrances, I miss the powdery aspect. So I will combine this scent with another one. Because the longevity of this fragrance is really good."
Signature Absolue,05/20/2023,Landrie,F,32,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,Review without a catchy title,"I was definitely there to try it out 5 times before I bought it. For me, the Signature Original was nothing, as that Solero ice cream note, which is initially so beautiful, also left a sticky sweetness that I didn't like.
Signature Absolue has a non-listed - but detected by many - melon-cucumber note. And that was the argument FOR this fragrance for me. After extensive testing, as I said, I bought it. But now I can also understand the reservations of many Original fans.
A sprayer of Absolue on the arm was fine, however when you apply it seriously - and I am truly not Team-Overspray - my goodness, it is then exhausting.. It indeed has something 90s about it.. Between one spray and 4, there are worlds with this scent. It becomes too much for me and I would feel uncomfortable going to the office with this fragrance - out of concern for disturbing my colleagues.
And at the same time, it is also somehow beautiful... So for those who, like me, hesitated - I would actually advise against it.. If you are into 90s florals, please go for it. There probably won't be many who wear this fragrance...
As for the description: it is indeed fresh, in a melon-floral way. Very dominant florals are present - the flowers are very homogeneously blended. The drydown remains floral. I perceive the sillage as strong. The price-performance ratio is definitely given here. And if you are into this kind of thing, it's a bullseye. I like it too much to sell it - but somehow I also don't like to spray it on.. Therefore, I couldn't think of a good title for this review...."
Femme de Montblanc,07/22/2017,Bcars10,F,90,,2,Too sweet,"I like sweet perfumes, but this was akin to drenching my body in maraschino cherries while standing next to an incense burner. Those are the only notes I got from beginning to end. Very linear and boring and way too sweet! Not at all elegant or classy like I'd expect from a brand like Montblanc. Actually, it's almost terrible. Any celebrity could bottle this and you wouldn't be surprised about that at all. That bottle is sure gorgeous, though!!!"
Femme de Montblanc,03/13/2015,Locita,F,14,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Surrounded by raspberry-musk clouds... I think I'm dreaming...,"Femme de Montblanc is an incredibly feminine, alluring, captivating scent that is melt-in-your-mouth beautiful.
It is fruity-chocolatey sweet. Quite sweet, in fact, when you sniff directly at the scented spot. The sillage, however, is something else entirely and even more captivating than this already delicious fruity sweetness. When I wave my arm, I am enveloped by a wonderfully beautiful raspberry-musk cloud. So incredibly pure and soft, yet so delicately enveloping. For a moment, I close my eyes and float on this fruity cloud. Wrapped in cotton, I let myself drift and be enchanted.
I would say that the musk plays a very important and central role here.
It prevents the scent from drifting into gourmand territory and becoming too sticky.
I don't consciously smell patchouli and vetiver, but I think they are well woven into the fragrance and ground it, so you don't float away on clouds and never come back ; )

Femme de Montblanc is a flattering scent that seductively emphasizes the feminine delicacy of its wearer and captivates the surroundings like an invisible silky thread. You receive many compliments and would even like to shower yourself with compliments because you are so fascinated by the cloud that clouds your mind and envelops you so softly.

I am very, very surprised by the perfume. Convince yourself of this femininely delicate sillage that makes you smell irresistible. It is my current signature scent and a great all-year-round fragrance.
With it, I always feel well-dressed (even without clothing)
Give it a try :)))"
Femme de Montblanc,06/03/2018,pudelbonzo,F,2405,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Great Ink Pot,"Today, my husband held an impressive bottle in front of my nose.

Appropriately for Montblanc, an ink pot - he said with a smile.
Oh - how gallant!

As a school child, I owned a Montblanc fountain pen, a beautiful utensil in green - black with a golden nib.
I wrote every one of my essays with it, feeling like a poet.
The poetry flowed smoothly from the nib.
Letters should only be written this way!
Preferably love letters.

And this slightly nostalgic association is also fulfilled by the fragrance.

It combines style with poetry and awakens tender feelings.

Cardamom and cinnamon start off softly spicy, refreshed by the pineapple.
The rose appears romantic - like the word ""back then,"" which sounds so beautiful in my ears.
The chocolate note is nutty and comforting, like the words of a dear letter that you read with warmth in your heart.

Even though my husband is not a love letter writer - this gift says more than a thousand words."
Femme de Montblanc,12/25/2010,Chrisantiss,F,525,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,There is no snow in the air...,"I ordered this fragrance blindly as a sample and I am not disappointed.

The first moment is floral-fruity, then a lovely sweetness and delicate spicy nuances come into play.
The jasmine is not too opulent and the other notes do not take center stage either. It creates a very harmonious blend that later shifts slightly towards a powdery scent.
The chocolate can only be sensed, but it is gently present in the aura.
A soft and feminine fragrance that does not overwhelm.
Well, the name is indeed somewhat misleading. With Mont Blanc, I expected snow-covered peaks and an icy winter breeze.
None of that, but that shouldn't stop anyone from giving it a try, as it is a very beautiful fragrance."

Black Meisterstück,10/12/2024,Smirky,M,483,,4,This ain't no masterpiece,"Opened with an unusual plastic/metallic type of note which quickly morphed into a subtle amber. In final dry down a woody note appeared, blending with the amber. Very generic. Nothing to write home about.

Sillage and projection are practically non-existent. Very tight skin scent. I mean, after the first hour, it's nose to skin to detect any of the scent. No idea what the longevity is like but does it matter? For such an intimate scent, who cares if it lasts 2 hours or 20 hours?

Overall a big disappointment. ""Meisterstück"" is German for masterpiece. This is definitely no masterpiece. Not available yet at discounters so the retail price of $140 is way too much for what this is - basically weak amber/woody fumes."
Black Meisterstück,04/10/2025,DJMartin,M,1,,2,Already Underrated,"If you just read the reviews on here you'd think this was the worst fragrance ever created, an abomination and that montblanc is spitting in the face of every fragrance creator/lover out there with this creation. However at the time of this entry it has a score of 7.6 by 55 users so some people are enjoying it. I am definitely one of those people. To me this is the one of montblancs greatest and I don't care who disagrees. It's a very dark and woody fragrance for sure but there's some amber in there along with some incense that gives it this sort of inky smell, in a good way. Best of all I would classify this as a spicy - oriental - woody/smokey fragrance. Not cough out your lungs smokey but just enough to let you know that it's there. It wasn't a room filler for me but it was enough for passerbys to get a whiff of and get me quite a few compliments every time I've worn it. Lasts all day long too. Really reminds me of something that I can't quite put my finger on, probably something discontinued by Gucci or Tom Ford or something. I dunno but I really like this. for Montblanc on this one."
Black Meisterstück,04/18/2025,Msl,M,9,,1,Such a wasted potential,"I firmly believe that the performance is overrated, I very much prefer smelling great for 4 hours rather than smelling meh for 10. With that being said, this one is simply disappointing.

It opens up beautifully, reminds me a bit of Black by CDG, one of my all-time favourite designers. You get a very pleasant and easy-to-like smokiness, maybe even some warm amber and a just a touch of sweetness. For a moment it evokes the scent of high-quality paper, perhaps intentionally, considering what Montblanc is known for. And then, before it even fully develops, the scent disappears completely.

I gave it another chance on a humid and relatively warm, but not hot day, which I thought should have helped its performance. Still nothing.

I’m incredibly disappointed, I had such high hopes.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s worth trying, you should give it a go anyway, it’s really interesting, and who knows, maybe it’ll have more staying power on your skin. From me, unfortunately it’s a no, especially at this price point."
Black Meisterstück,06/28/2025,AugustoB,M,31,,1,Meisterstuck? Monsterstuck. Big smell.,"What a tremendous collection this Montblanc has. The four released are very good perfumes, original, purposeful, even bold. The bad thing is that designers charge us almost niche prices so we can enjoy a scent that can be confused with any other. Black Meisterstuck is a tough, solid, direct composition, just three notes that, at the top, display an incense reminiscent of Loewe Anonymous, but it doesn't go that way; this evolves into dark woods, dry, bitter, almost medicinal, and slightly amber. I imagined it would be something warmer, for winter use, but on the contrary, this could work well almost year-round. It's for dressing casually, seriously, with a frown. It is truly a rugged and distinguished perfume. Fair performance, 5 to 6 hours are enough, projected for an hour perhaps. Quite unique, except for the price it is well worth it."
Black Meisterstück,07/22/2024,Avantgardist,M,42,,8,"Oh, come on!","Yesss, it’s a designer, I get it. Still, one should expect more than this watery concoction with no character.

Especially with the ""Masterpiece,"" I had high hopes due to the association with the luxurious writing instrument and the focus on only two fragrance notes! Serge Lutens takes similar paths and does so with great success. So it is possible.

However, the result in this case is not even disappointing, even when you lower your expectations.

In short, there is almost nothing to say (which I will do in great detail shortly):

You have to search for the ""scent"" with a nasal magnifying glass; I notice absolutely nothing of the incense, neither on the test strip nor on the skin. Ambrofix is listed, but nothing comes through. I have some of these fragrance chemicals at home and trust myself to smell them. Either the concentration is simply too low or it’s something else. Overall, a very light sweetness, a hint of woodiness. That’s it... and you can either like that or not, and it doesn’t have to be bad if only the longevity and sillage were right.

The sillage is almost non-existent: I and the salesperson had to really get about 10 cm close to perceive the scent. Mind you: right after spraying.

There is no scent progression; it remains the same as when sprayed and weakens minute by minute.

The longevity is miserable as well. I was in the perfumery for about an hour and then drove home. Upon arriving home, I could hardly perceive anything close to my skin. It could be due to the interplay of my skin and the fragrance, but the same picture was presented on the test strip.

The best part of the whole thing is the bottle, which looks really nice, though it doesn’t quite hold up in terms of tactile experience. One is used to better from Montblanc... although, if the only positive aspect of a perfume is that the bottle, despite being of average quality, looks quite pretty, that’s already an olfactory confession of failure.

For the price, it’s a real disappointment: a lot of money for a hint of nothing. Maybe a few more complementary fragrance notes and a higher concentration of them would have been better?

Conclusion: Just because you own a Montblanc Meisterstück doesn’t automatically mean you create top notes. The substance must also fit."

It's agreeable enough, but undeniably generic.
Like many Montblanc EDTs I've encountered (even their EDPs like Legend and Explorer underwhelm in performance), this one requires liberal application and frequent re-spraying to make an impact.
However, at its affordable price point (around $32), it's a decent everyday option. It's inoffensive and suitable for close quarters like carpools, elevators, and the office. Just don't expect it to be a standout date night choice or to last through a summer day or a night out dancing."

It has a nice scent, sweet with a touch of spice (similar to CK One Shock in my opinion), and it’s not expensive at all, so don’t think I “hate” it, it’s just that I was expecting MORE from it after the vid I watched.

I personally get a decent 3ft of projection radius, with a modest sillage trail, and 4-6 hours of longevity. For $30, I can’t complain. A decent buy at a decent price; no more, no less."

It's great office fragrance for either a man or a woman. For wood-loving fumies like @malegria, this is a must try!

Alternative review -

Presence is a very masculine fragrance for a feminine, in my opinion. It seems to me to have cedar in it, which always wears like aftershave on me. Or, perhaps it is the patchouli. Regardless, this is not one for flower-lovers. It's classified as an oriental vanilla, but it seems like a woody to me. Probably best for those who seek out non-floral fragrances.

The fragrance is solid & good, but definitely try this one before you buy this one. It's difficult to wear, and I think more men would wear it off-the-shelf than women. Unique bottle, though."
Présence d'Une Femme,04/24/2024,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,Underestimated,"What a scent! This is a fragrance that has so much to offer; longevity, sillage and note combination. The ratings do not give a true picture of the qualities of the product. I dare say that it is much better than the rating.
It starts out fresh and romantic. The combination of mandarin and pepper works so well. Then comes the heart: flowers and woods - beautifully mixed. It lasts for quite some time. At least five to six hours. In my opinion a great scent that you want to get to know.
The bottle is a beautiful design. It is both interesting and classic. I like the play between the metal and the glass, shaped like a circle. In my opinion it is greatly done.

Sadly, it's no longer made, but if and when I find a bottle I always buy it. Even if I'm still half-way through the one I have.
I remember misplacing the only bottle I brought with me on a trip. The entire apartment was turned upside down, looking for it. It just disappeared. My sister-in-law, somehow, managed to find a store that sold it. It was delivered that evening, just to make sure I had it when I leave. Thankfully, we found the original lost bottle! Phew! Exhaling!"
Présence d'Une Femme,01/02/2020,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,,11,The Ubiquitous Presence of Women??,"Women are just EVERYWHERE!!! Uh, wait, first of all, hello everyone :D
So… women are just EVERYWHERE!!! Well, one must admit that guys are everywhere too… but guys don’t scare you as much when you’re alone (or outnumbered) in a place dominated by you women!!

Oh dear, I could totally get hysterical about all sorts of things just because the name of this fragrance means something like “Presence of a Woman,” and that’s only if I haven’t totally misinterpreted the name… right now in the new year, I should probably annoy you ladies less and… uh… love you more?? Oh, I have no idea :D

But before I say something totally wrong, I’d better get to this fragrance by Montblanc. Still, my text here is surely better than some of the texts from fragrance manufacturers. In this one, it states among other things that the fragrance is suitable for all women who feel “extraordinarily sexy and elegant.” And now try to find fragrance descriptions that say something similar! Well? What did you find? Yes, exactly! That pretty much applies to all sorts of women’s fragrance descriptions, doesn’t it? He he :D
And to be honest, this doesn’t only happen with fragrances but with all sorts of products, because of course a manufacturer has to write things like “The fragrance for the elegant woman of today!” to sell the product, it’s just a shame that all this sounds very clichéd nowadays :D

Anyway, as long as the fragrance (or product) underneath doesn’t suffer, I’m fine with it. After all, you have me here for crazy and silly texts :DD
So, let’s get to the fragrance!

The Fragrance:
I smell a slightly spicy mandarin, of course, because alongside the mandarin (which smells good by the way), there’s also pepper involved, which is neither stuffy nor inappropriate for the mandarin. Both fragrance notes smell quite pleasant, although the scent leaves a slightly diluted impression in the top note. Violets quickly join in and give the fragrance a lightly powdery sweetness.
A little later, I still smell mandarins and pepper, while I also perceive a bit of rose and woody notes. The woody notes are gentle here and not sharply herbaceous like cedar or something, smelling more like sandalwood and similar. All this is still accompanied by a “splash” of vanilla, which becomes a bit stronger later in the base.
In the base, the fragrance is sweet and peppery. It now primarily smells of vanilla with some pepper, while the citrus notes like mandarins have almost completely disappeared. There are still woods and a slight earthy patchouli note.

The Sillage and Longevity:
The sillage is moderate, so you can smell it at a short distance for a little while.
The longevity is quite good at about seven to eight hours, although it is noticeably weaker in the later hours.

The Bottle:
The bottle is round, with the bottle being placed upside down. This way, the actual spray head, which also serves as a cap, is at the bottom, allowing you to see the glassy and clear part and thus the fragrance liquid on the upper side of the bottle. An interesting concept that also looks good.

Conclusion:
So, hmm… the fragrance is not bad, but it doesn’t exactly blow you away. It falls into that category of fragrances that are actually pleasant but just not extraordinary enough that you’d want it immediately, at least not right away. In any case, it’s worth trying out. I think that Présence is an all-rounder that works well for all seasons and can even be worn for many occasions. It is sweet and pleasant for going out, but also not very intensely radiant and overwhelming, so you could wear it at work too.

It smells very feminine, and this, even though the pepper is always noticeable. But the pepper is mild and thus also smells pleasant. Besides, it seems you ladies really like pepper; why else do I constantly hear things from you like “Get lost! Go where the pepper grows!!!”,… *sigh* No wonder I never dare to ask anyone out on a date when you all get so angry :D

Anyway, as I said, the fragrance is worth a test, even though you wouldn’t miss anything if you skipped it. With that, I’ll come to an end, and yes,… I wish you all a lovely evening. And I… I really need to find out where that mysterious place is where the pepper grows… :D"
Présence d'Une Femme,10/03/2012,LaPausa,F,10,,11,Light Spicy Oriental with a Touch of Sweetness,"This is how this beautiful, soft, round fragrance comes across to me.
The floral notes are somewhat underrepresented, which I really like.
There is only a hint of fruit, a bit of pepper, but the woody notes and patchouli are clearly in the foreground. This is the case right after the first spray and remains so.

When I first tested the fragrance years ago, I found the name a bit strange, as it had almost a somewhat harsh, masculine quality to me. But that’s exactly what I like - sometimes.
(I also wore Minotaure by Paloma Picasso for years).

A warm fragrance, perfect for gray autumn days. Moreover, it is a scent that is not overly common, but somewhat underestimated, which in my eyes is another plus point.

The longevity is good, the sillage is also good, but not intrusive, making it absolutely suitable for the office."

Présence d'Une Femme,05/13/2021,Fleurrare,F,47,,9,Characterful,"Following in the footsteps of one of my favorite perfumers and one of my favorite notes, I found this little gem. The name already says a lot about the character of this fragrance, and it definitely has one, and not a little! Like many compositions from this nose, the perfume is powerful! And it's an Eau de Toilette. The start is very strong, presence is felt, nothing here goes unnoticed (or overlooked)... so the subsequent silence was all the more surprising; the scent briefly became quite quiet only to then surprise with an even more dominant presence. So, it's not for lovers of subtle tones. When I smelled the fragrance, it occurred to me: it seems designed as an accessory for a power lady in a pantsuit who smokes. So, to get rid of it? Well, let's see... sometimes it doesn't hurt to appear stricter than one is. A sheep in wolf's clothing, so to speak... The whole ""strict"" impression probably comes from the pepper and woods, I assume. The perfumer has indeed managed to create a juicy wood scent with a very subtle sweetness. So, a masterpiece for sure! The quality leaves nothing to be desired. For me, it also has a slight sexy touch. This is, of course, very subjective. By the way, I think a man could also wear this well. I don't know how things were back in 2002 with unisex fragrances. In any case, I'm glad to have gotten to know it."

Présence d'Une Femme,08/14/2022,Iris2022,F,15,,5,"If not for men, then at least unisex","Obviously, Mr. Almairac must have relied heavily on pepper, patchouli, and woods when composing this fragrance, making it a clear men's scent for me. Even after 30 minutes, I can only sense the flowers and vanilla faintly and only perceive this harsh masculine character. With the first spray, I immediately thought of ""hooker diesel,"" and I admit that I simply had to have the bottle. That’s also what’s interesting about this scent: The bottle promises class and looks really good as a decoration, but only for looking at.
I’m really surprised that production has been discontinued, as you can still get the 75 ml for as low as € 27.99 at various popular perfume chains, which is certainly worth it for the fragrance.
It will continue to circulate; my dad will be pleased."
Présence d'Une Femme,08/02/2010,Antoine,F,207,,0,Sour,"I like mandarins for eating, I also like mandarin juice for drinking, but the mandarin in ""Présence d'Une Femme"" develops an unpleasant sour note on my skin that reminds me of vomit. Mr. Almairac, who is certainly no amateur, surely did not intend it this way, so I attribute this discomfort to my skin chemistry (I had a similar experience with Cassis Douceur by Varens, a fragrance highly praised by other reviewers).

But anyway, I simply cannot like PdUF, even though the description of the fragrance notes sounds quite attractive, with all the wood. In fact, the sour (mandarin?) note remains quite present for a long time, well over an hour. The subsequent sweet floral note no longer smells sour, but still fails to convince me completely; besides, an hour of sour top note is definitely too long. The base comes across as rather sweet and vanilla-like, where is the wood, where is the patchouli? Three different woods are supposed to be there, and also patchouli, but the only thing that is really noticeable is the vanilla and a lingering hint of fruitiness.

By the way, the bottle is a kind of intelligence test. You first have to figure out where the spray button is. It’s at the bottom of the bottle. Well, on the second (or third?) try, I figured it out ;-)"
Legend pour Femme,05/28/2013,BackToBlack,M,112,,26,The Ecstasy of Spring,"After work, I quickly went into town, straight into Müller.. I actually just wanted to buy a little something, but suddenly I found myself in front of a beautiful woman who was clearly unable to get enough of a fragrance. She smiled briefly, took the scent in her hand, and inhaled the whole mist she had sprayed into the air. She breathed in deeply and finally let out a soft ""Aaah."" How wonderful it is when someone is truly excited about a fragrance, when they absorb it as if it were a drug. She stood there, intoxicated, closed her eyes, and swayed her head back and forth. Yes, the scent had captivated her. She was enchanted. I love it when I come home stressed from work and see happy, content people. It makes me feel better too. I had to smile, and she smiled back, took the largest dimension of the fragrance, and happily went to the checkout. A wonderful breeze of passion and feminine elegance accompanied her. A very beautiful scent! - It hits you right away when sprayed and leaves you in awe for a brief moment. Yes, she must be in a good mood now, and I became particularly curious. What kind of scent is this? Montblanc. I've heard it somewhere, but I didn't pay attention or it simply passed me by unnoticed.

I slowly approached, briefly sniffed the sprayer. It hit me right from the first spray, and I inhaled the scent just like she did earlier. God, this scent is glorious! A warm spring rain cascades over my senses - The bitter orange falls into a cool mist and brings spring to the forefront. A light scent of an unripe pear spreads and slowly transforms into a warm symphony of woody notes and lily of the valley. Warm, sensual, yet this scent cries out for recognition. A fragrance that is not too loud but still noticeable, as it is very intense in its opening, yet without being overwhelming. It is not sweet, rather a bit unripe, but that is part of its charm. The bitterness becomes apparent after a while, and I sprayed some on my wrist because I found it so wonderful. Because I enjoy being drenched in warm rain and letting it wash over me. The warmth intensifies, and I leave Müller. Packed with 2 test strips, which I kept sniffing. I must say, it had really lodged itself in my memory. At home, I took a long shower, and when I briefly thought of the scent, the warm breeze shot up my nose. Yes, it blew me away. I retrieved the test strips again and took a deep breath to make sure I didn't miss anything. The scent is still warm, but a slight touch of orange can be detected, surrounded by vanilla candles. Like warm wax, the ingredient flows into the fragrance, making it even more feminine and, above all, more intense. It only became quiet after a few minutes. The vanilla has burned off. Only the woodiness remained, refined with the lovely lily of the valley and a hint of musk. The musk is quite shy but holds on firmly until the end and fades away in a flame. It started with a bang and ended with a rush.

My daughter asked me what was wrong with me, as I was so lost while walking back and forth through the apartment, constantly exclaiming ""wonderful."" I silently handed her the test strips. She looked at me with wide eyes and without really smelling them, said, ""Women's perfume!"" She raised an eyebrow and looked at me with questioning eyes. She took a sniff, and I waited for her reaction. ""Mhm.. Dad, WHAT IS THIS?"" I smiled and said I had stumbled upon it today. She took a few more sniffs, holding the strips tightly in her hand as if someone might take them away. Her reaction was the same as mine. She was practically glowing and raving about the scent that truly elevates the ecstasy of spring. She wouldn't let go, and now she was the one wandering through the apartment like a confused person, sniffing the strips as if it were the last drug of the century. It made a strong impression on my daughter's mind. She couldn't stop raving, and I was still lost in my warm rain..

This scent is for women who love to show themselves without wearing too much makeup or clothing. A hint of nothing and this scent! A divine connection. Women who skillfully express their personality, who enter a room and remain silent yet draw all eyes and noses to themselves - that's what Legend p.F. does too. It projects its character outward. It intoxicates the senses, never comes off as arrogant or cheap. It sneaks in like a parasite and devises plans to shape the senses with its fingers.. Gently but skillfully.
Tomorrow I will buy the fragrance..

This scent is unique. It rushes through my veins when I think of it. It definitely deserves much more recognition. Many fragrances go in that direction, but they are mostly all the same or pompously over-sweetened with vanilla or some violets..

It is simply wonderful and really good. I can't say more than that. It has delighted and intoxicated me. It would be something deadly for me if I smelled this fragrance on a woman I desire..

A downfall of my senses..

A toast to Montblanc!"
Legend pour Femme,04/21/2017,First,F,232,,23,A fragrance that isn't meant to be worn every day.,"What a delight this scent is! How pleasantly soft, friendly, and mild it is - after all my tests of demanding, albeit impressive niche fragrances. I spray myself with Legend and breathe a sigh of relief: Citrusy freshness envelops me with a slightly bitter hint of fruit and peel, the well-composed interplay of the mildness and sharpness of neroli, bitter orange, and orange blossoms gives the fragrance balance and allows it to float in the perfect and thus elegantly appealing middle between boring cozy scent and prickly bristle. I don't explicitly perceive pear, but rather a somewhat indistinct fruitiness that adds a restrained sweetness and calms the citrus notes.

After less than three minutes, something floral and slightly creamy joins in. I don't perceive the floral note as lily of the valley; rather, I feel that both a hint of tuberose and a touch of daffodil are woven in, taming the jasmine so that it can show itself from its finest and mildest side. The slight creaminess must come from the musk. Here, I must give high praise: The musk substitute used here is one of the few that I find tolerable, even pleasant, and that does not tend to give me feelings of suffocation. However, I must say that I don't necessarily smell musk here. As mentioned, it is more of a soft creaminess that connects the citrusy, floral, and fruity notes, now also sweetish, in the background.

One might think that fruits, primarily citrus fruits with flowers and peels, a bit of jasmine, dampened by tuberose and daffodil, underlaid with creamy musk would be ubiquitous and nothing special, just another ordinary scent that has been smelled many times before. But that is not the case. Once again, it shows that the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

I like Legend exceptionally well. It is a fragrance that always works when everything else is too demanding or conspicuous. Legend is feminine, but not vampy. Legend is warm, but not cloying. Legend is fresh, but by no means aquatic. Legend is bright, but not lightweight. Legend is sweetish, but not sticky. Legend is in the middle, but not mediocre. Legend is natural, but not naive. Legend is noble, without being elitist.

In my opinion, Legend rightly bears its name: Universally known, legendary components of perfumes that have been cherished by equally legendary divas for centuries are harmoniously honored here and presented anew with a more fruity focus.
In a certain way, this is very conservative. But doesn't the time-tested deserve active attention, a new perspective, and a modern yet preserving way of being showcased and brought to the forefront?
I think so.

From my side, there is only one single point of criticism, which probably has more to do with my particular nose: I adapt to the scent incredibly quickly. After about three hours, I could reapply. This impulse must be resisted, as the fragrance does not have such a short longevity or low sillage. Even two days later, I can still clearly perceive it on my clothing - however, only if I haven't worn it in the meantime.

And so I must hold back: I shouldn't wear it daily, no matter how much I want to."
Legend pour Femme,02/20/2013,Mandelmaus,F,132,,11,Desire for Spring,"Having read quite a bit of good things about Montblanc here, I was motivated to test this fragrance.

Right from the start, it smells wonderfully fruity and refreshing. The bitter orange is immediately present and gives Legend something extraordinary and herb-fruity. As the fragrance develops, it feels like all the notes are arranged around the fruit. The note seems to support the entire scent. The pear also comes through very clearly for me, just as refreshing and juicy. However, the fruits do not remind me of an overripe fruit basket that has been dumped with kilos of sugar. Rather, they evoke the image of fruit that has just been freshly cut. The top note hits me like a sparkling, crisp-fresh bomb. Legend gains warmth from unobtrusive jasmine and orange blossom. Both make the fragrance feminine and sensual. The lily of the valley adds a pleasant sweetness. The base is pleasantly woody and cozy. However, the vanilla does not make it a boring uniform blend, but gives that pleasant feeling of security. The base, so to speak, embraces the heart note. Even here, the bitter orange is still perceptible.

The perfume is very balanced for me and makes me long for spring. It is never synthetic or shrill. The bottle immediately appealed to me. It fits well in the hand and is beautifully designed otherwise. The color matches the scent well.
I think the perfume can be worn for all occasions. I find the longevity to be enormous. Throughout the day, my nose keeps catching a delightful whiff of it. Unfortunately, I can't give the overall package a hundred percent, as the sillage could be stronger.

Nevertheless, I place this fragrance at the very top of my wish list, as I can imagine it as the perfect companion through all seasons and I simply feel wonderful with it."
Legend pour Femme,06/17/2015,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,12,Beautiful Writing,"For the report card, there were always a few heartfelt words from my parents and a small gift.
The math grade of five was standard, softened by ones and twos in languages - including Latin.
This comforted my parents about my number dyslexia.

However, they found my handwriting to be in need of improvement, and so one day there was a long package on my report card, containing an incredibly beautiful black-green fountain pen with a real gold nib.
Montblanc.
My heart raced at the sight of the beautiful, stylish writing instrument.
Even the process of drawing ink from the classic ink bottle brought me joy.
It was a completely different experience than the mundane task of changing plastic cartridges.

And the nib glided smoothly and effortlessly across the paper, like a sailboat over a still lake - giving my immature teenage handwriting grace and elegance.
I decided that love letters and poems would flow from my pen this way.

And the scent that reminds me of this beautiful gift is graceful and elegant - with a captivating dose of simple elegance.
The opening of full pear and cool neroli is extraordinarily successful and alluring.
Indian jasmine is exquisitely exotic, and the lily of the valley is delightfully cozy.
The woody notes appear noble and classic, warmed by gentle vanilla.

I see myself again in my old classroom, lost in thought as I dip my Montblanc into the ink bottle, and then energetically transfer Fried's ""It is what it is"" into my German notebook.

The name Legend is well chosen - both for the classic among fountain pens and for this special fragrance."
Legend pour Femme,08/15/2015,Fefaminz,F,134,,8,"""The ladies must surely like this sweet floral stuff""","said the plump fountain pen manufacturer to his marketing department as he puffed on his cigar. In the lab, they quickly mixed something together so that the lady accompanying her husband, who was buying a fountain pen, would not leave the Montblanc house without making a small purchase.

LpF shows a bit of fruit at the beginning ""oh, that was pear?!"", immediately followed and dominated by an extremely sweet flower ""very reminiscent of the overly sweet artificial Tiare from the unspeakable YR-Monoi"" and then stays like that for a very long time. In the end, the obligatory vanilla naturally appears and manages to maintain this dull, heavy sweetness for many hours until the end. I do not recognize any of the individual flowers or woods mentioned in the pyramid. The musk was obviously only used for longevity, as it cannot be distinguished further.

Conclusion for me: Fountain pen yes - Legend pour Femme no!"

A legend like the women who inspired this fragrance.

A Kelly Bag, so to speak ;)"
Legend pour Femme,07/11/2013,DorettaCo,F,1,,2,"Schuster, stick to your last.","What has motivated the luxury brand Montblanc to suddenly start producing perfumes is something only God knows. I received 2 bottles of Legend pour Femme and one bottle of Legend (for men) as a gift during an event, and unfortunately, I find them only mediocre.
The men's fragrance smells exactly how one would imagine an average men's perfume to smell: sporty, nothing special.
The women's fragrance smells incredibly artificial and overpowering, to the point that it almost gives me a headache. But what can you do? The longevity is quite good, and I do use it occasionally during the day on weekdays, although not very happily.
Conclusion: Montblanc, I love your fountain pens and leather goods, but when it comes to fragrances, it's better to leave it be...!"
Legend pour Femme,12/12/2013,Marianne,F,65,,2,Love at second Glow!,"I can't believe it! Love at first Glow has risen again!
Legend pour Femme makes no secret of any developing fragrance notes, but reveals everything it has at the ""first sniff."" For me, that's peach, neroli (which makes it a bit more mature than Love at first Glow), and a musk-bitter orange combo like in Chopard Happy Spirit. However, the juicy fruits (pear,...) are primarily in focus.
When you take a closer sniff, Legend pour Femme turns out to be nothing more than a ""regular"" women's fragrance that exists by the hundreds. Floral, sweet, fruity, a bit artificial.
Well, at least the sillage keeps me thinking of my favorite from JLo :D"
Legend pour Femme,11/25/2013,Lenchen84,F,17,,0,Nothing special!,"I received a sample and tested it for the second time. It’s just nothing special for me. Nothing stands out and it smells like nothing. Besides lily of the valley, I can't find anything in the scent that the fragrance pyramid suggests. I wouldn't buy it or recommend it. The longevity is also low."
Patchouli Ink,08/19/2025,WolfHunter,M,67,,1,Corporate Goth,"A very unisex patchouli and vanilla fragrance that is on the woody side of patchouli. It’s a patchouli that’s very rounded and isn’t overly earthy or damp smelling. The vanilla is present but never overbearing to where it goes into gourmand territory. It’s an almost vanilla extract type of vanilla. The ink note is noticeable but it isn’t at all off putting or unwearable. It sits under the patchouli and vanilla and gives this fragrance a bit of “Oh…that’s different. But I like it!” kind of thing.

When I first smelled this, it immediately reminded me of a more formal and better behaved Lush - Lord of Misrule.

It doesn’t have the sharp pepper of LOM and the patchouli is more rounded. The vanilla is also not quite as sweet, but the framework is there.

It’s the perfect corporate goth fragrance. A ride to work blasting Bella Lugosi’s Dead in a black tailored suit that conceals your copious amount of tattoos. Working your normie job and all your co-workers know you’re kind of weird. They just don’t know the full extent of it.

The bottle is absolutely gorgeous but I do have some complaints about the cap. It’s a rubbery plastic cap that just feels so out of place for such an elegant bottle. Plus the rubber or plastic they used on the cap STINKS. This fragrance really could have used a magnetic cap to really set it off. But for a sub $100 fragrance, I can’t complain too much."
Patchouli Ink,02/06/2025,Hanniel,M,4,,6,Herbaceous Gentleman,"An intriguing scent that certainly not everyone will want or can wear. It is definitely not a youthful profile, but it can definitely be worn on many occasions. The fragrance is not necessarily edgy, but in my opinion, it is not a mass-pleaser. Strong projection and good longevity.

The scent reminds me of the smell of pecans. Woody, dry, with a very light nutty sweetness. A strong patchouli note. It feels mature and serious. Perfect for gentlemen and suitable for the office with fewer sprays.

The bottle is solid and the cap is magnetic. The price/quality ratio is good."
Lady Emblem,02/22/2016,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,dapper girlie,"Since I really like Legend by Montblanc, I was excited about the Lady Emblem sample.

I expected an elegant, confident scent.
But the title is misleading, as I am enveloped by a very playful, extremely youthful aroma.

Its distinct sweetness is appealing - but it probably suits a dapper girlie, without piercings and tattoos, more than a mature lady.
My charming nieces would likely look great in it.

Blackcurrant jam and raspberry are delicious - but not exactly ladylike.
The peach is beautifully delicate and juicy, and the rose is subtle and budding.
I can't detect the woods behind the floral and fruity curtain.

A sweet, delightful scent - whose age group and message I have already outgrown.
Still, I like it because it is so sweet and uncomplicated.

Nevertheless, the more mature Legend is a better fit for me."
Extreme Leather,08/24/2025,Sparrinsky,M,46,,1,A very interesting leather,"Usually, leather is not a note that I enjoy. It reminds me of cars and it gives me a nauseous feeling. Which is why I was very surprised when this leather forward scent caught my attention. The leather/saffron mix gives way to a powdery, soft, iris musky heart until dying back down to a muted musky/leather combo which goes pretty well with me. As others said below, nothing extreme about it. It is pretty mild and enjoyable if you can get past the punchy opening. It has intrigued me quite a bit and it is worthy of trying if these notes appeal to you, but don't expect a saddle."
Extreme Leather,12/30/2024,Orrisbutter,M,1,,3,Velvet Leather,"Dior Homme 2011 and Ombré Leather fusion:

This one has grown on me. The name is not appropriate. In no way is this fragrance harsh or extreme. This is a very soft, elegant, powdery leather. Velvet Leather is more appropriate name.

The Iris in this is not lipsticky or cloying. It’s rather earthy and vegetal, very comforting nevertheless.

Sits close to the skin but lasts decently long as get whiffs of it all day.

I also love wearing it to bed, it’s so comforting, like a second skin.

Have a feeling it will become a hit"
Lady Emblem L'Eau,11/13/2018,MarieTheres,F,71,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Just like the bottle,"Just like the bottle, so is Lady Emblem L'Eau.

I probably would have never picked it up in my life if it hadn't been shown to me in the perfume store, as it was available in a set with body lotion just before Christmas. So off I went to the tester strip. It was love at the second sniff; at first whiff, I found it okay, but not outstanding. However, on the skin, it developed so beautifully that I ""had to"" go back to that perfume store while strolling through the pedestrian zone to buy the Montblanc set.

Fragrances with peach are often way too sweet and artificial for me, but this one is different. You get what you see - the bottle beautifully reflects the scent. The blue color signals clarity and purity, which the fragrance certainly possesses. However, it is not a classic clean scent either, as the shape and faceting of the bottle are too playful.

For me, Lady Emblem is a lovely fresh fragrance that can be worn at any time of the year and day, and for all occasions. It doesn't annoy anyone, yet it can be sensed well - and for a long time too. I can still smell it quite distinctly on my sweater in the evening after I sprayed it on in the morning before work.

The perfume should be perfect for those who like it fresh but not too aquatic, who enjoy being surrounded by subtle flowers and are not averse to sweetness. Mind you, not caramel or cotton candy, but rather a light and fruity sweetness. Certainly, Lady Emblem L'Eau is not the greatest hit that perfume history has ever written - but it doesn't have to be! Sometimes it is not so easy to discover a calm, feminine gem among all the La Vie Est Belles."
Lady Emblem L'Eau,04/07/2017,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Spring in Light Green,"Spring is here - and on the tables in the department store, white, pink, yellow, and light green little boxes are crowding together.

This reminds me of a pastel-colored spring meadow.

I reach for the light green Montblanc Bloom - and I am pleasantly surprised by the sprayer.
I like it better than the pink EdT, which I found too girly for myself.
But L'eau is delicate yet expressive, and it skillfully reflects its spring green.
The mandarin leaf may be responsible for that.
A light sweetness is conveyed by the peach - nestled in white magnolia and pink roses.
Emblem L'eau remains pastel-colored, yet still quite noticeable.
A soft resinous note supports the fragrance from within.

For me, L'eau is more mature than the EdT - even though it is lively and conveys cheerfulness.
Subtle elegance is paired with a charming ""carefreeness"".

For me, it is the ultimate spring fragrance."
Lady Emblem L'Eau,03/23/2017,ChristinKl,F,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Fresh, sweet, and pure spring!","In search of more spring fragrances for my collection, I came across this scent from Montblanc. Well, actually, I was pointed to it by the lady in the perfume shop ;-)
This fragrance is a successful blend of very light citrus notes and floral scents. Clearly, the fruity part stands out at the beginning, smelling of mandarin and peach, and it simply whets the appetite for summer. What remains is mandarin, rose, and musk making their way through.
I’m sitting in the car with the top down and a decadent pair of sunglasses, driving through the Alps to Italy. Passing through vineyards and fruit orchards. I stop at a tiny inn and sit in the rose garden under a little mandarin tree, ordering an Aperol Spritz - or maybe a Limoncello instead?
This scent is fantastic on me. I've already received the first compliments, and my mood is lifting. The sillage is stronger than you think, so be careful! The longevity is great; after 6 hours, it’s still fully present, despite eating at an Indian restaurant and the corresponding food smells in my hair and clothes.
It's going straight onto my wish list!"
Vetiver Glacier,08/24/2025,Sparrinsky,M,46,,2,Does not deserve the current rating,"Written when rating was 6.4

This is good! Why do people clown on it? Yes, the price is not worth it, but you can get it for $70 on discounters. It is what it claims to be. Cold vetiver. The opening is undeniably vetiver, but it remains like that all along. Something in the mix, whether it is the juniper or sandalwood (both of which are not that prominent to my nose) gives it a more lofty vibe. More of a tundra than a glacier. It is classy, masculine, and timeless. Out of the 5 of this collection, this one is my favorite."
Vetiver Glacier,07/23/2025,Olaflora,F,17,,1,Between Allure and Overstimulation,"Vetiver Glacier is definitely a men's fragrance for me, and it is a scent that puts me in a real dilemma as a woman. On one hand, I find it very piercing and almost aggressive with its sharp freshness and spiciness - so present that it keeps me at a distance at first. On the other hand, this freshness and spiciness, along with the woody notes, are so special that they make me pause. It is different. It is a statement. Not a typical everyday scent, not a pleasing mainstream fragrance, but a composition with edge and character. This sharpness remains present for a long time, and that is what fascinates and repels me at the same time. I believe this fragrance only works when worn by the right person, as it demands a certain presence, perhaps even some rough edges in character; otherwise, it can come across as too loud too quickly. For me personally, it is a kind of olfactory tension: I stop, perceive it, am impressed, and at the same time, I wouldn’t want it in my nose for the long term. A scent that polarizes and definitely has a character... for me as a woman, however, it is too demanding. ..."
Femme Individuelle,06/15/2023,Stacia,F,134,,1,Surprisingly good blind buy,"The pink juice made me expect a watered down floral, heavy on rose or freesia or something. What I got instead was something quite unique. The femme who wears this is an individuelle indeed!

The top note of bay is very strong to me and I'm not a huge fan when it's still wet. It's so herby and medicinal, it makes me think of Vick's Vapo Rub. Thankfully it tones down as it dries and begins to blend with the currant. The bay never leaves completely but it takes it's place in the background as a support structure for all the other notes.

This has a slight ""plastic doll head"" quality and I happen to be one of those people who loves that doll head smell. I actually seek it out and have bought ""doll smell"" sampler packs! The notes I voted as strongest are: Pink pepper, bay, red currant and vanilla. The florals exist but I can't pick out individual flowers. This isn't for a girly girl, it's for a sassy girl in charge."
Femme Individuelle,06/21/2012,Michelangela,F,89,,28,...and every day the groundhog greets,"Femme Individuelle is the ideal scent for every day. No one feels offended by this fragrance, it does not cause sexual harassment in the workplace, is resistant to all kinds of complainers, does not intrude on allergy sufferers, and gives the whole environment the impression: I am freshly washed!
Without much effort, one (or woman) can leave a ""good impression"" with this scent. If you want to be pleasantly present without necessarily standing out: Femme Individuelle is the best choice.

I don't need to describe the fragrance notes themselves; anyone can see them in the pyramid, so I will limit myself to the effect and expression of this delicate companion.
Upon spraying, Femme Individuelle envelops the wearer in a powdery-fresh veil that accompanies her for several hours. One should not expect a spectacular scent evolution, as the fragrance only vaguely changes from floral-fresh-powdery to soapy-powdery.

Conclusion:
Femme Individuelle does not really live up to its name, or maybe it does? Is its classically elegant restraint perhaps ultimately what is meant to give us back our individuality? Should this scent subtly underline our personality without being loud and conspicuous?
I don't know. If I were to give this fragrance a name, it would be more like ""Femme Incognito""!
~
Why did I give it 70%???
Quite simply: it’s not that I don’t like it; I know few scents that fit into everyday life as well as this one. It is unobtrusively elegant and adapts well to the situations of daily madness where an egocentric sillage is simply not welcome. But personally, I find it too expressionless, or should I say too ""quiet"" for a ""loud"" girl like me?
As a companion for hot dance nights and as an aphrodisiac, it completely fails; it is far too inconspicuous and well-behaved....."
Femme Individuelle,05/12/2013,Mandelmaus,F,132,,20,Still waters run deep...,"... and dirty!, my grandma always added sharply. Logically speaking, she may be right. A bubbling mountain stream is certainly cleaner than a stagnant puddle. But I don't want to know where she got her insight from. Femme individuelle is definitely not dirty. I was hoping for a nice office scent, pleasantly unobtrusive and quiet. And surprisingly, I was taught better.

According to the comments, the fragrance is supposed to be very delicate and being an EDT, one can be generous with the spraying. Four spritzes on the neck and one on the wrist, and I’m enveloped in a substantial cloud of pepper. That’s it for delicate, as it tickles quite a bit in the nose and seems almost to laugh at me. The blackcurrant doesn’t take long to show up. It unfolds rather sour and a bit tart, hitting my taste perfectly. There is certainly enough sugary fruit. The bay leaf provides a fine aromatic and pleasant spiciness. Here, the scent is spicy, tart-fruity, and fresh. Definitely more interesting than I thought and even brings a room-filling sillage at this point.

In the heart note, the sharpness of the pepper subsides and the spiciness recedes more into the background, though it never completely disappears. The fragrance becomes sweeter and softer. The rose presents itself quite strongly without being transparent, but it lacks the velvety and soft touch to give the scent sensuality. Lotus adds fresh accents and lifts the fragrance; without it, the scent would probably be too boring. The heart is floral, fresh, spicy, and sweet, without being sticky. A gentle femininity that does not entice, but simply ""is"".

After that, the fragrance fades a bit. It becomes quieter until only a sweet, warm, and spicy whisper can be perceived.
The vanilla is very soft, smooth, and occasionally, musk peeks through stealthily.

The bottle is very beautiful, thick glass, curved shape, and well-crafted. The spray mist is very fine. The light pink color fits well with the scent. Femme individuelle can be used in many ways, suits every season, and impresses with long-lasting wear. Fortunately, it is not as quiet and inconspicuous as I initially thought. Initially quite robust, the fragrance soon merges with the wearer and emphasizes femininity in a more modest than overtly feminine way. I still give it 80%, as the spicy and fruity freshness lifts the mood and prepares well for the upcoming workday. Additionally, I am convinced by its good longevity.

Many thanks to Springflower for sending it."
Femme Individuelle,10/24/2012,Gaukeleya,F,109,,18,In Stillness Lies Strength,"My chronic curiosity is directed towards quiet scents. Underestimated fragrances. Disparaged perfumes. Well, Femme Individuelle is certainly not disparaged, although it might be somewhat smiled at for its quiet presence that is said to characterize it here. The wonderful comment from Michelangela piqued my curiosity; it was clear: quiet, discreet, fine, hardly anyone owns this scent, I see no advertising, zero hype, affordable price -- this has to be tried!

The opening is already a surprise. Strong-fruity, slightly sweet, and definitely a bit fiery, the scent bursts onto my skin. Wow! Well, that's not so quiet and discreet after all. And another surprise: the wicked, wicked currants, which always stick their sour tongues out at my skin, are here flattering and warm-fruity. Goodness!

The transition to the heart is incredibly smooth and flowing, the change so discreet and gradual that I am equally amazed. The rose -- even rose is not necessarily my close friend -- is juicy, warm, non-musty, and almost sensual. The lotus holds it back a bit and brings a touch of freshness, otherwise, Ms. Rose would be unstoppable and would fully display the feminine sensuality attributed to her. The impression lasts a long time. A very long time. How can a scent that is said to have a certain inconspicuousness last so long and well? I'm amazed once again.

After many hours, the scent impression shifts just as skillfully as in the transition from top to heart towards a warm, sensual base. I can clearly smell the patchouli, fine and non-musty as well, and it holds the scent on the skin with its tried-and-true base companions like Pattex. And this is meant positively: after 13 hours, I can still smell the fragrance well! Parfumo has long since automatically logged Femme Individuelle out in the column ""Gaukeleya is wearing today ...."", yet it is still there; my nose won't be led around by it.

Well. The surprise purchase (I ordered blindly once again) turned out to be a successful surprise. The calm, the warmth, the elegant sensuality, the astonishing depth, and the long-lasting nature make this scent a true unexpected win for me."
Femme Individuelle,09/16/2011,Baeumchen,F,160,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Delicate Elegance,"Michelangela has described this fragrance very aptly, and I agree.

This scent is beautifully delicate, lightly powdery, fresh, slightly woody, elegant, floral, lightly spicy (pepper), and slightly fruity (currant)... and it reminds me of my favorite from Chopard: Brilliant Wish (a bit stronger).
With Femme Individuelle, you are well-equipped for any situation, and it contains everything I like. The delicate color in the fragrance also gives Femme Individuelle femininity and tenderness!
On cold days (ice, frost, and snow...), this beautiful scent would be too light for me!
It smells lovely and soapy on my skin: well-groomed!"
Homme Exceptionnel,06/13/2015,ColinM,M,516,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Solid for the price,"L’Homme Exceptionnel by Montblanc is nothing exceptional, but it’s really nice in the less exciting meaning ever. It is basically a pedantic but perfectly enjoyable cedar-amber scent infused with a sweet-zesty orange head note, and some synthetic patchouli to give a hint of “dark class”. Nothing more and nothing less than you can imagine; it’s woody, aromatic, slightly sweet, warm and inoffensive, but crisp and discreet. Simple, inexpensive and effective like an Ikea table.

Homme Exceptionnel,03/08/2013,Miaw2,M,339,,2,Soft and great!,"Smells wonderful from the opening to dry down.

Very masculine and classic chocolate/cofee smell, but aint sugary or extremely sweet.

Homme Exceptionnel,10/26/2012,Oloroso,M,20,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Exceptional Man or Ordinary Man?,"Am I an exceptional man? Should I even buy this fragrance? Does it suit me? Well, since I never really ask myself such questions, I just went for it. Homme Exceptionnel > Add to cart > Click …

Homme Exceptionnel was a blind purchase. This truly promising fragrance pyramid with many of my favorite accords and a rating of 82% at the time of purchase looked very promising and raised my expectations high. A beautifully designed bottle and a pleasant color scheme that radiated a touch of elegance and luxury did the final convincing work.

When the fragrance finally arrived, I of course had to test it right away. Well, at first I was speechless, but not out of joy, rather out of disappointment. The scent was bland and ordinary.

However, I must admit that the fragrance also poses challenges for me, as it confuses me. The fragrance pyramid had little informational value for me after the test, and upon further inspection, my forehead furrowed deeply. Not much fit together here.

Therefore, I looked up the notes on Montblanc's website, where Sichuan pepper, lavender, coffee, and patchouli are listed as the main ingredients. These largely align with my perception and thus make sense.

The opening lasts only a few seconds and is led by mandarin. In the top note, I smell artificial, floral fruitiness, which reminds me of one or another Avon fragrance. What is the olfactory equivalent of Déjà-vu? Déjà-senti? :))

Does this artificial, floral fruitiness come from the lavender? I've never smelled it like this before. It seems very distorted to me here and thus strange, almost unfamiliar. Shortly after, the pepper kicks in, leading and dominating the fragrance for a brief moment, but only for a very short time.

In my eyes, the fragrance is poorly composed and not harmoniously coordinated, as the lavender persists, but the other notes gradually fade away. I can hardly perceive the heart note at all; it seems to be simply skipped, as amber and patchouli already become noticeable. The dry down brings no further changes, and the fragrance gradually fades away. By the way, I cannot perceive coffee at all throughout the entire progression.

It is a rapid, short, and in my eyes very unspectacular progression. The longevity and sillage are also to be rated as very low or weak. Where would this come from if there is no heart note?

It leaves the impression of an Ordinary Man in a fine suit. The fraud isn't always recognizable at first glance, but his cheap scent gives him away nonetheless."
Homme Exceptionnel,07/26/2013,Undo,M,39,,3,"Everything, but not boring","I am somewhat surprised by what my predecessor has written about this fragrance. Fortunately, everyone perceives scents differently, and that's a good thing so that everyone can form their own opinion.

In one aspect, I agree with Oloroso, albeit only partially; the coffee present in the top note is indeed there, but in my opinion, it is less intense and fades away after about 20 minutes. Here, the coffee could have been a bit more intense, but this does not negatively affect the fragrance progression.

As is often the case, citrus notes are found in the top note, here more like an unripe orange peel combined with a hint of coffee, as the amber takes the lead role, thus overshadowing the waning coffee. The interplay of amber and ginger, which comes across as less sharp here, accompanies the wearer for several hours (7-8) without being negative.

As I mentioned before, everyone has a different opinion, but I can report nothing bad. Sillage, longevity, and the fragrance itself are successful, even if the sillage is rather in the middle range; the other points score higher.

Recommendation: Those looking for something spicy and woody with intense amber should add this fragrance to their collection. Its strength lies in amber and ginger, and that’s when this MontBlanc becomes very sniffable."
Homme Exceptionnel,12/16/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,,0,Extraordinary Boredom?!,"I would have thought MontBlanc would have more men's perfumes by now and maybe Homme Exceptionnel would be a flanker of a regular Homme. But not at all, there is no simple MontBlanc Homme and aside from Presence Cool and Starwalker, I have now tested everything. From grand (Individuel) to underestimated (Presence) to a lame copy (Legend), everything is included. So today I offered the extraordinary Homme to my wrist - and unfortunately, it was quite disappointing. Almost no wonder, because a truly extraordinary man shouldn't have to show this in the title/name.

The scent is definitely woody and spicy, reminding me of a mix between Abyan PH and New Harleem. But despite the similarity to NH, there is only minimal coffee detectable in Exceptionnel. Rather, the lavender is similarly rough and twisted. This is perhaps the only good and special thing about this orange liquid. Then there is dry wood, also rough, and a fruity-cool sweetness. Maybe a mandarin-mint combo. But for me, it’s a woody scent, more for followers than for thinkers.

Bottle: here MontBlanc is actually clearly structured, smooth, matte, metallic, and clear. But the bottle also comes off as quite cheap and yawning.
Sillage: somewhere between skin and office scent.
Longevity: okay 7-8 hours.

Everything but extraordinary, despite the heavily woody and distorted lavender. One would rather look at the other MontBlanc men's perfumes, especially Individuel."
Starwalker Extreme,04/21/2025,WildWilly,M,6,,3,Very underrated..,"Another fantastic fragrance from Montblanc. I have owned the original Starwalker for quite some time, in fact it’s probably one of my best ever blind buys. I can say the Extreme is nothing like the original but I cant blame Montblanc for wanting to use such a stellar name like “Starwalker” for another one of their fragrances. Starwalker Extreme to me smells a lot like the original Coach for men with a tiny bit of Chanel’s Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme in the background. I am not mad at it one bit, this is an extremely good fragrance in my opinion and the notes all blend together extremely well creating a slightly sweet fruity creamy fragrance. The performance is also fairly decent. I have a feeling the bottles that are left of this are slowly dwindling down and this one will be quite hard to find eventually. I am very happy to own it as well as a back up bottle."
Starwalker Extreme,12/16/2024,Napasonoma,M,31,,1,All around freshie,"Starwalker extreme is not like the original, but…..this could be a colder version for the cooler months of the year. It will also work fine for the summer too. For me I like this flanker much better than to OG. It also has decent sillage and last 6+ hours on my skin. Try b4 you buy but I have a love for this one and as you can see there is not much out there so you will be unique!"
Star Oud,08/12/2025,Shemsmeller,M,206,,1,Star black afgano,"Tested today at the Montblanc boutique, I discovered through the Parfumo website that they recently opened a private collection.

Having seen few reviews of this collection on the site, I decided to be the community's guinea pig.

My first test is Star Oud, so nothing new; it's a warm, powdery, sweet, and incensed fragrance.

To put it simply, it's a similar result with less performance than Black Afgano, so it's classic and disappointing with the opening, which lasts a good three hours.

After that, the fragrance fades and has some facets of the discontinued Dior Mitzah.

Really interesting. The leather in the collection caught my olfactory attention the most."
Star Oud,07/21/2025,Pseikomaniac,M,1,,3,Duty Freeseidank,"I have seen this fragrance multiple times online; the bottle and brand caught my attention, but I never found it in the wild. I am generally a big fan of Montblanc and think the brand has potential.

After a trip, I finally found the fragrance in Duty Free. I immediately sprayed it on a test strip and was initially disappointed in the Duty Free cloud, as not much came through. However, to give the fragrance a second chance, I applied two sprays on my wrist, what a relief! On the skin, suddenly there was a mega sillage; I could only smell this fragrance. Yes, it is not overly complex, the oud is very pleasant, but overall it is an ultra-rounded scent and extremely well-suited even for less experienced noses.
After a 16-hour return trip, 2 showers, and countless hand washes, the fragrance, although faint, was still there! Even well over 18 hours+, the scent was still present. That was also the decisive point for me to place my order.

The fragrance itself is relatively generic, ambery, vanillic, oudy. Very pleasant, soft. A good choice for beginners or a high-quality, rather unexciting scent that should appeal to almost everyone. For me, however, it ranks very high in evaluation because it is simply a very, very rounded product."
Femme Individuelle Special Edition Soul & Senses,07/28/2019,Maris,F,110,,3,friendly pleasant companion,"Fresh, fruity, a bit floral, creamy-powdery, pleasantly friendly without being too sweet, light sillage, suitable for any occasion, at the office or in leisure time, in summer or winter. I would classify it as more feminine, but I believe it can also be worn by men. It truly is a go-to fragrance, and I mean that as a compliment. I cannot understand the negative reviews here. It is good. And for those looking for something friendly and clean without smelling like laundry detergent, this is the right scent to find."
Legend Special Edition 2012,01/12/2017,GabrielCupim,M,24,,2,Fresh Citrus Lover,"Amazing scent, but not so great performance.
Expected more from a Montblanc.

Still, great for quick dates or anything that won't take too long!
I'm loving it anyway : )"
Legend Special Edition 2012,05/29/2013,BackToBlack,M,112,,12,Stylish and Unique,"After being so overwhelmed yesterday by a women's fragrance from Montblanc, I had to try a men's perfume as well. Montblanc. I've heard of it, but never tried it. I do not regret it. The women's perfume was one of the best I've experienced, and I would also place this men's fragrance in the upper class, even though the scent is not too expensive.

I was briefly in the office today and brought both the men's and women's perfumes. The women's perfume I will gift, but I don't know to whom. It should definitely make me happy, and it's something special when a scent captivates me like that. So it has to be worn by someone who means a lot to me.

As for the men's scent, I can say one thing: it is neither arrogant nor too strong. It elegantly underscores masculinity without scratching with a three-day beard. It is not shrill, hard-hitting, or dominant - it is fluid, elegant, and truly good-natured in its character. The opening begins fresh. Mint - a good white wine with fresh mint, bubbling as if a volcano is about to erupt. It rushes through my thoughts, and the mint sways with ginger towards the climax. They harmonize perfectly with each other without overshadowing one another. The ginger scent is very unique. Slightly herbaceous, but very, very interesting and quirky. After the top note recedes a bit, a pleasant scent of young jasmine and unripe roses emerges. The floral scent is by no means sweet, but rather restrained and blends with the freshness of the mint. After the mint completely fades, the scent becomes heavier and more muted. The jasmine unfolds. The jasmine blossom is truly magnificent and intense. The scent feels mystical to me. As if one could see the unfolding of the blossom right in front of them when smelling at the wrist. Once the jasmine has unfolded, it is surrounded by woody scents that make everything appear a bit heavier, and the amber is a fantastic combination with the entire opening. It becomes muted and cool as the scent enters its final phase. A hint of mustiness can be detected, overshadowed by damp rose petals that are stirred by a smoky wind.

A skillfully crafted floral scent for men? Yes, it is! Not a sweet floral factory, but an opening of quality, from a dark but also a bright side. The jasmine is divine and presents itself justly. The fragrance pyramid is very successful. It is well coordinated.

The price is great, and the bottle has a beautiful color. Dark blue - exuberance, satisfaction, and inner peace. This dark blue brings to mind the ocean, the cool water - that makes my skin vibrate when I dive in. It takes my breath away because it is so cold. But inside I am warm, and I show determination.

I am deeply immersed in myself, surrounded by the scent - yes, it harmonizes with my inner self. It will have a very special place with me.

The scent is stylish and quirky. It has its own character and a unique floral personality. This time, it's also something for men.

The longevity is not particularly enormous, but I do not hesitate to reapply. You can really douse yourself with it. Sometimes more is truly good and not too much of a good thing. I like it :)

Gentlemen, dare to wear flowers; it doesn't always have to result in a floral bouquet when wearing a floral scent!"
Femme de Montblanc,06/20/2025,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,Nice to finally meet you!,"I suppose there is something wrong. Either it is my nose that has stopped working - or my Femme De Mont Blanc has stopped working. Before I met it.
I bought it second hand on the internet. First time I sprayed I had to check closely to my wrist. I sniffed several times but only a weak whiff of something sweet got to my nostrils. Second time I sprayed I succeded in getting the cinnamon note combined with a citric note that could be pineapple. The fragrance disappeared very quickly. This morning I decided to try again.
I sense the spices. Cinnamon and cardamom after the sour first impression has gone. I admit that I am not fan of pineapple but usually I love bergamot. With this scent I am relieved when the citric notes fade. The two spices work well together. Then comes the flowers, sweetening the scent, mixing with the spices. And the scent warms up and becomes the true FdMB. Suddenly I understand the intentions and I start to appreciate smelling it. Quite long lasting it takes a while to get to the base. Unfortunately for me, I do not get the chocolate note but I do get sweet raspberry, musk and patchouli. Amazing. And it comes in a lovely bottle, too.
Go meet FdMB - When I finally met her it was a good experience. I would like to meet her sister, Femme de Mont Blanc EdP.

Signature Elixir,11/09/2025,Iila80,F,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,19,A Bewitching Jewel,"Fate brought us together. In search of a new winter fragrance, I stumbled upon you. The first thing that caught my eye was your beautiful bottle, but the scent that emerged from it is unmatched. I've never smelled anything like it before. You are fresh and at the same time sweet. I can't quite place your fragrance pyramid, but I recognize vanilla and something resinous and woody.
Montblanc has created something unique with you, a warm, sensual, enveloping cuddle blanket, so sexy and seductive yet at the same time clean and elegant. These contrasts make you incredible; I can't get enough of you in my nose.

You will shine the most in the cool season, but unfortunately, your longevity is a bit weak for me; I don't smell you on me for very long. Still, I am already captivated by you."
Starwalker,07/12/2023,Salahharake,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,A trip down memory lane.,"You know how sometimes a fragrance has this incredible power to evoke vivid memories and transport you back to specific moments in your life? In a way it's like a time machine for the senses! Whenever I catch a whiff of Starwalker, it instantly brings back thoughts, feelings, and memories associated with my uncle & for this fragrance, I'm forever grateful."
Individuel Tonic,09/14/2025,MiBo,M,46,,1,Surprising everyday discovery - here's to an Individual Tonic!,"The first impression is distinctly alcoholic, but after a few moments,
a spicy, aromatic, herbal scent unfolds with a slight freshness that tingles mintily in the nose - well, if that isn't a tonic!

Both floral notes - perhaps most like a spicy geranium - and slightly fruity components occasionally peek through.
Initially subtle, something creamy like sandalwood, amber, and musk soon becomes noticeable. This creaminess gradually becomes more pronounced, without becoming sweet or heavy. As a result, the scent becomes a bit warmer, while the spicy-aromatic freshness remains, albeit diminishing over hours.
A hint of coconut lends the fragrance a slightly summery quality. However, it could also be suitable for other seasons, which still needs to be tested.

Even after 10 hours, the scent - apply sufficiently, as it is not overwhelming - is still distinctly perceptible close to the skin - a still fresh, almost clean scent in the direction of 'Your skin but better'.
A surprising, lasting, beautiful everyday discovery that seems to be discontinued, as the fragrance is unfortunately no longer found on Montblanc's website.

The wide yet thin bottle appears modern and elegant with a beautiful dark green glass.
The rather heavy cap features - as usual - the star-shaped Montblanc emblem, which is stylized to represent the summit of Mont Blanc with its six valleys."
Individuel Tonic,11/22/2024,MrWillson,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Interesting Flanker,"I have to say that I really like the original Montblanc Individuel, but I find this one really good! At some point, I came across this one…. from the ingredient list, it’s not far from the original, and for about €22, it’s worth a blind buy. To get straight to the point, the blind buy was worth it, but it doesn’t resemble the original! I don’t pick up the raspberry note here. Without focusing on the ingredients, I smell a fresh, slightly green grapefruit/musk scent, with a hint of amber, maybe in the background a touch of coconut! For me, it’s definitely worth the purchase, and for the upcoming spring, it’s a light companion!"
Legend Special Edition 2014,04/19/2018,ToneScents,M,2,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,An underrated offering,"My first ever review. Here it goes!

This is quite a pleasant scent. Nothing ground-breaking or Earth-shattering, but still nice. There is this open, airy, aromatic quality to it, but still has a little bit of a backbone to it, thanks to the woods and cardamom. This opens up nicely with lime/green-citrus and mint. Not too sharp or bitter off my skin at all. I'm positive the note list on Fragrantica is incomplete, because there must be lavender in this, and it makes itself known pretty quickly when the green-citrus dies down a little (after ~10 minutes). The ingredients seem well blended for the price point (can be found for $40-$50 AUD if you look for it), and you'll have a hard time offending people with this scent.

Longevity and projection seems to be a little fleeting. I can smell this for about 3, maybe 4 hours at best, however I have received compliments after the 5 hour mark, using two sprays on the neck, and one on each wrist.

The compliment factor for me is surprisingly good with this fragrance. I usually don't get a lot of unsolicited compliments from either strangers, or people I know in general. However, this fragrance has gotten me compliments from women whom I don't know around my workplace, ranging in age from 20's to 40's (I'm 23 myself).

I don't think this fragrance shares a lot of the typical ""Legend"" DNA at all. Having said this, I'm yet to get my nose on the original Legend, but own Legend Intense and Legend Spirit, and whilst those two fragrances share some similarities to an extent, Special Edition 2014, seems to be a black sheep, so to speak.

Perhaps best suited for Spring, hot Summer nights or warmer Autumn weather, this is my favourite fragrance from the Legend series."
