Eros Flame,04/08/2011,Behaviour,M,20,,1,Coney Island for the Small Wallet,"for me this is the budget version of my beloved Bond9 Coney Island - let's say it smells similar, but of course it doesn't last nearly as long.
Citrusy-Gourmand - for the price, it's definitely good!
It definitely lasts from the gym back home and no less long than Maitre Bahiana."
Eros,05/17/2015,Meggi,M,1018,HELPFUL REVIEW,32,Revenge,"She lay completely still. It was almost dark; only a single oil lamp cast its feeble glow through the room. She was cold, even though it was a very warm evening. The women had just left, and a half-dozen mutilated servants had carried the large tub away. In the air and on her skin lingered a slightly soapy scent of roses and saffron, which could have been delightful. Her body had been thoroughly washed, shaved, anointed, and perfumed. What a ridiculousness that she was cleaned just to be soiled again right after.

For he would come to her again today: she had only been in the palace for a few days. As long as his ardor lasted, he came every evening to his latest wife, it was said. Until he wanted the next one and discarded the previous one among the others.

Most families that received the message - rather the command - from the Sultan to give him their daughter in marriage bowed down, perhaps feeling it was an honor. But not all; and her kin, led by her mother, had not complied. A brave, strong woman who had known what awaited her daughter and had wanted to spare her such a fate. Especially since a wedding with a lover was imminent. It had done no good, but a family and this time even a fiancé had been accused of a despicable offense, and for their resistance had to pay with their lives.

It was hard to believe that as a little girl she had envied the women of the Sultan. For the lavish, days-long wedding celebrations, for example. Or when a palanquin glided through the streets as if it had floated out of a fairy tale, surrounded by an incomprehensible fragrance of rose petals and gentle spices. She had imagined being cared for by dozens of willing hands. There had been no golden cage or groping fingers in her childish thoughts.

He would have bathed as well, would be perfumed with the scent of fiery spices, which nevertheless could not conceal his true filth. He never wasted much time. He would throw off his garment, pull down her blanket, and roughly knead her breasts for a moment. Then he would push his powerful belly against her and shove her legs aside. If they did not obey immediately, clumsy hands would help with brute force, and he would take possession of her. Well, he would believe he was taking possession of her, as only such a man might think. But he would never possess her; her innermost self remained hers.

After each time, she had to think of her lover with tears of pain and sorrow in her eyes and of the only secret time when he had been able to come to her. As clueless as they had been, as awkward the hands of young people must have been, they had touched each other so tenderly and sensitively, so lovingly, later passionately and impetuously. She had willingly let him in - what could happen, just a few days before the wedding? It had been unexpected, a little frightening. And wonderful. Quickly, their kisses had to stifle the sounds of both.

She shuddered and pulled the thin blanket tighter around herself at the thought of what nightmare it had now become. And she could count herself lucky that the Sultan had not noticed that he was by no means the first. The days and nights since the pompous wedding had passed like behind a veil of dull horror. But the day before yesterday morning, she had woken up with a completely clear mind and had known what to do.

After a short time above her, he would start grunting like one of the wild boars from the forests. The smell of his sweat would invade her nose. And although it would be the mild, fresh scent of an outwardly clean body, she would feel covered in animalistic stench when the little streams sprang from his sides and his heated belly and laid a slippery film over her body. Then, all of a sudden, it would be over. Almost.

She had thought everything through carefully. With two fingers of her right hand, she would feel for the right ribs beneath the leathery bulges on his back. Yesterday she had tried it; with some pressure, it worked. He would take her firm grip for the excitement that the other women had advised her to feign, and would grin foolishly and self-satisfied. He truly believed he was providing pleasure! As soon as he lay exhausted on her, she could take the stolen knife from the kitchen - it was already under the pillow - and stab it through his heart from behind her fingers. And when she had rolled him off her, it would graciously take her own life as well.

The door opened, and a beam of light fell into the room. A moment later, a shapeless silhouette darkened the light."
Eros,05/05/2014,Dobbs,F,100,,23,Versatile Surprise,"Angelliese, oh Angelliese, what have you done? You lavish me with beautiful samples from Rasasi and El Nabil, and I fear I won't be able to sleep peacefully without one or the other from the collection. However, the Sultan won't keep me awake anymore, as it will be arriving at my place tomorrow. A quick decision that I surely won't regret after wearing it enthusiastically three times.

What kind of magic water is this that captivates me so? Musc Sultan starts with a surprise that you wouldn't necessarily expect given the fragrance notes listed above: a wonderfully fresh, juicy lemon opening that doesn't come across as ethereal-light like a cologne, but somehow thicker, more substantial... I don't know how to express it. This so-called ""meaty"" lemon gradually becomes sweeter, accompanied by a lovely, delicate rose that forms a very harmonious connection with the lemon. This is soon complemented by spicy-sweet saffron, which increasingly takes the lead in the fragrance journey. A very successful, balanced composition for my nose.

Only after about an hour does the namesake musk begin to emerge more prominently, initially in a well-balanced interplay with the spicy saffron, then infused with more woody notes. For a while, the musk even takes on a slightly animalistic direction until it finally develops into the musk that I love so much: warm, soft, trustworthy, sensual.

Who would have thought? A truly high-quality smelling perfume without a hint of cheap synthetic notes, an exciting, versatile fragrance development, very good longevity, strong sillage up to the rather skin-close musky finale... and all of this for under €20 for 50 ml - what more could one want?"
Versace pour Homme Oud Noir,10/07/2019,Gelis,F,328,,8,Monoi Tiaré and nothing else,"At first, I perceive floral notes. Initially, I think of carnation, but then Tiaré crystallizes: very floral, radiant, with a hint of a fruity note. A delicate fruity sweetness also dances around my nose for a brief moment. Oh dear! My usual three spritzes are way too much; I'm almost crossing the line into a headache. Vanilla pod and vanilla absolute have made my eyes shine and caused me to push away the voice from my subconscious: Monoï?! There was something, and it wasn't good...?! Coconut body oil ""Monoï Tiaré"" bought many, many years ago and used once. For me, it’s an overwhelming, radiant, all-consuming, crushing floral scent. How could I have suppressed that so much?

Additionally, I don't perceive any vanilla at all, really nothing. It remains Tiaré and nothing else. It becomes weaker over time and slowly more bearable, but that doesn't change much for me. Mostly, I am just annoyed with myself.

The poor rating is partly due to my perception of this flower, but also to the fact that I can't detect anything vanilla-like even in the drydown.

So, Monoï Tiaré enthusiasts: You will find what you’re looking for here.

Addendum: Here too, it is stated: 95% of the ingredients are of natural origin."
Eros Energy,10/13/2017,Vroni72,F,3,,4,My Fresh Favorite,"It’s an autumn day, I open the package and there it is:
a beautiful bottle, well crafted, but what I’m even more excited about is the content. I spray it on and there it is ...really beautifully fresh, amazing!
What I smell are lemon, mandarin, simply wonderful. It is very fresh but not intrusive, nothing piercing, which I don’t like. I wait... this pleasant freshness remains, what I notice later is the apple that comes in. Hours later I still smell it... a pleasant very soft freshness and a very light woody note.
I believe it has become my new favorite scent :)"
Versense,10/22/2022,Silvana262,F,42,,3,The Fascination of Light Anise Opening New Worlds,"This was a blind purchase.

It was such that my nose did not want to leave the wrist.
It’s like a high...
The fascination of opening new worlds within me and my perception...
New galaxies ...
An explosion of everything ...

The beginning starts with this wonderful raspberry with a hint of lemon in the background.
Right after that, anise combines with the creamy note, which develops very softly and almost balsamically warm.
Then the light, not overpowering vanilla with a minimal touch of warm and slightly green benzoin that also feels balsamic. And then the bright, light wood.
The entire progression of the notes is balsamic, warm, very rounded, light, and not intrusive.
Since my skin softens many sweet to extremely sweet fragrance notes and transforms many notes into a slightly bitter tone, I also did not have a carnival experience with this one!!!"

I think he was on a Dark Ride before and got quite wet there...

He slathered a load of sunscreen on his skin and laid out in the sun with a bowl of flavored candies.

He's quite nice, but I hope he doesn't stay too long."

Eros pour Femme,10/19/2022,LorenzoYann,M,36,,2,The masculine rose,"So many brands trying to market the next big thing as ""a masculine rose"" this and that.. in my very personal and humble opinion this has already been done in the past and this fragrance is one of very few of them. The first time I smelled it, so many years ago, I had a medicinal feel from it and despite having acquired it only recently it has been growing on me secretly over these years. I happened that not so long ago I tried it again in the store and I was baffled by how good was the aroma I was getting: fresh leather, still a little of that medicinal undertone and very light smoke, then it popped into my mind so clearly: this openness, this breeze is coming from a rose accord! Of course I should have noticed it earlier but back in the day I knew rose was there and it just blended in like in many woody orientals, let's call them this way. Too bad on my skin the rose shines too much, and therefore I wish to test the ""flankers"" (arabie, maroc etc..) to see if they lean even more into that perfect middle ground this is already very close to."
Eros pour Femme,03/21/2020,Minigolf,F,2512,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"Of Roses, Woods, Smoke, and Spices","Whether it smelled like this or something similar in ancient Alexandria is up for debate. However, this fragrance does have quite a bit of ""old exotic"" about it.
First and foremost, there are the spicy rose scents that play the leading role with their aroma. Surrounded by numerous ornaments of balsamic, smoky, and woody elements. And as for the ""old exotic"": La Fumeé Alexandrie largely avoids ""modern"" ingredients like aldehydes, molecular building blocks, and cashmeran or similar.
From what I know about the now seriously regarded aromatherapy, primarily natural and nature-identical fragrance substances can have a significant positive influence on body, mind, and soul. What the ""artificial"" ones can either not do at all or only to a limited extent.
It is no coincidence that rose scent is a fragrance of calmness and confidence. It has the ability, in whatever way, to ""smooth the waves"" in times of inner unrest or fear.
In combination with ""grounding"" scents like balsams and woods, this effect can be further enhanced.
And with spices like vanilla and cinnamon, gentleness and mindfulness are conveyed. So much for the aromatherapeutic applications.
Possible conclusion: Perhaps such fragrance compositions help, especially in critical times like these, to convey a bit of self-confidence, mindfulness, and comfort in a natural way. When looking at the history of perfume over several centuries (or the last approximately 100 years), it somehow stands out that during and after times of crisis, certain fragrance combinations were the most used. And in ""carefree"" times, characteristically different ones.
For me, at least, Fumee Alexandrie is a wonderful and imaginative ""soul comforter."""
Eros pour Femme,07/03/2017,Serafina,F,479,,13,A Last Rose in the October Sun,"I tested this perfume in autumn 2015 at London Heathrow Airport - it was on my way home from a business trip in the UK. From the very first moment, I was absolutely thrilled! But back then, I didn't want to just shell out over 200 pounds... But now, to my luck, there was sharing!

You all know those days: late October, sometimes even into early November with a late frost, when the sun shows its full strength one last time. Golden, warm light falls on colorful leaves and also on one or two last roses. Not a dark rose, no, a rather small, blood-red rose. That is the impression this perfume gives me. And it also reminds me with its smoky-spicy notes that soon the foggy, dreary days will come, the time for fireplace fires, mulled wine stalls, and also for Christmas baking. As a confessed autumn fan, I can find something beautiful in every phase of autumn.

A floral-smoky-woody-spicy scent that is hard to surpass in its beauty!"
Red Jeans,05/22/2025,ClaireV,F,969,,1,"Sophisticated chewy, cherrywood smoke","Oud Dhul Q is a distillation of organic, plantation-grown Thai oud wood and a batch of incense-grade Cambodi wood. In other words, a mixture of farmed and wild wood. It is very much related to Aroha Kyaku but far smokier, woodier, and darker in tone. It is also one of the most enjoyable Ensar ouds I have had the pleasure of trying, and the one I can realistically imagine owning myself one day. (Of course, it will probably have been sold out by the time I get around to buying it.)

Up top, there is a long, drawn-out smoke note, fused with aged oud wood, tobacco, and the bright saltiness of ambergris. But there is also a labdanum-style thickness and sweetness behind the opening. This smells like burned toffee mixed with liquid tar and leather. The smoke and tobacco place Oud Dhul Q in the same general arena as Aroha Kyaku, but smelled side by side, clear differences emerge. Oud Dhul Q leans towards the saline side of the flavor wheel, while Aroha Kyaku’s cherry leather makes it both sweeter and brighter. Yet, in Dhul Q, there is clearly something thick and syrupy at play behind the opening bouquet of smoke. This syrupy density is as salty-bitter as molasses, chestnut honey, or even labdanum itself.

There are no cherries or fruit in the heart, just a buttery leather smeared with tar and honey as seen through the fiery blaze of campfire smoke. The Heathcliff of pure oud oils, Dhul Q is a smoky, saturnine beauty that demonstrates that oud oil can be as complex and as ‘perfumey’ as a Chanel extrait. Its haunting umami quality makes me think of kinam wood kept in Japanese vaults, an image that persists in jumping to mind even though I have never been within five hundred kilometers of either Japan or a piece of kinam agarwood."
Red Jeans,05/15/2021,123lole321,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Black and White,"Oud Dhul Q is a typical smoky-incensy Oud that initially strongly reminds of ""Aroha Kyaku | Ensar Oud / Oriscent"" (AK).
Only this one has a deeper and darker soul.
Overall, this Oud presents itself more complexly. The ""vegetable"" side that AK has is completely absent here and is now overshadowed by the smoke and incense.

In general, the smoky components have been even more amplified and pushed to the forefront compared to AK.
It also has a slightly metallic quality, with sparkling incense flashing through from time to time. It is leathery as well.
One might think it is black leather treated with birch tar.

Nevertheless, this oil feels quite young. You can tell it was distilled only recently, as this oil still feels very ""sorted."" There is only black and white here. No brown tones, no green tones... only black and white. Black sparkling resins, black earth, and white smoke. Not the smoke of a fire, but rather a vapor of incense and other smoldering materials.

A better Aroha Kyaku! If you love smoky Ouds, then this one is a must-try.

Many thanks to Rhombus for the sample!! :)"
Eau Fraîche Extrême,03/10/2013,Miaw2,M,339,,0,Flanker fail,"In my opinion all of these Pi flankers are far away from original.

I can detect some herbals, an aquatic note and a very weak cedar base.

This one smells very synthetic and has almost no projection and lasting power.

Updated September 2014"
Eau Fraîche Extrême,06/10/2012,Kannan,M,37,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Real Summer Tropical,Amazing fragrance with good projection. The Longevity more than 5hrs. Best summer scent i like ever. Dam good catchy smell which can easily attract everyone. I get lots of compliments. Girls Love this. One must own this for sure. Fantastic job by Givenchy. I Love it.
Eau Fraîche Extrême,02/24/2013,Miner,M,32,,1,"Sun, Beach, and Coconut","Bold and different from the regular Pi Neo. Smells strongly of coconut - the only perfumes I know that evoke similar associations are Set Sail St. Barts and Fire Island. Not suitable for the office, as it is too noticeable, but excellent for the summer months.

Due to the vanilla sweetness in the dry-down, the scent lasts a long time, definitely 8-10 hours. The downside is the closure - it’s almost missing, so air always gets to the sprayer - in terms of longevity, especially for a limited edition that is no longer available, it's poorly designed."
Gianni Versace,10/10/2015,Omid2am,M,25,,2,another ch,212 nyc was my favorite fragrance when i was younger and i had two bottle of it and i bought this as a blind buy because it was from ch . but i hate this one and i gave it to some one although there is no coconut in the notes but i feel coconut milk it is fresh and longevity and sillage is very good just it is note my type... and i think it is not suitable for summer.
Gianni Versace,06/12/2017,Basti87,M,1064,,10,Unsuitable for Sports,"All fragrances from the Carolina Herrera brand are potential candidates for purchase for me. One of my absolute favorite brands. Besides the 212 line, I also love the CH line. This Sport was a spontaneous blind buy, as I found it for under 30 euros for 100ml. Even though the fragrance pyramid didn't completely convince me, I didn't have to think long and added this scent to some others in my cart.

I have owned this CH Men Sport for a few months now. The bottle is very stylish and impresses across the board. The entire CH line, including the women's line, is very elegant in terms of the bottle and really fits well with the high-quality fragrances of this line.
The first test was rather modest. Unspectacular and interchangeable. Back then, I gave this fragrance a 7.0. In the meantime, I have upgraded it to 8.5. I have worn or tested it several times, and the more often I wore it, the more interesting it became for me. There are such fragrances that you have to wear more often until you like them.
First of all, regarding the Sport addition: Despite its freshness, I find it unsuitable for sports. What characterizes sport fragrances for me is a non-intrusive and simple freshness. For that, it is clearly too spicy for me. Which fragrances one wants to wear during sports should be left to each individual and not dictated by a name. Those who have no issues with spice while exercising can certainly wear this well. For me, it is a good daytime fragrance like Sauvage, Bleu de Chanel, and the like.

About the scent: It starts fresh with bergamot, grapefruit, and sage. The pepper note is very present immediately after spraying. A strong but not too intrusive pepper note that fits really well with the fresh notes. The fresh sage has a slightly cucumber-like quality, which may not appeal to everyone. I really like this note as it stands out from others. Maritime notes follow and give it a nice lightness in contrast to the pepper. These maritime notes are more in the background, as the spice stands beautifully in the foreground. Over time, it becomes softer, but it retains its beautiful spiciness. It doesn't have the CH DNA at all.
The performance is also very good. The sillage is really strong with the beautiful spiciness, and the longevity is also adequate.
The creation is an acquired taste and may not appeal to everyone. It probably wasn't a bestseller, as this fragrance has been discontinued. Nevertheless, it is still well available for a small price. Those looking for a fresh-spicy scent might find it here. For the price, I can really recommend it."
Gianni Versace,11/17/2016,Schule,M,28,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Freshly Showered and Quickly Prepared Gazpacho and Vegetable Stew,"This scent doesn't seem to be particularly well-received here, yet I want to defend it.

As a fan of Herrera for men, I naturally explored the rest of the label, although nothing could compare to the original.

212 is too poppy, Chic a bit sweet, CH Men and Men Privé too overwhelming…

Therefore, the statements suggesting that CH Men Sport dances a bit outside of the CH Men line and actually has little to do with it caught my interest.

Peppery notes were mentioned, as well as the association with cucumber salad… And that it is not a pure sport fragrance in the sense of being very citrusy or aquatic. Interesting enough to give it a test, especially in the hope of finding a pleasing all-rounder that offers something special and isn’t worn by everyone.

At an airport, CH Men Sport then managed to stand out in a skin test against other candidates, so I had to seize the opportunity with the currently low prices (obviously a discontinued model) and a good offer from a nice perfumer.

The bottle is solid and heavy, with a good finely distributing spray unit and is covered on one side with sturdy canvas fabric. Tactilely very nice and also somewhat retro in appearance - I quite like its design clarity. The scent is blue-purple, but it could also have a green tone, which I would have found more fitting.

So how is it? It starts relatively fresh-peppery and maintains that throughout. There isn’t a great development, which is an important criterion for many. However, I do appreciate a linear development.

Associations with pepper, cucumber, subtle hints of freshly cut vegetables like celery or fennel (or should I just say dill) and a prominent sage note emerge. Overall, this creates a salty-fresh-spicy impression for me, so thoughts of a cucumber salad with pepper are indeed not far-fetched. However, it doesn’t repel me; rather, I quite like it.
Everything is fitted in a masculine way, without resorting to overtly masculine brute notes and without the ubiquitous ""consumer-desired"" sweet rounding.

Perhaps CH Men Sport is not an artistic revelation, but I was looking for a fresh all-rounder that doesn’t polarize too much and still has its own character. One must also admit to some light shower gel associations, but more in a wellness-fresh way, just as cucumber and pepper have made their way into this segment in recent years, e.g., with Kneipp.
This doesn’t necessarily have to be a killer argument for an all-rounder; even with Sander For Men, a non-sweet, spicy all-rounder, this ""freshly showered"" comparison is often made. I see CH Men Sport in a very similar role and purpose, although its finish has a lighter, fresher spiciness rather than the strong, darker one.

As a discontinued model, for me it is a very affordable, somewhat quirky, fresh-peppery all-rounder for everyday use. Whether it will be missed when it’s gone, that remains to be seen… Just as it will be seen how people will cope with the vegetable touch…"
Gianni Versace,02/03/2016,Verbaplex,M,25,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,When Carolina Wants to Do Something for the Figure!,"Carolina Herrera, a great name, and in her younger years, the lady was also very pleasant to look at. She is now 77, but still quite lively. With her now several fragrances from different scent lines, she has made a big name for herself among insiders, but the big breakthrough has so far eluded her. Thus, she is usually found somewhere between mainstream and niche, and always good for a surprise. Her perfumes, all produced by Puig, appeal to different target groups, so she is overall very well positioned.

From the CH Men fragrance line, there is (or was) also a sporty variant, visually clearly distinguishable from the regular black one, the red/white faux leather-decorated bottle really jumps out at you. It definitely makes a lot of visual noise and makes you curious whether it can be as loud as it looks, and of course how far it is from the original, quite sweet CH Men.

For me personally, there is absolutely no connection between the two fragrances, apart from the similar bottle. The scent starts directly and with full force, bergamot and grapefruit give a rather short guest appearance, at least here you can sense a bit of the sport, then the heart note comes in mercilessly. The marine notes provide a cool, fresh bed for the pepper. The Sichuan pepper really hits hard, and with such enormous pepper notes, I always struggle a bit, as within a very short time my entire receptors are occupied and I can hardly smell anything else. Similar to the pepper note of the new Dior Sauvage, this one is too, only thankfully it doesn't have that character of pickled pepper, but is much fresher, almost cold and slightly metallic. I am still not a fan of too much pepper in perfumes, yet I have somewhat come to terms with it. Because if you ""survive"" this point, you are rewarded with a wonderful base. Vetiver and sandalwood give the previously very cold scent a slight warmth, leaving an unusual but quite interesting feeling. The longevity is fantastic; thanks to the pepper, I had a solid 8 hours of it, and it wasn't completely gone even then.

The most interesting aspect is probably the price. I got it through a sharing, but the 100ml bottle for under 30 euros is not a purchase that hurts, and for that, you get a stable, non-everyday sporty scent that stands out clearly from other representatives of the genre. Still, I find the designation ""sport"" somewhat inappropriate; purely from the feeling and nature of the scent, something more along the lines of power, energy, or something similar would fit better. Because power has been packed in here quite well, dear Carolina. If she does sports like this or has done so in the past, then hats off!"
Gianni Versace,07/26/2018,Minigolf,F,2512,,6,April-fresh without fabric softener,"There can be no talk of ""sport"" here, I agree with my predecessors on that. This ""CH/HC"" is fresh like an April breeze, which we could really use right now to make the heat a bit more bearable.
And it has a bit of a ""rack"" to it, like cotton towels that have been dried outside in the fresh air (which I really like...), WITHOUT fabric softener. In particular, the sage takes the lead here. Crushed leaves of this versatile plant blend with an Icelandic sea breeze that blows in cool and refreshing.
From a beach covered in juniper, there’s a complimentary scent greeting.
Grasses and reeds sway in the cool wind while rain clouds bring showers.
Woody-earthy aromas waft from trees and soil.
I find this EdT excellent for the warm season.
It has good longevity and its projection is (at least for me) quite intense (around 8), although a lower sillage is indicated at the top.
However, this is not intrusive, but rather pleasant to sniff this ""April freshness."""
Vanitas,03/29/2015,Avoirdupois,M,79,,0,"Not much fragrance, despite many oils... rather strange.","This is a difficult one. I don't find this perfume particularly musky at all. Nor is it strong on floral tones. OK for gents, not for ladies.

There is a mild oriental & woody aroma after a while, but this is a weak perfume and needs constant topping-up to maintain any strength at all. Disappointing, but I guess Al Haramain can't hit the bull's eye every time. The 35ml size cost less than US$6, standard bottle in the signature flip-top Al Haramain cigarette box."
Eros Parfum,11/16/2024,Merlotsupern,M,97,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Absolutely the best bottled...,"This is the very first time that I look at the ""Smell Similar"" list and I think it is 100% correct... it turns out that people are not always affected by olfactory hallucinations!

I currently own Layton, Red Tobacco and I used to have Bottled Elixir too (but I found out that I don't love patchouli bombs)... and I agree on the listed similarities.
Bottled Absolu is essentially a combination of Layton with Red Tobacco's dominant note.

I've tried it recently, and I would say that if you don't own any of the 3 frags I listed above, you could easily purchase Bottled Absolu (for a reasonable price) and make the other 3 redundant.
As I already have Layton and Red Tobacco, Bottled Absolu is not for me but it is definitely full bottle worthy.

Performance wise, I would agree with what most of the people are saying here, noting at least 3+ hours of decent arm's length projection. Given its notes, this is more of an autumn/winter fragrance which would be best used in the evening.
Usually, I steer away from blunt seasonal categorisations, but the tobacco note used here would make it suicidal if used during hotter months."
Eros Parfum,10/11/2024,Smirky,M,483,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Winner from Hugo Boss,"WOW, this is really good. Hugo Boss has a real winner here. Funny thing is, I tested Bottled Elixir around the same time I tested Sauvage Elixir. Liked the Sauvage better and bought it. Boss Absolu is so much better than the Boss Elixir, I definitely want it too.

Very nice, smooth almost creamy well blended combo of notes. Incense is there, but not overpowering. If you don't like strong incense, still test Absolu since the incense only makes up part of the whole. Very masculine fragrance. Performance is nuclear. I woke up the next day to whiffs and during my morning cardio it started to project again. This was about 20 hours after the initial sprays. I'm getting a full bottle of this baby. Test, don't blind buy."
Eros Parfum,01/25/2025,StinkSultan,M,54,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Bottled Elixir's Bigger Brother,"Seeing all the hype and all the comments saying that this is Hugo Boss' best fragrance yet made it clear that I had to get my nose on it as soon as possible. But when I finally got to smell it, I wasn't as surprised as I expected to be. I left the hype give me way too big expectations for it.

That doesn't mean that I don't like it. On the contrary, I'm seriously thinking on acquiring a full bottle. The opening comes off as quite spicy, with the warm leather and the smoky frankincense accords being indeed the most prominent. Soon enough, the patchouli gets through, and so does the myrrh which turns Boss Bottled Absolu into a delightful blend of spiciness, leather, incense, and sweetness, none really being too overpowering. There's a resinous undertone too, which adds depth to the composition. It's a beautiful blend which instantly reminded me of Boss Bottled Elixir, which also shares the patchouli and frankincense notes. Not only those, but cedarwood is also shared by the two perfumes, which pushes through once the perfume/s settles down with a dry woodiness. At this point, you can still feel the leather and frankincense, but it's all made a little bit more herbal and warm with the help of the davana note, while the cedarwood compliments it nicely by adding a certain dryness and slight woody feel (but not too strong, though). The smokiness is also slowly overpowered by the sweetness, yet it never truly leaves, maintaining a dark, sophisticated aura. For whatever reason, Boss Bottled Absolu smells slightly familiar to me, even though I haven't previously owned any Hugo Boss fragrances (apart from a few samples). And that made it a bit less unique to my nose, even though I still find it to be a very soothing and sophisticated scent, perfect for dressed-up events.

Then comes the performance, which was pretty good. After about 5-6 hours, the fragrance settled down quite close to my skin; still detectable, though. For the first two-three hours, the fragrance had very good projection; 2-3 feet. It then started to calm down substantially, tricking me that it had already become a skin scent. But after I asked some friends if they could still smell it, they said they did, and from about a feet and a half away. So I suppose I was just going nose-blind to it. So I'm very pleased with the overall performance here. 3-5 sprays seems the sweet spot.

So in summary, yes, this is one of Hugo Boss' best fragrances ever. It's warm, leathery, smoky, sophisticated, mature... the perfect wearing experience for a wedding or a professional/work event. It's borderline niche-smelling stuff, kept at bay and slightly more mass-appealing thanks to the sweetness. So after all, would I buy Boss Bottled Absolu? Maybe. This is a fragrance well-worth your time and interest, especially if you like aromatic-first fragrances with a nice dose of leather towards the ending. But do try it first; blind buying is not really an option with these kind of fragrances.

Eros Parfum,08/04/2024,Ceesie,M,132,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Love at first smell,"Right upon the first spray, this fragrance takes me on a journey. Straight back to my childhood.

Back when life was easy.
You could eat vanilla icecream without caring about your weight, or your cowmilk allergies.

When you rode a bike and the chain fell off, you’d put it back with your bare hands without caring about the grease all over your hands and clothes.

Talking about grease, I loved John Travolta and his leather jacket in that movie Grease. Boy do I love the smell of leather.. not too much.. just a whiff of that coolness.

Sorry where was I? Ah yes this new Boss Bottled. Phew it’s quite something."
Eros Parfum,08/17/2024,Denden22,M,24,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The designer version of Shaghaf Oud Azraq,"I'm usually not a fan of Boss fragrances—I generally find them to be somewhere between bland+basic and drugstore trash. But this one is the first that I actually like! Woody-balsamic, sweet, and leathery—wow! When I first sprayed it, it felt oddly familiar, and after reading other opinions, I realized: Shaghaf Oud Azraq EAU DE PARFUM !

Comparison:

- ShOA offers a wonderfully realistic honeyed sweetness, while BBA has a honey-like, balsamic-amber sweetness—I’d guess it’s fir balsam, complemented by a good dose of ethyl maltol.
- ShOA has a dry oud accord, while BBA rests on a balsamic-woody base, with a substantial dose of some superamber (Amber Xtreme?).
- The light cinnamon note in ShOA seems to have been replaced with incense in BBA.
- Leathery notes and patchouli are about equally strong in both fragrances.
- BBA has a noticeably more intense scent; however, I find that ShOA has significantly better sillage, even though the scent itself isn’t as strong. In terms of longevity, ShOA also clearly outperforms BBA.

For me, ShOA is the niche version of BBA, or rather, BBA is the designer version of ShOA. ShOA remains a 9.5/10 for me, but for a Boss fragrance, I still find BBA really good!

BBA also has a certain harsh fruity note that reminds me of Layton, especially on the Drydown."

Have to give them credit for how smell it gets, just a little spritz and you're in for a really long day. I can't get rid of it and it overpowers anything that dares to come close to it.

The alpha male fragrance."
Eros Parfum,10/02/2025,Frizzen44,F,5,,2,Took this one from my husband,"As soon as my husband had me smell the paper at the store, I knew that I would end up taking his bottle.
On my husband, this is a sad, weird, spicy - woody - boozy thing indistinguishable from several of his other colognes. His skin does something strange to patchouli.
On me, Boss Bottled Absolu is spiced caramely sweetness with smokey incense that peeks through and keeps it from being too sweet. Once it dries down, the notes meld beautifully, taking turns rising to the top and keeping me from going nose blind to it all day.
I easily get 8 hours longevity from this with 1 or 2 sprays. I don't like scents to project beyond a couple of feet and I find the projection on this one isn't crazy."
Eros Parfum,10/29/2025,Newtype777,M,21,,2,Best Designer Release of 2024,"I think the title says it all, in my humble opinion, this was by far the best designer release of 2024. Niche quality, excellent performance, decent price. This is dark brooding symphony: vanilla, frankincense incense, benzoin, leather, wood, patchouli. Some of my favorite notes are present. It opens with a dark resinous incense monotone and slowly develops into a deep leathery amber. In the dry down you, you will get a striking dark macerated patchouli leaf which emulates a dry tobacco leaf. There are shades of a few PDM favorites in there: Carlisle, Layton, Layton Exclusif and shades of Herod all come to mind.

Longevity is exceptional for a designer release, easily pushing over 12 hours on my skin, revitalized every time a gust of cold air rushes across my skin, with very strong projection and Sillage well into the 6th hour.

Due to the heavy nature of this composition, it only really works on the cold of Autumn and Summer. There are many frags in my collection that I would consider safe for date nights in the warmer months, in air conditioned spaces, I think this one would be pushing it when applied in any kind of humidity or mild weather. I would only wear this in the cold.

I tend to classify most frags as unisex, typically leaning either more masculine or feminine, but I think this one is out of the unisex camp and into masculine territory, but I could also see a certain kind of woman pulling this off.

This is honestly a masterpiece in my opinion, it's very rare to find a designer fragrance that has such strong attributes and densely composed notes. If I smelled this one without any frame of reference, I would be hard pressed at the thought of it not being a niche frags, let alone a release from a house that has mostly flown under the radar for the last two decades. I tried the Bottled Elixir recently that this is purported to be a flanker of and they are definitely similar.

This, to my nose, is a more user-friendly version of Laudano Nero, which has recently become a favorite of mine. I would say it could be a down market version of LN or an upscale version of Mauboussin Star for Men.

I would give this an 89/100
High art at a mid-range price."
Eros Parfum,06/07/2025,Costantinos,M,10,,1,Big surprise,"I was out at a fragrance store testing fragrances. Tried many boss fragrances but none was catching my attention. of course there wasn't a tester for this one so I took the decision to get a sample from a kind souk partner. I'm happy that I did because I'm thinking now to buy a flacon. At the start its a bit aggressive and overwhelming but after 5 minutes it was amazing. Spicy woody notes are ruling and there is a sweetness too but not so strong as I thought. Leather is at the background but very hard to notice. As it dry's down you get more woody notes and the leather is starting to show up but in a shy way. It is there but its so well blended that you cant notice any raw leather sense at all. a very pleasant smell and surprise for me. I'm pretty new at exploring the world of fragrances but I believe its well executed very well blended and the raw materials are amazing. Amazing quality for amazing price in my opinion, good work on this one Boss.

I hope this was helpful and if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them if I can ^^."
Eros Parfum,07/10/2025,JLovezScents,M,17,,2,Great Scent!,"I absolutely love Bottled Absolu. I’m not a big Boss anything fan till I tested this piece out. My only problem with it is that I cannot wear this all the time living in SoCal where it’s hot. Just during our short winters and occasionally at night Spring and Fall.

I have Layton and I put this up there with it! Beautiful fragrance that is complex and develops nicely."
Eros Parfum,07/14/2025,lameiraaaa,M,2,,2,"Great fragrance, I was pleasently surprised!","Fell in love with it the first time I smelled it in a store. I really like this scent, but I don't use it a lot. I think it is a fragrance for very specific occasions, more formal. Amazing performance and projection! It has a powerful and mysterious vibe to it. The incense note is very prominent, which I enjoy. Would 100% buy it again."
Eros Parfum,05/19/2025,Atlasdot,M,1,,1,Interesting but can't figure out where to wear it,"The smell itself, the opening, is harsh but that part does go away. What is left is this smooth leathery ambery sweet (smoky(?), incensey(?)) smell.

I like it, but I wish it wasn't so strong because it sticks all day, then all night, then on your clothes in the morning and you wish it was just gone. I wish the totality of this fragrance mellowed out more than it does, it lasts forever and is strong as heck. I'm probably more picky than others on longevity and would prefer a scent to be mostly all gone by bed. This is off 2-3 sprays MAX on each arm and one on the chest.

The other main thing I have, this isn't an easy grab. I'm not really sure what places I could wear this too, maybe a night out with the boys, a semi-casual work lunch, annnnnd...? date night I'd rather something less intense and more seductive, during the day I'd usually go to a more milder scent.

A quintessential person & vibe on this would be a dude wearing plaid going out for beers kinda vibe. If you are into this type of thing, the fragrance is a beast, but to me personally, a bit overhyped to my tastes as a not-quite middle aged guy."
Eros Parfum,11/03/2024,Te1973,M,9,,1,Herbstspaziergang,"Boss Bottled Absolu ist wie ein Herbstspaziergang in einem edlen Wald, wo die Luft von reifen Äpfeln und würzigen Hölzern erfüllt ist. Ein Duft, der die Wärme eines schalenden Kaminfeuers einfängt und mit Noten von Zimt und sanftem Moschus abgerundet wird. Es ist wie das Gefühl eines feinen Kaschmerschals auf der Haut—weich, aber mit Charakter. Absolu ist nicht nur ein Duft, es ist eine Einladung, in einem Moment voller Eleganz und Tiefe zu verweilen, leicht süß und doch kräftig."
Eros Parfum,08/26/2025,Tominux,M,11,,1,Surpris par cette version,"Ayant fait mes débuts avec Boss Bottled EDT, la plupart des versions arrivées derrière m'ont déçues. Mais alors la version Absolu, n'ayant aucun rapport avec le reste des versions, est un chef d'oeuvre pour l'hiver.

Ce côté élégant, un cuir très caractériel mais pas écoeurant (il s'agit d'une de mes seules références qui possède du cuir, je ne suis pas cuir à l'origine).

Un sillage extrêmement fort, faîtes attention à ne pas trop en mettre non plus (très puissant). Une tenue monstrueuse (+8h sur peau), tout ça pour dire que je passerai mon second hiver avec ce parfum pour toutes mes occasions !"
Eros Parfum,09/19/2025,Jujulalu,M,23,,1,Encore un...,"J'ai l'impression que depuis quelques années les maisons populaires ont compris l'interet commercial de sortir des parfums nichés.

On voit ainsi un dior sauvage qui se veut de base frais et vert sortir une version elixir cuirée et boisée, aux antipodes de l'idée de départ.

Je pourrais citer a-men, le male, et tous les parfums qui se déclinent à l'infini. C'est un raccourci qui je trouve porte un peu préjudice aux jus originels. Dommage.

Très bon parfum, la n'est pas la question"
Eros Parfum,11/13/2025,AlexFan123,M,3,,1,Ein wahrer Mann,"So riecht ein wahrer Mann, hat Ähnlichkeiten zum Carlisle und zum Triumph of Bacchus geht aber gewissermaßen seinen eigenen Weg, durch den Weihrauch und das Sandelholz sehr edel sehr dunkel und doch hat es etwas weiches an sich. Kann ihn nur empfehlen als alternative zum Carlisle da dieser auch gleich lange hält und natürlich wesentlich preiswerter ist."
Eros Parfum,10/20/2024,TimoJ,M,94,,27,Boss keeps getting better!,"This is a warm-spicy fragrance with a hint of sweetness, yet it has this dark aura that is so simple and pleasant to wear.

At the first spray, I thought: Is that Oud? Because it has, at least in the first 1-2 minutes on my skin, something animalistic, which quickly faded away.
And then I smell this dark leather coated with incense - warm and balsamic, as well as the myrrh in here.
It is a dark, dry, and mysterious scent, which is also contributed to by patchouli, bringing a bit of earthiness with it. The sweetness in this fragrance comes from the Davana - which seems floral and delicious.
I also get tobacco vibes here, as it is so warm and spicy. It’s not listed, but I just get those vibes from it. Otherwise, it has a rather linear scent profile, which only becomes a bit softer/woodier in the dry down.

Overall, it smells like a gloomy, spicy, ambered aura, enveloped in gentle wafts of incense, resting on light woods. This perfume definitely has the potential to pass as a niche fragrance. Longevity and sillage are good for me: 8-9 hours were really top on my skin."
Eros Parfum,12/17/2024,Ratzmann3687,M,85,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,"The best, the final boss, the ultimate challenge!","Good morning, friends of refined fragrance sports.

I had more than enough time to test the Hugo Boss Bottled Absolu, and it's not for nothing that I say he is the final boss!

Never before has the brand managed to create such a brilliant, masculine - striking, and intense scent that is even more than convincing.

It really knocked my socks off when I first wore it with 3 sprays on my neck.

This mixture of a Layton (even though the apple note is missing) and a light Red Tobacco is truly more than successful.

In the opening, you immediately get this intense, warming, and soothing sensation on the skin.

In the drydown, not much changes; the fragrance just wants to stand out positively.
The spiciness increases a bit and is pleasing

Incredibly beautiful, attractive, and sexy!

Fragrance clear 10/10
Longevity also definitely very long, hence also 10 points

Sillage is also out of this world; never has a Hugo Boss fragrance managed to project so much, also 10/10

The bottle is typical Bottled, just in a different color, but valuable.
Conclusion: The new flagship from Hugo Boss is, in my opinion, even on par with great, renowned niche fragrances and definitely does not need to hide behind them!

It can do something - and it does it really damn well!"
Eros Parfum,12/30/2024,JustinVI,M,8,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,I am shocked!,"Boss Bottled Absolu by Hugo Boss is a masterpiece. I bought it blindly and I was shocked by this wonderful fragrance composition.
I didn't expect such a leathery/woody scent cloud with an intense incense aroma. I love this perfume and it is addictive. The sillage is also absolutely amazing; you will definitely be noticed with it. Very masculine and a true surprise from the House of Boss. I can only recommend it and I am happy to have it in my collection."
Eros Parfum,07/03/2025,Basti87,M,1064,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,The Best Boss Bottled?,"Boss Bottled is an endless series. Completely milked out, a few flankers hit the market every year. Even though this series is extreme, that's the business in the designer world. It can be a bit tiring when you constantly test loveless flankers and are already slightly annoyed. However, there are also true treasures among them, which can also be said about this newer Absolu. Since I ordered a sample, I was able to test it. Even though we are currently heading towards summer and sunshine: the next autumn and winter will surely come. Moreover, such sweet-spicy fragrances always work well in the evening. Here you really get a great noble scent that shines best in the evening and can also work quite well in everyday life during autumn and winter temperatures. The listed similar fragrances really match: ""Carlisle | Parfums de Marly,"" ""Layton | Parfums de Marly,"" ""Shaghaf Oud Azraq (Eau de Parfum) | Swiss Arabian,"" and to some extent ""Red Tobacco | Mancera,"" although this Absolu is significantly softer. In short, one could say that this Absolu is a blend of Layton & Carlisle. Definitely also independent and great if you don't want to invest in those extreme niche prices.

In terms of price, this new Absolu is not as cheap as many designers. Affordable, but perhaps the price will drop when it gets older. Available in 50, 100, and 200ml. For €80 for 100ml, you can get this, which is already quite good.
The bottle is the usual Bottled, but here in a special color combination. It looks quite elegant and perfectly captures the DNA of this noble evening scent.
The scent starts off really well. It could easily pass as a niche fragrance in a blind test. Right after spraying, it reminds you of Carlisle and has a slightly soft note like Layton. A great sweet-spicy mix that smells thoroughly noble and, thanks to the high patchouli content, has some dark elements, making it a top-notch evening fragrance. This slightly fruity Davana note also smells really good and is present in the top note. Additionally, there's an extremely pleasing leather note. You don't have to be a leather fan to like this combination. The myrrh spice is very appealing and convincing. A great combination of sweet spice, leather, and also cedarwood that is present throughout the entire development. A harmonious creation with a sweet-woody dry-down. Overall, this Absolu is absolutely worth it. It smells high-quality and is already a bargain at this price.
Performance is also top-notch, lasting around 10-12 hours with really good sillage in the first hours. Even later, the scent remains very active, and you have fun with it.

Overall, a great evening fragrance that can be worn all year round, especially when the sun has already set. A wonderful sweet-spicy scent like Carlisle with a great portion of mysterious patchouli."
Eros Parfum,09/07/2025,Felix0311,M,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Bosshaft,"To keep it short: I can only recommend it.

I just bought it recently, as I was convinced by all the positive reviews and ratings everywhere, and ultimately decided to get it.
I sprayed it on during a test (around 7:00 PM) and was immediately convinced by the intense sillage. I could still strongly perceive the scent all evening until I went to bed. At some point in the middle of the night (around 4:00 AM), I woke up and immediately noticed how Boss Bottled Absolu was STILL projecting incredibly strongly from my hand.
Even the next day at 10:00 AM, I could still perceive the scent very well, even though fragrances tend not to last that long on my skin.

About the scent in general: At first, it was a bit too piercing and too sweet for me. However, this changes quickly, and in the drydown, I can't get enough of it. I like it much better then.

I was really convinced. Great scent for the upcoming winter."
Eros Parfum,12/02/2024,Emhyr,M,12,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,The absolute best Boss!,"The Elixir as the current highlight of the Boss Bottled flankers and a standout of last year, I didn't think Boss could top it - I was absolutely wrong!

The scent begins with an intense leather note, accompanied by incense - at first, it already seems animalistic. As the fragrance develops, the earthy and balsamic notes of patchouli and myrrh increasingly come to the fore, giving the scent a dark depth and complexity. This is rounded off with davana and cedarwood, which provide a warm-woody and slightly sweet base. Even though it is not listed, I can still detect a brilliant apple note that remarkably resembles that of Layton Exclusif. Dark, oriental, masculine; that was the Elixir already - but the Absolu combines all of this in an even more complex, higher quality, and brilliant way.

I see the longevity similarly to the Elixir, but here it adds even more to the projection. One of the best releases of the last few years!"
Eros Parfum,08/27/2024,MrMojo82,M,5,,13,Boss on the Right Track,"Boss Bottled was truly a fragrance worn by many in the late 90s and early 00s. I also received a small bottle as a gift and wore it from time to time. Back then, however, my passion for perfumes was not as developed as it is today. Over the years, the scent faded more and more from my consciousness, as there were many new and exciting discoveries in the world of perfumes. The fragrances from Boss eventually became less interesting and appealing.

This changed in 2023 when Boss launched the Bottled Elixir. Inspired by the Elixir hype that Dior started with Sauvage, which I really like, I had to give this scent a try, and it convinced me right away. Significantly less mainstream than the current designer lineup, it is dark, spicy, smoky, woody, and has a minimal touch of old school, similar to Sauvage Elixir. However, the original Bottled DNA was not recognizable here. Rather, it was a new, independent fragrance.

Now comes the next release from Boss with the Bottled Absolu. This continues the positive trend set by the Bottled Elixir. Again, there is no similarity to the original DNA. In terms of depth, wood, and spiciness, it goes in a very similar direction as the Elixir. However, there is a greater presence of sweetness. If I had to summarize it briefly, I would describe it as: amber-dried fruits in balsamic resin, with a spicy and smoky note and a woody base. The scent feels very well balanced. Nothing is too much or too little.

The longevity is absolutely positive. 8 - 10 hours are easily achievable. The sillage is also noticeably present in the first 2 - 3 hours, and then pulls back a bit closer to the body.

I also think I detect a slight hint of tobacco in the fragrance, but that might also be due to the combination of the notes used, as it is not listed. If I were to compare the scent, fragrances like Carlisle by Parfumes de Marley or Red Tobacco by Mancera come to mind right away. Not that it smells exactly like them, but for me, it definitely goes in the same direction as the mentioned fragrances. However, I do not perceive the listed leather.

In general, one can say that the fragrance does not do anything groundbreaking, but for a scent from the designer segment, it can really hold its own. The trend is clearly moving, as with the Elixir, towards niche and away from the designer uniformity. If the Elixir is a bit too edgy and rough for you, you might find the Absolu to be a more wearable scent that still radiates that certain something. I feel it will be better received by the masses due to the stronger sweetness than the Elixir, which I would prefer slightly over the Absolu because of its edges and very light freshness.

In conclusion, Boss has done everything right here again and, compared to many other designers, has dared to take some risks with the releases, which is a very positive development. I am definitely curious to see what comes next. Keep it up, Boss! ;)"

Eros Parfum,02/20/2025,XerxesI,M,13,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Unexpectedly often comes...,"What can I say... I was standing there... in front of the doctor's office - I was a bit bored, as I had 20 minutes until my appointment. So I quickly went into the Müller next door to sniff some perfume.

The Boss Bottled series had never been anything for me!
That's why I hadn't even had the newer flanker ""Absolu"" on my (fragrance) radar!

But then this coincidence happened, and it made me grab the (test) bottle solely because of its beautiful dark color. My nose wanted to wave it off beforehand - but I did it anyway (thankfully).

When I sprayed it on the test strip and the scent reached my olfactory bulb, I must have looked like someone who just found out that Michael Jackson is still alive.

I was immediately captivated and had to first smell the usual coffee beans. But even after that, this unbelievably good scent was still present.

This fragrance is like a spicy, leathery, smoky adventure. I did not expect something like this!
I don't know of any directly comparable perfume. Maybe it has a certain touch of PdM-Layton. But definitely no clone or anything similar. A standalone fragrance that almost leans towards niche.

However, this strong presence has to be liked. Blind buying is therefore not recommended.
But it's easy to test in any city.

H/S is also not bad! Both are above average.

Everyone in my circle has expressed themselves absolutely POSITIVELY about it!
And indeed - they thought more in the direction of niche than designer. No one suspected Boss behind it.
For example: My buddy Franky wears Boss (The Scent for Him) as his signature. He guessed Layton Exclusif.

To continue the story - I then ran excitedly to the saleswoman with the words ""Wooo where is the Boss Bottled Absolu??!"" - Immediate response: ""Unfortunately, that's no longer available!"" ""But it's ordered!""

I then walked towards the doctor's office while my disappointment was still filling me and dragged this unbelievably interesting scent behind me (I had sprayed it again just to be safe).
As I sat in the waiting room, I actually received a wink from the receptionist with the words ""great scent.""

At that exact moment, I decided ""I must get the Absolu TODAY!"".

That very evening, I drove 11 kilometers to the nearest ""large perfumery"" to buy this scent. I have not regretted it for a second.

Therefore, I would recommend the following to every fragrance enthusiast:

Definitely try it out!!!"

Eros Parfum,10/04/2024,Patrick83HC,M,22,,8,Underestimated,"The Boss Bottled Absolu is very underrated; I hardly see anyone talking about the scent. I received a sample and tested it, and I must say that I like it so much that I am considering getting it as my first Boss fragrance since I really like the Boss Bottled line. The scent starts off leathery; I find the leather note really nice, and with the incense, it becomes even more beautiful. Although I hate leather in perfumes, I find the leather here really lovely as it is not too overpowering but still present. The scent becomes more pleasant and settles down a bit.

The longevity was very good for me; it lasted all day. After about 7-8 hours, it is still there but not as strong, fading more into the background. The next day, that is today, I can still smell it, but only very faintly.

The bottle is really beautiful; I like the bottles from the Boss Bottled line, and especially with this one, the color is really nice."

But this Boss release really surprised me. It is not the ""typical"" designer fragrance, but it's also not absolute niche. But let's be honest, the boundaries often blur anyway. Whether this is due to a trained nose or whether many niche fragrances are taking a more mass-market approach is another question.

I can't help but compare ""Boss Bottled Absolu | Hugo Boss,"" at least in principle, with Dior Homme Parfum (2014) (God bless it and please forgive the crazies selling it at completely inflated prices here).
What both fragrances share in my perception is this really beautiful dark and masculine leather. While the implementation in Dior Homme Parfum (2014) was sometimes a bit more challenging and I often wondered what occasion I should actually wear the scent for, that is not the case with the Boss at all.

Here you get this deep, dark leather and also a very intense incense. Both notes can quickly become challenging because they can be very dominant.
These notes are also dominant here, and I find it remarkable how harmoniously the scent has been composed as a whole. I can't claim that I can distinctly smell Davana or cedarwood here, but they obviously manage to round the fragrance off beautifully.

I am thrilled. It's amazing what you get for your money here.
Anyone who likes leather fragrances and isn't completely averse to incense must definitely give this scent a chance."
Eros Parfum,10/10/2025,NorCal236,M,2,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Top, but definitely not blind-buy material","I really like Boss Bottled Absolu… absolutely!

With the classic Bottled DNA, Absolu has pretty much nothing to do; instead, you get a dark, intense scent that feels like it lasts forever.

The similarity to Layton doesn't quite resonate with me, as Layton tends to go in a ""fruity"" direction with the apple and lavender notes; I do see the resemblance to Carlisle more, although there the patchouli note comes through much stronger in my opinion.
To me, Absolu smells extremely well-balanced, with something reminiscent of dark chocolate and spices in the result.

When you consider that 50ml are sometimes priced at €60 at Douglas and similar stores, one might almost think about ordering Absolu just to try it. However, I would rather advise against that and suggest testing the scent first (it's available everywhere).
The intensity and the scent profile will certainly not appeal to everyone, and especially in the office, school, etc., Absolu runs the risk of becoming quite overpowering if you apply more than 3 sprays.

In conclusion: Aside from the classic EdT/EdP, it is undoubtedly my favorite in the line, but still better to test it first, then buy ;)"
Eros Parfum,04/02/2025,AlexB1986,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Not a normal designer fragrance,"This Boss is not a normal designer fragrance. The scent experience is much more complex and interesting. When I smelled it for the first time, I was immediately thrilled! From Hugo Boss? Frankincense, leather, cedarwood You get exactly that! I think this scent is simply MEGA! Wearing the fragrance, you receive a warm scent curtain in front of your nose that caresses it like..."
Eros Parfum,05/05/2025,lunala,M,11,,8,Dark Horse Layton,"I believe the thirty-second positive review of this fragrance is no surprise anymore. Nevertheless, I would like to briefly share my own two cents with a pinch of experience.

Boss Bottled Absolu is a powerhouse on every level. For me, it's a niche fragrance, packaged and sold in designer clothing. Dark, mysterious, present. Not classic designer synthetic, but pure, genuinely enjoyable fun. Although it took me about half an hour to fully get my bearings after the first spray, I now love the scent very much. Especially since the price for what is offered is more than pleasant.

I found the comparison to Layton interesting; I hadn't come across it until recently. Now that I have smelled it, I think: Yes, there is a strong similarity. Absolu is for me Layton, but with slightly less sweetness and darker. Of course, it's not a 1:1 comparison, but the basic DNA is present in both, and I find that somehow cool. I do think I would prefer Layton due to its increased versatility; however, considering the price, Absolu definitely remains the choice.

Longevity/sillage are fantastic. Almost too strong: 2 sprays, and I was approached multiple times about what a strong perfume I was wearing today. This can be good or bad depending on the situation.

Season? Cold. I'm not someone who assigns fragrances to seasons, but wearing this in the height of summer could count as public indecency.

So I love the scent, as you can surely read, and I will definitely get a second bottle as soon as mine is empty. Even if nothing from Boss has wowed you so far, you must try Absolu; it's a hidden gem. :)"
Eros Parfum,01/28/2025,ArtXScent,M,60,,5,This is a declaration of war!!!,"It is loud and clearly challenges the entire niche. And yes, it has what it takes. Finally, the designers have realized that they also need to be loud and oriental, and that's exactly how the fragrance starts. The first impression was simply: Wow, and this comes from a designer. You have pure animalic here. You have leather and incense that together remind me of the ""cow..."
Eros Parfum,01/17/2025,DopeBoi,M,19,,6,"Married to the Elixir, but having an affair with the Absolu","I really don't like incense and patchouli, not at all. But fragrance notes like these guarantee a strong presence. When I smelled the Elixir, I found it intense, reminiscent of Sauvage Elixir, I liked it, sprayed on clothes and skin, let it settle, great scent. I hesitated to buy it, why? No idea. A year goes by, Bottled Elixir is still on the list. I saw the Bottled Absolue at the local perfumery, with (in poor light) an identical bottle. Applied it and fell in love. The Elixir is sweet, somehow more charming, you like having it around. Incense mixed with leather, an absolute room-filler and it has been lasting on my jacket for 2 weeks. Again and again a hint of Bottled Absolue in my nose, simply wonderful. Absolutely recommended for those who enjoy sweet and spicy scents.

I'm sorry Elixir, but I love your little sweet brother... It's me, not you!"
Eros Parfum,03/01/2025,TheD315,M,21,,7,An absolute masterpiece!,"What can I say about this fragrance, except Wow! In my opinion, the best flanker since the discontinued Boss Bottled Intense! This fragrance is a concentrated dose of attractiveness and spice in a bottle! A very successful dark, warm scent for the colder days. Beautifully leathery, woody, and sweet. A very pleasant and almost addictive combination. With this fragrance,..."
Eros Parfum,09/25/2024,DannyR,M,7,,6,"""I'm not that kind of person, honestly!""","When I heard this sentence, or something similar, from a date during my single days, all alarm bells would ring for me, and I would internally conclude the matter. ""They all say that,"" I thought to myself. Maybe this woman really isn't that kind of person, even if her first appearance suggests otherwise.

However, I neither have the time nor the desire to be convinced otherwise. The first impression counts, after all.

I recently experienced something similar in the perfume store while searching for a new autumn or winter scent. By chance, I spotted a new flanker of Boss Bottled.

""How many are there now?"" I thought. ""Definitely 10."" I quickly checked Parfumo and could hardly believe my eyes. There are exactly 30!

Another one... nobody needs that?! Since sniffing fragrances is less time-consuming and, above all, less nerve-wracking than dating, I simply sprayed the new Boss Bottled Absolu on a paper strip. And then I was shocked.

From the very first second, I perceive a very potent, woody, sweet-spicy scent. ""This smells more niche than many niche fragrances,"" I think to myself. I have to keep smelling it and toss the other test strips away immediately so I don't get confused.

I like it more and more and it reminds me a bit of ""Red Tobacco | Mancera,"" whose DNA I truly love, although I find it not very suitable for everyday wear and a bit too playful. The Boss Bottled Absolu smells grown-up, masculine, and serious compared to Red Tobacco. Less sweet, yet the scent is clearly spicy-sweet and strongly leans towards Parfums de Marly.

I usually can't pick out the individual notes, but anyone who enjoys fragrances with a spicy incense DNA will surely find this appealing. And wow, it's really strong! Longevity and sillage are above average and justify the slightly higher price in my opinion.

""I’m not that kind of person, honestly!"" I hear the new Absolu saying among the 29 other Boss Bottled flankers. And this time, the statement is even true, because the scent is really different from its relatives and deserves its own, individual name to stand out from the crowd.

One of the best and most interesting scents for the cold season this year. Give it a chance."
Eros Parfum,01/22/2025,FloriShori,M,4,,5,Signature for Colder Days,"This is my first review and I will keep it brief. I had read a lot about Boss Bottled, watched numerous videos. And yet, when I first experienced it, I was blown away. The mix of (light) apple, cinnamon, and this perfect vanilla in the drydown is quite unusual for a designer fragrance. I never perceived the older versions of this line like this, but Boss Bottled..."
Eros Parfum,02/26/2025,DingoEurope,M,13,,6,Like Layton but darker. And cheaper.,"This Boss also has the classic Boss DNA, of course: If you really don't like it, there's no need to read further.

For those who are not averse to it, a truly interesting new touch develops from the familiar DNA. It increasingly reminds me of Layton (without being a full-fledged dupe), which smells good but is way too expensive. At the same time, it is darker, more suited for evenings than casual wear, and more autumn/winter than summer.

In my opinion, it could be a tad less sweet and/or synthetic, but many popular fragrances are too sweet or synthetic for me as well, so don't let that deter you.

Since the price is much lower compared to its original, it earns a few extra points.

The longevity was surprisingly good! I could still smell it after 12 hours!

Feel free to give it a try."
Eros Parfum,11/09/2024,Wahrvin,M,3,,4,Boss Bottled Oriental? Absolutely.,"Very good opening with a lot of oriental spice and an alcoholic base. The scent character of the very strong opening remains, only the intensity decreases to a more approachable, pleasant, muted level. At the same time, it also becomes slightly sweeter. Nevertheless, Boss Bottled Absolu remains a clear men's fragrance.

I really like this opening, both in terms of performance and pure scent. It is definitely a men's fragrance with incredible longevity. Furthermore, one clearly gets the impression of a niche perfume.
Important: You have to dare to wear this perfume, as it is not accessible to everyone's nose. But that is not what Boss Bottled Absolu wants, and that's a good thing."
Eros Parfum,07/05/2025,kevmeister,M,16,,3,Pretty Awesome,"I received a sample of Boss Bottled Absolu and tested it blind.

I approached it completely without expectations and was quite surprised.

At the top, it was super strong leather, which I really liked. However, I perceived the incense a bit as a flaw. Maybe it's just not for me. The sillage was already extreme; I didn't smell anything else at first.

In the drydown, it becomes quite close to the skin and noticeably milder. Nicely woody, very pleasant.

For the price, it's an absolute steal! I can highly recommend it."
Eros Parfum,12/06/2024,Supreks,M,2,,5,Where Does Niche Begin and Where Does Niche End,"It was one of those days when I was browsing in my favorite perfume shop, curiously searching for a new olfactory adventure. With a smile, the saleswoman handed me a small sample. “A warm scent,” she said, “Boss, but with a touch of niche.” Her words sounded like a promise that stirred a quiet excitement within me. What could that mean? A scent from Boss that “acts..."
Eros Parfum,01/17/2025,Saraujo,M,3,,7,Super Designer for Winter,"Boss Bottled Absolu is, for me, one of the best designer releases for winter in recent years. I also find the design quite nice. It's nothing incredibly daring, but the dark bottle directly conveys the fragrance direction.

The first seconds after application may seem “typically designer,” but as the scent develops a bit, it shows its true face, and this impression stayed with me from the first application.

I am a big fan of leather, but I prefer fruity leather (the master of this category is, of course, Widian London). However, Boss Bottled Absolu goes in a spicier yet still fitting direction. The scent is simply dark and masculine, but I don’t find it ""too old."" One might think that the notes target an older male audience. I’m in my early 20s and find the scent quite suitable for me!

In general, I find the notes very well balanced: The leather is supported by other notes that give it depth without falling too far in one direction. Despite its spiciness and depth, the scent does not clash - it is different, (especially in the designer sector!) stands out from the mainstream, and still receives compliments from those around.

For me, Boss Bottled Absolu is a great companion for the cold season. Anyone who doesn't have a dark, spicy winter fragrance should definitely give it a try - especially when considering the price/performance ratio. Sillage and longevity are truly in the perfect range, and you can perceive a beautiful development!"
Eros Parfum,12/14/2024,Dionysos2022,M,946,,5,In the Glyptothek in...,"... Munich on Sunday, one can admire the figures of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Outside, it is cold and foggy. In front of the sculptures, such as the Munich Kouros and Barberini Faun, which are over 2000 years old, stands a well-groomed, fit middle-aged man. He wears a fitted white turtleneck sweater and white jeans with white sneakers. If he weren't breathing, one might think he is also a sculpture. He is simply mysterious and dark.

Upon applying this fragrance, the first thing that hits the nose is a leathery smokiness with a sweet note. The patchouli adds a dark quality to the scent, while the myrrh contributes resinous, mossy accords. With the davana, fruity spicy and slightly floral notes blend in, rounded off by the woodiness of cedar. This fragrance has a strong masculine twist. The two ladies Annick Ménardo and Suzy Le Helley have created a perfume for men here that, alongside the Elixir, is a true men's scent for Hugo Boss.

The longevity and sillage are very good.

Here we have a fragrance that I see for men aged 21 and up, but it's open-ended above that. It is wearable throughout the year except on warm and hot days. It is an all-rounder that can be worn both in the office, during leisure time, or in the evening when going out, and it will definitely make an impression. I actually see it less on women, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't give it a try.

Anyone who enjoys a smoky, leathery, dark, fruity scent will find a good match here and should give it a go. When it comes to prices, one just has to look for where it can be found at a reasonable price."
Eros Parfum,03/04/2025,DrColdflame,M,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Timeless, elegant, and innovative","Boss Bottled Absolu is, for me, a completely new departure from the previous Bottled DNA and offers a more intense, modernized interpretation of the classic. The combination of fruity apple notes, spicy accords, and a warm, woody base creates an elegant, masculine result. In the top note, the scent is fresh and fruity, with dominant apple notes captured by cinnamon and bergamot. This gives the fragrance a classically warm touch. In the heart note, sharp aromas like cinnamon and nutmeg prevail, adding a slightly sweet depth to the scent. The base remains a legacy of the original Boss Bottled and is a sensual blend of sandalwood, cedar, and vanilla. Performance and longevity are outstanding... for everyday school use, it's almost too much. In my opinion, the fragrance definitely has a niche character and nothing designer-like."
Eros Parfum,05/31/2025,ComputerMaus,M,264,,5,Absolutely Awesome,"Hugo Boss has some bestsellers in its portfolio (Boss Bottled EAU DE TOILETTE, Hugo EAU DE TOILETTE, The Scent for Him EAU DE TOILETTE), but for a long time, it has been ridiculed as a label with rather mediocre fragrances. However, the men's tailor no longer wants to sit back and is determined to break into the ranks of the most esteemed designers and position itself alongside much more appreciated brands like Dior, Chanel, Tom Ford, or Louis Vuitton. And after recent successes like The Scent Magnetic for Him and ""Boss Bottled Elixir | Hugo Boss,"" which have also been praised in the community for their quality, they are on the right track.

And now ""Boss Bottled Absolu | Hugo Boss,"" to which I wanted to dedicate a review for some time.
Because when I first tried it at the well-known turquoise cosmetics store, I was more than just positively surprised. Alongside my personally favorite Hugo Boss scent, ""Boss Bottled Triumph Elixir | Hugo Boss,"" Boss Bottled Absolu is truly the greatest and best creation of the German fashion label.
Strong, old, very high-quality leather appears together with an almost overwhelming sweetness, along with incense and patchouli as a base. All of this is wonderfully blended together, so that no note completely takes over, but all directions-leathery, smoky, spicy, sweet-form a quartet with equal presence. An absolute date fragrance.
I find the Davana interesting here, which is not often used as a sweet note; usually, vanilla, tonka, or benzoin are chosen. But it has its own charm and fits beautifully between the characters of the other three.

Boss Bottled Absolu has something niche about it, yes, but still, the scent is mass-appealing enough to be successful in a broader market. From this perspective alone, it is excellently crafted.
Additionally, the performance is outstanding. The Absolu projects excellently for 2½ hours, then it pulls back but still radiates for a total of 9 hours. And the fragrance is adorned with one of the most beautiful bottles in the entire line.

Hugo Boss is on the right path. If the future creations of the label maintain the same quality, the designer will surely find itself alongside the aforementioned brands soon."
Eros Parfum,10/03/2024,NiceSmell,M,241,,5,"Good Flanker, finally a Boss again","The Boss Bottled Absolu is, after a long time, a Boss that I like. After the last creations were a bit boring for me, the Absolu convinces me again.

It starts off strong, sweet, yet with a certain extra.
In the opening, the leather hits me with well-crafted incense holding back in the background. Not too much of everything, yet noticeable.

As it develops, myrrh and patchouli are also well executed here.

And in the base notes, you find davana and cedarwood.

A scent perfect for the upcoming or current autumn. Perfect for dreary weather and winter. Too strong and heavy for me in summer.

Longevity and sillage are good.

And the bottle looks very elegant as well. It makes a statement."
Eros Parfum,02/16/2025,Kriggz,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,A Mysterious Balm,"When I opened the sample sent to me, I was immediately greeted by a spicy-warm, dry, slightly fruity note that reminded me in a certain way of a well-known tobacco perfume.

As soon as I sprayed it, a resinous, balsamic warmth enveloped me, which I would primarily attribute to myrrh. It is this very balsamic warmth that, together with the prominent incense, gives rise to an oriental, mysterious touch. Starting with a leather note, this is united by patchouli into a deep, earthy, masculine presence, which is completed by cedarwood. And then, more and more, this dry, warm fruitiness emerged, which had greeted me at the very beginning: davana.

I perceive the scent as spicy and subtly oriental. A certain animalic quality can definitely be noted. The sweetness seems pleasantly rounded to me and is more of a nice side effect of the composition rather than being in the foreground. The notes come together to form a complex, deep overall composition that certainly does not need to hide from the niche. Thus, a warm, mysterious, powerful, masculine fragrance emerges, which is particularly suitable for going out, but also for everyday wear in the cold autumn and winter air."
Eros Parfum,06/01/2025,Dufti1985,M,43,,4,Sweet Type for Cold Days,"For many years, Boss Bottled EAU DE TOILETTE was a loyal companion for me. In the meantime, I've gotten a bit older and have tried quite a few things - the flankers of the Bottled series offer enough variety to lose track, so I first got a sample of this highly praised candidate:

I can indeed understand the enthusiasm - from my perspective, aside from the classic bottle, it has little in common with the ""regular"" Bottled. Compared to its brother, it is heavier, warmer, resinous, slightly smoky, sweet-leathery, and a whole different ballgame.

I find the sweetness borderline and can understand that it might be too much for some. I enjoy warm incense and resin scents, so I really appreciate it. Longevity and sillage are really great considering the moderate price. You will definitely be noticed.

Compared to ""Red Tobacco | Mancera,"" which many consider similar, I find it less fruity, less synthetic, but more resinous and leathery.

In my view, it is made for cold days - the strong sweetness fits very well with chilly autumn and winter days."
Eros Parfum,02/09/2025,Brosef,M,14,,3,Layton Exclusif's Final Boss,"Well, I have to say: Boss Bottled Absolu is the secret winner in the duel against Layton Exclusif for me. The latter seems to be very popular in the Parfumo community, but to me, Layton Exclusif smells more like an olfactory misstep - or rather, like a trip to the toilet. Seriously, the scent reminds me of a 50-year-old leather couch that has been forgotten in the basement and smells so musty that even the spiders are complaining.

In contrast, Boss Bottled Absolu is a real surprise! It doesn’t have much in common with the original Boss Bottled, except maybe the name, but that’s a good thing. This fragrance is like a spicy, leathery, smoky adventure for the nose - intense, but not overpowering. It’s a designer perfume that doesn’t feel like 4711, but rather like something special. Thanks to the ingredients, it’s the perfect winter scent for me, ideal for special occasions - or simply for days when you want to feel like the king of the office.

In short: Layton Exclusif? No, thanks. Boss Bottled Absolu? Absolutely yes!"
Eros Parfum,02/20/2025,NightRider84,M,1,,1,Pinimenthol Cold Balm as Perfume,"I was tempted to blind order a 50 ml bottle of Boss Bottled Absolu when it was on sale for €52 at Flaconi. Given the extremely positive reviews here, I thought I couldn't go wrong with this scent. Unfortunately, I was very mistaken; this fragrance smells almost 1 to 1 like Pinimenthol Cold Balm from the pharmacy. A herbaceous, bitter-spicy blend, underpinned by a slightly menthol-like freshness.

My toenails are practically curling up, and it almost lifts me off the ground when I smell this ""fragrance."" I absolutely cannot understand the many positive reviews; for me, it is one of the most unpleasant perfumes I have ever smelled, and everyone in my circle found the scent absolutely repulsive.

You probably need to have a very specific taste to like it; I can only recommend testing it in-store beforehand. On a positive note, the sillage and longevity are both above average."
Eros Parfum,02/23/2025,Inos,M,6,,3,Never say never,"Unfortunately, I could never warm up to the Boss Bottled DNA…
Every bottle I saw, I held under my nose, and none suited my taste or took a turn that made me decide against an entry. Therefore, I never thought that (spoiler) one would eventually knock my socks off.

When I learned that a new Boss Bottled was being released, I couldn't resist.
And wow, was it worth it!

The opening surprised me right away. It is an intense, spicy start that captivated me immediately. The leather and incense notes are present from the very beginning. Compared to the earlier Boss Bottled fragrances, this one feels much more complex and masculine.

As the top notes settle, a balsamic warmth unfolds, wonderfully supported by the myrrh for me. The spiciness slowly fades away, making room for a warm, almost honey-like sweetness that comes from the Davana. The Davana is also the big player in the pyramid for me! It gives this fragrance a wonderful depth. It is not overpowering but fits perfectly into the overall very masculine composition.

This scent definitely stands out from the crowd. It feels almost like a niche fragrance. It is more intense, more complex, and for me, an absolute surprise.

What can I say, never say never."
Eros Parfum,10/01/2024,Birdsword,M,4,,4,Undercover BOSS,"""Undercover, the boss mingles with his employees to find out where problems lie and wishes remain unfulfilled.""

Do you still remember the show?
Anecdotally, this bottle tells the story of a designer house that has long made its mark on consumers.
Despite a luxury image, expensive campaigns, and well-known faces from film and television, nothing seems to help lift the brand's image. Sales are declining, and the general opinion of the brand is drifting negative.
The efforts of the management, consisting of yes-sayers and overpaid advertising technicians, are also not helping the brand get back on its feet.
The BOSS is on high alert, ready to address the problems that plague his brand. In a simple black outfit and with a discreet hidden gold chain, he immerses himself with utmost concentration into the everyday life and happenings of his company.
In the first weeks, he receives little attention, as efforts are made to involve him in the process as much as possible. He listens and observes. He sets traps here and there for those who think they can behave superficially and inattentively towards him. The resolution, with wide eyes and amazement, awaits each of you, unembellished, professional, and rewarding every good soul who has engaged with him.-

The Boss Bottled Absolu has truly been a surprise for me. For many, the elixir from last year was the first real step, but it didn't really convince me. The Absolu offers a certain overall package that simply appeals to me in the designer sector. It opens with a sweet-spicy cola, similar to the ASAD from Lattafa, and from here it radiates very strongly - the sillage remains quite stable throughout the entire duration of the fragrance, and the longevity is truly impressive. Even after 24 hours, it is still close to the skin and strong enough on clothing to casually continue wearing the scent. The fragrance then develops, alongside the smoky notes, an animalistic touch, which is very harmoniously integrated into the scent. The typical Bottled apple DNA must not be missing, as it makes the fragrance pleasant and versatile - here the comparisons with Layton and its big brother Layton Exclusif are justified, but in my eyes, this fragrance is neither a replacement nor an alternative for the Exclusif. It simply lacks the niche depth and the dark, noble oud component. Nevertheless, I would see it as the best leather fragrance from the house of BOSS. This release takes the Bottled DNA to a new level, even if it is not yet what it might truly aspire to be in the future - a unique selling point, a true BOSS of fragrances. There are simply too many references to other scents.
I have not been able to test the Shaghaf Oud Azraq yet, but it is read as a niche version of this fragrance - this alone would underline my statement here.

And now to the elephant in the room: The price.
€145 for 100 ml RRP.
Anyone who buys at these prices is simply to blame themselves.
Still, I took the plunge during the supposedly good sale, also out of fear of a too-quick reformulation. Because the H/S of the fragrance really made the purchasing decision easy for me."
Eros Parfum,06/20/2025,Fabian2710,M,13,,3,Boss Bottled Absolu - a great fragrance,"I have been testing Boss Bottled Absolu for about a year now and I can say: It is a fragrance that I don't want to miss anymore, especially in the cooler season. The first impression right after spraying it is pleasantly fresh and slightly fruity. After just a few minutes, you can feel the warmth setting in. The cinnamon comes through really well, not too sweet, but nicely..."
Eros Parfum,11/06/2025,Kmayha,M,5,,2,Beastmode in a Bottle,"That I would ever write something like this about a Boss Bottled fragrance, I never expected..

Actually, I had already written off Boss Bottled after the countless flankers (all of which have been disappointing for me so far). By chance, I stumbled upon the Absolu here on Parfumo and was intrigued by the strong reviews to give it a try. So off to the nearest drugstore and a spritz on the back of my hand. I was immediately impressed! The scent reminded me of PDM Layton, only with less freshness and more spice. Resinous/smoky, with a slight sweetness. I immediately bought a 100ml bottle and wore it for the first time at the office today. I was approached multiple times throughout the day, asking what fragrance I was wearing. Even my wife could still detect it in the evening, 10 hours after application, wow! Longevity and sillage are therefore extremely good, and that from a Boss Bottled. I never expected that…

Long story short: great scent with outstanding performance. I would already call this Beastmode quality. A clear recommendation to buy!"
Eros Parfum,10/23/2025,CBeckFFM,M,1,,1,Don't Get Too Caught Up in the Hype…,"I was led to a blind buy by various reviews and opinions and I am a bit disappointed. I find the scent itself very good and I like it, so it was definitely not a bad purchase.
However, I cannot share the assessment as Fragrance of the Year. The niche has quite a bit more to offer.

In the top notes, there is a lot of leather that quickly fades, making way for wood and incense. Simple but nice."
Eros Parfum,01/12/2025,JimmysScents,M,10,,2,Absolutely (t) Brilliant!,"Who would have thought that after the Elixir by HBB, which is quite successful, there would be another enhancement? I took my time with this statement to thoroughly test this fragrance, so I wouldn't judge too hastily and say it wasn't that great before I let myself be swayed into this review. It's astonishing that this flanker evokes such different memories in me; sometimes I think I smell a Red Tobacco, then again a bit of associations from the Bottled Elixir. I can't pin it down and say: It definitely smells like this or that… no, it's a bit of everything, and yet there's something unique about it. What makes this fragrance special for me is the Davana, the leather, and the incense in combination, which I can smell well and gives it a nice twist. I also noticed that fragrances created in collaboration with at least two or more perfumers in the industry usually receive a good reception or become a sales hit. Like in this case with Annick Ménardo and Suzy Le Helley (who admittedly doesn't have as long a list of creations as the former) but still: Just like with the HBB Elixir before, they created something beautiful together. I see this phenomenon with many other hits that have come out over the years, like the legendary AdG EDT (in which Annick Ménardo also contributed to this hit), ""La Nuit de L'Homme"" EDT, or ""Tuscan Leather,"" to name just a few, where there was a collaboration of different perfumers. There are several other well-known fragrances that are currently not coming to mind as I write this review, but they should be quite famous, so pay attention to that. Usually, a beautiful fragrance hit comes out of it that later has or finds many fans. I mean, I heard that in the past, ""parfum creators/perfumers"" positively influenced or inspired each other, which is certainly possible; I don't know if that's true or complete nonsense, whatever. Also, the newer fragrances, including the Gucci Guilty Elixir, which is admittedly quite new like HBB Elixir and the ""Absolu"" in this case, have to establish themselves first to become a hit. But these are the fragrances that are mostly positively accepted by the majority and are well-made perfumes, just like those mentioned. It's not the case with all perfumes that have actually become well-known sales hits over the years (like with Maestro François Demachy, who created many heavyweights starting from the Dior Homme range (Parfum, Intense, etc.) to the Sauvage range, which he also created alone as far as I know. And despite that, they became big hits. That doesn't mean anything. But one thing must be remembered for the future: At least I will remember this for myself, when a fragrance comes out that has been created by more than one person or was developed in collaboration: Then there is a VERY high probability that it will be good or at least a potential success or bestseller."
Eros Parfum,10/01/2024,Joein,M,7,,2,A Teenager Becomes a Man,"If Boss Bottled were a teenager, it would have become a man with the release of the Absolu. And Boss has done a lot right in its various product lines over the past years. Starting with the marketing, where they brought in a lot of prominent support (Chris Hemsworth, Emma Roberts, Jacob Elordi, for example) to truly high-quality fragrances that, especially in the Bottled product line, have now moved far beyond the old Bottled clichés.

During the first scent test, I was surprised that the Absolu and the new The Scent Elixir resemble each other a bit. However, this is only superficial. The Absolu feels even more masculine, has a lower sillage, and becomes significantly woodier and fresher over time due to the patchouli notes, while the Scent Elixir is noticeably warmer, more intense, and sweeter. Both fragrances are completely independent, but they show me that the Bottled line is taking a much more elegant approach.

I recently received a sample of the Absolu and subsequently bought a small bottle on sale, which will last me a long time since I always spray it discreetly. But the Boss Bottled Absolu will most likely become a preferred companion for my evening outings. A thoroughly successful release."
Eros Parfum,10/24/2025,7Seven,M,3,,2,Final Boss,"The fragrance opens with a distinctive leather note, enveloped in incense. Davana and cedarwood round off the composition with a warm, woody, slightly sweet base. Despite the lack of official mention, a juicy apple note flashes through, giving the fragrance a subtle freshness. Overall, it is very dark, oriental, and masculine."
Eros Parfum,07/27/2025,Albertovgt,M,2,,3,My Recommendation,"I smelled Hugo Boss Bottled the new Absolu… last year in September and was immediately blown away, the scent has something niche about it, it develops permanently on my skin, it really smells intense.

Eros Parfum,02/19/2025,AndiNick,M,31,,0,This Apple Falls Quite Far from the Tree,"My experiences with BOSS Bottled ended long before the flankers really took off. Sorry to all who like the EDT, but even as a teenager, the original Bottled was the most boring scent ever for me.

So I didn't really pay any attention to the Bottled line for a very long time. Now and then, I came across a sample of the EDP&Co. Those didn't really grab me either. Accordingly, I was quite surprised at how beautiful the Absolu turned out to be.

The scent starts with a leathery fruitiness. It smells like a sweet apple in a leather bag. The patchouli tingles a bit in the nose and gives the fragrance a certain masculinity.
When the spiciness fades, a kind of candied fruits remains with soft resins. The davana wraps the dry down in a sweet-balsamic finish.

Beautiful for the cooler days. The longevity is definitely above average. On clothing, you can still smell the fragrance easily the next day.

So I love it and I'm excited about the development of the Bottled line. Although the apple could be recognized again, the Absolu has long left boredom behind. It is a clear recommendation.

Best regards, Andi"

Strange to see them already being discounted/discontinued? since I think they just came out, but am very glad to have this in my collection! Some say similar to Santal 33, I will have to do a side-by-side test, but this frag is good enough to stand on it's own"
Yellow Diamond Intense,10/18/2017,Elysium,M,898,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Undertones of the Leathery and Smoky Notes,"I popped into the ZARA shop before dinner one late evening, I saw the newbies from Swedish Collection, and I spritzed some of the Tiveden on to test it, and for the rest of the night, I could not stop sniffing my wrist. It was masculine, and it was tad feminine, it was smoky, it was woody, it was leathery, it was shape-shifting in my nostrils, it was elegant but edgy, it was sophisticated but down-to-earth. In summary, it was love, pure love.
Now that I've smelled the smoky-powdery-leathery vibes of ZARA Tiveden, I'm addicted. I'm taking solace that, because no one in my office wears it yet, I'm still kind of a special snowflake.

For one thing, despite the Swedish name, I find this to be a predominantly leather-focused scent, with salty, green cucumbers or better pickles quality that is almost aquatic. It opens with a powerful blast of green cardamom, with its pungent yet elusive flavor, resinous and dark with hints of eucalyptus, sea salt, leather, and that aqueous herbal element. Perhaps, there is a tad of tarragon or drill in the headnotes, not listed on the official site.

What makes a fragrance intriguing is when it evokes a specific time, a certain place, or a particular material while remaining elusively vague. ZARA Tiveden is intensely masculine: full of raw, oily leather and balsam. It makes me think of a lifestyle concept store – one of those deep-toned, white empty studio spaces where they place a tangle of dried white driftwood in one corner and a long leather couch in the other. Close your eyes, breathe, and let your mind go in there.

Much later on, in the far dry down, there is the aroma of the raw and brusquely woods, and it is only then I see the reference to sandalwood. But, in general, this is dry and woody-leathery, not lactonic or sweet. The more I sniff it, the more I get the unusual smell of genuine leather exuding from a brand new handmade coat, belt, or pair of shoes.
It reminds me of books, too. In particular in the raw, harsh chemical breeze of salt, which ultimately comes off as a combination of freshly-tanned leather and newly-printed paper.

Oh man, no question about it. With superior performance to boot, this is another winning hand from the house of ZARA. Well done! Be sure to give it a chance before damning it after the first sniff – you might eventually enjoy it!

Ultimately, the smell lies on the masculine side and can be worn well in the fall. It's a warm, woodlike smell that I found surprisingly identical to the way the forest smells after it rains. It captures the scent of damp earth, ferns, creek water, cedar, and wet leather. Woodsy like the aroma of the freshly-cut wood you get in a sawmill or lumber mill, where logs are cut into lumber... Ever been to a lumber yard? It's that scent. Beautiful woods just cut. It's terrific and entirely wearable.

At this point, it's weird if someone doesn't smell like Tiveden by ZARA!!!

Update: longevity and sillage are enormous. I've been wearing it since 8.00 am, and after almost 7 hours, it is still alive and kicking, and I do love it!

Yellow Diamond Intense,01/30/2018,Serafina,F,479,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Powdered Snow,"As a woman, I am writing the first comment on this men's fragrance... so far, there have only been statements.

Apparently, this new perfume from Zara is rather controversial.

To me, it primarily comes across as fresh, especially at the beginning, even though hardly anyone seems to feel the same way. This freshness comes from the cardamom. Anyone who has ever opened a bag of the green pods (e.g., from the Asian market) knows this incomparable, almost camphor-like aroma.
Furthermore, I would have suspected iris due to a dry-powdery, slightly ""carrot-like"" note, even though it is not mentioned.
I perceive the leather note as rather subdued, although clearly detectable - here as light leather, not aged, old, spicy leather.
“Tiveden” strikes me as bright-woody, wintry, powdery-clean, but not creamy and not sweet in the slightest. It makes me think of sunshine and powdered snow - a winter walk (in ""picture-book winter weather"") or a ski slope...

Unfortunately, “Tiveden” lasts very poorly on my skin. After the lovely cardamom opening, I can soon only sense a subtle hint on my skin."
Tabac Impérial,02/27/2025,SmellyWrist,F,17,,2,Extremely odd and I love it,"I know this is marketed and discussed as a floral gourmand, but boy is this one strange for me (and in the best way, as I love strange frags). While I get an initial lilac burst in the beginning, I wouldn't describe this one as overly floral like one might expect a lilac-forward frag to be. It's floral powderiness remains present throughout, but I'm not getting the heady spring blooms that I'm seeing others describe. And I also don't get a sticky sweet gourmand from this either. The first few minutes to me read almost like a hint of lilac with a hint of something dessert like, but mostly whatever this combo is, reads to me more like something akin to dusty burnt wires. Annnd...I'm kinda digging it. I can't even explain why, but I keep coming back to this frag and its strangeness. 5-10 min in, the marzipan does come out and the fragrance turns a bit sweeter, but I definitely do not get a rich sweet gourmand or a punchy floral from this frag. There's a lot of nuance here. I haven't smelled anything like it and I'm continuously intrigued by the complexity of this one and the journey it takes me on."
Tabac Impérial,03/06/2025,Goodchat,F,1,,2,Not what I expected,"I'm confused by this one. This smells like a tobacco bomb and yet, there's no tobacco note. I happen to like tobacco notes, but I can only imagine what a diehard gourmand lover would think when they spray this after seeing notes of marzipan, tonka, whipped cream, rhubarb...

It's giving cinnamon tobacco sweetness. Very strange. I like it, but was hoping for something cool with the lilac note and didn't really get it."
Tabac Impérial,05/15/2025,WhiffandWit,F,6,,1,Marzipan cookie w/ a whisper of lilac,"I have to preface this by saying I do not prefer gourmands. I do, however, love lilac, so I really wanted to try this one.

Unfortunately, the lilac did not come through at the start. The rhubarb was very acidic on my skin, verging on sour. That acidity sat on top of the cookie accord for a long time. And when I say cookie, I mean an almond cookie with almond frosting and almonds on top. It was sweet, sweet marzipan, and that sweetness was cloying to me, personally.

The dry down became much more pleasant. The vanilla began to shine with the patchouli, and I finally felt like I could smell some of that lilac coming through.

In the end, it became a very familiar scent. Like a lotion or candle from long ago that you will never remember the name of. I do think it is a vanilla almond scent before it is a lilac scent, and for that reason, it wasn't a win for me. But it's definitely a win for someone out there!"
Tabac Impérial,03/09/2025,Alexaraes,F,8,,1,So weird but so good,"This comes dangerously close to diaper territory, but somehow manages to pull off powdery, creamy, and floral together without going full-on poopoo. It feels so clean, like I just got out of the shower, but wrapped in a big fluffy robe and also it's kinda hot outside so the robe is making me a little sweaty.
.
The mimosa and rhubarb give it a light twang to elevate the powdery aspects. Cream, vanilla, and tonka add an addictive gourmand base without making things too sweet. I think the lack of sweetness is part of the reason it's not entirely poopy pants. The notes in this one twine together so well, which gives such an interesting scent experience. Sometimes I'll get lilac as the star, sometimes tonka, sometimes rhubarb, even the cinnamon pops out every once in a while!
.
Definitely sample-worthy if you're a gourmand lover who wants something interesting for spring time, or if you, like me, are becoming more adventurous when it comes to note combinations."
Tabac Impérial,02/13/2025,LastWonder,N/A,484,,1,Edible Lilacs,"This feels like spring is here. Lilacs are blooming, the sky is clear and the day is warm while you sit on the grass amongst the flowers eating a creme brulee. This is a creative gourmand that is combines it's creaminess with green and floral notes. Almost as if your dessert is decorated with edible flowers in that they add a little something extra to the star of the show. This fragrance is really good but there was something a little off in the depths of this fragrance, a weird starch-ness to the fragrance. I hate to say it, but that starch I was picking up reminded me of opening a box of instant mash potatoes. It wasn't strong but it was noticable enough to distract me from fully enjoying this fragrance. The starch faded after a few hours but it lasted long enough that I cannot fall in love with this fragrance.

This fragrance has some floral lift for the first hour or two but mainly its a sweet skin scent. It is long lasting, over 8 hours on my skin even after I washed the area. There are two sizes and prices available starting at 9ml for $58 and 30ml for $145. Fairly pricey but if you can't detect that starchy-ness like I can, then this is definitely a unique and creative enough scent that it would be worth the price."
Yellow Jeans,05/17/2015,Meggi,M,1018,HELPFUL REVIEW,32,Revenge,"She lay completely still. It was almost dark; only a single oil lamp cast its feeble glow through the room. She was cold, even though it was a very warm evening. The women had just left, and a half-dozen mutilated servants had carried the large tub away. In the air and on her skin lingered a slightly soapy scent of roses and saffron, which could have been delightful. Her body had been thoroughly washed, shaved, anointed, and perfumed. What a ridiculousness that she was cleaned just to be soiled again right after.

For he would come to her again today: she had only been in the palace for a few days. As long as his ardor lasted, he came every evening to his latest wife, it was said. Until he wanted the next one and discarded the previous one among the others.

Most families that received the message - rather the command - from the Sultan to give him their daughter in marriage bowed down, perhaps feeling it was an honor. But not all; and her kin, led by her mother, had not complied. A brave, strong woman who had known what awaited her daughter and had wanted to spare her such a fate. Especially since a wedding with a lover was imminent. It had done no good, but a family and this time even a fiancé had been accused of a despicable offense, and for their resistance had to pay with their lives.

It was hard to believe that as a little girl she had envied the women of the Sultan. For the lavish, days-long wedding celebrations, for example. Or when a palanquin glided through the streets as if it had floated out of a fairy tale, surrounded by an incomprehensible fragrance of rose petals and gentle spices. She had imagined being cared for by dozens of willing hands. There had been no golden cage or groping fingers in her childish thoughts.

He would have bathed as well, would be perfumed with the scent of fiery spices, which nevertheless could not conceal his true filth. He never wasted much time. He would throw off his garment, pull down her blanket, and roughly knead her breasts for a moment. Then he would push his powerful belly against her and shove her legs aside. If they did not obey immediately, clumsy hands would help with brute force, and he would take possession of her. Well, he would believe he was taking possession of her, as only such a man might think. But he would never possess her; her innermost self remained hers.

After each time, she had to think of her lover with tears of pain and sorrow in her eyes and of the only secret time when he had been able to come to her. As clueless as they had been, as awkward the hands of young people must have been, they had touched each other so tenderly and sensitively, so lovingly, later passionately and impetuously. She had willingly let him in - what could happen, just a few days before the wedding? It had been unexpected, a little frightening. And wonderful. Quickly, their kisses had to stifle the sounds of both.

She shuddered and pulled the thin blanket tighter around herself at the thought of what nightmare it had now become. And she could count herself lucky that the Sultan had not noticed that he was by no means the first. The days and nights since the pompous wedding had passed like behind a veil of dull horror. But the day before yesterday morning, she had woken up with a completely clear mind and had known what to do.

After a short time above her, he would start grunting like one of the wild boars from the forests. The smell of his sweat would invade her nose. And although it would be the mild, fresh scent of an outwardly clean body, she would feel covered in animalistic stench when the little streams sprang from his sides and his heated belly and laid a slippery film over her body. Then, all of a sudden, it would be over. Almost.

She had thought everything through carefully. With two fingers of her right hand, she would feel for the right ribs beneath the leathery bulges on his back. Yesterday she had tried it; with some pressure, it worked. He would take her firm grip for the excitement that the other women had advised her to feign, and would grin foolishly and self-satisfied. He truly believed he was providing pleasure! As soon as he lay exhausted on her, she could take the stolen knife from the kitchen - it was already under the pillow - and stab it through his heart from behind her fingers. And when she had rolled him off her, it would graciously take her own life as well.

The door opened, and a beam of light fell into the room. A moment later, a shapeless silhouette darkened the light."
Yellow Jeans,05/05/2014,Dobbs,F,100,,23,Versatile Surprise,"Angelliese, oh Angelliese, what have you done? You lavish me with beautiful samples from Rasasi and El Nabil, and I fear I won't be able to sleep peacefully without one or the other from the collection. However, the Sultan won't keep me awake anymore, as it will be arriving at my place tomorrow. A quick decision that I surely won't regret after wearing it enthusiastically three times.

What kind of magic water is this that captivates me so? Musc Sultan starts with a surprise that you wouldn't necessarily expect given the fragrance notes listed above: a wonderfully fresh, juicy lemon opening that doesn't come across as ethereal-light like a cologne, but somehow thicker, more substantial... I don't know how to express it. This so-called ""meaty"" lemon gradually becomes sweeter, accompanied by a lovely, delicate rose that forms a very harmonious connection with the lemon. This is soon complemented by spicy-sweet saffron, which increasingly takes the lead in the fragrance journey. A very successful, balanced composition for my nose.

Only after about an hour does the namesake musk begin to emerge more prominently, initially in a well-balanced interplay with the spicy saffron, then infused with more woody notes. For a while, the musk even takes on a slightly animalistic direction until it finally develops into the musk that I love so much: warm, soft, trustworthy, sensual.

Who would have thought? A truly high-quality smelling perfume without a hint of cheap synthetic notes, an exciting, versatile fragrance development, very good longevity, strong sillage up to the rather skin-close musky finale... and all of this for under €20 for 50 ml - what more could one want?"
V/S,07/09/2025,Greenfan1701,F,189,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,Fragrance jewel par excellence,"Sensual, extraordinary, dense, elegant, refined, in one word CARON.

This little treasure has unfortunately been languishing in my cabinet until now, and today was such a strange, actually funny, dark, dull afternoon/evening that I decided to revisit my fine samples that I wasn't ready to test yet.

Now I have done it and am very surprised, at the same time relieved but also ashamed that I waited so long that I no longer know who gave me this wonderful fragrance. I also don't know if it is the pure perfume, but I assume it is, as it has been hovering around me for so long, smelling, smelling, smelling, simply brilliantly beautiful.

It is floral, balsamic, yellow-powdery, spicy, resinous, but it is also the true French elegance, everything you can imagine is here, and I am unable to pick out anything specific. I only know one thing, it is dreamy, a jewel of the art of fragrance, and it has completely captivated me.

Dear Iris, I strongly suspect that it comes from your treasure chamber, which you always so kindly open for us and in your lovely way also let others partake in, so I thank you from the bottom of my heart for that and already regret it when the AF will someday (I fear in not too distant a future) be emptied."
White Jeans,06/29/2023,Pimm,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Natural Mediterranean Citrus Cologne Anno 1819,"A lot of lemon and clove oil, is my impression. These materials are also mentioned by the label, along with rosemary. I think I can also smell orange oil. So quite culinary, which is why it doesn’t remind me of cleaning products, and I don’t perceive any bitter orange oils, making it not similar enough to 4711 to seem outdated. The combination of citrus oils with kitchen herbs seems to never have gone out of style. The top note of the Saint Helena Cologne is zesty, cheerful, and delicious. However, the essential oils are so volatile that the scent - on skin as well as on clothing - can only be perceived from close proximity after just a few minutes, and after an hour, hardly even that. This heart/base phase smells not only sour and spicy but also oily, perhaps due to the rosemary.

Regarding the historical background, the information on napoleon-cologne.fr is a bit confusing for me; I have laid out the following sequence: Napoleon arrived in his exile on Saint Helena in 1815 and used a Cologne imported from Europe, though it is unknown which one. In 1819, there was a supply gap - unclear why - and Napoleon's entourage, specifically his chamberlain and librarian Louis-Étienne Saint-Denis (known as Mamelouk Ali), created a Cologne on Saint Helena that was supposed to resemble the one imported until then. In the English text (usa.napoleon-cologne.com), it sounds as if local plants were used:

“Mameluke Ali pieced together the Eau de Cologne in a traditional way according to the local resources available on the island. Nearby, he mainly had access to citrus trees from which he extracted and collected the essences contained in the fruit peel, using compression with a natural sponge. He also harvested rosemary and cloves, which he distilled to extract their essence. These oils and some others were then mixed with wine spirit in good proportions.”

For practical reasons, I suspect that imported supplies of fruits and spices were used - the French text leaves this possibility open, as it speaks of “des citrus” instead of “citrus trees” and uses the more general “récolter” instead of “harvest.” It would be interesting to know, at least for me, which oils besides the explicitly mentioned ones were used. In any case, probably no special perfume ingredients like bergamot oil. The improvised distillation of any flower oils also seems unlikely to me. More conceivable are other herbs, perhaps in small quantities and therefore not easily identifiable by scent, which could also explain the Farnesol in the allergen list. The citrus fruits were probably simply lemons and oranges.

Napoleon died in 1821, so the Saint Helena Cologne was in use for a maximum of two years. The text mentions a temporary shortage (“disette momentanée,” “disette qui régnait à certains moments”) - so it is conceivable that even only a single batch was produced. The recipe eventually reached Jean Kerléo, co-founder of the Osmothèque in Versailles, from the estate of Saint-Denis, no earlier than 1991. What exact contribution he made is unclear to me. He must have interpreted the information on materials and quantities, and perhaps he also thought about the growing areas and extraction methods of that time. Soon after, marketing began as an olfactory reminiscence of Napoleon, possibly already in the square bottle that is currently shown in the Parfumo photo. “Les parfums historiques” assures, citing the Osmothèque, that the formula corresponds to the original and is “100% natural”; however, no information is provided regarding geographical origin and processing.

The cylindrical bottle advertised on napoleon-cologne.fr has apparently been available since 2020. The formula must have remained the same, but the price per milliliter has increased. The old bottle is still available in some French online shops, which is how I got my current 100-ml bottle in 2021 (for €54 with free shipping). A 25-ml size seems to have recently been added.

These are not prices at which one can spray oneself all over every hour with a clear conscience to survive hot weekends. For this purpose, one would also need to find more refreshing scents, perhaps more with bergamot or bitter orange and fresher spices. Well, spraying once to put oneself in the mindset of the exiled emperor is certainly justifiable. Otherwise, for me, it is a scent that one enjoys a little, briefly, from time to time. However, citrus oils are said not to last too long even in the -opened- bottle. As I understand it, these oils in modern perfumes are usually concentrated and thus more durable; in comparison, this historical Cologne could therefore age particularly quickly. On the skin, however, even modern fixatives seem not to make the most beautiful citrus aromas significantly longer-lasting. Since the suspected ingredients are all easily available as pure essential oils, a diffuser could be a cost-effective alternative with a longer duration of effect; I have no experience with that.

Personal background (for particularly leisurely readers): My parents brought back a bottle as a souvenir from France, probably in the late 90s, possibly with thoughts of our house cat Napoleon. In any case, the still-packaged bottle was displayed on a shelf near the cat litter for years before I had the idea to try the scent. At that time, I only knew various soapy men's fragrances, which I found unpleasant, but whose social function I understood. The Saint Helena Cologne, without a clear reference to gender, age, or social status and already through its very short-term external effect decidedly non-functional, offered me a completely different perspective. (To engage further with perfumes at that time, the Cologne perhaps seemed too much of an exception, and I lacked an idea of how such a hobby could be affordable.)"
Metal Jeans Men,08/27/2020,QueenS,F,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Queen of white flowers,"This is a really beauty! It's all about white flowers, sandalwood and vanilla, beautifully mixt.

Every single Arab perfume I’ve ever bought (kayali too) is not worth touching for at least 2 months. This one has been left for 6 months probably and I’d genuinely given up. Moved my perfumes into a new cupboard today and gave it a sniff. Where did the sweet creaminess come from. This was a sharp powder bomb last time I smelt it. I’m thrilled and I’ll be wearing it out for a meal tonight. It’s gorgeous. Just don’t throw your scents out for a long time
Metal Jeans Men,07/25/2025,midaramadara,F,50,,1,immediate scrubber,"the opening is fruity (but not juicy) and not too sweet, with plenty of white floral - although the flowers are blitz-blended here, to the point where it’s impossible to pick up much more than the jasmine.
as the concoction settles, the tuberose (which is reminiscent of a poorly executed, synthetic peony note) resurfaces from under the layers of jasmine and it does start being screechy - for some reason it’s giving me vintage ysl and a headache.

it was much better on the blotter than on the skin but now i'm too traumatized to spray it again... (yeah i had to change clothes and scrub my wrist twice to get rid of the smell)

edit: i gave it 9 months. 9 months to cook and macerate and somehow develop. it's nothing more than screechy, cloying, overly sweet, god forsaken tuberose. my wrist hurts from how hard i just scrubbed it off."
Metal Jeans Men,09/28/2023,Gourmandnisi,F,102,,12,Elegant Lady Chewing Gum,"As has often been read, this fragrance is very similar to L'Interdit (2018) EAU DE PARFUM. But still with subtle differences. Givenchy comes across as more delicate and refined.

This one is louder. It screams ""Here I am! An elegant, well-dressed lady. I know how to behave. I wear expensive, noble clothing. My designer handbag in hand. But still, I love chewing gum, that delicious pink Hubba Bubba. Sometimes making a bubble with it. Even if that’s not quite lady-like.""

I really enjoy wearing it. However, it has to fit. In everyday life, it could quickly become too much for me. The bottle is an oriental dream, like most of Lattafa's creations."
Metal Jeans Men,03/02/2024,Lycroth,M,4,,5,Timeless Elegance,"Floral-sweet jasmine scent. The tuberose comes through beautifully. Suitable for everyday use/evening, spring/summer/autumn/winter - young & old! Classy. Develops wonderfully on the skin. But you really need to use about 3-4 sprays. Then the longevity and sillage are also top-notch. Just like L'Interdit (2018) EAU DE PARFUM

I gifted the fragrance to my wife because I was so curious about it. I've read several times that the scent is supposed to be good. And I must say it did not disappoint either my wife or me. The price-performance ratio is incredible. You basically get the L'Interdit (2018) EAU DE PARFUM for around 20€.

There are some fragrances from Lattafa that are beautiful. But just as many that I don't like. You have to test them out."

Metal Jeans Men,12/17/2024,Dania84,F,5,,4,Positively surprised and yet unsure...,"So this is my first review, and it's for a Lattafa fragrance. At first, I thought the now so hyped scents from the Orient would smell very typical: heavy, rosy, sticky-sweet, overly rosy-patchouli, etc.

I must say that I can't recognize and dissect the individual elements of a fragrance as well as most people here; I can only say whether I like it or not and possibly whether it is heavy, sweet, floral, fresh, woody, or oriental

This one surprised me right from the first sniff: to my perception, fresh and floral at the same time, not my favorite direction but still pleasant and beautiful. After 20-30 minutes, the floral freshness gradually fades into the background, and a mature, feminine, deep scent follows: vanilla-sandalwood, just how I like it. It stays that way, and I love it. However, I must say that it doesn't last that long on the skin, but on the sweater, it lasts longer.

To what extent it resembles L'interdit, I don't want to evaluate, as I don't own it. But I could imagine that it smells similarly mature, feminine, and elegant :)"
Metal Jeans Men,04/04/2025,SunShine1110,F,180,,5,"First fruity, sparkling, then powdery, seductive","Yesterday I tested ""Fakhar Lattafa Women | Lattafa / لطافة"" by Lattafa... and I have to say: it really surprised me positively! The opening is totally pleasant - floral, fruity, fresh - I immediately get notes of lychee, peony, and white peach. The peach (aldehydes) makes the scent sweet yet clean. I can't confirm the listed fragrance notes here. The floral aspect of the scent comes a bit later. At this point, it reminds me a little of Chance Eau Tendre EAU DE TOILETTE or a light Delina EAU DE PARFUM.
Really sparkling and feminine!
After a while, it develops into something more powdery, more intense… the rose and jasmine, orange blossom, and tuberose become more prominent, accompanied by a fine sweetness, but not heavy or overloaded.
In the drydown, it becomes softer, warmer, and sweeter: vanilla, musk, and sandalwood come into play, giving the scent a seductive, opulent note.

Fakhar Women actually reminds me of L’Interdit by Givenchy, but for me personally, Fakhar is somehow more wearable. L’Interdit has too much tuberose for me; I find Fakhar more pleasant because it is also feminine and sensual but not quite as dense and ""in your face"".

Overall: a beautiful, versatile scent that can be easily worn in everyday life, but also has something to offer for the evening. Price-performance is really top-notch like with almost all Lattafas!
For me, it won't be joining my collection, as I probably wouldn't wear it often."
Metal Jeans Men,10/21/2023,Cathlyne91,F,29,,4,A wonderful powdery scent,"A really great, powdery, floral light scent. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long on me. The price-performance ratio is very good though.
The bottle is simply beautiful and very sturdy.

No headaches and overwhelming patchouli. Tuberose is also not too dominant in the foreground.
Clearly a light, powdery, feminine, everyday-appropriate jasmine.

What you can also do wonderfully with the perfume is layer it.

Perfectly suitable for all occasions."
Metal Jeans Men,11/26/2023,Avokashu,F,2,,5,Everyday Fragrance,"For me, this is a good everyday fragrance; I like to wear it to work. I only use 1-2 sprays, so it's not too loud. I really like the heart notes of jasmine and tuberose. I find the bottle very beautiful, and it is also suitable as a gift (if you know the preferences). I think the longevity is good as well."
Metal Jeans Men,09/19/2025,Basti87,M,1064,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Great Alternative to L'Interdit,"Let's continue with another women's fragrance. Lattafa really has some great options in their range and always offers truly wonderful alternatives to some bestsellers from niche and mainstream. This Fakhar line is also quite popular. While the male counterpart leans towards YSL Y, this is clearly an alternative to Givenchy's L'Interdit (2018) EAU DE PARFUM. This line from Givenchy is already one of my favorites when it comes to women's designer lines. I love these playful floral notes of orange blossom and tuberose with a slight bubblegum touch. There is also a Fakhar Extrait, which has nothing to do with the previous Fakhar fragrances and stands on its own. With this white bottle featuring a bronze-colored cap and cover, you get this L'Interdit, which is priced at around €80 for 80ml. Here, you pay the usual Lattafa prices of €20 for 100ml. For a small budget, it's definitely worth buying.

Even though this bottle is white, this fragrance is certainly not a white scent. The bottle is visually appealing and quite typical for this brand. I love these beautiful bronze tones in a glossy finish. In some shops and websites, it is listed as Fakhar Rose, which, however, does not appear on the bottle.
The pyramid seems to be incomplete here. Some components are missing, such as the fruity notes that provide great fruity-floral vibes, especially in the opening. Present in this Fakhar is a wonderful fruit mix and also a great pomegranate note. At the heart of the fragrance is, of course, this well-known floral heart note with tuberose, orange blossom, and jasmine. This mix is 100% feminine and somehow slightly playful. This is also due to the tuberose note, which has such light bubblegum vibes as is often the case with this note. It smells similar to L'Interdit and does not come off as cheap. The fruity notes also match well with this floral heart note. The floral mix feels vibrant and has that certain something that I also love about the original Givenchy. This has been well executed here and provides wonderful sensual-feminine notes. The base consists of sensual-sweet notes with vanilla, musk, amber/ambroxan, and also gentle sandalwood. The white musk gives a creamy impression. Overall, a well-rounded ""dupe"" that convinces me, even though I am usually ""Team Original"". The original is a bit rounder, but for about €20, it's an easy blind buy and a great option for everyday use. However, the DNA is rather not for daily wear due to the strong bubblegum tuberose.
Performance is also strong like that of Givenchy. The sillage is really strong and impressive. It is perceived by many and lasts around 10 hours, with the last hours becoming a bit closer to the skin and softer.

Overall, a clear recommendation for women with a small budget. It smells sexy and slightly playful. I can recommend it, especially as an evening and casual fragrance."
Metal Jeans Men,06/07/2024,Night0witch,F,2,,0,Wrong Fragrance Pyramid?,"I am a bit confused and believe that the fragrance pyramid here is incorrect. On the Lattafa website, it lists ""Lattafa Perfume Fakhar Femme"" as follows:

Top notes: Bergamot, Lily, Pomegranate;
Heart notes: Rose, Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Tuberose, Peony, Gardenia;
Base note: Vanilla, Sandalwood, Ambroxan, white musk

Or am I mistaken and this is a completely different scent? (feel free to let me know)

When I tried it, at first it had a bit of a gum-like quality and over time became so indefinably sweet (which, in my opinion/experience, would suggest vanilla in the base note), I only perceive the floral notes very subtly. It is not overly intense and not ""sticky"" sweet, but it only lasts moderately well on my skin even with several sprays.
As I perceive it (with an untrained nose, however), the fragrance pyramid here on Parfumo does not match."
Metal Jeans Men,01/29/2024,HerzogWiesel,M,4,,5,Powder powder,"...or maybe I'm just too young to like it.

Because this is by no means a bad perfume: The flowers are wonderfully present, especially the jasmine blossom, and envelop one in a creamy white scent. Objectively, I can only praise it, and yet I do not like it.

Perhaps it’s because my grandmother's powder had a similar note.
Perhaps it’s because I simply expected something fresher.
Perhaps it’s because I am a man and not so well-versed in the world of women's perfumes ;)

Either way, at this price, you can definitely give it a try if you like floral-creamy-powdery scents!"
Metal Jeans Men,10/23/2024,ParfCh,F,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Good but not particularly exciting,"Personally, I am a huge fan of extraordinary fragrances with very good longevity and sillage. I miss that a little here.

All in all, ""Fakhar Lattafa Women | Lattafa / لطافة"" is a very nice scent. Jasmine and tuberose come through well, so it really smells pleasant. As an everyday fragrance for the office, the perfume is great, as it is not too loud and not too noticeable. I find the longevity and sillage to be rather mediocre, so it's not a banger like some others from the Lattafa brand. However, for the affordable price, you can't go wrong with this scent.
The sample is enough for me - I probably won't be getting a bottle."
Metal Jeans Men,09/27/2025,Nikike,F,4,,2,Childhood Memories!,"This fragrance evokes memories of my childhood 30 years ago. My mother had a cream with a balsamic scent in a ceramic container - I have been searching for a scent just like this for a long time.
The fragrance is very powdery and floral and, in my opinion, lasts surprisingly long. Even the next day, I can still perceive it in my clothing. I really like this scent, but I couldn't wear it every day as it is very prominent."
Metal Jeans Men,10/12/2025,FrauSpinne,F,37,,2,Summery Femininity in a Bottle,"I don't know the original scent :)
I bought Fakhar Lattafa Women EAU DE PARFUM on vacation, as the beautiful one quickly wrapped me around her finger. It's a really great cheapie that's worth the little money!

To me, the scent smells like vacation. Freshly washed, lotioned flowers.
Clean, well-groomed, and warm but without being overwhelming. I could wear it easily at 30 degrees and above without getting a headache. Strangely enough, I was approached about the scent several times. The niche fragrances are usually not worth mentioning, but this one brought me endless compliments :D.

My nose can't untangle anything here, so no detailed review. I can't detect the aforementioned orange blossom, vetiver, or anything like that. However, the overall scent profile is really good and definitely worth a sniff!"
Versace pour Homme,06/08/2025,LeatherLace,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Is Incubus really this brutal...,"Every person has experienced certain things in their life that they do not want to be reminded of. Whether it is out of guilt, bad memories or experiences, it doesn't matter, but people prefer to keep quiet about it. Some moments do not tolerate the daylight and take place in the middle of the night, dark, sinister and above all unimaginable and unpredictable. What if this
secret comes out? Secrecy surrounding a fact is not acceptable to many. It leads to speculation and usually ends in denial. This also happened ages ago and not much has changed since then...Incubus became famous for this.

Is the fragrance Incubus really as brutal , violent and sinister as history would want us to believe ? Of course not.

If you're immediately tempted by a gift of chocolate, fresh fruit and a bunch of tuberose the first time you meet, you know it could become serious. What else can you expect from this seduction ritual? Try to focus on the other person, not on yourself because the first moments determine whether it will become the truth or whether you will be left alone again.
His leather jacket is old, probably worn at every date. But his leather pants suits his body perfectly, as it was made hand tailored. All stitching is done with so much precision that it's almost too perfect...too perfect for the man who wears it ? What is he hiding and why? It is sometimes said that there is a beast in every person, so I am warned, but not afraid.
Why should I, I've been through worse haven't I? I let myself be overwhelmed at that moment, Incubus seduces me with a ritual that can be experienced as painful slowly. He comes closer, too close, you smell his breath. He smoked just before entering the room, the smell still lingers around him but you will be surprised because it smells like something creamy, sweet balsamic and even a bit powdery feminine which makes him irresistibly attractive. Your space becomes his space, in between the both of you develops the smell of something balsamic resinious. Almost enchanting.......

Suddenly you realize that it's all a memory of forgotten dreams. Forgotten dreams because the true reality hurts more than a lie. Holding on to the past makes no sence while you cuddle your first born. He smiles back at you in a very familair way.....
You swing the crib and then, out of nowhere, the curtains move as if a breeze came in and a so familiar smell fills the room while the windows are closed...it's the smell of Incubus which makes you wide awaken: the sensual and so powerful smell of leather makes you dizzy from desire. Incubus will be always a part of you even after he left...

you forget me
do not look for me,
for I shall already have forgotten you""

Versace pour Homme,11/10/2020,Floyd,M,570,,47,The Demon of Hypnagogic Illusion,"Then it is dark. You sink deeper into the straw of your sleeping place, the resinous sheet in the barren chamber. You breathe in the scent of dark chocolate, still warm, poured over fermenting fruits that someone placed on your nightstand. It smelled of the smoke from the kitchen flames as you tiredly devoured it for sleep, then everything became a confused cotton, your eyes turned to stone as the room still spun.
Now the smoke glimmers like from tobacco leaves, the edges sharp green, like from damp grasses, you feel the presence of animalistic beings and hallucinate flowers, fleshy and waxy, growing on green spices. Over everything lies a fog that intoxicates the senses, the resins, the wood smoke, the chocolate liqueur. Is this all just a strange dream, or is an incubus present, a demon?
Now the damp meadows are on fire, the fruits, the flowers, the spices are scorching, smoke billows through the room in ethereal sharpness, rain hisses as it extinguishes the smoldering ash and washes the thoughts, the vivid dreams into moist, green, burnt earth.
**
With ""Incubus,"" Nikolay Eremin created a dynamic scent image that remarkably does justice to its theme. The demon of hypnagogic illusion, who mates with a sleeping woman at night without her noticing, initially captivates with a strong yet incredibly balanced blend of resins, bitter chocolate liqueur, tobacco, and wood smoke, which soon gives way to slightly animalistic musk, a waxy-fleshy tuberose, and bitter spices. Vetiver provides sharp contours, appearing both smoky and damp. After about an hour, one truly believes in the presence of the incubus, as the smoke and ash seem so ethereal, almost sulfurous in a positive sense. The visitation fades after about six hours into earthier tones.

Versus Time for Pleasure,07/08/2022,Parma,M,277,,30,Less is more,"Fresh, cool, slightly damp wood. Natural and urban. Melancholic and robust. For breathing and dressing. Reminds me of Paul Schütze's 'Behind the rain', but less green, less dark, less synthetic. A slightly brighter version. Without sourness. Essentially a mineral-woody scent, permeated by the elements, like a gray dry stone on which the last water remnants silently evaporate, complemented by a wonderfully aromatic pine-cypress ether with - almost soft - green nuances. This uniqueness is further enhanced by a subtly used incense that gives it depth and a touch of mystery. Just like the somewhat sweeter resins myrrh and elemi, which increase wearability with this quality. Everything is incredibly finely tuned, wonderfully restrained without being shy. Radiating a worship-worthy lightness despite its seriousness. An effortless elegance. This composition comes close to Giacobetti's transparent-sensitive masterpieces like 'En Passant' or 'L'Original'. Lyn Harris' less is more style of absolute calmness, simplicity, and lightness, as well as the so soothing renunciation of popular, modern, eternally lasting, and often unpleasantly smelling synthetic components in the drydown, is showcased here par excellence. More expressive due to the ""heavyweight"" ingredients than much of her still relatively young brand. And yet, I can't imagine that this idea can be composed more effortlessly. For me, one of her best works."
Versus Time for Pleasure,01/21/2022,Earthbound,F,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,I Prefer to Go Out in the Rain.,"The name of this fragrance immediately caught my attention. I am a total nature person! I love being outside in any weather; no mood of the weather can ruin my spirits. So I enjoy rain just as much as sunshine. My favorite place is in the woods, so the scent combination of rain and wood is not entirely foreign to me.

I was lucky enough to participate in a sharing right away (thank you for that!).
When the sample arrived, I could hardly wait, and upon the first sniff from the bottle, I thought only ""wow!"", authentic rain. So I sprayed it immediately. Even then, an intense clear scent of rain. For me, it’s more rain on asphalt than on wood, but very accurate! Yet even here, I smell a subtle floral note that I really don’t like. However, it is so inconspicuous that I hope it will be fine.

Unfortunately, it does not fit. The rain scent disappears incredibly quickly (not even 20 minutes), and what remains is this totally unpleasant floral-sweet note. Is it the angelica, or the water lily? I don’t know. I just know that I don’t like it. It somehow smells oppressive to me. The scent that lingers is quite weak, but you know how it is, when you don’t like something, no matter how subtle it is, it just bothers you...

So, unfortunately, Rain Wood has disappointed me. It gives a promise upon the first sniff that it cannot keep. If the rain scent didn’t fade so extremely quickly, I would say it’s just a matter of taste whether one likes this floral note or not - but the fact that the scent has nothing to do with rain after half an hour is really a shame.
My boyfriend also tested it and reported a similar experience: the rain scent fades quickly, and for him, it then became floral-sweet, but later turned a bit more bitter. But he is not convinced either. What a pity!
I don’t know what it is; after all, people here have had good experiences with the scent. Maybe it just doesn’t like my skin very much.

So my sample will have to move on, and I’ll just wait for the real rain :)

Versus Time for Pleasure,12/30/2020,Smoetn,M,36,,6,Fresh Rainy Forest Floor,"Very nice scent that actually reminds me of a rainy forest floor. The fragrance reminds me of something from the past. It could be Sumatra Rain by Axe (the deodorant of my youth 20 years ago), but I can't be sure about that. Unfortunately, the sillage is not particularly strong, so it's more of a scent for personal relaxation."

The Dreamer,11/21/2017,Serafina,F,479,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Little Fire in the Pine Forest?,"Or just the small incense burner in the bathroom when you're sitting in a bath with pine needle oil?

The latter is certainly the safer and cozier association. I do enjoy coniferous perfumes, and therefore this one has my sympathy as well. Among the 4 fragrances from the brand that I get to test in the travel note, it is also the most expressive and the longest-lasting on my skin, which is why it gets a comment from me as the only one.

At the beginning, the impression of conifer resin is so strong that I perceive it as almost camphor-like freshness, but apparently no one else has chosen the classification ""fresh"" so far. The bright and rather cool-looking incense makes its appearance a bit later, but it remains clearly subordinate to the coniferous notes. An absolutely unsweetened, autumnal perfume, probably more of a candidate for leisure time.

Anyone who likes woody-smoky perfumes should take the risk of a test! For me, the only potential purchase candidate from the series."
The Dreamer,08/08/2017,Skubi73,F,70,HELPFUL REVIEW,0,I've discovered another,"absolute feel-good fragrance. It is so wonderfully calming and protective that I really associate Namasté with a peaceful yoga session with meditation, preferably in a clearing in the middle of a coniferous forest. The pine note here is really very, very subtle, in my opinion. It is more of a homogeneous composition of fewer noble ingredients, appearing complex, deep, warming, and yet gently fresh. Overall, it has a slightly ethereal quality, and fresh grasses are also perceptible. I keep looking at the fragrance notes because I feel like something is missing there. Somehow, there is a soft component as a base in the scent, perhaps a hint of patchouli or musk? It reminds me a little of ""Thundra"" in the drydown. Overall, it’s a fragrance perfect for wrapping yourself up in. The sillage on my skin is subtle, and the longevity is about 7 hours. A quiet presence, but one that can still stand out with its constantly emanating pleasant scent. I give it an absolute recommendation for testing!"
Versus Uomo Private Edition,10/03/2014,molihuacha,F,69,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Unnecessary,"I must confess, I only got this perfume because it was incredibly cheap, I already own a few La Rive scents and think very highly of them.
Unfortunately, there was no tester and the fragrance went blindly into my shopping cart.
At home, being as curious as I am, I immediately unpacked it and sprayed it on.
Well, then came the shock, ..........Bruno Banani. To me, it smells exactly like Bruno Banani ""woman"", maybe not quite as intense, but unmistakably so. Anyone who knows these fragrances knows that they all resemble each other very closely and have that typical Bruno Banani scent, the one from the pink bottle. I even believe that this one always serves as the ""base ingredient"" for all the other variations, and then a few other ""ingredients"" are mixed in, and voilà, we have a new Banani.
I have nothing against these fragrances, as I think they have an extremely high recognition value, last very well with great sillage.
Unfortunately, I belong to those who overindulged in Bruno during school days and emptied quite a few bottles. Now something inside me blocks when I just smell it.
However, as I said, it is a very individual scent and offers a great price-performance ratio.
""Bueno,"" on the other hand, does not have great sillage and the longevity leaves much to be desired. I can hardly perceive it shortly after spraying it on. Now and then I notice it again, but it's not worth mentioning.
In my opinion, everyone would be better off with the original in this case, as it is not significantly more expensive but offers more in terms of scent, longevity, and sillage.
I also read online that ""Bueno"" is supposed to smell similar to Banani ""Magic,"" which I cannot confirm, as I have never sniffed that one; for me, it definitely smells like Banani and very much like the one in the pink bottle."
Versus Uomo,03/17/2024,Dmbfaninmass,M,34,,1,90s Redux,"I have 2 Montale selections and they both serve one very specific purpose - nostalgia for the 1990s and that is it. When I was on the cusp of turning 40, I bought several 1990s to early 2000s era frags for the magic of olfactive scent memory and feel nostalgia for younger, more care free, and quite plainly for my life experience, more fun times.

Did they do the trick? I suppose, albeit in a lesser fashion than I’d imagined they would. My nose felt they were less than they had been - be it the quality of oils used, IFRA changes that occured and necessitated altered formulations, or simply watered down offerings due to the frags being selections that had gone through multiple reformulations in the years since they’ve fallen out of fashion en masse. Tommy, Hugo, The Dreamer, Dunhill Desire Blue were all standbys in my teen years rotation. Sculpture was one I didn’t personally own, but I knew several that had it and would “borrow” some sprays from time to time.

Enter Montale’s Fougeres Marines and Wood & Spices. Off the top Fougeres just hits my nose like a 90s one two pinch of Tommy and Hugo. At opening much more Tommy and into dry down sort of an equal mix of the two. I’d heard / seen several compare Wood & Spices to Sculpture, The Dreamer, and Desire Blue and to my nose I get equal parts of all of those.

I don’t wear either of them often and while I’ve got several fbs from the sister company, Mancera, and enjoy those quite a bit, I have not, and don’t plan on delving deeper into Montale. They hit their sweet spot for me and there they shall remain within my fragrance wardrobe, no more, no less.

If you, too, are looking for that 90s nostalgia but from a brand that offers options that project and last as long as I would imagine one could desire, and don’t want thinner or watered down versions, while being willing to pay a tad more in line with what those 90s frags went for back in those days, this may hit that sweet spot.

I enjoy the heck out of some of my more refined niche frags, but I can also appreciate these for what they are. I say that because I know Pierre Montale’s works can spark “controversy” within the fragrance community. To some they’re just a synthetic mess, to some they’re an affordable gateway to niche, to some they’re absolutely outstanding. I appreciate them for what they are. Some of my Manceras I can’t imagine parting with. Are they going to hit my nose like Roja, Royal Crown, Stéphane Humbert Lucas, Francesca Bianchi, among others - no, certainly not. However, they do, at times and situationally hit my nose as simply perfecto for what my nose craves. These 2 fit the perfecto bill when I want that 90s feel and for that reason, I couldn’t imagine wanting to ever sell or trade them away. Sillage, Projection, and Longevity, like all Montale and Mancera I’ve experienced is about as potent as I could want. Refinement and quality of ingredients is lower spectrum of niche - they’re synthetic and not “natural ingredient” smelling, but they’re as good as it gets for doing what they do and what my expectations could be for their doing so."

Versus Uomo,10/07/2016,Gutriechfee,F,101,,6,"Cool, Distant Freshness Kick","By chance, I was offered Montale fougeres marine as a bargain. Apparently, my acquaintance didn't like it. After a first test, my clear classification is rather masculine, as it is marketed as a fragrance for men. But then a friend said, why shouldn't a woman wear this scent! After all, women have also embraced marine fragrances today. And so, for very little cash, I acquired an almost full bottle of FM from Montale.
My first impression, I've been wearing it for two days now, good longevity, 7 hours on me, a maritime freshness kick, a feel-good scent for a cool head, I smell mint, the distance it creates clarifies my emotional state, bringing me to calm.
It reminds me in scent expression of a mix between Allure Sport Homme and Davidoff Cool Water women. FM is very civilized for Montale, not overpowering, but rather pleasing in expression. It is well-suited for the masculine side in us women, namely to go through the day calmly, coolly, and distantly."
Versus Uomo,09/23/2010,Igraine,F,45,,0,For men only,"I had a bit of a hard time trying to describe this Montale fragrance, as I could hardly identify any note without knowing the details in the pyramid. My first impression was: Hm, is this Montale? Surely, there must be something similar that is cheaper and not niche (although one could debate whether Montale really falls under ""niche""). The second thought: This is not unisex; it is clearly for men. The third: It smells somewhat synthetic, although I couldn't quite say why. It’s not an aquatic Calone that jumps out at you, nor is it the penetrating substance sometimes listed as ozone, but it is certainly not the true rough sea. Despite the slightly synthetic impression, this is, after all, the most pleasant and accurate interpretation of ""sea water"" that I have encountered so far. Admittedly, I don't really know much in this direction, which I will change when I get the chance.

An impressive freshness spreads from the very beginning. I don't perceive it as indefinably synthetic; it feels menthol-like, like very sharp mint, with a hint of squeaky sour lemon juice. This cool, bitter freshness is extremely pleasant and compensates for the somewhat chemical-seeming sea water. It actually reminds me of a brisk breeze on a very cool day during a walk on the beach, clearing your head.

The coastal vegetation definitely provides a lot of oak moss, because to my nose, there is far more ""fern"" than ""marine"" present here. I don't smell lavender at all, at least nothing I would recognize as such. Patchouli is at most perceptible as a very subtle hint if you look for it. I can easily find the geranium and musk on the paper strip (where the scent becomes much rounder), while on my skin, a mixture of sea water and moss dominates.

I used up 2 samples of this marine fougère with some enthusiasm when it was around 40 degrees in the shade during the summer. If the climate catastrophe should lead to such sweltering heat occurring more frequently, I will definitely get myself a whole bottle of refreshing sea water. Otherwise, I would clearly leave this scent to men and wouldn't mind if I came across it on one or another specimen."

Fougères Marine. I was curious how Montale would interpret the blend of herb-green and aquatic. I usually find aquatic notes boring or they remind me of the scent of men's deodorant.

When first sprayed, I was a bit disappointed. The scent smelled strange.
But then the top note developed into a spicy freshness. Only very faintly could one perceive a subtle sweetness. Are all the ingredients listed here? I predominantly smell a fresh herbiness. I do not detect lemon. I wonder where the seawater is supposed to be? Was that the strange scent opening?

The heart note then develops a bit sweeter, but the summer character of the fragrance remains well preserved. The intensity is okay. The lavender wanders around in the heart undefined.

The base clearly has a fougère accord. Only the musk could have been toned down a bit, as there is a slight hairspray note in the dry down.

Conclusion: well done, but still not to my taste."

Versus Uomo,10/07/2010,MSB,M,15,,1,Fougère a bit too sweet,"I feel similarly to Igraine that FM gives a synthetic impression - this happens to me with almost all Montale fragrances.

After spraying, a citrus freshness becomes noticeable, which within a minute lets the mint come to the forefront.
Shortly thereafter, it develops into a sharp freshness, which, however, is overly overshadowed by a sweetness accompanied by menthol.

All in all, a very pleasant scent, although the sweetness can also be bothersome."
Metal Jeans Women,02/03/2025,Merlotsupern,M,97,,13,"If there is coconut, this is a Malibu Cola!","Nishane's Fan Your Flames is undoubtedly one of my favorites from the house, offering a boozy, rich, and indulgent experience. From the first spray, it immediately evokes the scent of rum and cola, blending a deep, sweet-ish, and spicy booziness.

If you're specifically looking for coconut, as it is listed in the notes... you will be disappointed. Instead, I can smell a realistic cola accord. In my opinion, this fragrance does it better than Enigma PARFUM, which leans more towards a cognac-heavy warmth rather than a true rum-and-cola feel. Fan Your Flames, by contrast, captures that perfect balance of sweetness and spice, making it more ""fun"" in the opening.

As it dries down, the composition evolves by bringing out a warm, mildly-smoky tobacco note.
There are faint similarities with ""Honor & Glory | Lattafa / لطافة"" in the later stages, particularly in the interplay of warm tobacco and woods. However, Fan Your Flames has a much more pronounced tobacco presence, which emerges more distinctly as the fragrance settles. Lataffa's fragrance plays more on the cinnamon & sandalwood accord.

Overall, this is perfect for cooler weather, nights out, or when you want something smooth. If you enjoy boozy, tobacco-laced (but not dominant) fragrances with a unique cola twist, this one is absolutely worth trying."
Metal Jeans Women,11/08/2023,ScentToolbox,M,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Leaves me Wanting More!,"I am on the hunt for my personal holy grail tobacco fragrance and while researching the note of tobacco I came across the tantalizingly unique note profile of Fan your Flames from the highly regarded house of Nishane.

This is my first Nishane and was a total blind buy and as many have already stated, FYF is definitely not a safe blind buy. But before I was even able to get my nose on the scent I was very impressed by the packaging and unboxing experience that Nishane puts together and after my tobacco hunt cools down I am looking forward to further exploring this gorgeous house.

FYF immediately stood out to me due to the unique note combination of coconut and tobacco, both of which sit atop my favourite notes in perfumery. This alone was enough for me to smash the Add to Cart button and before long I had the first sprays of this firey fragrance on my wrist.

The opening is by far my favourite part of this fragrance. You are blasted with a warm and boozy toasted coconut. This is not a typical sunscreeny coconut but rather one that has been kissed by open flames and left to smolder. It's not smokey but warm, resinous and although slightly sweet, that sweetness is overpowered by a peppery herbaceousness. This opening is intense and projects well but despite its warmth, I strongly believe that the opening suits every season well. There is enough beachy campfire and coconut to capture the allure of the summer while also being paired with a comforting and boozy warmth that easily cuts through the cold winter air. Though the notes of tobacco and coconut initially seem like they would clash fairly strongly, there is no cacophony of competing notes trying to out loud the other. The blend is at its best in the opening and every note is incredibly well balanced and this allows FYF to appear effortlessly classy in spite of a more casual scent profile.

Like many great things, this does not last. Before I speak about my personal issues with the drydown I want to say that FYF's drydown is fairly linear, the overall scent profile really doesn't change much between initial spray and 10 hours in. The coconut fades into the background and the tobacco in the base becomes more prominent but besides that, all the notes remain more or less the same. However... the way that these notes combine with each other and the way the blend develops does not do this fragrance any favors. The well balanced nature I spoke of earlier does not remain for the entire life of this fragrance and on my skin, every note degrades and falls out of harmony the farther I get from the initial spray. What starts out as a warm, toasted coconut becomes a dirty, fleshy, sticky mess on my skin. It's as though some really cheap sugary coconut liquer was spilled onto an expensive cigar and the resulting liquid was left to dry on my skin. I really can't bring myself to appreciate this drydown no matter how many times I've tested this fragrance. It genuinely makes my skin feel like it hasn't been washed in days. The tobacco is there but it's mutated by this stale and sweaty syrupiness from the degradation of the top notes.

At its best, FYF projects a carefree confidence and makes me feel like I'm simultaneously vacationing in the tropics while also being inside a fancy humidor as winter winds pelt the outside of the room. The opening is truly a work of art and every single time I experience this I tell myself that this fragrance is a masterpiece and THIS is the time that the drydown will be different. Unfortunately that time hasn't come.

Despite my distaste for the drydown, I can't bring myself to rate FYF any lower than a 7.5. The opening is absolutely incredible and impeccably unique and I hope one day that the rest of this fragrances life will grow on me because it's clear that Nishane put a lot of work into crafting this scent. It may very well be a skin chemistry issue but it's an issue that makes FYF very difficult to wear for more than a few hours without feeling dirty. I wish I could get more from this fragrance, I can't overstate how captivating its opening is and it leaves me wanting more every time I wear this."
Metal Jeans Women,06/14/2021,Virginia93,F,19,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Pure fire and at the same time charm in a bottle,"""Do not feel lonely, the entire universe is inside you. Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion. Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.""
Rumi, Persian Poet, 13th Century.
This is the quote by Rumi which inspired Nishane's Fan your Flame, an amazing (probably one of the best) perfumes I've ever smelled. A combination of coconut, tobacco and rum that gives a warm Caribbean touch to the sweetness of tonka bean and to the woodiness of Chinese cedarwood. Oakmoss completes the picture.
F.Y.F. is an extrait of parfum, this means that sillage and persistence are huge!

It's an unisex fragrance, in my opinion more masculine but it can suit women too without problems! This is why I decided to make myself a ""little"" gift and buy it, I just couldn't resist... I fell in love at first ""sniff""
It's wild, pure fire, but at the same time charm in a bottle.
Preferably to be sprayed in autumn/winter because as I said, it's literally fire! HOT
The bottle is very elegant and it comes in a beautiful box with an amazing postcard. Well done Nishane!"
Metal Jeans Women,06/17/2016,ScentedSalon,F,96,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,First Taste of Istanbul,"This Rumi-inspired concoction has turned out to be a beautiful blind buy. I haven't tried any of the Nishane perfumes but am very impressed by the quality so far. The perfume is multi-faceted, long lasting and powerful. It starts off very tropical with pineapple and coconut. I wish there was more rum: here it is more like restrained sweet liquor whereas I would have liked more punch, like a rum raisin. The tang of cedarwood makes the intense sweetness bearable but you have to like super sweet perfumes in the style of Tabacca, Or du Serail and Sacre Tabac Sucree. For those that like hookah/shisha perfumes, you will love this."

- Rumi

New York, sitting in a bar with a fireplace, smoking a good coconut-flavored hookah and tasting rum.
This is the presentation postcard of Fan Your Flames.
The fragrance starts off immediately with a nice coconut edged with a boozy note: with a generous addition of pepper it would have been a very similar opening to Pazzaglia's Carbonara.
As time passes, the alcoholic hint wanes and a good, non-cherry, fairly dry tobacco takes over.
In the drydown, oak moss gives smoky hints that combine well with the other notes and make the composition very intriguing and persistent.
This is a warm scent with exotic vibes, but not tropical beach; a contemporary metropolis scent."

Metal Jeans Women,07/11/2022,Smellike82,M,17,,3,Coconut love,"Just like an artistic painting of ingredients but mysterious, it takes time to absorb it and enough space to reveal its contents. It's not the kind of fragrance you spray, inhale, and judge in a minute. A gritty, he leaves you in confusion until you get to the right perspective to see it, don't get too close or you clash with his heaviness, his cruelty and you don't walk away from him losing yourself in his pleasure. I find boozy notes to be one of the most seductive notes in perfumes, especially when we are talking about matured spirits like rum.
Fan Your Flames is inspired by Rumi, a Sufi poet known for his courageous and exploratory vision of religion and teachings, he inspired and instilled positivity through his serene messages laden with wisdom, but unlike Rumi, Fan Your Flames is dark and mysterious, in the best possible way. From the beginning I take tobacco and rum which make the opening spicy and intoxicating, there is coconut mentioned in the notes but I have almost none, although, I make myself a sweet and nutty undertone that could be due to the coconut. I love how it has held a smoky profile for so long, the combination of rum with a rich cedar smells like a finely aged rum joint, the luxurious and resinous tone is further enhanced by a very prominent tonka bean which adds a warm, creamy and nuttosa facet to woody drydown. There is a slight sweetness in the background throughout the journey, accompanied by a deliciously smoky tobacco.
It reminds me of a hookah bar I used to visit, going out with friends, drinking spilled on wooden tables, big smiles on our faces. What fun it was for a moment to watch the city lights fade into smoke and then shine again!"

Metal Jeans Women,02/18/2023,Loubacca64,M,70,,4,A mixed drink next to a bonfire,"This is....wow.
You think your getting this woody spicy mix, but really the dry down is boozy & sweet. Coconut & rum is prominent, i won't go into these diatribes where I try to paint you any picture. But this is a date night/night out frag to be worn. Its thorough, long lasting and SEXY! Compliments for days!
This is clearly stated, a beautiful fragrance. I wouldn't wear it during the day, it's a night fragrance through and through. I'd say fall & winter, a cool spring evening. But im crazy enough to try this bad boy on a beautiful summer night while out at the bar or on a date. Why not? It FANS YOUR FLAMES"

Metal Jeans Women,03/25/2022,RahulESJ,M,36,,3,An absolutely delicious coconut dipped boozy tobacco,"Fan your Flames is sweet, slightly velvety, and is very dry and dusty tobacco with creamy coconut-like nuances. It definitely smells like a party on a Pirate ship somewhere in between the ocean. I also get a lot of earthiness in the back which is very reminiscent of what I get in Sultan Vetiver. You can definitely sense that both the fragrances are from the same brand. ⁣
⁣
⭕ To me it's slightly masculine leaning due to the smokey/ earthy base I spoke about above but that doesn't mean that the ladies can't wear it. The sweetness really balances out everything atleast in the opening and really makes this fragrance another winner from the house for me. Also for the people who don't enjoy overly boozy fragrances, this could be a great start. ⁣
⁣
Overall, Fan your Flames is delicious Malibu coconut rum that's a delight to wear. It's tasty like a coconut-based cocktail, warm like the smoke from the bonfire, and slight green like the wind from the pine forest nearby. Can't go wrong. This is a huge recommendation from me"

When i wear it i fell like chill vibe on the beach smoke nice cigar and sip whiskey along with it.
Personally i suggest just try this you may fall in love such as i do"
Metal Jeans Women,06/28/2024,Ninamariah,F,295,,2,Burnt Coconut and Rum,"This really unique masterpiece is either love or hate at the first sight. I had two wonderful perfumes from Nishane already and I knew that the performance and the longevity are great. I was just again surprised how all those notes blend beautifully together. Nishane is a niche perfume house from Istanbul and their quality is 10/10

Because of the main accords which I like and an opinion of most of the people that this is well blended totally unique scent (plus hours ) made me pull the trigger as a blind buy. Anyway I recommend sample first.

Main accords: sweet, tobacco, coconut, woody (Chinese Cedar), rum, vanilla, mossy (Oakmoss)
What you get - or better what I got:
Forever lasting powerfull burnt smoky coconut rum experience and this perfume really is an experience. I love this! I was scared about tobacco note but it’s not like dirty smoked cigarette, it’s rather smoky airy feeling, pleasant one. Coconut is not cloying or sunscreen one, it’s burnt dry coconut. Tonka Beans gives it a little bit sweet hint while rum lingers in the background.

This is perfect for the wintertimes but I will definitely try it in fresh summer evenings as well while dreaming of being in the Pirates Of The Caribbean-movie. ️

Unisex, a bit male leaning, Fan Your Flame X is female version.
Longevity is eternal, a sillage is huge."

A bold and versatile choice. Go for it"
Metal Jeans Women,08/24/2023,Axeel998,M,20,,2,Very pleasure and strong,"Fan Your Flames is probably the most interesting and highest quality tobacco-coconut combo I’ve ever smelled.

Metal Jeans Women,07/06/2021,Art,F,68,,2,The aftertaste of a party in the Caribbean,"This perfume is like the morning aftertaste of a cool party somewhere in the Caribbean, perhaps, where there is still a strong mixture of aromas of sweet alcohol, cigars, coconuts and thousands of burnt firecrackers and fireworks in the air. The note of fire/ gunpowder / barbecue / burnt matches in this perfume (a similar note that I also smell in some Imaginary Authors perfumes) is very dominant here, and sometimes it overshadows everything else in the composition for me....
Sooo, yesterday's party was obviously very hot! ;)"
Metal Jeans Women,09/30/2021,Eko,M,16,,0,fan my flames,FAN YOUR FLAMES by nishane is a very masculine sell you got to be an alpha to wear this the rum the coconut the tobacco the cedar its crazy. it's rich is heavy its strong very good. you will make a statement with this perfume. its kind of like an more masculine more manly man version of jazz club by maison martin margiela replica line. only this adds the coconut in the mix wich is very good to be honest.
Metal Jeans Women,01/10/2024,TonkaTommy,M,51,,1,Tis nice.. safe.,"Safe for notes. Obviously we shouldn't completely BLIND BLIND buy things, but if you like the note breakdown, you like or love this. It's pretty solid. Summer day, or night, some drinks, some eye contact. It could set the mood. But we what I've smelled from Nishane now, there's an almost dirty quality. It's less abundant here, compared to sultan vet and even Ani. But it CAN be off putting to some.. ohhhh I know what it is. The preservatives. It's heavy on preservatives. Ahhh makes sense now. Pass for me."
Metal Jeans Women,06/25/2025,Killsocket,M,29,,1,"Coconut rum works in drinks, does it work as a scent...","Checking out the scores, I feel a little out of place and guilty because this isn't going to go good, but what am I other than just one voice of the many who enjoy this scent. Definitely worth a sample if you are interested as Nishane is typically very good in the quality category.

This one comes off very coconut and boozy forward, as if I spilled a pretty famous coconut flavored rum on me. It's loud and in your face at first spray but mellows quickly. I don't find this to be all that good for my tastes, but I will say the notes are accurate when people remark on the coconut and rum. It transitions to a somewhat sweeter tobacco note with some coconut still lingering about. I seem to get some woodiness and even moss on the dry down.

I am not a fan of this. I think the coconut might be throwing me off? I am not sure. If you like this kind of scent, I don't know if anything could beat it.

If I want rum, I might reach for Jazz Club (for example), if I want tobacco, I might reach for Herod (for example), if I want everything plus coconut, this could be your jam. It's not mine.

I actually wonder how good this could be to my nose minus the coconut. Now that would be awesome, I think."
Metal Jeans Women,08/25/2022,BobbyGee,M,230,,1,Nishane / Fan Your Flames,"Perfume that smells like the Cuban national gem - Havana Club rum mixed with coconut oil in the accompaniment of tobacco (probably twisted into a cigar-shaped on Kubanek thighs) seasoned with tonka beans and decorated with the scent of green moss and cedar (this time Chinese cedar - pink - called Cedrela) .
An interesting experience I associate with heat, sun, warm sea (be it the Caribbean or an island in the ocean), a pipe in my hand and smoke in my mouth (as I still smoked) and a glass of coconut rum with ice cubes and the smell of conifers coming from the land. I think that some people may associate it with the smell of shisha - yes, it's a good comparison.
Although I associate it with warmth, summer, peace and relaxation, I believe that it is a competitor for winter - warming with its warmth, positive vibration, bliss and light sweetness. Personally, I also see him on a woman more than a man, although in winter I like to humiliate him and… .. make a quick trip to another part of the world and at a different time of the year.
I recommend it especially to women, including fans of such fragrances as Carner-Palo Santo, Montale-Honey Aoud, MEMO-Shams Oud, Mancera-Red Tobacco.
Very good projection, durability - up to 12 hours (it is really very durable)."

Metal Jeans Women,09/17/2020,Bloodxclat,M,34,,28,The Gentlemen-Pirate from the South Istanbulian Islands,"Rum, coconut, and tobacco in a perfume, with cedar as a base? Have my years of pleading to a higher power been answered?

I have relatively high expectations when it comes to rum and tobacco - I have been dealing with R(h)um for many years and was previously in the tobacco industry.

So it was clear to me in advance - either this is my long-awaited holy grail, or I will stop searching and dedicate myself to, for example, a model railway or start sewing children's clothes.

One must give credit to Nishane, the presentation, packaging, and bottle are incredibly elegant and beautifully displayed. This is enjoyable.

The scent opens quite smoky right away, a resinous smoke with a hint of sweetness - it reminds me of a smoky, natural oud that I once had the chance to sniff. Then a lovely coconut joins in, very nutty and natural, the sweetness is moderate. No coconut milk, no Bounty, but really well done. Cedar & rum create an open rum barrel - aromatic, authentic, sharp, and dark. Anyone who has ever stood in a warehouse with rum barrels will remember this now.

The tobacco is green-herbaceous and heavy, swirling powerfully around the rum barrel, while the coconut shells crackle on the fire. Every now and then - a resinous-sweet-smoky note flashes, reminiscent of hashish. The progression is truly wonderful, the scent constantly shifts, and a new olfactory impression comes in all the time. It feels very high quality overall.

Longevity is phenomenal, easily 12h+. One should not overdo it - as always - since the sillage quickly rises to a few meters. Two sprays from the hefty bottle are sufficient.

Fan your Flames is exotic, a bit wicked, and carries a certain lustfulness - at the same time, it is just as distinguished and possesses a certain nobility. Gentlemen-Pirate sounds terribly clichéd, but somehow it is apt.

This perfume will certainly have a permanent place in my collection. I am still searching for the holy grail ;-)"
Metal Jeans Women,05/03/2020,Chizza,M,361,,31,Caribbean Party in the Ruhr Area,"Recently, I had a silly accident while doing my weekend shopping. Before you gasp in shock: I had already bought butter and salami, all good. No, my lovely wife wanted to bring the vacation vibe home despite Corona. Instead of beach, palm trees, and sea, it was party cellar with dim lighting, Dortmund Union beer, and homemade Raffaello schnapps from the bathtub. From my friend, Jürgen.

Sounds good, right? Well, anyway, my wife sent me out again to buy coconuts and Caribbean stuff. No problem, I'm a pro at that! I can boast several stays at Caribbean resorts. Quickly put on my Halston Z-14. After Googling, I bought rum. The one from the middle shelf. Not too cheap but also not an expensive drop, she wouldn't taste the difference anyway. While I was there, I grabbed a couple of packs of cigarettes and some vanilla liqueur. Jürgen swears by it.

Then the mishap happened as I was leaving the store. The stone slabs outside were too slippery for my flip-flops (I had already put on my vacation outfit as a precaution), I slipped, balanced my shopping but it was no use. I crashed down and everything spilled over me. First, the coconuts spilled out along with the rum. I suddenly smelled like Klaus Störtebeker, I tell you! Anyway, the rum was quite intense and very alcoholic, phew! Only now did I realize that a bit of tobacco and vanilla liqueur had fallen into the spilled coconut-rum mix. Well, that didn't make much of a difference. The rum already tasted very sweet because of the coconut. As pleasant as the scent was at first for a bad boy like me, it was a bit bothersome now. Quickly gathered the opened pack of cigarettes and headed to the car. Stupid that my mossy Halston no longer came through and also stupid that I partially fell into the cedar planting. As Andy Brehme once said: if you have shit on your foot, you have shit on your foot.

I drove home and smelled like an entire Caribbean bar, where you drink rum from a coconut shell. You probably think that's nonsense. Oh no! I've done that in Duisburg before! And it was really Caribbean, as the owner told me. And what Peter says is true. He was once married to someone from there. Twenty years ago. I was glad that all the other nonsense didn't also play into the scent. The alcoholic smell also weakened over time, it became sweeter and sweeter, but now the cigarettes also stank!
I parked my car and of course ran into my neighbor, that nasty Schofel! ""All good, Captain Morgan?"" he grinned at me. I wanted to tell him off but he was also lifting weights at home. So I smiled at him instead and pretended to be clumsy by dropping the keys to the front door several times. The idiot!
Anyway, I got home and told my wife about the mishap, she had already put on the grass skirt and the crown in her hair. She didn't quite get the hip swing right. She thought it wasn't a big deal and so everything was okay. I first opened a Union beer to calm down. She said to me, I'm not Jack Sparrow but still her pirate. To which I replied, she's not the woman from the Batida de Coco ad but for me, she's the drunk alternative. That didn't go over well. Maybe I inhaled too much of the rum smell.
That was my story! Good night from the sofa, folks!"
Metal Jeans Women,08/20/2025,Berkanlenck,M,145,,24,"Where Coconut, Rum, and Smoke Meet","It was a warm summer evening when I first applied “Fan Your Flames.” I still vividly remember how the sun slowly sank behind the rooftops of the city, bathing the streets in a golden light. I had discovered the fragrance in a small perfumery-a narrow, dark bottle with golden accents that radiated something mysterious. The salesperson simply smiled when I asked how the scent was and said, “You have to find out for yourself.”

Barely applied, the top note unfolded: a sweet, warm wave of coconut and rum that instantly evoked a feeling of coziness and adventure at the same time. It was as if I held a small piece of summer in my hand: sweet, slightly intoxicating, and with a hint of wanderlust. I closed my eyes and could imagine sitting on a beach, my feet in the sand, a gentle breeze on my face, while the sun kissed the horizon.

But the fragrance was much more than just summer. After a few minutes, the heart note opened up: tobacco and tonka bean. Now the scent became deep, smoky, almost a bit mysterious. It told stories of long evenings with friends, of conversations by candlelight, of memories that linger like smoke in the air. Every breath felt like a step into a world full of warmth and familiarity, but also full of adventure.

Finally, the base note of oak wood, vanilla, and musk brought everything together. It gave the fragrance stability and depth, making it sensual, enveloping, and unforgettable. I could feel the hours the scent lingered on my skin, like a constant companion throughout the evening. People around me noticed it without me saying a word. It was subtle yet present, and it seemed as if everyone who came near me took a piece of this story with them.

In the following days, I wore the fragrance for special moments: at a dinner with friends, on a walk through the city at sunset, even during a spontaneous visit to a small, hidden bar. Every moment became more intense, more memorable, as if the fragrance extended time itself. “Fan Your Flames” was more than a perfume-it was an experience, a little journey that one could always carry with them.

Since that evening, the scent has become inseparable from warmth, a sense of adventure, and the feeling that every moment, no matter how small, can be special. Every time I smell it, I am reminded of that golden city, the setting sun, and the magic that arises when all the elements of sweetness, smoke, wood, and musk harmonize perfectly."

Metal Jeans Women,02/14/2022,DarkWinterCS,M,291,,18,"Away from the Hype, I Feel Your Fiery Temperament","Sweet scents here and there, as far as the eye can see. Those who seek will find. Only what I am looking for I cannot find, at least not in the way I wished. Too much that has been too sweet for me lately, too much mainstream, few authentic gourmands, and then more and more flankers of well-known fragrances trying to adapt to the newer taste of the masses. Aventus was the holy grail for newcomers, slowly fading and increasingly hated. The tip of the iceberg. But everyone should have noticed who wears this fragrance. Therefore, a new grail was sought. It seemed that Baccarat Rouge 540 would be the next one. Much hyped, even more fragrances still trying to find similarities with saffron to then shine through differences.

Do I want that? NO, definitely not.
Even Baccarat Rouge 540 could not convince me. Especially not Aventus with the batches I tested. Everything felt so uniform, so conjured, and so boring. Especially BR540 was just sweet, sweet, and sweet for me. Exploded hairspray. Why? Do you just want to blend into the masses, to prove to some people that you wear something everyone wears and what many might perceive positively through good memories?

What is wrong with experimenting? Finding something that not everyone wears or that doesn't fit into the current hype. That is what makes it so exciting when you stand out, when you smell different. Here, interest and curiosity arise.

I currently feel this with my long-loved Spicebomb. The pepper no longer appeals to my nose. Too boring, too overused is the DANN. That is why Infrared seems to be doing so well. More than a reinterpretation of the known.
In the search, several candidates come into question. Many push themselves forward, even those that have already left my collection. I could perceive the fresher version of a Spicebomb in Histoires de Parfum's 1899. Good, but too close to the original. Even Ani by Nishane couldn't resist a bit of Spicebomb DNA. But in a more eccentric and stronger version. What a powerhouse.

No, it should be something completely different, something that is also demanding, perhaps not immediately cuddly, but striking. Here comes Nishane Fan Your Flames into play. Completely differentiated from the spicy-sweet mass of winter fragrances. Hints of a summer scent, nuances of a gourmand. Not a fragrance that precisely fits my requirements, but rather takes a supportive place in my collection.
It fascinates me, though. Complex, with edges and corners, a crazy all-rounder.

Summer?
Winter?
Who cares!

Initial coconut rolls through the campfire and bursts. Sniffing the woody coconut shell, the frayed remnants reaching, smoke rising, slightly charred. Nutty, woody, and coconut water in the sun. Smoky, it cools the skin to intensely distribute light smoky wisps. Nutty-fruity after slightly unripe coconut. The curse of the Caribbean. Rum, oh so.
A bit of alcohol can never hurt, as it dampens the excesses of the burnt shell. Is someone smoking here?
Lovingly wrapping ripe tobacco leaves. Not lit, just lying on the table, staring into the fire.

In summer, cooling on the skin, summer and vacation feeling ready. Caribbean islands full of warmth and cocktails under the little umbrella.
In winter, warming, smoky, coconut water in the wind.

The scent lingers on me for a long time. At least ten hours are in it. You don't radiate as extremely as others of your kind, but enough to envelop myself in your delicate notes.

What more could I want?
The search continues, perfection is not yet achieved, but this one has earned its place; my collection is happy about your participation."

Metal Jeans Women,02/06/2021,Felix2109,M,17,,9,The best fragrance notes combined,"Tobacco, rum, and coconut - all fragrance notes that I love. You can't go wrong with tonka bean either. There's nothing to complain about a nice cedar note. So it sounds like the perfect scent for me, and it was immediately added to my wish list.
After only a short time in the souk, I saw it and bought the whole bottle blindly. A few days later, it arrived at my place, very nice packaging, and I also like Nishane's postcard idea; it's something different. The bottle is designed very classically and only stands out because of its more unusual cap, which I like.
Well, let's get to the scent itself. As mentioned, I approached it with very high expectations due to the listed notes, and what can I say, you get what it says on the label. It starts with a strong and pleasant rum accord. However, after a short time, the coconut takes over, and the rum retreats to the background, replaced by cedar and tobacco. After a few hours, it's really just coconut and cedar with a smoky undertone. The longevity and sillage are also good. The scent had everything it promised, but unfortunately, I don't quite like the notes in this combination. The woody note is also, unfortunately, too pronounced for me in this fragrance. I guess I'll have to wait a bit longer until it gets warmer, and I can enjoy coconut in summery scents.
Nevertheless, it's a beautiful and, above all, unusual fragrance that one can certainly try."

Metal Jeans Women,05/22/2024,Vikteur,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Blessing of the Caribbean,"I join all the pirate comparisons of my predecessors, and I think it’s great that I can! This fragrance truly combines many scent notes that must not be missing in a good pirate fantasy: boozy rum, coconut, a bit of sweetness, wood, tobacco, smoke, leather, green notes, and a very fine mustiness.

Malibù - Party in the Bay for really hearty people.

[The fragrances don’t have much in common aside from coconut and a boozy note, but they effectively represent the two ends of a Caribbean fantasy spectrum.]

Or better: People who wear Fan Your Flames ambush those who wear ""Malibù - Party in the Bay | Simone Andreoli.""

Or: People who wear Fan Your Flames turn a stiff beach party with piña coladas into a wild rum feast.

What do I like about the fragrance?

1. The scent is strong and multifaceted. In fact, the first minutes are very boozy, green, bitter, and somewhat unappealing. Since it was a blind buy for me, I briefly felt a certain regret. Only over time do coconut, tobacco, sweetness, and finer woody notes develop for me, making the fragrance really good, pleasant, and even a little elegant - although the scent should feel most at home in casual leisure. Additionally, I personally detect a slightly leathery note: the oak moss shows clear edges but harmonizes excellently with the other fragrance components.

2. The fragrance stimulates the imagination, and we associate heavier, bitter-spicy scent notes with sun, beach, and sea. Pirates in the Caribbean, indeed.
This breaks a tiresome cliché: with heavy, dark, gourmand, or spicy fragrances, direct connections are often made to winter wonderlands, Christmas markets, fireplaces, or other cold-romantic scenarios. This annoys me, and Fan Your Flames shows that it’s all in the mind and that classic notions can be questioned. Of course, one should take care of oneself and one’s environment regarding heavier fragrances in higher temperatures.

3. Pirates!"

Metal Jeans Women,08/09/2023,Machiavelli7,M,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Jack Sparrow Signature Scent,"Although Johnny likes to promote the Ambroxan bomb Sauvage in the real world, his fictional character has a different favorite: Fan your Flames. At first, the powerful rum note overwhelmed me a bit during my first sniff and pushed the notes of tobacco, tonka bean, and coconut into the background. This was disappointing for me, as I had been looking forward to these fragrance notes when I ordered it.

But I didn't want to give up on it. I kept returning to Fan your Flames, sniffing it, and over time I began to warm up to the strong rum note. After several sniffs, my nose could now also detect the other fragrance notes, albeit more subtly. Although the rum note is consistently dominant and perhaps not typical for summer or spring scents, Fan your Flames definitely shines on mild summer evenings."
Metal Jeans Women,11/19/2024,Kleibinho,M,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The Tipsy Coconut!,"I have had Fan Your Flames in my collection for quite a while now and have had the pleasure of wearing the scent extensively.
In fact, I have not smelled anything comparable so far, which makes this fragrance absolutely unique in my eyes.
It starts off with a hefty dose of coconut that has been soaked in rum. Personally, I love this opening, as it doesn’t come across as creamy sweet like a typical coconut, which gives it a more masculine touch. In my opinion, the scent progresses quite linearly, which is absolutely brilliant in this case, as this composition simply fits together beautifully. The sillage and longevity are well above average, so one should apply Fan Your Flames with care. I enjoy wearing this fragrance all year round, especially in the evenings and at celebrations.

So, if you want a unique scent that definitely stands out and garners compliments, you can't go wrong with Fan Your Flames!"
Metal Jeans Women,01/24/2022,Tarkaan7,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,First-Class Rum with an Unsweetened Raffaelo,"I stumbled upon the fragrance on Parfumo. When I saw the notes, I was very excited, but I didn't want to get it as a blind buy and in the distant future, as I have already spent a lot of money on fragrances lately :D
Spontaneously, I went with a friend to a new perfumery in Zurich and lo and behold: They happened to have FAN YOUR FLAMES in stock. Of course, I had to test it, and it was love at first spray. Naturally, I had to order it as soon as I got home!

For me, the scent is hard to place in a specific situation. It can be worn elegantly (not with a suit, but rather Casual Business), but I also see myself wearing it in the evening somewhere on the beach in shorts during a walk or at an outdoor bar. Personally, it is the best rum fragrance I have tested so far. At first, the coconut might be a bit too strong for some noses, but I like it, and in the drydown, it becomes pleasant and smooth for everyone. Longevity is easily a whole day (at least 9h), sillage is quite decent but not exaggerated. I can recommend this fragrance to anyone who takes life easy and achieves their goals solidly with the principle of minimalism. Nothing can bring you down!

Metal Jeans Women,12/21/2021,Neonwhite,M,21,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Fire in the Cocktail Bar,"First of all: I only write reviews for fragrances that truly impress me in an extraordinary way. So why is this the case with Fan your Flames?

From the first spray, I was immediately surprised. I've never smelled anything like this. Cough drop in smoke, coconut in the background. Not the coconut you expect, but somehow minty, fresher coconut. Extreme contrasts right from the first sniff. It could also be a fresh sauna infusion. In the sauna, I see incense sticks blowing their flags into the sky while the visitors joyfully enjoy the best rum. Indefinable yet so clear (nonsensical) images. Contrasts indeed. Contrasts that don’t fit into my world but are incredibly attractive because of that.
Despite the strong smoky note, Fan your Flames is an absolute clean scent, something I've never experienced elsewhere.

What I find so brilliant about this fragrance happens more at the beginning; in the drydown, after about 4 hours, the smoke, which is rather unspectacular and too strong, remains while the wonderful unique freshness slowly fades away.

I don’t care, I want to own this fragrance. So unique, so mysterious, so clean, so wearable, so noticeable, so strong yet so pleasant, so crazy, so full of contrasts and as chaotic as this comment. This fragrance is incredibly complex.

Let’s go outside and smoke a cigar in front of the cocktail bar that has just burned down and was extinguished with coconut liqueur!

Sillage & Longevity:

The special aura surrounds me, as mentioned, for about 4 hours before it transforms into smoky wood. However, the little fire that this fragrance ignites is still clearly perceptible after 8 hours.

One last thing to say:
I want you! The 4 hours are worth it to me."
Metal Jeans Women,02/10/2025,TimH20,M,4,,4,First Great Love,"Fan your Flames has been with me almost since day one of my perfume journey. Back then, I received a sample of this fragrance, and it was the best scent I had smelled up to that point.

Coconut notes usually appear in summer fragrances like Miami or ""White on White | XerJoff."" However, Fan your Flames tries something new and transforms it into a perfect boozy winter scent with the perfect dose of rum, so it doesn't come off as too alcoholic. The nutty sweet aroma of the rum shines through nicely but not too strongly. The tonka bean enhances the sweetness and rounds it off. And the combination with my favorite note, tobacco, completes the fragrance into a masterpiece, adding spice and a hint of the Orient. Additionally, the oak moss also contributes a touch of spice to this composition. In my opinion, the sour tree note does not come through, which is a good thing, as I believe a green note would be disruptive here. The fragrance may be too sweet for some people since there is a sweet ingredient in the second tier of the notes pyramid. For my taste, it strikes the perfect balance of sweetness and spice. Highly recommended!"
Metal Jeans Women,03/25/2023,Basti87,M,1064,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Coconut-Rum-Tobacco with Cedar Base,"A new acquisition of mine. Fan Your Flames by Nishane has been on my radar for a while. The unique notes of coconut and rum seemed very appealing and exciting as a change for the collection. Many Nishane fragrances can be found at a good price, which wasn't the case before. This one, for example, can be partially found for 120 euros for 100ml. The MSRP for 50ml is already significantly more expensive. Definitely worth checking out, as this brand simply offers quality, performs excellently, and many just resonate really well.
Fan Your Flames is somewhat more edgy, especially due to the striking rum note in the first two hours. The coconut is also quite unique and something that may not appeal to everyone. You should definitely test it before purchasing, especially the opening could be quite off-putting in a blind buy. As it develops, it becomes much more pleasant and softer.

The bottle and Nishane packaging is, as always, a 10/10 for me. Simply elegant & luxurious. For me, it's among the best in the niche world. Not too much, not too little.
Fan Your Flames is a dark coconut scent. Those expecting Raffaello will be disappointed, especially at the start. A strong boozy rum note greets you there. It packs a punch and can be quite overwhelming for some. When smelled closely, it has a slightly musty vibe. In the air and from a distance, it's fine. Coconut is also present in the opening, but still overshadowed by the rum. As the rum note softens, the coconut develops beautifully and offers a lovely cocktail feeling, especially with this light cigar-tobacco note and wonderful creamy-sweet tonka that pairs great with the coconut. However, the scent never becomes overly sweet. The development is really well crafted, as this fragrance becomes pleasantly appealing without becoming too ordinary or mainstream. The base comes in very softly with a lot of cedar, and the heart notes of tonka & tobacco are still present. The woody-soft cedar base is excellent for the dry-down and a great finish.
Performance is, like all Nishanes, simply grand and worthy of an extrait. The rum opening is quite intense, and even in the further coconut development, the sillage is really good. The cedar base is still well noticeable and pleasant. Perfect for people who want to stand out. Longevity is easily over 12 hours or more.
This can be well suited for nightlife. Not a Raffaello for the beach, rather dark coconut with a lot of depth. Thanks to the coconut, it can be worn well on summer evenings/nights. For everyday wear, it's less suitable. Unisex is also fine, although it is significantly better received by men with 90% ownership. This is probably due to the bad-boy rum start. After about 2 hours, it becomes quite unisex.

Overall, a high-quality fragrance that can be well purchased on sale if you want a coconut-rum scent for the evening/night. Definitely worth testing before buying."
Metal Jeans Women,04/23/2023,TristanKalus,M,130,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A Feeling of the Caribbean,"The sun high in the sky, the white sand so blazing hot.
In the comforting shade of a palm tree, somewhere in the South Sea - who knows?!

Leaning against the trunk, a pirate as drunk as can be.
In his left hand a jug of mojito, in the other a bottle with rum written on it.

Alternately he takes a sip, sometimes from the bottle, sometimes from the full jug.
With a cloudy gaze, he lights his cigar from Nicaragua and takes a deep drag.

How long he has been here, he does not know and does not want to know.
What he also does not know is when he had his last bite.

But with a thud against the trunk, a few coconuts fall down.
He indulges in them and is happy, as he no longer has to hunger.

He has everything he needs and feels like the king on his island.
Everything seems perfect - if only he didn’t have such a terrible burn.

But his mood lifts immediately at the sight of the chest made of light cedar.
Filled with gold ducats, jewelry of ancient Aztecs, some tonka, and bottles from a bodega.

Slowly, the dark sea and the red sun merge in a swirling symbiosis.
The pirate's gaze wanders longingly over the horizon and over the oak moss growing on the chest.

Fin.
______________________

Nishane's Fan Your Flames ranks quite high on my list of alcoholic fragrances, if not at the very top. This is probably because I have found a truly authentic ""booze"" scent in Fan Your Flames for the first time. Where other fragrances only use fewer facets of spirits, Nishane's creation offers the full spectrum of top-notch rum from the Caribbean. The aroma of the sugarcane schnapps develops a bit sharp and piercing right from the start and becomes increasingly softer, fuller, and almost reveals a fine sweetness as it progresses. Following this are smoky coconuts and light tobacco. The tobacco note indeed reminds one of hand-rolled cigars from Nicaragua, but the coconut note does not quite evoke images of fresh coconuts. Much more, the note recalls coconut-flavored rolling papers, which we smoked for a while in our youth - a lovely nostalgic feeling! Next, a bit of citrus and a hint of mint join the rum. With the very sugarcane-heavy rum, an aroma develops that strongly reminds one of refreshing mojitos. As it progresses, Fan Your Flames gains sweetness on one side, while on the other side, an increasingly intense cedar note emerges. The latter dominates the fragrance after the initial burst and gives it its sharp-woody character, which is underlaid by a bit of zesty oak moss.

So, if you are looking for an authentically alcoholic fragrance, you can certainly find it here - a feeling of the Caribbean is included!"

Metal Jeans Women,06/06/2023,On3ForN1ce,M,20,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Grandiose blend of Pina Colada and Caribbean beach,"As can be seen from many other reviews here, there is often talk of a pirate or even a ""gentleman pirate.""
This comparison is quite fitting - probably or especially because of the rum.
I would like to describe it differently.
Imagine you are on vacation. 10 days in the Caribbean, preferably Cuba.
You are lying on the beach. The typical vacation photo - turquoise blue water meets fine, white sand. There are countless palm trees on the beach.
In your wooden lounge chair, next to which stands a wooden sunshade with a thatched roof, you are enjoying a nice Pina Colada - of course authentically served in a coconut.
In your other hand, you have a real Cuban cigar.

You are enjoying the stress-free life before the vacation ends and you have to go back to work.

This scent really reminds me of a vacation in the Caribbean. I find the combination of coconut, tobacco, and rum really great.
I fell in love with the fragrance at the first sniff. I am glad that I stumbled upon it through a blind swap; otherwise, I would have really missed out.

Longevity and sillage are nishane typical and really extremely good. It easily exceeds 10 hours.

But beware: one to a maximum of 2 sprays are really enough.
The scent is truly ultra strong.
Almost overwhelming, but the coconut gives the fragrance a light note.
I personally never adhere to the conventions of ""summer"" and ""winter,"" but I would tend to say that this is more of a scent for cold days.

However, I would also wear it in summer. The coconut and rum evoke the ultimate vacation feeling!"
Metal Jeans Women,07/18/2024,Lauser93,M,1199,,2,"Unfortunately, it didn't captivate me","I personally find Fan Your Flames a bit tricky. At times it is beautiful but then again too cumbersome. Above all, there is an earthiness that I find disturbing. The longevity on my skin is quite successful at 8 to 10 hours, and I would also describe the sillage as good.

The top note starts off sweet with creamy coconut milk but is also very woody thanks to rum-soaked oak barrels. The heart note offers a lot of tobacco and a bit of tonka beans. Unfortunately, the base is too earthy and peaty for me. The oak moss bothers me quite a bit. There is also dark leather.

Unfortunately, there was no spark between me and ""Fan Your Flames | Nishane."" Nevertheless, I thank Niklas for the manufacturer sample."
Metal Jeans Women,07/02/2022,Creedence,M,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Edelsüss,"I mean with this Nishane fragrance, apart from oak moss, I can actually perceive all the listed notes. An incredibly warm and very enveloping scent. Unobtrusive coconut, nicely vanilla, light tobacco, and a moderate alcoholic note with very good longevity... simply very well composed. I really like this spicy, subtly sweet progression. Now and then, a hint of sunscreen wafts into the nose, creating a kind of beach, vacation feeling. Traditionally, most connoisseurs would probably reserve 'Flames' for the cooler months, but I can’t help but occasionally spritz it over citrus notes even in summer.
Fan your Flames by Nishane is a perfume of excellent quality that is worth its price."
Metal Jeans Women,05/11/2023,Raoul0508,M,7,,5,Rum and Tobacco - a combination I thought I knew by heart...,"A beautiful, fundamentally rather wintery tobacco and rum scent, which is made very special by the coconut. Somehow, the coconut does not fit this fragrance at all, yet still, or precisely because of that, I can't imagine the scent without this intriguingly interpreted note. I perceive the coconut very clearly throughout the entire scent development. Right at the beginning, it is rather fresh and by no means sweet. Anyone thinking of sunscreen or cocktails here is, in my opinion, mistaken... Rather, it resembles a realistic, somewhat unripe coconut that has been layered over the finished fragrance. It sounds a bit odd at first, but in the final product, it is incredibly beautiful. As the scent develops further, it becomes a bit sweeter, which is probably due to the tonka bean, without losing that realistic, unripe touch.

Nishane has impressively shown that they can play well with vanilla in Ani EXTRAIT DE PARFUM and ""Ambra Calabria | Nishane."" However, with Fan Your Flames, I am very glad that there is no vanilla included. This would have pushed the scent too much in a wintery direction... Instead, the fragrance creates a very fine balance between cozy warmth and an interesting tropical touch with the coconut.

Both the tobacco and rum smell very realistic and develop a sweet-bitter scent on my skin. The cedarwood gives the fragrance a bright, woody base and prevents it from going too strongly in the gourmand direction. With the fragrance pyramid in mind, I imagine that I can smell the oak moss, even though I actually don't know how it should smell on its own. I can generally pick out each of the listed components, which is rather rare for me.

Through other reviews and videos, I expected the scent to be smokier than it actually is on my skin. It strikes the perfect balance for me between boozy-sweet, woody, and fruity-bitter. This makes it very difficult for me to classify the perfume into a specific season. I wore it yesterday, carefully dosed, at 20 degrees and thoroughly enjoyed the scent trail. In my opinion, you can wear Fan Your Flames all year round, except for sunny summer days, although in deep winter, I would probably lean more towards sweeter alcoholic scents like ""Side Effect | Initio.""

Definitely a great fragrance that allows you to stand out from the crowd perfectly, without trying too hard to be noticed. The true magic reveals itself only when you wear the scent on your neck and perceive it through the fragrance cloud. Therefore, one should wear the fragrance, if possible, before evaluating it. The longevity on my skin is superb, the sillage is typically ""subdued"" and wave-like for an extrait, but just right for the scent. The bottle and packaging are quite impressive, and the overall picture simply works. One of the few fragrances in the niche segment where I feel that it is worth every cent, without having financed expensive marketing campaigns... So definitely give it a try! :)"
Metal Jeans Women,02/01/2024,Illyrianguy,M,1,,1,Havana in Winter,"Fan your Flames is the perfect winter fragrance that still has a tropical touch.

Metal Jeans Women,02/07/2023,Yambo,M,67,,3,Fan your...WHAT?,"Since Nishane is a brand that seems very popular and I quickly fell deeply in love with ""Ani (Extrait de Parfum) | Nishane,"" I wanted to test and learn more from this house.

In terms of quality, Nishane plays in a high league, which is not surprising since almost every fragrance is an extrait.

The bottles are quite simple. A square block with a label on the front and a nice heavy cap.
So, not really impressive in itself, but still it feels complete and somehow shines through its simplicity.

Now let’s finally get to the fragrance ""Fan Your Flames | Nishane.""
As mentioned above, I was shockingly in love with ""Ani (Extrait de Parfum) | Nishane,"" and unfortunately, I was not as thrilled with ""Fan Your Flames | Nishane.""

At the start, a sweetness kisses the nose. This is realized through a distinct coconut note paired with a hint of rum and tobacco.
The coconut is the star at the beginning and projects very strongly and clearly, nicely rounded off by the rum.
Rum is definitely recognizable, but it doesn’t play the main role, and in the background, a hint of tobacco can be sensed.

I don’t know why I always associate it with ""Replica - By the Fireplace | Maison Margiela,"" but somehow I picked up this phrase and, unfortunately, had a certain expectation.
With ""Replica - By the Fireplace | Maison Margiela,"" it is not comparable at all, and I don’t find any similarity, which wouldn’t have been tragic if it still managed to shine.

After a while, the tonka bean joins in, and the fragrance becomes sweeter.
The tonka bean is also only perceptible far in the background and additionally supports the sweetness of the coconut with the other notes, rum and tobacco.

Over time, the coconut note fades more and more, and the rum and tonka bean shine through increasingly, becoming the main players.
Even though it sounds strange, at this stage it reminds me a lot of ""Replica - Jazz Club | Maison Margiela,"" which is ""okay"" in my eyes.
Even ""Replica - Jazz Club | Maison Margiela"" didn’t evoke a ""must-have"" vibe in me.

A kind of roughness, as the name might suggest, I hardly perceive, which I actually find quite unfortunate.
So far, the naming and what you get is not quite fitting. At least for me and according to my perception.

Over time, moss and cedarwood notes shine through more and more, and I must say that the moss gives the fragrance a somewhat musty, earthy development.
In my opinion, it completely ruins the fragrance, and it evolves from ""wow, that’s sweet"" to ""yeah, it’s okay"" to ""oh no, definitely not my thing"" or ""not at all!""

Because of the moss and cedarwood, which shine more and more at the end, it feels very musty and medicinal. It reminds me of a fragrance, but unfortunately, I can’t recall which one it could be (mine would be one from BDK)!

Most niche fragrances actually develop the other way around. At the beginning, either too much, too intense, or very strange (see ""Musc Ravageur | Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle"") and develop into a delight and even a pleasure.
But this one does it exactly the opposite.
But what you have to give the fragrance is that it has a very recognizable development, even if in my eyes it is rather negative, but it is present, and thus the art is recognizable :-)

Very, very unfortunate!

Nevertheless, I am curious about what else the house has to offer and hope that they have a fragrance in their collection that makes me as shockingly in love as the wonderful ""Ani (Extrait de Parfum) | Nishane."""

The sky is blue and it’s 36 degrees, a light breeze is blowing that cools my skin. A vendor is selling fresh coconuts at his street stand not far from me.
I have a Montecristo in one hand and a 25-year-old Ron Vacilón in the other. Now and then, an old Cadillac drives by. Satisfaction and inner peace spread within me.

Metal Jeans Women,01/28/2022,Theoalex,M,3,,3,The Alcoholized Coconut with a Hint of Vanilla is Fighting for Me!!,"The scent starts with a chord of coconut and plenty of alcohol. I feel transported to a warm South Sea beach with a rum-coconut cocktail in hand. Right next to me, two women are vying for my attention. Both want to go out with me tonight. But only one can win. The fire of passion is evident in the battle between rum and coconut. Both engage in a fiery duel. From time to time, they are supported by tobacco and tonka bean. So who has won? In my opinion, it’s the rum. It makes the coconut drunk and kicks it out of the ring.
Now it gets more sensual… Oakmoss and cedar give the scent a touch of elegant woodiness in the drydown.

All in all, a very good scent for an evening out to dinner or to the club.
The sillage and longevity are beastly. The longevity for me was over 10 hours. Still noticeable on clothing days later.

Fan Your Flames is one of them - and I must say at this point that I personally find this scent simply incredible.

Initially strongly smoky, fresh from the sprayer, the scent is somewhat of an acquired taste, and it takes a while for it to develop on my skin. However, then coconut and tonka come to the fore, mixed with the wood and the strong rum note that runs through the entire fragrance, making it a bit sweeter - I would almost say pleasing, even though I know that this type of scent is not for everyone.

The longevity is brutal on my skin. It easily lasts all day, and the sillage is - sometimes to the lament of those around me - also very, very good - but since this is my current favorite scent, I admit that I sometimes apply it quite heavily.

A fragrance, a bit like a dwarf tavern. Smoky, tobacco-heavy... and the strong alcohol first... but still, one is tempted to sit down on old wooden benches next to the fire - to order a strong schnapps and some sweet cakes from the somewhat grim, tough innkeeper."

Metal Jeans Women,05/01/2023,Dennis1104,M,995,,1,A special scent that somehow captivates. Campfire + Pina Colada? YES!,"Fan Your Flames is a truly unique fragrance. It combines Pina Colada vibes with a campfire.

Imagine sitting in the garden with friends in the evening by a wonderful campfire.
You pour some rum into the fire to make the flames even bigger, and you also toss in some coconut flakes and a few tonka beans.
Meanwhile, you're smoking a cigarette.
That's Fan Your Flames!

Sounds crazy, is crazy, but there's something really interesting about it.
I personally find the scent really cool. It stands out from others and combines so many things at once.

This fragrance works excellently on cold days, but also in summer.
You could tell the story differently.

You're on vacation in the Caribbean with your friends. In the evening, you're sitting on the beach, looking at the sea, one is smoking a cigarette, another a cigar, and another a cigarillo, while you all sip a strong Pina Colada that blows you away.

Yeah, yeah... this scent is fun.
The longevity and sillage are also quite impressive.
You'll get a lot out of this.

Definitely worth a try."
Metal Jeans Women,05/04/2024,Cimi,M,379,,0,"Is it too strong, are you too weak | Risk of Overwhelm for Untrained Noses; with Risks and Side Effects","The Fan Your Flames was one of my first niche fragrances, and I believe that was my biggest mistake with this scent. After applying it twice, I sold it again; it was too strong for me, smelled too angular and edgy, almost cloyingly sweet-alcoholic, simply unpleasant.

This week I tested the Fan Your Flames again, a few years and hundreds of fragrances later, and yes, I must say; the Fan Your Flames is truly special and above all, quite good!

Now to the Fan Your Flames - how does it smell?
- I believe that the opening can still be a slight challenge for many even after years of perfume experience. You get a real blast of coconut-rum, this combo is extremely high dosed and strong upon spraying. The first 5 minutes were still challenging for me, but not unpleasant. It is simply strong and edgy!

- After 5-15 minutes, this extremely strong combo settles down, and a beautiful tobacco note slowly joins in, giving the fragrance a slight spiciness and balancing out the sweetness of the coconut a bit. Now it starts to get exciting and beautiful. In the drydown, it then receives the typical Nishane oakmoss base, of course not as strong as in Hacivat, since the coconut-rum note carries through to the drydown, but the sweetness gradually recedes, and you get a beautiful melange of coconut-rum-tobacco-oakmoss, perfectly balanced.

- The longevity of this fragrance is truly beastly; it doesn’t run out of steam for a very long time! The sillage is definitely in the upper third; the fragrance projects and projects!

Overall, a fragrance for which you really have to be ready. It is special, yes, representing a coconut in such an alcoholic-spicy way is not typical, as coconut often finds its way into fresher scents, but if you have enough experience and give the fragrance a little time, it could indeed become a good companion for special occasions!"
Metal Jeans Women,11/12/2022,AbuNadeem,M,33,,1,Beautiful beginnings are sometimes fake,"Boozy Sweety Scent,
My beginning with the fragrance was very nice, as I received a sample, and because I am a fan of the coconut note combined with the boozy blend represented here, I later bought a whole bottle at a very affordable price.

The scent is a fiery ball with an opening of coconut and rum, featuring notes of tobacco and the sweet taste of tonka bean with oak moss and wood.

Honestly, I found this perfume very boring after several applications.
The fragrance combination is unbalanced here, and too much spray causes headaches.
There is a synthetic smell that I only recognized after longer use of the perfume; the scent of coconut is like an unripe fruit that is still green and has a thick shell.

The fragrance notes will fascinate those who haven’t tried it, especially for those who love coconut, but anyone who has tried Creed Virgin Island Water will likely discard this perfume.
Creed created a summery scent, in contrast to Fan Your Flames as a winter fragrance.

And the perfume rightly bears its name, as it truly makes one feel indescribably warm on the harshest cold days, because the hot notes ""tobacco, coconut, rum"" are mixed in an innovative and unique way.

The performance of the perfume is very good; it lasts for two hours, with a longevity of over 12 hours on the skin and on clothing for weeks."
Metal Jeans Women,03/14/2023,Catchmynose,M,67,,2,All the Delights of the Tropics,"Television advertising has changed dramatically over the last 40 years. Who doesn't remember (if they are of the appropriate age) the cute little Clementine, the Persil uncle, or Mr. Kaiser? And the ad for my (then and now) favorite chocolate bar has certainly stuck in my mind. The coconut/chocolate bomb was advertised back then with the - at first glance grammatically peculiar - slogan ""All the Delights of the Tropics"".
That this at least has its justification in the GERMAN language should be clear to everyone by now; but whether one can/should/must evaluate the ""tropics"" solely based on a sweet treat is open to doubt.
Yes, I am a fan of coconuts! That’s why I am always on the hunt for fragrances that evoke a corresponding association in me. ""Fan your Flames"" - ignite your flames, is the name of this fantastic product from the equally fantastic Turkish brand NISHANE. And yes, it ignites in me the memory of a hearty bite into the sweet something that has been haunting me since my childhood. However, this memory is more mature; more robust. A slight rum note accompanies the opening, without one being bothered by a fusel smell. The experience also becomes slightly woodier over the course of the - well 10 hours of longevity. The initial perception and thus the journey into the ""Bounty childhood"" remains ever-present for me, yet the rum/tobacco mix prevails here. The sillage is okay, though not overwhelming. And that's a good thing, as not everyone is a fan of the Caribbean faction. Compared to my other highlight in this fragrance category Virgin Island Water, ""FYF"" performs significantly spicier. However, the longevity is also significantly better. Do we still need to talk about the price of Nishane fragrances? I don't think so… But there really isn't a true alternative if you want to experience a somewhat authentic feeling…
Love it!"
Metal Jeans Women,01/21/2022,Burak46,M,105,,1,Coco Drunk at the Bar,"Since I am an absolute fan of the Nishane label, I had to buy and test Fan Your Flames, of course. No front, I find it to be the weakest among the Nishane candidates so far. The ingredients sounded very good with the reviews, so I had a rough idea of which direction it was going. The opening in the first minutes gives me a strange impression .. You can clearly perceive..."
Metal Jeans Women,01/03/2023,GratWanderer,M,228,,1,Consistently dry-woody tobacco scent with a touch of tropics,"A coconut with a lot of grass and dry tobacco makes its presence felt right from the start; I’ve rarely experienced such a dry coconut, as it usually turns creamy and kitschy quickly. It’s a different way to stage the notes directly in the head.
To be honest, I felt very little rum in the top notes; tobacco and coconut were rather upfront, and the former quickly takes over more after 10-15 minutes. One of the woodiest interpretations of tobacco I know, it sometimes feels more like finely worked fresh wood than actual tobacco leaves or even that sweet pipe tobacco note that one sometimes encounters. I guess it’s the cedar in the base that is already shining through in parts and exerting influence.

The transition to the even woodier and slightly forest-dry base is particularly nice and smooth; this tobacco-cedar main combination with light, dry moss notes lasts very long and consistently.

Overall, it’s not particularly varied, but a very well-balanced tobacco-wood scent with a hint of tropics, and rum is rather minimal to nonexistent for me.

[tested on skin]"
Metal Jeans Women,03/11/2023,Marcello01,M,10,,1,A Pirate on Tortuga,"I was eagerly waiting for the sample to arrive, and today it came… The scent starts with quite smoky woods, almost burnt. Initially a bit of an acquired taste, but after about half an hour, the fragrance really takes off. The burnt woody notes recede, and the coconut and tobacco emerge, followed by a hint of rum.

Longevity is above average. Additionally, the scent develops into a sweet direction, although it seems quite different at first. The fragrance is more suitable for milder seasons. I definitely categorize this scent as masculine, less so for a lady.

In comparison to Jazz Club, which I also own… although the fragrance notes are similar, I find that the scents are quite different. In my opinion, the coconut is a bit more present in the top note of Jazz Club, even though there is no coconut in it at all, very strange.

Back to Nishane Fan Your Flame. I find it well done, although everyone perceives the fragrance notes differently. For some, the rum note or the coconut is less present, even though the fragrance notes come across very well. Yes, the rum could have been a tad stronger, but otherwise, everything is detectable. As for the coconut… it is not as artificial as in shampoos but rather kept natural.

For those with the necessary funds, I would prefer Jazz Club here because the sillage and longevity are significantly better."
Metal Jeans Women,09/18/2022,Skooodle,M,30,,0,great scent that gave me a headache at first,"The scent itself is not bad, but there is something in it that gave me a headache at first. The typical Nishane DNA is immediately noticeable, along with something synthetic. The coconut is still green, and I also smell something mossy! As much as I was looking forward to the scent and I really like the ingredients, I can't wear this too often. The first 2 hours are fine, but..."
Metal Jeans Women,10/29/2025,Dama96,M,58,,1,The Coconut Rum,"At the opening of ""Fan Your Flames | Nishane,"" one gets the impression of being in a bar. On the wooden tables around, only one spirit is being consumed: rum
Not mixed with sweet, sticky cocktails, but neat, authentic.
From the adjacent smoking room, a subtle, smoky nuance seeps through the closed door. It wafts into the bar unobtrusively, carrying a hint of coconut with it, which it picked up from the only person in the whole room who is drinking Pina Colada with fresh coconut instead of rum.

This is roughly how I perceive ""Fan Your Flames | Nishane."" The rum note is clearly dominant, but it is by no means unpleasant or too alcoholic. Rather warm and boozy.
I perceive the smoke and coconut in the background, but they are slightly overshadowed by the woody notes of oak moss and sourwood.

A wonderfully crafted fragrance, which, however, due to the very prominent rum note for me is not a candidate for purchase. A candidate for purchase is also not Angels' Share EAU DE PARFUM for cognac reasons, and it rightfully has an enormous fan base.

So just test it and let yourself be enchanted."
