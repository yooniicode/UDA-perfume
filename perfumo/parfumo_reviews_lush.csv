Turmeric Latte,10/06/2025,Smellemental,M,74,,0,"Blow my way, brise d’oud…","(2025 Edition)

Opens fresh, clean, citrusy and green, with the smokiness of the Keemun opening up within minutes, tannic flavour and a slight ineffable fruitiness beginning to pour out. The green tea facets soon follow, and actually come across more authentic than in the majority of blends I’ve seen it in. It’s that particular grassy, earthy astringency that’s actually quite difficult to accurately capture. Jasmine, honeysuckle and honeybush are also conveyed beautifully, creating a delectable honeyed, floral jasmine & black tea combination with a deep woody boost from below.

In about an hour the base begins to unveil, robust, woody cedar and earthy, spiced Chinese oud perfectly supporting the teas in the heart. Sandalwood isn’t terribly prominent to me now but may arise later in the drydown as is common to it. I also have difficulty determining what spices adorn the base, but I think there might be a hint of something faintly musky, perhaps cumin, and also maybe some caraway. There have also been some very slight rubbery nuances from the honeybush in the heart, but I think they actually accentuate the woody and smokiness of the oud and black tea very properly.

Becomes all the more resinous in the drydown while retaining much of the great citric and tannic properties. Sandalwood as expected does appear to help smooth things out in the final act. All in all, I actually consider this a stupendous blend, a super easy and fun tea-and-oud scent that even newcomers will find bewitching & fascinating. Best worn in spring and summer but would personally make occasional exceptions during the colder months as well.

Sillage moderate to strong, longevity excellent. At $135/30mL through American Perfumer, it’s a bit on the pricier side but I’d definitely consider it justified.

Bravo, good sir!!!"
Rose Jam,10/19/2025,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,"And it smells good, by the way","Kenzo has a great sense of humour, if you ask me. And if I translate the name of this fragrance correctly: Ça sent Beau meaning This smells good. What a great name for a perfume! But apart from being quite fun, there is a truth to it, that I shall have to comment on. Since with this astounding product I do sometimes consider the smell secondary. Perhaps that needs an explanation. Let us look at in what order this unfolds itself.
It starts with the wrapping: stunning. The EdP comes in a beautiful light green box with a beautiful black (hand) writing stating Kenzo. Next to this is a red seal like decoration, a Japanese ‘hanko’. The box has structures of leaves pressed into the cardboard. Inside, the bottle is wrapped in crisp peach coloured tissue paper, almost nesting in it. Oh yes please! Now, that is what I call decent wrapping. The whole act of unwrapping makes my nervous system go bonkers. So much, that I tend to forget what it is all about - the fragrance.
But then there is the bottle. I have the deodorant, the miniature EdT and the ‘real thing’ - the EdP. All are in the stunning category. The EdP, however, takes the price. It has a stopper shaped like two flowers, and the neck and bottle reminds me of the now again popular activity of stacking rocks on top of each other. Even though the top is plastic, the whole picture is a balanced, beautiful and bold design, that leaves me with a luxurious feeling. So much that I tend to forget what it is all about - the fragrance.
Well, the fragrance is out of this world and should be in the Top100 - despite its high ranking, it is not in Parfumo’s Women’s Top100, which surprises me. It is creamy, floral and soapy at the same time. When it warms up it has a floral expression that makes me want it to stay like that forever. Actually, I think it is timeless. Such a shame that it is discontinued. But then again, I get to enjoy it, because it is in my collection.
Year 2, 158/365"
Rose Jam,09/03/2023,Lauser93,M,1199,,2,Fruits and Flowers (EDIT: 23.02.2024),"Today, I wanted to compare the Ça Sent Beau EAU DE TOILETTE on the right and left arms with the ""Ça Sent Beau / Kenzo (Eau de Parfum) | Kenzo."" To my surprise, the perfume lasts only 3-4 hours on my skin with a rather weak sillage. The Eau de Toilette comes across as much more concentrated, likely due to its age - both fragrances come from collection dissolutions and are in older miniature bottles. I find the DNA of the scent not too bad but also a bit old school. It smells very floral and fruity.

The top note starts fruity with peach but also floral-sweet with orange and jasmine blossoms. The heart note remains distinctly floral. I detect rose water, geraniums, tuberose, gardenias, iris, violets, and lily of the valley - what a sea of flowers! The base reminds me a bit of soap and fabric softener. Additionally, I recognize a green-earthy patchouli aroma. It also has a slightly vanillic and balsamic scent.

All in all, this is a fairly successful fragrance, but I wouldn't necessarily associate it with my ""dream woman,"" as I find it a bit outdated.

EDIT 23.02.2024: Now I have tested another miniature. Here, the longevity was significantly better at around 12 hours. In the top note, I also detected bergamot and a jam-like quality. As it develops further, it also smells quite oriental, festive, and of cinnamon."
Cardamom Coffee,01/13/2019,Bernard,M,15,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A Mild Pineapple Fart in the Tuscan Wind,"How can I resist the temptation when the price of an EdC is under €3 / 100 ml? Especially since it's supposed to be one of the much-touted Barbershop classics.

I've always wondered which target group this ominous Lustray line is aimed at, as Pinaud Clubman offers very solid drugstore products for the US market at a (there) very low price. Lustray is - in my impression - the budget version of the house and can even be ordered in canister sizes in case of a major emergency. My expectations are initially at 0, just like a meat hedgehog on the party buffet. It's also old school, rosy, and just as unappealing as the plastic bottle.

Bottle: see above. Unappealing! I have nicer things in the garage or tool shed. But one must not be deterred by the Pinaud / Lustray bottles, otherwise one might miss out on one or another gem. They remind me of discount beer bottles like those from Lidl. Horribly made and exclusively made of plastic, which I actually wanted to ban from my household for ethical reasons.

Longevity: Here I would be at the heading. So disappointingly mild and flat-chested, at best on the level of an aftershave. Measurable in minutes.

Sillage: Was there something? Even for the highly sensitive noses of my cats, I remain almost invisible in terms of scent. Also for my two-legged golden treasure. Even for myself.

Scent: Fresh pineapple briefly tossed in Provençal herbs and doused with a hint of musk. Good. Solid. Simple. Proven.

Conclusion: In the main subject a 2, otherwise only 5s and 6s on the report card. That’s not enough for promotion. Class goal missed."
Grass,11/17/2019,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Should I watch while your perfumes worship the sun?? :D,"Hello you sun-worshipping perfumes (who are surely hating the cold days right now!). Soo… oh man, I wish I hadn't started with ""sun-worshipping,"" because now I have… strange thoughts… like imagining you in bikinis, let’s say, in alluring movements worshipping the sun, which surely catches the fleeting glance of us guys *sigh*
It's kind of like when you do yoga (oh my God… some of those poses make your heart stop!! Who came up with such ""exercise positions"" like ""Downward Dog"" or even ""Merudandasana"" or whatever it's called (the one where you spread your legs so extremely)… Arrrrghghgh :DD Not to mention many other ""positions""!!…

Anyway, how did I come to sun worshippers? Quite simple: The fragrance here is called ""Sympathy for the Sun"" (by Roos & Roos/Dear Rose). And I think, especially you ladies must love the sun much more than men, right? Well, I’m not a big fan of the sun. Yes, yes, because I’m single and blah blah, we've been through that several times… no, this time I wanted to say that the sun can be beautiful, but all those heat waves in summer really annoy me. A few years ago it was okay, there were just a few hot days, but now it looks like the heat waves are increasing and lasting longer… anyway, I just don’t like extreme heat and I already feel sick thinking about next summer *sigh* No sorry… I much prefer winter! :)

Anyway, I’ll get to the scent, which sounds quite fresh :)

The scent:
The scent has a rather classic opening with citrus and oak moss and even briefly resembles an aftershave or those scents found in barbershops. But don’t worry, just a minute later the scent becomes distinctly more feminine with sweet jasmine and roses. Of course, the classic touch from the oak moss remains, but this classic note doesn't come across as much like a men's aftershave anymore :D
Over time, the scent loses much of its citrus freshness and becomes more powdery-sweet, but not in an overwhelmingly intense way, so it still stays light and breezy.
Now many seem to smell salt here, but I find the salt to be rather subtle. Especially towards the end, the scent is, as mentioned, more sweet and powdery, with a hint of woodiness. The sweetness mainly comes from the jasmine and is generally floral and soft, but occasionally reminds me a little of tonka bean.
All in all, a very nice scent.

The sillage and longevity:
The sillage is weak, as one is used to from summer scents or fresh fragrances. This one at least stands out a bit through the bitter oak moss now and then, but even then the scent is relatively weak overall. I found the longevity to be average, around five to six hours. Especially for summer, this is quite good.

The bottle:
The bottle is rectangular with nice curves… uh, I meant with strongly rounded corners :D On the front, you see a golden label with the name of the fragrance. The neck is gilded and bears the brand name engraved in it. The cap is black and cylindrical. Everything is quite okay, but not incredibly exciting.

Okay, that was ""Sympathy for the Sun."" And even though I extremely hate the sun during heat waves, I must say that this scent turned out to be all the more beautiful, even if I shouldn't like the name of the fragrance right now :D

But honestly, the scent is not really refreshing, yet it is still light and breezy despite the sweet notes. It is soft with powdery undertones, sweetly delicious with sweet scents like jasmine, and has a slightly spicy-bitter base reminiscent of woody notes and tonka. It fits wonderfully into spring and summer with its beautiful, light aura and can be used as a daytime scent, for work, and even for going out on warm days, as it also comes across as elegant, even though it could have been a bit stronger for going out.

In my opinion, this scent is definitely very recommendable, even if it may seem quite simple in terms of scent progression. So, give it a try; it can make you feel soft, cute, and elegant, maybe even delicious :D But please don’t wear it to yoga or while… well… sun-worshipping… or else guys like me might just drop dead from heart failure… waaaah!!!
But okay, enough about my dirty fantasies, well, at least for this comment here, he he :DDD

Well then, take care and have a nice evening :)"
Rentless,07/10/2024,Dionysos2022,M,946,,2,On a Summer Day...,"...this fragrance is pleasant to wear.

Upon spraying, one gets a light apple note even though it is not listed in the fragrance pyramid. This is complemented by the freshness of mint and citrus fruits. A very slight spiciness is emitted by the juniper berry. The thyme further emphasizes the spicy note, followed by a woody note.

The longevity and sillage are below average.

This fragrance can be worn for any occasion in summer.

The perfume is no longer in production."
Barbie x Lush,08/09/2024,parfumpixie,F,357,,1,Interestingly clean,"This opens with a blast of clean solar aldehydes paired with some fresh aromatic sage. Then you get an almost bubblegummy powdery sweetness paired with some creamy warm florals. The citrus here reads like a soapiness but not in a cleaning products way, more so like clean laundry. This feels like a desert haze, a mirage even. It’s hard to describe what this really smells like but it’s such an alluring smell. The dry down reads more floral with a prominent linden blossom paired with some ambery warmth."

Lord of Misrule,10/05/2025,Sirbennyone,M,499,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,EO's All-Purpose Weapon ;),"Hello everyone,

Today I want to talk about a very, very special and unfortunately too rare EO, the ""Kambodi Gris (Eau de Parfum) | Ensar Oud / Oriscent"".

A little general information:

There are 2129 Rose - Oud fragrances from the company (number fictional, but feels true^^), x smoky, x green, xx musky beasts - but nothing that you can really wear all the time = unproblematic, pleasant, doesn't clash. I know how some think about this, and I partially agree, BUT there are also days when you might not want to hear certain comments about what you're wearing, and that's when the ""Kambodi Gris (Eau de Parfum) | Ensar Oud / Oriscent"" comes into play.

Because it is pleasant, unproblematic, doesn't clash, is ultra high quality, you feel special, etc.

How does it smell:

The actual main character here is the ambergris, BUT it is different (!). Ambergris usually has an aquatic - mineral - smoky impression like, for example, in EO normal, whether it’s ""Black Gris | Ensar Oud / Oriscent"", ""Gris Sultani | Ensar Oud / Oriscent"", or ""Jamaican Ambergris Attar | Ensar Oud / Oriscent"". Here, the smoky component is, in my opinion, almost 100% eliminated.

It feels very Western and almost not like a fragrance from EO, because it is very easy to wear.

For every season, every possible occasion!

Are there similarly scented fragrances?

Yes and no.

What comes closest to the ""Kambodi Gris (Eau de Parfum) | Ensar Oud / Oriscent"" is the V: Amber Fougere, HOWEVER this is not a fougere fragrance, it has no pepper, no sweetness - nothing.

The included lavender and rose are a very high-quality accompaniment, but nothing more, and the included Cambodian oud forms its woody foundation and, in my opinion, is perfectly balanced.

The sillage is perfectly sufficient, and it effortlessly handles a normal workday.

If there were a 50 ml bottle, I would grab it because I am quite enthusiastic about it. It is this pleasantly understated, always fitting - like a tailored suit.

If the opportunity arises = test it!

And now have a nice day/evening or whenever you read this review, best regards, Benny

Cocktail,04/28/2016,Sweetsmell75,F,210,,17,Beautiful Cara,"The lovely comments here have once again triggered a ""want-to-have"" reflex since I really enjoy powdery vanilla scents. Snagged blindly in the souk from a dear perfumer, I went straight to testing today.
Hmm... Vanilla? I don't smell it at all... but first, a green-almond note. I actually quite like it here after overcoming the initial shock of the non-vanilla :)
The vanilla doesn't really come through on my skin at first. That's okay... I like almonds too. This almond note is so beautiful, delicate, and powdery. I'm thrilled. Slowly, after about an hour, the vanilla starts to make an appearance.
Cara is a powdery scent dream made of beautiful almond milk surrounded by gentle vanilla. Not at all intrusive, not too sweet because that green feeling, wherever it may come from, is always present.
Cara is truly a fine fragrance that gently envelops the wearer in a delicate scent veil. Unisex... I don't think so... in my opinion, Cara is too feminine for that.
Of course, I also wanted to know where the almond comes from. In ALZD, the fragrance pyramid is displayed a bit differently... and so the overall picture fits :)
For those interested:
Top note: Vanilla, Sugar
Heart note: Almond, Caramel
Base note: Amber, Powdery Notes
Unfortunately, I can't provide exact information about the longevity, but sprayed 3 hours ago, the scent still smells very intense. The sillage isn't that great... but it doesn't have to be... here it suffices to feel a sense of satisfaction from this wonderful fragrance. I can imagine wearing Cara in any season.
The bottle... well, beautiful is something else, but the content matters.
Conclusion: Cara is beautiful! I'm glad to have her in my fragrance collection!"
Cocktail,05/27/2021,Velamint,M,13,HELPFUL REVIEW,17,Luxury Powder Puff,"Today, Cara moved in with me.
It was a rather spontaneous decision, as I had sworn to live alone from now on, for reasons.
Things turned out differently, and I am glad about it.
Cara is simply wonderful.
She doesn't like to be in the spotlight, yet she is hard to overlook.
She appreciates understatement, and that is precisely what makes her so appealing.
She comes on quiet feet and enchants with her lightness more than many crowd-pleasers that shout ""Make way!"" from 10 meters away.
Cara wraps you around her finger without you even noticing, and before you know it, she has come to stay.
Resolutions are made to be broken, so I gladly made room for Cara beside me.

Cara?

CARA???

Oh there you are, hmmmm……"
Cocktail,06/30/2013,Sabi,F,69,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Liquid Happiness,"This comment is dedicated to my ""scent sister"" AnnaKi :-)

Cara...the world's most beautiful vanilla scent!

Delicious, airy, and soaring it is, ""uplifting"" like the golden rays of the sun, it surrounds me like liquid happiness.

It is hard to put into words because something very special defines it; how can I do it justice? It is different from all other vanilla scents.

Sweet yet light, it has a pronounced caramel note that doesn’t feel heavy and still shows a lot of presence. The almond is more like almond milk dusted with the finest powder.

Although a gourmand with plenty of sillage and longevity, it remains as light as a golden vanilla kiss from an angel. A delicate creaminess like a spread cake batter is added; all of this is always very sweet but never too sweet. It must be the amber that ensures it is and remains an adult gourmand.

It radiates carefreeness and an inner sunshine... ""I am 8 years old and ride my bike home from school, today it ends early, I am so happy. In the warm summer air, butterflies flutter, my fingers brush past golden ears of corn along the roadside, the wind gently caresses my face... when I arrive home, my mother sets a bowl of still warm vanilla pudding with caramel sauce on the table, outside the birds are chirping, life is so beautiful""...
This feeling is what Cara transports for me.

The only question remains why on earth it is not yet in my collection;-)"
Cocktail,03/20/2014,Calista,F,102,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,High Summer Vanilla,"The Cara is beautiful.
The Cara makes you happy.
The Cara invites you to feel good.
The Cara is very clingy.
The Cara is sweet and powdery and soft.
The Cara takes me mentally through a high summer wildflower meadow in the morning, where the incredibly wonderful vanilla combines with the scent of the wild meadow for many, many hours.
The Cara is different from other vanilla fragrances, with a subtler sweetness that never overwhelms.
The Cara is sunny, blissful vanilla with powdered sugar and more summery than any other perfume.
The Cara is an absolute dream that I always love to have by my side."
Cocktail,07/21/2011,KittyHawk,F,31,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Vanilla Crescent!,"I have to agree with Sunshine - a sweet, angelic almond note garnished with vanilla sugar to comfort on dark and cold days. One wants to throw on their cozy tracksuit and then disappear under the blanket on the couch or in bed with the scent on their skin :)

The fragrance is sweet - but not cloyingly sweet. You can't directly smell the amber, but I think it’s exactly this hint that keeps the scent balanced so it doesn’t drift into girly sweetness. Thus, it remains a cozy scent for the adult woman or a sweet man *g* (mine likes such fragrances), which also surprisingly lasts well on the skin and hardly changes in its presence.

Autumn can come! (well, actually it’s almost here already *laugh*)"
Cocktail,04/18/2021,PennyPearl,F,108,,5,Dark Chocolate Mousse with Toothpaste Topping,"Cara, is that really you?!?
I heard you’re supposed to be quite sweet and playful, you actually sounded quite pretty...
Now that we’ve met in person, I have to say;
I thought I was facing a dark bitter chocolate dessert with liqueur.
Unsweetened almonds, generally no sweetness, rather bitter.
Maybe a little glass of Baileys...
I smell vanilla at 0%
An unexpected start, but it gets even stranger.
A bright dentist smell follows, which sometimes lurks in gourmand-tinged fragrances, mild toothpaste/mint gum, every vague gourmand note completely gone.
The scent now appears almost airy, like the cool freshness in the mouth after brushing teeth.
Really quite strange...

It remains a bitter musty After Eight chocolate, I guess I have to imagine vanilla with it,
roasted almonds without sugar with some insignificant powdery note somewhere in the background, which might be responsible for this mustiness that resonates.
For me, there’s no further development on the skin, it smells rather one-dimensional and weak, with just a hint of sweetness at the very end with its last strength.
And I had feared beforehand that it might be too sweet foody for me...

So I’m confused.
The fragrance pyramid and associative descriptions of others cannot align with my scent perception, unfortunately not even close..."
Cocktail,03/10/2015,Biggihi,F,131,,2,Gentle Vanilla,"Cara is the gentlest vanilla I have tested so far. Right from the start, it envelops me with its softness. After about half an hour, I was startled: marzipan. I really don't like that at all. But just half an hour later, the gentle vanilla was back and the marzipan had disappeared. And that's how it stayed for 14-15 hours."
Cocktail,02/24/2024,Dennis1104,M,995,,3,"Quite linear, but a special DNA","Cara is a special fragrance.
It conveys its own vibes and definitely leans towards a sweet gourmand-like direction.
Additionally, it is quite powdery and has a certain spiciness.

Cara doesn't have many fragrance notes, and you can tell.
The scent progression is quite linear, but that's not a problem at all, as the DNA is so special.

What does the fragrance do?
Personally, it gives me associations with certain desserts. I definitely think of rice pudding or semolina pudding. Of course, the rice pudding or semolina pudding is refined with a good portion of vanilla.

Not much more happens for me, but I find that good.
It simply has something.
However, it is also not cloyingly sweet; it even comes across with a slight ""spiciness.""
A kind of sweet spiciness.
Difficult to describe more precisely.

In conclusion, Cara is a special and unique sweet fragrance. It doesn't fully match my taste, but I appreciate it.

The performance is okay.
It lasts about 6-7 hours on me, but it becomes relatively close to the skin fairly quickly.
At least that's how it is on my skin.

Do give it a try if you want to smell something like vanilla semolina pudding or rice pudding as a perfume."
Cocktail,01/17/2014,Phelicia,F,24,,1,Scent in Disguise - the Heart of the Matter?,"At first, it was beautiful and gentle and sweet. Then it turned bitter. Then again heavenly soft. Then bitter. What is this fragrance doing? And how can I stop it? I simply prefer the pretty poodle over Mephistopheles! Aaaargh, this is driving me insane!"
Cocktail,03/28/2025,Laviniana,F,6,,1,Finally found …,"Finding Cara just before this fragrance was discontinued means the world to me.

In the 90s, The Body Shop had some glass bottles with perfume oil for testing. They were placed on a round tray.
They were really intensely fragrant and long-lasting. A drop was enough to fill a room with the scent.

The Vanilla Perfume Oil was my scent, love at first sniff. The fragrance of my youth … It was a wonderful and pure vanilla pudding or marshmallow smell, the most beautiful of all vanilla scents, intensely room-filling and long-lasting. A scent like a loving embrace, a scent to feel good … A scent that comforts you.
I needed nothing else. Until I could no longer repurchase it …
It was reformulated and later completely discontinued.

It never completely let me go …
Years later, I set out on a quest. Determined to find something comparable. Something that could similarly comfort my soul and satisfy my longing for it.

I sniffed through so many vanilla fragrances and oils, made many blind purchases because others described this or that scent as similar. But everything was far from my scent memory.

Until the day this unassuming 30ml bottle named “Cara” moved in with me. I had ordered it directly from the manufacturer at a special price in the outlet.

The adhesive label was already peeling off, it seemed rather unpromising to me. Until I sprayed it and almost cried. This is it, the scent of my youth, I was speechless and I could even stock up on it before it too was discontinued."
Flower's Barrow,12/23/2020,Scentwitch,F,292,,1,Heavy Caramel,"I’m a little surprised by the notes in this fragrance. I expected all pear, but it’s really heavy on the caramel.
My husband walked by me and said I smelled like a tree. A perplexing statement for sure, I asked to explain. He told me I smelled like tree sap. Hmmm. He didn’t like it.
I do, however.

Pear Tree smells like a vanilla dessert. Cake, perhaps, but more like pie. Pie with vanilla ice cream.
It’s great for the holidays!

Sillage: 4 feet, so really good
Longevity: good
Bottle: average"
29 High Street,05/09/2022,Lizzy90,F,2,,5,My new friend Francesca - At Mazzolari in Milan,"At Easter, I went to Milan and a visit to Mazzolari was a must. I own Vaniglia, which I love very much, and wanted to get to know the other Mazzolari fragrances, as they unfortunately do not sell sample sets. Mazzolari has 4 stores in Milan, I was in a beautiful old building near the Duomo.
The lively and very communicative saleswoman Geraldina advised me very competently. I was looking for a fresher summer scent. She recommended Francesca, which she perceives as very cheerful. I agree.
Francesca starts off citrusy fresh, shortly after that aquatic notes blend in, which I perceive throughout the entire fragrance development. It becomes slightly powdery, a few flowers peek through, until a fluffy musk becomes more present. Generally, the scent reminds me of a sea breeze in Liguria, where, alongside the sea, many colorful flowers bloom and someone has hung fresh laundry in the narrow streets. I hardly notice patchouli and sandalwood.
I am looking forward to summer, when I will test Francesca in high temperatures. She will definitely accompany me on my trip to Liguria in July."
New Romantics,12/03/2021,Philipp91,M,219,,1,Wild!,"Kenzo Jungle is a fragrance I know from my childhood. My elementary school teacher used to wear it (hopefully still does today). It was very influential. Now I really wanted to try the men's version, as the original appealed to me and I didn't want to wear a women's perfume. I must say, there are definitely some parallels between the two. But the men's fragrance is much spicier. One could say it is an early precursor to Spicebomb EdT. Not quite as sweet, a bit woody, but a full spice bomb. Sniffing out individual notes is impossible for me. But the interplay is superb. For me, it's an exotic spicy scent for cold days.

Longevity and sillage are very good, similar to Spicebomb, easily 6 to 7 hours, and you will definitely be noticed. If you don't want that, you should avoid this fragrance. If you can still find it (I have the 100ml version), it's usually around 50 to 60 euros. That's a fair price. The bottle with the zebra brush is thematically fitting, creative, and I like it."
New Romantics,12/21/2018,Farneon,M,112,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Balm for the (stressed) Soul,"Normally, I’m not a fan of Kenzo. Neither Homme, Night, nor Power appeal to me, although I wouldn’t deny that all three fragrances have a distinct character. Accordingly, my expectations for Jungle were rather low, especially since I couldn’t really imagine the interplay of the mentioned ingredients. Well, the result can definitely be appreciated on my skin. However, I do have to deduct points for the zebra-like ""bush"" on the cap of the bottle. But for those who need a built-in brush for cleaning electric shavers or similar, this might be a delight! ;-)

Now to the scent: It exudes a fresh-warm aura, fitting for the climate zone it’s named after. I would describe it as unisex rather than distinctly masculine. Fortunately, the indicated sweetness is very subtle and does not rely on the often typical tonka-vanilla combination. Citrusy wood is probably what my nose perceives the most. But there’s something else that, like with most Kenzos, provides an extremely individual note. I can’t really attribute this to any specific ingredient and would describe it as balsamic, with a hint of floral and powdery nuances.

Thus, a rounded and harmonious overall scent emerges with long-lasting wear and a pleasant sillage, more soft than abrasive, yet still very special. For me, Jungle fits perfectly into the urban jungle and is universally wearable, meaning suitable for any season and occasion. However, those expecting something herbaceous-green or even resinous-leathery from the name are mistaken. Jungle is convincingly gentle harmony that has been overlooked for far too long!"

I can feel lots of Spice connected with oriental aura around. Mystery and strong fragnance into it, interesting combination.
Its unisex, but I personally think its more for women.
Sillage is above-average, longevity too."

It then focused on the woody notes, mainly the sandalwood and oud with the carnation adding a nice bite. Mild vanilla was there; wouldn't call this a strong vanilla scent. Finally got subtle whiffs of leather. Very unique fragrance. Longevity is quite good while the sillage was only moderate for me. Considering the price, Qaa'ed is an exceptional value.

All that said, Qaa'ed didn't wow me. Will probably not be getting a FB."
25:43,05/22/2025,ClaireV,F,969,,1,"Been 'macerating' since 2021, still horrible, send help","I bought Qaa’ed for my husband in 2021 and all four of us have rued the day I did ever since. Taken in (and not for the last time, I bet) by all the mentions on Fragrantica of warm gingerbread or cardamom cookies, and conveniently ignoring all the reviews that mentioned how it smelled like a loud men’s aftershave, I imported it at some expense from Indian eBay, from whence it was dispatched – it seemed to me, given the seven weeks it took to arrive – on the back of manatees and elephants.

Exotic back story and all, you might say my expectations were high. One spray was enough to reveal the gravity of my mistake. Give it some time to ‘macerate’ they said, and that synthetic-smelling roar will die down to reveal the glories of a highly spiced, leathery, caramelized woody scent. Reader, it’s been three full years since this thing got shoved to the back of the sock drawer, and having pulled it out again just now, it is with a heavy heart that I inform you that Qaa’ed needs a full 36 months of aging to smell a mere 10% better than it did when you first opened the bottle.

Rather than tell you what’s ok about this scent (a short list indeed, and includes the bottle), I am going to tell you about what’s wrong with it. First of all, the combination of treacly, syrupy sweet notes over those brash ‘burnt wood’ aromachemicals make it smell like any generic designer scent that markets itself as ‘smoky’ or ‘oriental’ these days – anything that comes in a black bottle, basically – and is unfortunately close to the chemical marshmallow BBQ stench of By the Fireplace. The cardamom and other spice notes barely register against the burnt but radiant woody amber, so the gingerbread cookies remain trapped in your hopes and dreams rather than making it out there on your arm. Lastly, its spicy masculine leather notes take it beyond the outer limits of my personal gender stretchiness – I would no more wear this than I would Brut or Old Spice (but obviously, I am not you, so you do you).

Lastly – and yes, I know I already promised that the last point was ‘lastly’ but since my hatred of this knows no bounds, I shall continue – it contains a sulfurous chemical that smells like boiled cabbage or broccoli farts, which means it’s giving a little Hard Leather, another monstrosity, this time of the Norlimbanol sort."

The initial spray is a burst of warm, spicy notes – cardamom and cinnamon dominate, creating a comforting and intense opening. As a fan of bold scents like Spicebomb Extreme, I was immediately hooked. The drydown reveals a smooth leather note alongside the lingering cardamom. Overall, it's a warm, masculine, and spicy fragrance that punches way above its price point. Solid performance too, with 7 hours of longevity and 2 hours of decent projection."

Albeit, leather is highly dominant here and I’m definitively not a leather fan. I’m also quite new to the Oud train and I’m still learning to appreciate that historical, divisive note. From others’ reactions, this must be a great scent but perhaps not a great scent for me.

To my nose, on this paper strip, I get an artificial Oud and amber at the base with spices and spicy florals (carnations or geranium maybe?) at the top. Even on a test strip, it’s super clear this scent is optimal during cold weather. My reaction may also be coming from the fact that it’s currently 96 F/35.5 C and this scent would truly choke someone out in the heat.

I like most of the notes otherwise. To give this an honest and true fair shake, I’ll try another test strip when the temperature dips."

This fragrance is distinctly different from all the others in my collection.
Very masculine, oriental/spicy. Primarily smells of cardamom, cloves & cinnamon, while being completely unsweet.
For the first 30 minutes, an intense leather note prevails... To my surprise, the scent smells very natural and not synthetic at all.
I like to use it for layering with sweet-spicy/powdery fragrances like THE ONE EDP / DIOR HOMME INTENSE / Givenchy Gentleman or Givenchy PI.
Fortunately, it's affordable enough for a blind buy.

The scent starts off spicy sweet with a hint of saffron. The nutmeg is clearly noticeable and remains throughout the entire development, but is quickly enveloped by softer notes like vanilla and sandalwood. A fascinating interplay of the individual components, similar to what I experienced with Carlisle by PDM. Later, oud and leather join in, giving it a somewhat profound and mysteriously intriguing character. It's clear from the beginning that this is an oriental fragrance. But that it only costs a pittance, I still can't believe. Just the packaging is significantly better than many others. It comes in a round presentation box covered in faux leather. Longevity and sillage are also very good, by the way. I can only recommend that everyone give this fragrance a chance."

Many thanks to everyone - without you, I would never have come across this direction of fragrances from the East. I would have definitely missed out on something.
The first contact was quite piercing and scratchy; I also clearly noticed the motor oil mentioned in a comment. First thought: ""Well, of course, at this price."" But as often in life, good things take time. Once the top notes have evaporated, it becomes magnificent! Spicy, warm, clean, and quite oriental. In fact, it is similar to a spicier version of ""Felce Azzurra"" (Paglieri), as someone described it.
At first, I had doubts about whether I should really consider Qua'eed unisex. Although I do wear men's fragrances from time to time. (Calvin Klein, Zino, Lagerfeld, Joop...) In the meantime, I've made up my mind: it fits!! Moreover, I find it incredibly appealing that this liquid dream doesn't come off as mainstream but has its own edges. Anyone can be pleasant; one must allow oneself to be extravagant...!!
At the moment, I can't go without it. But be careful: when it comes to dosage, one should probably exercise restraint. And I say this mainly to myself, because I love to really go for it. When I go to work, I hold back... But now it's the weekend, and I'm going to let loose!! I am a talking room fragrance in my house and feel absolutely wonderful in this spicy cloud!"

Upon spraying, you immediately smell the notes of musk, saffron, and oud that are characteristic of Lattafa. A very, very nice leather note joins in.
The longevity and sillage of this fragrance are very good for Lattafa's standards! I mean that Lattafa generally has good to very good longevity, but this fragrance leans more towards the strong to very strong side in terms of longevity and sillage.

What I've noticed here.
I have to say that some spices tend to repeat themselves in Lattafa fragrances, and you can ""recognize"" them again. This is not really a problem unless you are absolutely not a fan of them.
For example, take ""Ameer Al Oudh Intense Oud | Lattafa / لطافة"" and ""Oud Mood (Eau de Parfum) | Lattafa / لطافة"" and this one ""Qaa'ed | Lattafa / لطافة""
ALL 3 have saffron in the top note and also a bit in the further development of the fragrance. You can smell this clearly, and it is the same in all 3! If you don't like it, it's best to skip all 3 fragrances (:

I also distinctly smell other well-known fragrance notes that I won't go into further. What I want to convey is that I feel or can smell that Lattafa takes a kind of ""base"" of fragrance notes here and always mixes in a new twist.
Here with ""Qaa'ed | Lattafa / لطافة"" it is the leather, with ""Oud Mood (Eau de Parfum) | Lattafa / لطافة"" it is the rose, and with ""Ameer Al Oudh Intense Oud | Lattafa / لطافة"" it is the resinous, woody note.

Overall, the fragrances are all good, and the longevity and sillage are sometimes fantastic! But they don't differ too much. Those expecting a completely different scent might be disappointed."
25:43,01/05/2023,AriGold88,M,1,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,"Spicy, sweet, and woody. Delicious!","A spiciness that, as an inexperienced perfume beginner, slightly overwhelmed me with the very first spray. However, the second sniff reveals the clearly present sweetness, which provides a very pleasant contrast and makes the scent incredibly delicious in combination. The longer the fragrance stays on the skin, the sweeter it becomes, accompanied by a light woody note. This woody-sweet base and the strong cardamom note make it one of my current go-tos.
Due to the prominent cardamom, it even vaguely reminds me of the widely popular ""La Nuit de L'Homme,"" but it feels somewhat more complex and lasts significantly longer.
For an oriental fragrance, it is overall very pleasing yet somewhat special.
The indicated oud in the heart note is perceived rather briefly and fortunately not at all animalistic or overwhelming.
I see Qaa'Ed more as a scent for the evening, in a stylish setting and well-dressed.
It is also suitable for everyday wear, but I do avoid it in the office. I find (and so do my colleagues) the sillage to be quite strong, though not completely overpowering. With such strong scents, I tend to refrain from bombarding my colleagues in the office.

Absolutely no one would guess that this fragrance is available for under €20. It smells really high-quality, surprisingly natural, and exciting. I have not encountered a better price-to-quality ratio with any perfume so far.

I personally find the bottle beautiful and eye-catching, although my wife commented, ""It looks like it’s from a flea market."" I can't relate to that. Of course, the golden casing is made of plastic, but the bottle still has a certain appeal."

Although the fragrance is listed for men, I think women can rock it just as well. Sure, the opening smells quite masculine, but after a minute, the aftershave opening has already faded away.

What unfolds is a carpet of smoky woods, leather, sweet spices, and vanilla. And it stays that way until it slowly fades away.

The longevity is truly enormous.. and the sillage leaves nothing to be desired. On clothing, it can still be smelled for days..

Worn alone, it is a masterpiece, but together with the fragrance oil Choco Musc, Schmitz's cat really takes off. A combo made for each other - definitely give it a try!"

25:43,12/14/2023,Joshless,M,23,,6,A Budget King That Deserves More Hype,"For months, I had been searching for a spicy-oriental fragrance that isn't too overpowering or screams bazaar.

During a sniffing excursion at ""Haltane | Parfums de Marly,"" which was definitely out of my budget at the time, I stumbled upon Qaa'ed through Parfumo. By the way, the two fragrances have very little in common (why they are listed as ""similar"" remains a mystery to me).

Fortunately, I like Qaa'ed, for which I promptly got a decant, much better - at least for the actual purpose of explicitly searching for something spicy-oriental:
A woody heart surrounded by nutmeg and saffron. In the drydown, a light but noticeable hint of vanilla comes through. The initially quite dominant nutmeg becomes pleasantly tamed and is complemented by a leathery note.

With a longevity of 7-8 hours and a moderate sillage (which diminishes a bit after 5 hours), Qaa'ed is already a price-wise no-brainer, but it doesn't stop there:

The presentation leaves (in typical Lattafa fashion) little to be desired. Just from its appearance, one could easily find oneself in the 10-20 times price range.
The faux leather feels more premium than most counterparts used in accessories or automobiles. Positive madness!

Why Qaa'ed doesn't receive the hype of ""Khamrah / خمرة | Lattafa / لطافة"" or ""Asad | Lattafa / لطافة"" is beyond me. Clones or not. As one of the cheapest fragrances from Lattafa, Qaa'ed is one of the few Lattafa scents that made me think, ""my goodness, this smells like really good niche!"""

The (nutmeg) top note then gradually fades away, taking with it some of the magic, the uniqueness, the intrigue, but leaving behind a warm creamy veil with little leather, which has lost its entire sillage after 2-3 hours.

For just around 17 euros, it's a good addition to any collection for those who want a warm vanilla-sandalwood scent with that certain extra.
But also thanks to its good longevity and sillage, it's worth a blind buy.

Definitely more of an autumn and winter fragrance for me, or generally for cool evenings, where the vanilla and sandalwood bring a certain warmth and the nutmeg adds a bit of pep to the atmosphere."

Overall, it creates an incredibly smooth impression; a scent can't be rounder for me. This is how I imagine a ""warming"" companion for cold times, one you want to snuggle up to. It leans somewhat towards ""Halston Man Amber | Halston,"" but is softer and feels even more balanced to me. A fragrance that won't clash anywhere.

By the way, I can't understand the similarity to ""Midnight Oud (Eau de Parfum) | Ard Al Zaafaran / ارض الزعفران التجارية"" at all; for me, there are no parallels whatsoever.

The bottle is great, and the sprayer, like with most Lattafas, is good. However, I particularly want to highlight the packaging here. I have really thrown away every packaging so far, except for the can of ""Le Mâle Eau Fraîche Popeye Edition | Jean Paul Gaultier."" But I will keep the one from Qaa'ed. Either Lattafa manages to give faux leather a perfectly authentic leather scent, or Qaa'ed actually comes in a can that is covered with real, very fine leather.

The opening is really interesting..I didn't detect any rose first off, it is more of a wisp of gentle smoke,with a touch of the almond and apricot. I have found this slight smoke accord to be present in most of the Tauer perfumes, but this is only a faint touch in this fragrance. I must say, the rose accords are very light, and soft. In his other creation. Une Rose Chypree) my favorite of his rose fragrances, The Rose is very pronounced, and bold. It's almost as if this rose is hiding in the mist, and just peeking through. This fragrance, in my opinion, is very feminine..even though it's classed as a unisex fragrance).The dry down is very soft, as well, and I did re-apply after two hours to have a sort of second round of options. I enjoyed wearing it, but was expecting something much stronger, or perhaps bolder is a better word. Another interesting point, every review I have read on this fragrance has been really varied. Some have said it's really rich, and bold, others have had a similar experience to mine, in that it is a soft scent. It doesn't come across as very sweet, I would say the notes are very nicely balanced. The slight tobacco note is pleasant, and there seems to be just a touch of patchouli..which stays very close to the skin. I didn't find the sillage strong, but it is detectable. I hope to order this in the Tauer Explorer set, as I do like it, Yes, a lovely, but gentle Rose, wrapped in the softest silk."
The Comforter,12/09/2013,hedonist222,M,26,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Marzipan Noir,"Opening is a handful.
It starts out unapologetic.
All notes radiating at maximum capacity.
Bitter almond (no sweetness) and apricot made dusty by the tobacco leaves. A faint sparkle from the bergamot.
The tonka balances the patchouli.
No dainty frills.
There's an overall austere mood to it.
There's a strong correlation between it & Rahat Loukoum.
I'm getting a likeness to that supple leather & plum accord in Boxeueses.
But here it's supple leather & almond.
I'm GLAD the rose isn't prominent at all.
We all love roses but there are enough outstanding rose perfumes available.
There is rose and I can tell its not the regular fluffy rose but its not rose centered.

Then an interplay of notes commences.
Here is where Andy's craftsmanship in complexity is most vivid.

The premise is as such:
A bonding of gourmand & noir (leathery resinous accord)
Composition :
The apricot & almond create a marzipan accord. The gourmand aspect.
The tobacco (excessive use of) , geranium & musk make up the noir effect.
This demonstrates Andy's craftsmanship with complex compositions.
It opens with strong presence then harmoniously transitions to its peak purpose -interplay of gourmand & leathery/resinous (dark)- and then settles to a base that is the sum of all its parts.
I'd have named it Marzipan Noir."
The Comforter,11/15/2013,Pipette,F,122,,6,PHI - Une Rose de Kandahar,"Andy Tauer's latest rose creation is another gem. A gem as such. I don't know what PHI stands for, but I read in his blog that it is a rose scent with precious, natural absolue ingredients ... and therefore a limited edition. The next harvest oil may not turn out the same exact batch. Notes and technical background are not my forte, but what I can put is my impression of this perfume.

It envelops you like a soft cloud. Roses, roses with a touch of slighty bitter brownness ... I suppose the cinnamon, geranium and almond have something to do with that. That takes the edge of a brilliant rose and makes an almost skin scent, so warm and close. It projects only a little, actually I had to spray on a lot, but then it lasts the major part of the day. The beauty is that the sillage and skin smell alike, and I cannot stop stiffing up closely and delight how good it smells.

It does not hit the nose like mainstream perfumes do with a boost of flowerbomb notes and a lot of sweetness, rather it is a soft veil where beautiful, delectable, almost gourmand (caramel candy) notes swirl around also. Tobacco leaves? Maybe. If so, that is one good aromatic soft and subtle tobacco.

The best reviews you will find in Kafka's blog. Refer to that if you really want to know.

If I did not have already similar perfumes, I would buy it when it is available in a Tauer Perfumes Explorer Set. Those are easier for shipping as postal air shipment restrictions hinder the flow.

Thumbs up. Another scent well worthy of Andy Tauer's reputation. I have the feeling that it may become a landmark, a big success."
The Comforter,02/24/2015,Drseid,M,828,,3,"Another Tauer, Another Pass...","PHI opens with a slightly fruity apricot, with whiffs of piercing rose and bitter almond. As the composition moves to its early heart the rose remains in support, but moderately powdery, slightly creamy vanilla emerges as co-star with the slightly bitter almond. During the late dry-down the composition is all about the powdery vanilla that turns relatively dry, supported by rooty vetiver, light musk and remnants of the almond losing its bitter facet through the finish. Projection is excellent, as is longevity at nearly 15 hours on skin.

Let's get the positive aspects of PHI out of the way quickly... The composition has some great performance metrics and is obviously well-made. In addition to the impressive performance, the composition has a tolerable late dry-down that is unobtrusive and wearable. OK, now that is out of the way we can focus on the rest of the composition's attributes, and they all disappoint big time. Maybe disappoint is unfair because that implies one expected something better to begin with. I feel guilty panning yet another one of Mr. Tauer's compositions, but something about his trademark dusty vanilla base is just so annoying it ruins every one of them, and PHI is no exception. Also not helping matters is that while rose is supposedly the featured note (and it certainly is in the composition) the bitter almond mixed with the dusty, slightly sweet vanilla really is the focus and it doesn't smell good. I wouldn't go as far as to say the composition is a scrubber, but I did think about it several times, particularly in the key mid-section as the vanilla almond is at its strongest and most displeasing. At the end of the day the only one to blame for my torture in wearing this is me. I haven't found one Tauer composition I have liked yet, so why would I expect any different with PHI? The bottom line is the $160 per 50ml PHI Une Rose de Kandahar has a couple positive attributes easily drowned by an avalanche of negatives, earning it a ""poor"" rating of 2 stars out of 5 and an avoid recommendation."
The Comforter,12/16/2014,MasterLi,M,376,,5,Rose of the mountains...,"This is a phenomenal fragrance! Really beautiful stuff. So far I have never been disappointed by any fragrance by Andy Tauer. This is my third one. I have to say I am enjoying this one quite a lot.

To me this is typical of most Tauer fragrances. It is a heavy, spicy kind of smell. My first love was his fragrance Le Maroc pour Elle which was inspired by Morocco, and which had heavy amber, jasmine and spices. This one has it's origins in Afghanistan. Kandahar is a very famous city there and close by there are fields near the mountains where poppies are grown (for opium). Afghanistan is not all desert, there are many high mountains with snow and green fields and fruit trees all fed by ice cold mountain water from the rivers and streams. In such a place, roses also grow, a ""mountain rose""... and those are the roses used by Tauer in this fragrance.

It opens up with heavy spice, with almonds, tobacco, cinnamon, bergamot. For me the strongest note here is the tobacco. Dry tobacco leaves mixed with spices (the same leaves used to make cigars). I think there is a rose here, but it's not quite a ""rose"" fragrance. It;s a deep, spicy perfume with a little rose. A very ""dusty"" rose. I also get the ambergris, tonka bean, vetiver, patchouli and vanilla. It's very dark. If this fragrance had a colour, I think it would be dark red, or like a brown red colour. This is like deep, dark red wine. It has the same feeling to me. Personally I like it, but I know it may be a little heavy and ""weird"" for some people out there.

Une Rose de Kandahar is a fragrance with quite a unique smell (but not unique if you know the Tauer house). It's a very spicy scent with heavy musk as well as rose. So don't expect a huge rose in your face. But I think it's really beautiful. I sprayed it on earlier and one or two sprays stayed with me for at least 3 hours. It's a very beautiful fragrance. I would say only buy this if you are a huge fan of the Tauer house. Because it is a limited edition (he buys the rose oil from only one field in Afghanistan and each year the roses finish... so he has to wait until the next year to make more perfume). That's why it is a limited edition. One to try and sample first (because of the high price)."

The Comforter,10/28/2021,MariaS,F,23,,2,"""The earth laughs in flowers""","Not sure who said this, but this quote came into my mind when I smelled this perfume and it could be an alternative name for it. Why? Because its a dusty earthy floral scent...not an ordinary rose scent.

Generally:

I am not fan of rose fragrances even the most known as oud satin mood, atomic rose, etc. Its just not my taste... I believe that because I am used to smelling rose in other things at home, like cloth detergent, closet scent sachets, room diffusers and other things we use at home, that I am bored of this scent and I just dont want it on me. Or at least I dont want it when it has the main role in the fragrance. All those home stuff are most targeted for women so most of them has a rose scent.
Lately, I was obsessed into getting a rose fragrance so I started testing the most known and high rated rose fragrances such as portrait of a lady, rose d arabie, rose de mai, a la rose, intense cafe, wardasina, radical rose, etc , but none of them made me reach my wallet for it! Desperately, I decided to blind buy one. Une rose de Kandahar. I have read all good stuff about this fragrance even that its a gourmand (I love gourmands) so I decided to make the move.

About the fragrance:

When I first sprayed it, I wasnt blown away like ""OMG. this is awesome"", I was just ""hm...ok...not bad..."". This scent is the type of scent that gives you headaches with its intensity that I believe its coming from the bergamont, the bourbon geranium and the patchouli. From its notes, I dont get any cinnamon, vanilla, vetiver and tonka. It is a very dusty, dirty, powdery rose enhanced by geranium and patchouli in a beautiful well blended way. It is a sweet scent but I would not characterize it as Gourmand. Its not that sweet because of the intese dustiness.

Most common questions:

How will you characterize the scent?
It is a powdery dirty sweet rose scent.

Is it a safe blind buy or a gift?
No to both. Its a diffiucult scent, not an ordinary mass appealing scent. You need time to understand and appreciate it.

Is it for women or men?
This scent is totally unisex and I must say that I will love it more on a man.

Is it for summer or winter?
Definitely a scent for cold weather.

What occasions can I wear it?
It is not an everyday scent that you can wear at the office or to chill out with friends. Its a scent that you can wear in formal occasions with a dress or a tux.

Does it reminds you of another rose fragrance?
No. Une rose de Kandahar, is far from an ordinary rose scent and this is what I loved in it and kept it. It has the Tauer DNA, its like Au Cuer du Desert or L air du Desert but with rose...

Thank you for your time, hope I helped you understant it.

Stay safe and smell great!"
The Comforter,02/16/2016,Katad,F,58,,2,Phi - a simple rose,"the progression of scents for me went like this:
1 - very strong acrid rose, the metallic acridity went away quickly however then came a very fresh, green rose.
2 - rose strongly infused with peach.
3 - a very lovely powdery rose finish. very beautiful at the end.
for me this scent did not have very good sillage or longevity - it was mostly gone in 3 hours."

The Comforter,06/14/2025,Reddawks,M,82,,1,He who seeks reality finds poetry,"Originality doesn’t come from a desire to be unique, but from a desire to be sincere.
This is true for perfume, as it is for everything else.
And sincerity begins when we ask questions, when we explore.

Jón Kalman Stefánsson once wrote:
""He who seeks reality finds poetry.
He who seeks poetry finds himself.
He who seeks himself can travel between worlds.""

I don’t know if Andy Tauer can travel between worlds,
but I’m quite certain he’s searching for poetry—his own kind of poetry.

And the rose he brought back from his universe smells like no other.
It’s a rose of almond paste, vanilla, and apricot.
Beautiful enough to be kept under a glass dome,
but far too innocent to be robbed of its freedom.

Phi (that’s her name) isn’t a seducer’s rose.
It’s an honest one—perhaps even a gourmand—
one that makes mistakes, but means every word.

And we always underestimate just how seductive sincerity can be.

The Comforter,12/28/2020,Ptsau,F,65,,1,Divine natural modern kind of rose scent. It’s a LOVE!,"I’m very picky on rose fragrances as they are normally very feminine or mature but this one is very different, rich but not strong, unisex, and modern. Love this rose mix with almond, tobacco and vanilla. Plus the slight touch of the apricot. The whole composition makes it a smooth warm gourmandy scent. The rose smells so high quality. It becomes one of favorite rose fragrances besides Oud Satin Mood and Intense Cafe. These are the only 3 roses I like so far. The only downside is that the performance is considerably weak compared to other Andy Tauer creations although it’s still better than many fragrances out there. Lasts only 7-8 hours and projects only for 3 hours on my skin, then would turn to skin scent but the scent is so gorgeous enough to make me overlook the performance issue. Love Love Love!"
The Comforter,02/09/2019,PMRP12,M,37,,1,Creative and unique rose gourmand,"This one surprised me with its creative take on a rose gourmand. And not the usual rose and chocolate combo, but rather, an apricot, almond, and vanilla rose. It’s sweet and alluring with bright stone fruit and gentle cinnamon at the opening, and dries down to include an addictive nutty tobacco tonka combo that has me sniffing my wrist all day. This is my favorite rose to date, and a scent I can’t stop thinking about. Highly considering a bottle..."
The Comforter,10/14/2025,schnauzer,M,105,,1,"Sweet, warm, spicy rose","One of the more accessible scents from this house, and yet still quite unique and interesting. Lovely rose is accompanied by green notes, tobacco, and tonka bean, all of which are kept in careful balance. A bit of sweetness keeps this quite approachable, while the spiciness adds some mystery. The base is warm and delicious, without being overly gourmand.

I like it."

The Comforter,11/09/2021,Ponticus,M,79,,116,"An attempt to say it with flowers! Clichés, phrases, expressions!","Let’s get up close and personal with the perfume and see if the chemistry is right.
Let’s take a closer look at Rose de Kandahar, separating the wheat from the chaff.

The scent comes on strong like Blücher, there’s no skimping, only boldness.
At first, the apricot-like fruitiness hits immediately with a fresh-spicy punch.
Cinnamon throws its hat into the ring but quickly shifts down a gear.
Bitter almond stands at the ready, ensuring that sweetness doesn’t take center stage.
The rose is still a shadow of its former self, backed against the wall.
The strong scent of damp hay conceals the rose like a needle in a haystack.

It’s high time for the rose, or it won’t be worth a shot of powder.
And it won’t let anyone take the butter off its bread, stepping up its game.
The rose rises like a phoenix from the ashes and makes a powerful statement.
It masters its rosy facets effortlessly, everything is in harmony.
We’re floating on cloud nine, experiencing a scent sensation as if resting on roses.
The slight bitterness of the almond remains the salt in the not-so-sweet soup.
To counter the floral nature of the rose, tobacco is raised as a banner.

The tobacco plays well against the rose and appears cheeky as Oscar.
The scent stands at a crossroads, but the rose keeps the tobacco in check.
The crux is that both have a lot going on behind the scenes.
Ultimately, the tobacco supports the rose and extends a hand.
The rosy-warm spiciness of both runs like a red thread through the scent.
But it’s not all over yet; not everything is settled.

The perfume base, as the ace up the sleeve, crowns the scent.
Cinnamon has made its exit, musty-woody vetiver plays the filler.
Vanilla gently knocks on the door but keeps the ball quite flat.
Bitter almond lingers almost to the bitter end but now gives up the spoon.
Marzipan-like tonka bean jumps into the breach, sweetness chuckles to itself.
Patchouli has a dirty secret, earthy-woody hits the nail on the head.
There we have the salad, but patchouli has made its calculations without the host.
This doesn’t take the wind out of the rose’s sails; it shows what it’s made of.
This rose is thorny and has teeth, earthy-floral it stays in the game.
And it maintains a bitter-sweet-dark grip until the end, lucky us.

As a rose scent, it’s the egg of Columbus; Une Rose de Kandahar hits the mark perfectly.
Thick air at arm’s length for about 6 hours, the end of the line is after 10 hours.
Packaging and Tauer bottle are old news; the high price doesn’t bother me.

A weight has been lifted from my heart. I hope you don’t get cold feet while reading,
don’t let your head hang low or grow gray hairs!
I’m keeping my fingers crossed for everyone!"
The Comforter,09/13/2015,FabianO,M,1008,,41,"Highly complex, multifaceted rose-tobacco-stone fruit oriental","It has a lot to offer, this Tauer!

That we only know the city of Kandahar (unfortunately) from the news due to political turmoil and military conflicts is bad enough; the horrific events in Afghanistan have overshadowed any awareness of the culturally magnificent components of this world region and its neighboring countries for decades.

I don't just mean the valuable essences, spices, and resins that bring us Europeans so much joy in fragrances, but also the mythical Arabic music, beautifully played by Anouar Brahem, for example.

This connection is always fundamental for me, as a freshly applied oriental fragrance pairs wonderfully with said Arabic music in the background, allowing one to be atmospherically transported to the distant Orient.

The ""Rose from Kandahar"" truly deserves a longer, more elaborate commentary, as it represents a remarkable work of art.

The beginning already hints that much more aromatic richness will follow. First, it hits you hard, getting the entire olfactory apparatus into gear: lightly dried apricot slices, somewhat fruity and sweet, are paired with a very moderately used cinnamon. Here we already have the culinary Orient, which - and this is what makes Tauer's refinement - finds an ideal counterbalance in a beautifully contrasting bitter almond, preventing it from becoming too sweet or cloying.

In fact, this fragrance apparently always has two sides or two faces: superficially flattering, sweet, festive, yet subtly serious, dark, and contemplative.

The rose, which reveals itself in the apricot-cinnamon opening, is intense, powerful, and at times disturbing.
This is not an inviting or brightly feminine rose at first glance, but rather a shady, earthy, vegetal one.

This impression can be further intensified by a generously added tobacco absolute, which brings an incredible amount of grounding in the autumnal brown spectrum.

That the fragrance, despite this aromatic power, appears harmonious, aesthetic, and simply artistic may be attributed to the gentler base, which, in the form of tonka bean and mild patchouli, always allows the star, the complex rose, to take the lead, merely softening, dampening, and caressing around it.

Truly a highly remarkable and experiential fragrance, where one can indeed concede that the demanded premium price is not merely a show and image effect, but is based on excellent quality and artisanal mastery."
The Comforter,05/10/2018,Meggi,M,1018,,37,At least a promising side effect,"I’ll keep it short: I can’t get along with ‘Une Rose de Kandahar’.

The Comforter,06/02/2020,LadyLuxifer,F,12,,38,SUB ROSA,"""RhNUDX1 from Quandhar""

Many think that roses bloom only once a year. This is not true. The queen has her secrets, many secrets.

If you connect the tips of the petals of a wild rose two at a time, you get the Drudenfuß, the mystical pentagram, an ancient magical sign, the secret symbol that guarded the understanding of the harmonious structure of humanity and the universe. Therefore, the wild rose, which carefully seals its bud sanctuary from the outside world, became the embodiment of the mysterious and the discreet. Ultimately, this symbolism was transferred to all roses.

The fact that the rose has been regarded as a symbol of discretion since ancient times is said to stem from the following event: To hide the love affair of his mother, the goddess of love Venus, Cupid sent roses to Harpocrates, the god of silence, and asked him to keep the secret. The ancient Egyptians dedicated the rose to the god Harpocrates. The Romans hung a rose from the ceiling at gatherings to remind those present of their duty to silence. Pope Hadrian had confessionals adorned with rose carvings - on old confessionals, you can still occasionally see them - the decoration also known as the silent rose. The stucco rose above the common table had this meaning as well. In the High Middle Ages, rose images were also placed in wine taverns and council halls to allow for confidential conversations. Sometimes, a fresh rose would symbolically hang on the door of the city council to indicate ""sub rosa."" In England, it is a custom to place a sword on a table strewn with roses when the council meets to elect the Mayor of London. The Rosicrucians, a secret society, even carry the rose as a symbol of discretion in their name. The modern writer Umberto Eco also plays with this symbolism in his novel ""The Name of the Rose""!

The rose is a mysterious and beautiful queen.

To describe the scent of the rose, everyday language simply lacks the words. In the high cultures of early history, the knowledge of plant scents and their application was alive and widespread. The realization that scents directly affect the human brain and can be used for healing is successfully applied today in aromatherapy.

The rose scent contains 450 known and 120 yet unknown components. The distribution on the flower is very different: in the outer part of the flower, rose alcohols - including citronellol, geraniol, and nerol - attract bees, bumblebees, and hornets. However, these substances repel other insects. Next, the pollinating insects enter a phenyl-ethanol intoxication. They crawl dizzily further into the center of the rose, where familiar scents like eugenol and citral greet them. The rather spicy, clove-like eugenol and citral, a warm citrus scent, are related to scents found in beehives. They wave their bodies and brush off the pollen of other flowers, leading to pollination. The scent of the rose solely aims to attract insects for pollination. Although bees cannot perceive the color red, they are still drawn to red roses because they are attracted by the scent and not by the color.

And humans?

Humans operate according to the pleasure principle. They seek fun and enjoyment. Scents are the only things that reach the brain directly without intermediaries. Therefore, scents offer us an incredible potential for pleasure.

“Une Rose de Kandahar” is lustful. Very lustful.

As the sixth fragrance ever, “Une Rose de Kandahar” makes it into my top 10 list. It is not easy to get in there. I am on a quest. I want to assign all categories to this one fragrance, such as the best leather scent, the best vetiver, etc.

“Une Rose de Kandahar” is for me THE rose scent. A fragrance like life itself, affirming, uplifting, fulfilling, and blissful. I do not like these comparisons with dead roses. This rose is alive. It breathes and laughs, enjoys life, and is like a small, blissful child. It rejoices and jumps in circles. Even if it comes from a painful place, this rose enchants me with its zest for life!
Quandhar was the place of the ancient Indo-Persian gathering, a trade hub and cultural meeting point between India, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Quandhar has been destroyed many times, yet we know that some things are virtually indestructible.

Just like the rose from Kandahar.

I believe that each of us hopes to leave some kind of mark, something ""to be remembered for."" Andy Tauer has created a masterpiece with this fragrance. No one can take that away from him. The rest of his fragrances somehow do not reach me, but this rose...

I have already written in my statement that I lack the words to describe this fragrance. Even today, I do not feel much better. My favorite author here, FabianO, has already said everything and more...fruity, rosy, shady, earthy, but all together a perfection. The perfection!

This fragrance is a must-have!

In this composition, in my opinion, what one calls the essence of a rose is preserved, namely the RhNUDX1. What is that?

https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=RhNUDX1"
The Comforter,11/11/2015,Ergreifend,F,528,,36,The Atomic Bomb,"When it hisses and crackles and strikes like lightning.
When your body trembles.
When the prickliest goosebumps spread across your body.
When it penetrates your skin like an invisible force that holds you captive.
When suddenly all stimuli and senses overwhelm you.
When your most intimate thoughts ride a wild carousel.
When your happiness hormones burst out of your body like Smarties.
When your ears buzz, muted by a breathtaking power.
When your knees tremble.
When you have sweaty hands.
When your heart almost skips into your pants.
When your eyes are covered by a fine, wet layer and you have to pause to avoid bursting into tears. Before a meter-thick layer of joy, as hard as a chunk of brick.
When all thoughts tear away from you and worries are thrown around the corner.
When silence spreads that you can hardly explain.
When everything points at you and attention turns against you..

Yes then - then you have been hit by the atomic bomb of Une Rose de Kandahar!

What a bombastic fragrance, in the truest sense of the word!
Une Rose de Kandahar is not a shy child of the perfume world, but a cunning bomb that penetrates your skin so vehemently that it is hard to pull it out from under it.
Nothing here suggests soft features, but rather many pronounced edges and extremely sharp corners.
And when a perfume makes my most intimate thoughts ride a wild carousel and takes me out of action, then everything has already been said and done. Done perhaps not yet, because it now ranks at the top of my wish list.

The atomic bomb begins its overture, as expected, with an unimaginable intensity. The scent rolls in with a towering, black wave that carries tons of cinnamon. In addition, a candied fruit already enters the scene. Spices are presented abundantly and have no intention of settling down quietly. Only slowly does the wave return to calm, and it is almost silent at sea. But then an unimaginably beautiful rose appears, making my spirit bloom. Yes, I praise the scent to the heavens, because this rose is truly something special. At first, it pricks me, then I only feel caresses. Rose petals on bare, pure skin. Dim light. Warm air. Sensory immersion. Completion. Ecstasy.

The longer I remain in this ecstasy, the less I am aware that strong tobacco leaves are seeping into the fragrance. It comes only gradually and not as harshly anticipated. Because I thought at first contact that the rose would play the concert all by itself. Far from it! The pairing of tobacco with the rose is a truly grand olfactory experience that I have rarely encountered. Tobacco, initially really rough and dense, then rather soft and flowing. Pure enjoyment! Cinnamon remains discreet in the background, giving the fragrance, along with the approaching vanilla, a gourmand touch. Tonka then crowns the whole thing. My heart feels warm.

Rose petals continue to fall upon me. Tobacco, over time, only adorns the background, and the rose makes it clear who has the say between them. As the scent winds down, it becomes only softly resinous, with a hint of smoke. This does not diminish the rose, as it takes another run-up. The gourmand touch always lingers in the scent. Like a slumbering phase of the Orient. Pink powder clouds adorn my dream. I would love to fall onto them inside and let myself be caught.

Quiet really means something else! A fragrance with enormous longevity and the sillage is truly noteworthy. It comes in! It annihilates many sensations, even if it also scares some. Because it is complex and one needs time and patience to get to know it. To do justice to Une Rose de Kandahar. As beautiful as its name is, I give it the additional name: Atomic Bomb!"
The Comforter,07/29/2019,DerDefcon,M,132,,30,Imagination,"Afghanistan … a beleaguered but still fascinating country with so many facets. I have not been there yet, and I do not plan to go there anytime soon; who could blame me? Yet, what one hears and sees about this mysterious land awakens curiosity and a desire for discovery. So, in this comment, I must let my imagination guide me. In my world of imagination, I am a tourist in a peaceful Afghanistan that I can explore freely and without danger. I take the liberty to fantasize accordingly for this comment - well aware that this fantasy is currently of a utopian nature.

I think of the hospitality and warmth, those character traits that are often said to be innate to the people there, especially to those who have little. I think of the scorching heat that sometimes drives me, as an average Central European, to despair, and how I cling to every water bottle and every piece of fruit to stay hydrated. The locals seemed to understand my suffering and offered me a basket of apricots, a bit of cinnamon, and to have something solid between my teeth, a few bitter almonds, whose aroma came into full bloom while chewing and beautifully accompanied the compote I had made myself, consisting of mashed apricots and cinnamon sticks. I immediately felt better - yes - even invigorated and gastronomically spoiled, and I left the village and its inhabitants to make my way to the next one.

The temperatures gradually dropped. While the days here can be unbearably hot, the nights can also become biting cold. This night was to be one of those. The sky was clear, the stars sparkled, and I saw our Milky Way for the first time. No artificial light, as we know it in our densely populated countries, clouded that atmosphere.
I reached the next village. The moonlight illuminated the large cluster of clay huts in a haunting way, winds blew over the fields, which would again be struck by the glare of the high, hot sun the next day. The closer I got to the clay hut that was designated for my accommodation, the stronger I perceived a floral aroma that must have originated from the accompanying rose garden. Tired from my day trip, I entered this garden full of curiosity. The floral, so dark aroma intensified, flooding my nasal cavities. These roses were not at all fruity, not playful, but mystical, dark, unpretentious, ripe, illuminated by the moon, thorny, dominant, companions of the Afghan night.
Enchanted by that olfactory delight, I entered my accommodation. The village elder was already waiting for me and embraced me warmly, showed me my bed, and promptly left me alone, as he must have recognized upon my entering the hut that my eyes were nearly closing while standing. So I lay down, the roses were to accompany me into sleep together with the freshly harvested tobacco stored in a large sack standing right next to my bed. And so I fell asleep after just a few minutes - almost tipsy from this warming, sweet aura - and was awakened the next morning with tea and a bit of bread. Just the evening before, I had communicated that they need not go to great lengths for me. Nevertheless, they made a great effort with the tea. My guest gift to the village elder was now in that tea they served me - a vanilla tea, whose aroma filled the entire hut, complemented the tobacco, and was subtly accompanied by the rose. All of this evoked associations of cherry tobacco, which, although I am a non-smoker and do not know much about hookahs, made me want to linger longer. It must have been this combination of vanilla and roses that made me smell it this way. Anyway … I did not want to leave here anymore. This warmth, so inviting, so heartfelt, so cozy, held me captive to that place, yet I knew that it would eventually be time to wake up again.
Dear readers,

So this is how Afghanistan smells? Do you know? I do not. That was just a fantasy, trying to obscure all the terrible things in that country. Perhaps I am completely wrong with it, if a fantasy can be wrong, and your associations, images, and ideas, my dear readers, are entirely different. But as I said … it is a fantasy, and so we will leave it at that and perhaps enjoy it together, no matter how utopian it may seem in light of the situation in this mysterious land."
The Comforter,06/17/2018,IrisNobile,F,23,,29,Un Rose de Kandahar ...... Symphony of Floral-Spicy Abundance .....,"your spice refines juicy fruits -
your roses enchant the senses -
with you I let myself fall -
onto a soft bed -
of musk and vanilla -

I don't really want to write poetry - - but I am once again enchanted - and more than impressed - -
in this case by a rose scent!! …..
Rose scents ……. actually not my desired fragrance direction - , because they usually come across as too flowery harmless, sweet, and boring ……

Different with this beautiful rose from the Middle East, which, after I have freed it from its Pentagon -, conveys the following to my senses ……

Once you have overcome the few steps from the slightly musty-earthy cellar with large strides and reached the bright garden, whose magnificent roses lean lushly and heavily into the light and impregnate the air along with its full-bodied fruits -, you are reconciled.
Reconciled with the beginning of this fragrance, which might scare some at first …….
I suspect it is the patchouli in the base, which pushes itself dramatically to the forefront for my nose right from the start and creates a typical and often described, slightly musty impression.
In agreement with an immediately present citrus note, it tries to assert itself a bit, but in this intensity it quickly recedes to create a beautiful rounding later in this concert …….

First come the apricots - - then the roses ;)

When I enter this garden after the subjectively perceived musty intermezzo -, I first smell the ripeness of juicy apricots, infused with the aroma of cinnamon and almonds, which somewhat capture the fruitiness of the fragrance and round it off gourmandishly …….. above all, a delicate warm spice hovers - , possibly stemming from the tobacco that deliciously weaves in, the vetiver, and the essential oil of special Afghan roses from the Nangarhar province, which, according to the description, also contributes a certain spicy component with its aroma of spices and plums.

The fantastic interaction of the ingredients listed in the pyramid results in a delicate fruity-powdery, minimally spicy event, in which the softened patch takes on the role of the powdery effect, and in which the wonderful roses secretly frolic …..
secretly - - …. , because they do not predominantly determine the perfume, but rather carry it along cleverly, thus giving the scent a velvety depth and a very noble aura. - - I also believe I can perceive delicate woody notes in between.

Equally at the end of their virtuoso performance, the actors of this magnificent artifact sink under the influence of subtly sweet amber on a powdered soft musk-vanilla cloud and form a fantastic drydown.
And in contrast to my skeptical attitude towards sweet rose waters, this fragrance does not convey the impression of an arbitrary perfume of this species at any stage.

A creation that absolutely enchants unisex and, in its sillage effect, makes a real statement without being overly assertive.
The longevity extends from day into night. And with the warmth of summer days/nights, the fragrance wafts enchants the wearer and their environment even more in my opinion.

Andy Tauer is probably not able to produce this perfume in a consistently uniform quantity - , as the oil of these special roses is not available in unlimited supply ………
therefore - - one should not be afraid of scarcity - and if it pleases - then bunker purchases are worthwhile ;) :)

for the never-ending fragrance concert of the abundance of lush summer gardens ….. :))"
The Comforter,03/03/2021,Sisyphos,M,143,,23,Bitter Sweet Symphony,"How beautiful the ingredient rose is in a perfume, in whatever form, became truly clear to me many years ago when I got to know Zino by Davidoff (the version with italic font before the dilution). There are indeed parallels to Phi - Une Rose de Kandahar. Both share a spicy-oriental character. However, there are also marked differences. Phi is noticeably fruitier and more floral, overall sweeter, and less woody than Zino. Nevertheless, Phi contrasts the floral sweetness with a dark, very oily, slightly bitter, and spicy note. This rose oil-like quality is particularly characteristic. It has almost a medicinal aspect at the beginning, without being sharp. A fabulous Bitter Sweet Symphony.

A connection can also be made to Lumière Noire pour Homme by MFK. This one is certainly lighter, more transparent than Phi, and in its flawlessness also more abstract. LpH is overall fresher. Phi, on the other hand, is more sensual. The fragrance makes no secret of placing the apricot fruit and marzipan right at the center. But only to capture both components with fresh, darkly spicy tobacco. Here, those who can appreciate Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford might feel addressed. Interestingly, Phi is owned by more men than women on parfumo (as of 03.03.2021). In terms of target group voting, women are proportionally ahead. This reflects a possible gender-specific categorization (for those who wish to use it as a point of reference) of Phi well. It is unisex, remains ambivalent, and somewhat eludes categorization. I find that immensely appealing.

Phi is a spring, autumn, and winter fragrance. And a scent for sleeping. Therefore, references to Oud Satin Mood by MFK are also possible from my perspective, although there is no oud in Phi. The drydown is wonderfully soft, warm, and harmonious. Here, musk, tonka, and amber do a great job, fixing it firmly. However, it is not overly heavy, as one might initially suspect. Projection and longevity are undoubtedly good, but overall, Phi does not come across as overloaded to me. Certainly, one must have an openness to sweetness and gourmand notes. The cliff of over-sentimentality is then skillfully navigated. As for categorizing Phi, I also find that the fragrance is both retro and progressive at the same time. In my view, it is indeed so unique that I can imagine it on both an older woman and a younger man equally. Phi is a perfume that seems to particularly come to life through the wearer. I find that post-post-modern. And utterly delightful."
The Comforter,10/16/2020,Jas0N,M,61,,23,Transience,"His name was Bryan. He was a soldier, stationed in Kandahar. His wish was always to do something righteous and serve his country. His parents never wanted him to become a soldier. The dangers and risks he might face were not small.
It happened as it had to happen. The overseas assignment. Kandahar. A province so beautiful and yet marked by so many atrocities.
The people back there were so frightened, and yet so friendly. All they wanted was peace. Peace that everyone should have, regardless of country, religion, or political views. Bryan saw these people for what they were: human beings, and sought closeness. He tried to get to know them and show them that he was not a threat.
Time passed, and trust built up between him and the people. One day, outside of his duty, a village boy wanted to show him something. He led him to a magnificent landscape filled with countless flowers. Among them was a rose, known as the Rose of Kandahar.

This rose would ultimately play a decisive role, but more on that later.

Bryan was more than fascinated. This landscape and the accompanying scent. He was more than taken with it. The rose exuded such a wonderful fragrance that he could hardly put it into words.
At first, he perceived an engaging spicy start, paired with a well-measured sweetness. That must be the cinnamon and bitter almond. A great contrast, as he found. As he let the aromas settle a bit and time went on, he could perceive further notes. Here, it was primarily the tobacco that became increasingly prominent for him. The scent of the rose now also supported this. The fragrance was distinguished by its many facets and dimensions. He could hardly extract everything. It was an opulent work of art, complex and capturing the surroundings around him. In the final moments, it became earthier, with patchouli dominating the scene, and eventually, the scent faded away.
A flattering scent that never veered into sweetness.

Enchanted by this perception, he lost track of time. This scent lingered for so long. An enormous longevity.
He thanked the village boy and asked if he could pick a rose once a month. He wanted to show his wife and parents the incredibly beautiful sides of Kandahar. The boy agreed. A part of the landscape served the population for planting raw materials and crops.

Every month, he now sent his family a postcard with a rose. He told them about the wonderful acquaintances, the surroundings, the culture, the food.
His family was delighted and kept everything. The postcard and the rose, which captured the scent of Kandahar.

At some point, however, the messages stopped coming. The worry and despair turned into bitter certainty. Their son, their husband had fallen. What they had always feared had come to pass. What remained for the family was both the beautiful and the ugly side of Kandahar. The rose, which captured the beauty, and the war, which took it away. The roses remained preserved. As a reminder of the positive that their son had described and as a memory of their son himself.

Life. So beautiful and yet so fleeting. Enjoy it."
The Comforter,11/18/2014,KleineHexe,F,78,,21,The Treasure from the Niche,"Treasures are often not lying around on the street. They need to be sought and found.

Such is the case with PHI, a perfume that was unavailable for a long time and thus difficult to procure. When I finally found a supplier, the shipping was shrouded in mystery. More specifically: shipped with UPS and not delivered to me. Intensive inquiries revealed that the bottle was dropped off at the bicycle shop in our small town.

PHI was a blind buy for me. I had no idea what to expect.

So, I picked it up at the bicycle shop and received a metal canister. What could possibly be inside? Screws and nuts or perhaps a repair kit for bicycle tubes?

The metal box is painted a cool blue on the inside. The unadorned green bottle simply placed inside along with a handwritten card that says “Enjoy! Andy Tauer.

Glue or can I use this to protect the garden fence from rust? Everything somehow fit with and into the bicycle shop.

“We don’t smell like Eau de Toilette
Here we sniff good chain grease” (TORFROCK)

crossed my mind. The bottle hadn’t exactly been cheap.

Nervously, I pressed the spray head and then … Wow, what is this?!!

Unusual, fruity, spicy start.

A mysterious, lush rose follows. I can easily imagine this in a dry and barren landscape.

Woods, vanilla, amber, and who knows what else complement this rose well and lastingly in the base.

Tobacco is listed in the fragrance pyramid. For me, a very often challenging scent component, but it doesn’t bother me in the slightest with PHI. It makes this oriental-influenced fragrance perfect for me.

The large Phi stands
in mathematics for the irrational numerical value of the “golden ratio,”
in electrical engineering and physics for magnetic flux,
in lighting technology for luminous flux,
in chemistry for the volume fraction of a substance in a gas mixture.

The scientist Andy Tauer has created for me with PHI a
innovative,
unusual,
cool,
quirky,
pleasant,
oriental, and
wearable
rose scent
to which the term niche truly applies.

There is an undeniable similarity in concept to “L'Air du Désert Marocain.” If you like No. 02, you should definitely try PHI.

The bottle isn’t exactly cheap - but it is worth the price."
The Comforter,06/10/2015,Terra,M,646,,0,Seductive Rose Pastry,"Une Rose de Kandahar is one of the most cuddly, delicious, and beautiful rose interpretations I know, yet it does not conform to any conventions.

Cinnamon, bitter almond, vanilla, tonka, and apricot create the impression of a delicious, oriental pastry, refined with the finest rose oil. The rose does not stand alone in the foreground here, but serves, as it does in some oriental desserts, as a special rounding. Perhaps it is vetiver that makes the rose appear somewhat green in places. I imagine green notes to be somewhat strange in a more or less gourmand fragrance, but here it fits perfectly. When you smell it again on your arm, the rose seems deep dark, warm, and the apricot appears to create a special spiciness together with it.

Une Rose de Kandahar is a unique fragrance full of beauty. Not a trivial rose-oud combination, not a dramatic rose just for women. A fragrance for both men and women, and a rose that even rose haters might enjoy. This masterpiece reminds me with every sniff of original oriental sweets, yet fortunately it is not overly sweet, but instead captures this wonderfully interesting variety and combination of aromas.

Absolutely recommended for testing, and a fragrance that seems worth every cent even at its proud price of 150€/50ml!"
The Comforter,11/27/2017,Gschpusi,F,302,,12,A rose is a rose is a rose!,The charm of the rose lies not merely in its scent and its appearance but in the fact that anyone who wants to enjoy its beauty and fragrance must also love its thorns.

The Comforter,11/23/2014,Florblanca,F,1168,,18,Light is different,"You don't make it easy for me! You are by no means just a rose; you are an entire rose plantation. But you are not alone, around the plantation grow some cinnamon bushes with their fragrant bark, there are large tobacco fields that contribute the robust, aromatic scent of tobacco leaves, and there is plenty of greenery that takes the sweetness away from your lush, large, and strongly scented blooms.

Your name suits you like no other - Kandahar is indeed a very troubled region where many people have lost their lives due to political unrest. It is not easy to cultivate you to the splendor with which you then shine in this beautiful bottle. Kandahar is also quite a dry region, and you do not make it easy for the people there to give you everything you need to thrive; hence, there is only a limited number of your magnificent blooms each year.

Your perfume possesses a sillage that is not to be underestimated and could certainly meet with resistance from people who generally do not like roses. But for those who love you, they can enjoy you for hours on end, completely immersed in your beauty.
For even when you have settled down and rest your head on a bed made of vetiver grass, adorned with delicate slices of vanilla and sprinkled with a dark, warm blend of patchouli, amber, and musk, your strength and beauty can still be felt.

You are not an oriental rose, but a very modern and quite European rose in a very refined combination with a dirty, dark background.

All the effort that people have put into you has paid off, and this unusual perfumer from Switzerland, named Andy Tauer, has succeeded in capturing you in such a fantastic combination in the bottle that you can not only showcase all your beauty but also bring along all the scents of your original environment. And he tries to do this anew every year, bringing a limited number of bottles to us perfume lovers and hoping that he will succeed again next year. That your bottles are always sold out quickly goes without saying.

You are not the most beautiful rose in my rather large collection of rose fragrances, but you are by far the most interesting and sophisticated! I am already looking forward to the 2015 version and am curious whether you will smell the same as this year or bring a variant."
The Comforter,09/23/2017,Erfsche,F,8,,13,Strong Tobacco,"What does the beginner do to gain experience? Right, she sniffs here and there, reads through various descriptions and comments, picks out what she finds interesting, and ends up more or less accidentally with the Rose of Kandahar.
I love roses; my garden is adorned with about twenty of these beauties, and each one smells better than the other. I value that; the modern stuff that looks nice but is completely scentless does not come into my house. 'Une Rose de Kandahar' is certainly not modern stuff, even though the perfume hasn't been around for long. As powerful and massive as it comes, it seems to have sprung straight from the fifties, when sex bombs like Bardot, Loren, or Monroe set the tone. Its fragrance orgy is like these ladies: lush, sensual, and with an all-dominating presence.
The first impression after spraying? Intense! ... a brief recoil ... cautiously sniffing again ... still intense! I don't really find anything fresh or bergamot-like; the apricot is also well hidden, probably too shy to come out among all the powerful floral queens. I can't detect the vetiver that I love so much anywhere, neither at the beginning nor at the end. Instead, a flood of roses takes your breath away, because this flood is not sweet-smelling like my garden roses; it is dark and heavy, bitter and smoky.
Not suitable for everyday wear, and it has clearly and distinctly made me understand that I am not made for such heavyweights. But despite everything, compliments for this powerful scent and congratulations to all who can wear this rose."

It urged me to accuse you, a powerless hatred made me ask: what have I done to you, oh God, that..."
The Comforter,01/16/2021,Smoetn,M,36,,14,Afghan Rose? Bulgarian Rose? Marzipan Rose!,"I actually wanted a rose fragrance… But let’s start from the beginning!

It all started when I discovered my love for rose fragrances some time ago. Yes, I know, many people here are now quite fed up with rose scents, but personally, I haven’t had enough of them, or rather, I am still on the lookout for a great men’s rose fragrance. To get straight to the point - “Une Rose de Kandahar” is only partially that.

In the meantime, I have tried quite a few rose fragrances, including many great ones that I can even call my own, such as Halfeti (see my comment on that fragrance). While it is very masculine, I wouldn’t classify it as a classic rose fragrance where the rose would dominate. However, it is very mass-appealing, and I would define it as the more wearable brother of “Viking.” Other rose fragrances, like “Rose Oud” by Kilian or Noir de Noir, I also like very much, but they are a bit too feminine for my taste. Now, onto “Une Rose de Kandahar”…

I had read a lot about this fragrance beforehand and had high hopes that this could be my men’s rose fragrance. So I ordered it here in the souk (thanks to Marcello) and tried it today.

At first, the scent clearly starts out as a rum ball for me, which immediately awakens childhood memories. An unexpected opening, but so far so good. As the top notes develop, more and more gourmand notes come through, a bit of cinnamon and, quite clearly, marzipan, naturally due to the bitter almond. This smells very intense, so much so that one might think they are standing in the kitchen baking a cake with Dr. Oetker’s bitter almond flavoring. If you like this, you’re in for a treat, but it might also put off one or two people.

In the heart note, the rose notes finally come through. Supposedly, all kinds of roses are supposed to be present here - Afghan rose, Bulgarian rose, Bourbon rose geranium… But for me, it is a marzipan rose! This is simply (unfortunately) because the bitter almond never fully retreats, and the various rose accords constantly have to battle against the almond. Sometimes this works better, sometimes less so.

In the base note, a bit more sweetness comes through from the vanilla and tonka bean, but overall, the impression of the marzipan rose remains.

This is very disappointing for me, as I actually wanted a rose fragrance but ended up with almost a gourmand. I should have listened better to the comments here! Don’t get me wrong, the scent is really good and I like it, but it is indeed different from what I had hoped for. The combination of gourmand and rose is certainly interesting and quite successful, but the search for my men’s rose fragrance continues.

The sillage and longevity are very good and, for me, also rather masculine, although the fragrance can certainly be worn by the female gender as well. Like with so many heavy and gourmand fragrances, “Une Rose de Kandahar” feels most at home in autumn and winter and is more suitable for the evening.

In summary, I can say that while I like “Une Rose de Kandahar” and could imagine wearing the fragrance more regularly, it ultimately doesn’t quite make the cut for a top spot with me. To make matters worse, my wife doesn’t like the scent at all, which doesn’t exactly make the search for my perfect men’s rose fragrance any easier…"
The Comforter,11/17/2014,Kasmodiah,M,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,What a Rose...,"In the ROSE VON KANDAHAR Une rose de Kandahar, there is a lot of love; I even see a certain resemblance to the famous No.2, of course with a different fragrance pyramid and different ingredients. In terms of ""craftsmanship,"" however, it is comparable to what is personally the best scent from Tauer for me.
Unfortunately, I have only recently acquired this rarity and haven't really dissected it yet. But it is delicious, tasty, and seductively gourmand. I've never had such a delightful rose in my nose.
In the meantime, I must say that Mr. Tauer has achieved something extraordinary here. Not too much or too little of anything. And only the finest. That's how it should be. I am receiving praise everywhere, even though rose has always been somewhat problematic for me. But here, it is one of the most brilliant fragrances from the house of Tauer. I can already see that there is much more to discover. I think I need to get myself another bottle before everything is sold out again for quite a while."

The Comforter,11/03/2020,Floddel,M,9,,7,Yin and Yang,"I am very enthusiastic about this scent.
Although I am not a big fan of rose fragrances, I love this perfume above all.
When I spray it on, I immediately think of the past, yet not in an old-fashioned way. The scent definitely has a gourmand touch, but it is by no means too sweet or cloying like many other rose fragrances. In my opinion, PHI has a very unisex quality.
The fragrance is therefore a interplay of many contrasts, and that is what makes it so special for me."
The Comforter,10/28/2017,ClemensJ,M,26,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The Rude Rose,"Certain roses - like those I knew from my mother's garden - smell unpleasantly intense up close. However, from a distance, they are enchanting and captivating. Many perfumes with rose as the main component often do not necessarily smell like a classic rose and tend to be rather subdued regarding the characteristic notes.

Not so with this one.

At the start, the fragrance components listed in the top notes, apart from bitter almond, are hardly noticeable. From the heart note onward, the rose-heavy composition unfolds gradually. Neither captivating, nor flattering, nor striking, and not even refined. Rather, it is simply exhausting, uneven, dissonant, and disharmonious. At times, the accords were perceived as slightly synthetic.

Even the well-perceptible tobacco (or tobacco leaf) is, despite the contributing spiciness, not a suitable antagonist. Coarse power without balance does not quite work.
Personally, I appreciate a fragrance with edges and corners that give it individuality and character. The perfume fails to skillfully unfold along the narrow path without appearing pompous, overwhelming, or opulent.

Only after many hours does the very pleasant, creamy, and successful base, primarily consisting of amber and musk, become noticeable. Longevity is impeccable. However, that is not enough compensation.

For me, this composition is too unbalanced. Especially in the middle part, I find it desirable to adjust the volume a bit with a different composition. It can remain (very) strong, but it should form a balanced whole with the rose in the leading role without the current intensity. And perhaps include one or two antagonists. If reformulated, I would be willing to try it again."
The Comforter,08/20/2022,MiniGBIC,F,24,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Almond Croissant in the Desert,"I really like ""Au Coeur du Désert | Tauer Perfumes."" With this fragrance, I have the association of 'working in a dusty attic, then freshly showered and moisturized, enjoying the evening in the shade.'

With PHI, it's similar. Only that here I smell an almond croissant the whole time - even while tidying up in the dusty attic.

What also accompanies me after finishing work and showering - yes, showered and moisturized, the cream has a very subtle almond scent. And subtle mineral notes - I think this association comes from the combination of cinnamon and tobacco.

What I hardly perceive or only very subtly in the background is rose... :)

In any case, rose or not, I smelled it and was immediately smitten, and I still am, great fragrance!"
The Comforter,07/31/2023,RichardHorn,M,80,,7,Almondy Rose! And more!,"Une Rose de Kandahar truly impressed me, as this Andy Tauer is more than just a simple rose fragrance. It possesses a wonderful marzipan-like (that is, almondy) note that makes it something special and seems to set it apart from other rose perfumes.

Here you find a blend of bitter almond, apricot, cinnamon, various types of roses, tobacco, vanilla, even tonka bean, and much more. This combination creates a seductive yet subtle sweetness, accompanied by a finely-spiced nuance. The spiciness, however, is expressed in a subtle and elegant manner.

The roses do not simply come across as floral; rather, they have this unmistakable marzipan aroma that gives the perfume a certain depth. It is a type of rose that you don't smell every day and that - one should know - not everyone would wear. It is a scent for confident women who enjoy exploring new fragrance worlds and wish to radiate a touch of elegance and sophistication. It is not a typical everyday scent, but rather something for special occasions or unique moments.

The longevity and sillage of this Tauer are decent. You only need a few sprays, and the fragrance lasts long on the skin, unfolding its scent journey over the course of wearing it.

What I also appreciate about Une Rose de Kandahar is that a considerable amount of natural fragrance materials were likely used in its creation. This gives the perfume a vibrant and authentic quality that is often missed in many mainstream scents.

Overall, I can recommend this perfume if you are looking for an extraordinary and unique rose fragrance. Give it a try and let yourself be enchanted by the fascinating combination of gourmand rose and fine-spicy sweetness!"

Princess Peach,10/19/2024,SiLe93,M,15,,3,"A unique, masterful interpretation of ""Blue"" with real ambergris - a masterpiece","Ambre Bleue, an outstanding masterpiece by Vincent Micotti, is a charismatic and distinctive fragrance with a fascinating personality. As the name suggests, the scent captures various facets of ""Blue"": the ocean, the wind, the sky, and their intoxicating nuances.

In contrast to most fragrances that dedicate themselves to the theme of ""Blue"" and associate ""Blue"" with fresh, aquatic notes and occasionally fruity or salty accents, Ambre Bleue offers a completely independent interpretation. It is vibrant, profound, and beautifully unexpected, an extraordinary sensory experience.

Although real ambergris, the ""bluest"" of all ingredients, is used generously, the fragrance does not feel heavy; instead, it radiates a special clarity and timeless elegance. Ambre Bleue captivates and unfolds an irresistible sensuality that is hard to resist."
Princess Peach,12/31/2021,Jutta96,M,2,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Ambergris at Its Finest,"""Who would think that the finest ladies and gentlemen indulge in a fragrance derived from the unglamorous intestines of a sick sperm whale! And yet, it is so. Gray amber is considered by some to be the cause and by others the result of poor digestion that whales sometimes suffer from. How such dyspepsia could be cured is hard to say, unless one administers three or four boatloads of rhubarb pills to the patient and then quickly gets out of the line of fire […] I assert: When the sperm whale thrusts its tail high, it emits just as much fragrance as a musk-scented lady rustling her skirts in a warm salon."" Excerpt from the book by Herman Melville: Moby Dick Chapter 92 - Ambergris

For centuries, if not millennia, wild stories have surrounded this mysterious substance. In the Chinese Empire, amber was referred to as ""lung sien hiang,"" or the ""saliva perfume of dragons,"" until about 1000 AD, as it was believed that the substance originated from the saliva of dragons sleeping on rocks by the sea. In the Orient, amber is still known by this name today. It was not until 1574 that the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius was the first to deduce from the inclusions of cuttlefish beaks in amber that it comes from the digestive tract of whales. However, this went largely unnoticed for a long time. Only later, when fresh amber was discovered in the intestines of individual sperm whales during slaughter, was Clusius' statement confirmed
**

But now to the scent:
For me, it starts with a generous portion of spices in the form of cardamom and pepper. This spiciness is by no means nose-wrinkling strong; rather, it paves the way for the olfactory experience that is yet to come. The main player in this masterpiece by Vincent Micotti is, as could be expected, the natural ambergris. According to YS-Uzac, Ambre Bleue contains a generous amount of the precious whale secretion. After about five minutes, a bright, radiant, aquatic, slightly animalistic note emerges that must inevitably come from the ambergris. I also perceive the exotic resins mentioned in the fragrance pyramid quite strongly. These hold all the fragrance notes together, so to speak, with their sticky quality, ensuring that the spices and the slightly animalistic ambergris never become unpleasant for the nose. In the base, leather, oud, and incense hide, but they do not overpower; rather, they form a worthy foundation for the royal ambergris. All in all, it can be said that Ambre Bleue, due to the amount of ambergris used, conveys a natural aquatic impression throughout the entire fragrance journey, where initially the spices and towards the end the dark woody notes, as well as leather and incense, play a rather subordinate role. The whole is then enveloped in a warm resinous cloak that embraces all the fragrance notes. In my opinion, we are dealing with a masterpiece of perfumery that can bring much joy to a trained nose."
Lush Linen,01/31/2019,Jazzy76,F,320,,0,When the violet meets the almond...,"When the shy and tender violet meets the sweet Almond , the result is a perfect scented marriage: this eau is very light and pure, clean and minimalist, but also extremely feminine and charming in its simplicity.
The violet note is just suggested, not too vibrant and intoxicating and its shy character is strenghtened by a warmer and sweeter Almond note, giving that ""floriental"" touch to this scented water.
It's a perfume to wear by day, at the office too because it's very soft and inoffensive. It's perfect in every season but mainly in spring-summer . In my opinion, it's one of the best scented waters made by the good Italian brand Collistar.The price for a 100ml size is quite affordable. about 40€ and you can buy online too.

Yuzu and Cocoa,01/16/2024,Axiomatic,M,149,,40,The Agitated Man,"Can four listed components capture a state of mind, indeed a character trait?
And can they olfactorily trace the urge to roar out a deeply seated tension in the shabby short window of confined freedom?

Two questions are posed to the second man in the fragrance series, and he will answer them convincingly.

Here now is the apparent discord of an agitated time span.

Hiss!

Resinous benzoin in the greeting.
Today easily found in oriental fragrances, in 1982 it meant the ultimate slap in the face.
Buddy, open your eyes wide!

Certainly, a certain citrusy undertone with spectral, herbal aspects shows thoughtful craftsmanship. But what matters here is the rough wooden nature.
Can't you see the forest for the trees?

This resin is illuminated in such a way that its sweet side completely disappears into the shadows.
Slightly salty, a bead of good amber will make it combative.
Hunter's fences want to be jumped, and a high seat ascended.
The gaze sharpens.
Watch out, my friend!

Once at the top, then the introspection.
Cultivated animalic warmth crawls up the leather jacket.
Nature has been tamed, that's just how it is.
Bright oak moss with a hint of sorrel freed the pores of the skin to naturally draw out that spicy masculinity from the body's glands.
The solid emphasis of the body.
The tightrope act of rutting self-control.
The social acceptance of the three-day beard.

That the fragrance does not drift into unrestrained brutality is thanks to a noble iris.
German bearded iris?
Quite possible.
But it is not her lovely floral lilac that conveys here, no, it is her rhizome from which something precious is extracted.
Soothing, nurturing confidence, the divine messengers accompany the second man.
Slightly powdery, subtly floral, and with a hint of golden amber.
The emotional state is ordered and calmed.

There he stands now, full of inner turmoil and composed.

For this is how the fragrance will settle, balancing the harsh contrasts.

With the aforementioned limited time window, I mean that mood of the period from 1982 to 1984.
Much change was in the air.
Not only the replacement of Helmut Schmidt and the confirmation of Helmut Kohl, the nuclear armament, the initial digitalization, and the accompanying changed production process.
A certain neuromantic urge and quest for freedom spread along forest-lined country roads.
The motorcycle achieved cult status.
And in leather gear, even if just a leather jacket, one could endure along the fir green, finding oneself again.

Aside from the lovely NDW - Neue Deutsche Welle - Spliff created a different and deeper understanding of the current events for a brief moment.
Their song ""Herzlichen Glückwunsch"" illustrates for me the inner soul of Man Two.
The video could not be more fitting.

With what exquisite range of grooming products this magnificent fragrance was equipped is best described by Lancaster85 in his review.
Back then, all fragrances by Jil Sander were produced in Wiesbaden.

As fashionable as the 1980s decade was, the market presence of the second man remained short-lived.

But fortunately, the urge for the forest was not subjected to a fleeting trend.
And that man could once again enchant with his romantic side today."
Yuzu and Cocoa,08/15/2014,Lancaster85,M,31,,13,The Probably Most Unknown and Rarest Jil Sander Fragrance,"Jil Sander Man II by Jil Sander is a perfume from the Woody Chypre fragrance family. Jil Sander Man II was launched in 1982. It had the same design as the previous Jil Sander Pure for Men, except that its packaging was gray instead of black, the bottle was transparent instead of darkened, and the cap was gray instead of black.

This fragrance, which is very atypical for Jil Sander, contains iris, oak moss, benzoin resin, and castoreum.

Benzoin is used in perfume making; it is particularly suitable for oriental and warm fragrance compositions, and it also serves as a fixative. The scent of benzoin is sticky, intensely balsamic, slightly chocolaty, and definitely reminiscent of vanilla. Benzoin or benzoin resin refers to the resin (the flowing gum) of various benzoin trees.

Castoreum, also known as beaver musk, is a secretion from the glandular sacs of beavers. The secretion consists of a complex mixture of chemical compounds that are likely formed from secondary metabolites of urine. The beaver uses the fatty secretion for fur care and to mark its territory. In perfumery, castoreum, which is said to have an aphrodisiac (erotic) effect, is a component of some fragrances. Similar substances are now produced synthetically.

Oak moss, the typical fragrance ingredient of chypre scents, which originated in Cyprus and was first developed by François Coty in 1917, rounds off the fragrance and gives it a spicy freshness.

Overall, it is a fragrance composition of smoky benzoin resin, erotic balsamic castoreum, and fresh spicy oak moss. And that is exactly how it smells; I consider myself a lucky owner of the EdT. It starts intensely spicy-woody and develops into a balsamically warm scent within 20 minutes. I would recommend it as an autumn-winter fragrance for real men! This scent reflects pure rugged masculinity. I personally find it very unique, very intensely smoky-balsamic; I can only imagine wearing it on cold winter days.

In the original leaflet for the fragrance, it was described as follows:
""Consistently masculine scent. Characterized by self-awareness and dynamism. Elegant through its herb-fresh aroma. Jil Sander/ Man Two is exclusivity and vitality. Simply extraordinary.""

Even in the woody-spicy 80s, it was too extraordinary; this also became its downfall at the end of the 80s, six years after its release, as it disappeared quietly from perfumeries.

Even in the early 80s, the grooming-conscious man was offered quite a bit:

Jil Sander Man, which everyone here calls Man pure, has accompanied me as my scent for many years. Man II completely slipped through my fingers in the 80s. Unfortunately! I wish I had never met you! It happened as it had to happen. We did meet. Resiny and light brown you are. With a fine note of cognac, you have burned yourself into my memory.
While Jil Sander's Man (pure) is a wonderful reminder of past times, you are the scent I would still spray on myself every day today. I know nothing comparable.
This gem is as rare as the legendary Patou. Simply untraceable. Probably only to be found in estate sales. At flea markets, for little money, because the poor sellers have no idea what treasure they possess!
My life must go on without you... damn!
Released in 1982, Jil Sander Man II was not a great success. In the same decade, it disappeared without a trace. Yet it still has its loyal fans today. Myself included.

I have had this one as a miniature for some time and have worn it a few times. Somehow, I haven't found a way to connect with it yet. I am fascinated by its uncompromising nature and awkwardness, and I will try to convey this impression.

Scent development:
It starts off intensely resinous, with a slight herbal undertone. This resinous impression is very intense and quite off-putting and requires some getting used to for me. However, it is not dark and heavy, but very clear, slightly ethereal, and thus quite biting. Just like the very restrained herbal impression, I also perceive a slightly dirty-animalistic base note that further supports this awkwardness.
There is no development. The scent remains as it started.
I would place the scent most closely in the forest when the air is heavy with resin. However, this doesn't fully capture it, and I can't draw any further fitting analogy. Therefore, it is difficult for me to grasp and categorize. It is absolutely independent and does not care about conventions. In my opinion, Man Two is rough, rather signaling distance, and can only be worn by a very self-confident man.
In its own way, it is fascinating, but for me, it is too awkward and intense.

Longevity and sillage:
The longevity for me is about 8 hours of good perceivability, and the sillage is noticeable almost the entire time, but not too strong.

Bottle:
I like the clear shape of the bottle designed by Peter Schmidt with the two stacked cubes. The color definitely matches the resinous-clear scent impression. The light gray color of the screw cap is something to get used to.

Conclusion:
Resinous-clear, slightly ethereal-biting scent of high intensity. It will certainly deter many and is a clear, uncompromising statement. Due to its creation in the 80s (1982), it has quite a punch. It fits into the typical Sander line of men's fragrances due to its clarity and lack of sweetness (there are few exceptions like Feeling Man). I wouldn't wear it, but I am happy to have an unturned miniature and can occasionally sniff it to then indulge in a pinch with a puzzled smile and think: ""Wow, that's bold!"" :)"

Jil Sander's long-time friend, the Hamburg designer Peter Schmidt, is once again responsible for the design.

As for the fragrance itself, there are currently no offers on the WWW - so I am proud to have received a sample from Ingepetra...merci!

The scent is a classic fougère and reflects a rugged masculinity!

The opening is fresh and green. The progression is spicy, mossy - even smoky.
I detect parallels to Chanel's Antaeus and Scent 79.
However, Jil Sander's Man II is not as dark...

Overall, an interesting fragrance that I personally would not wear.
Nevertheless, it would be appropriate for the Jil Sander company to bring a similar perfume back to the market for the ""established"" man, as currently there are only sweet, soft men's fragrances from Jil Sander.

The Voice of Reason,01/29/2015,Hasiputz80,F,34,,0,Vanilla that I don't like!,"Well, actually I love vanilla! Pure by DKNY is the perfect vanilla for me.
Delicious Vanilla was a blind buy and also a mistake. That's not how I want vanilla to be; it comes across as dirty and outdated to me.
Since I haven't quite figured out which ingredients I like, I guess it might be the amber?
The scent doesn't change at all from the beginning to the end.
If someone wants it, please!"
The Voice of Reason,09/15/2014,Somebody,F,227,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Fluffy Vanilla Cloud,"Gale Hayman, along with her husband, founded a very successful boutique named Giorgio Beverly Hills in 1961 in Beverly Hills. In 1981, the couple launched a fragrance of the same name, which found enormous appeal in the world of the rich and beautiful. In 1987, the company was acquired by Avon, and Gale established Gale Hayman Inc. From then on, she successfully launched various fragrances under her own name.
The characteristic bottle of the Delicious line is shaped like a stylized rock, with a snow leopard lurking on it, and was nominated for a FiFi award.

With the hit Giorgio Beverly Hills in mind, I was very curious about how the theme of vanilla would be approached, a note that gains significance in autumn and winter and is often too intense and thus unbearable for me in many fragrances.
Delicious Vanilla gets straight to the point, opening with a bright, fine, and delicate vanilla. The fluffy and soft impression is created in combination with the light almond note of heliotrope, yet vanilla remains the defining element throughout, even as the flowers timidly and ethereally join in after about half an hour. I believe I can identify jasmine and sweet pea.
Towards the end, musk gains significance with a soapy component.
Since Delicious Vanilla stays very close to the skin and I can hardly perceive it from 30 cm away, there is little danger of overwhelming myself or my surroundings. Despite this weak projection, it lasts on me for 6-8 hours.

Given the price-performance ratio, you can't go wrong with Delicious Vanilla, and I would definitely recommend a test to friends who enjoy subtle, preferably monothematic vanilla fragrances. The bottle is also a true delight to hold, easy to handle, and a feast for the eyes as well."
The Voice of Reason,07/23/2014,Schnüffeli,F,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The Light Vanilla,"After I already had ""Delicious"" at home, I thought this one would definitely blow me away; but it doesn’t!
This is actually a light vanilla scent that can be worn during the day and in the summer without the people around you having to fan themselves.

The scent progression is quite linear; it’s a mix of ""light vanilla,"" I don’t know how else to express it, and flowers. However, it never becomes heavy or cloyingly sweet, but always remains pleasantly fragrant; a bit playful and naive. Definitely something for younger girls too!"
Exhale,07/11/2013,Neroli,F,36,,2,floral fruity,"A pleasant light fragrance, just right for warm summer/spring days. It reminds me a lot of the scent Selection by S. Oliver. The fruity accent of apple and the floral note of violet come through very strongly here. The scent smells the same after half an hour as it did at the beginning. Conclusion: not a very extravagant fragrance but very pleasant."
Exhale,11/17/2012,Salliano,F,14,,3,Summer!,"I think this is the perfect summer perfume. The yellow bottle and the fruity-fresh scent lift your spirits and refresh you. I immediately fell in love with the fragrance while testing it at dm and took home a 40 ml bottle right away! Despite its lightness, the longevity is very good, and the bottle doesn’t feel cheap despite its simplicity. I am totally thrilled to have gotten such a great Eau de Toilette for the affordable price!
I also have to say that I’m usually not a fan of sporty - light scents and rarely buy drugstore perfumes.
But here, in my opinion, Puma has hit the mark perfectly!"
Exhale,06/18/2012,Peanut,F,218,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Anti-Koma,"Okay, okay. It’s warm, it’s humid, and who doesn’t have a citrus craving in this weather! Besides, I like citrus, even in freezing temperatures. Therefore, my assessment will be rather biased and quite favorable.

Sure: Puma hasn’t revolutionized the citrus fruit here. Within a select collection of fine hesperid fruits, this scent will look silly (and smell even sillier). A lot of synthetic, lemon cake batter-like citrus, typical Puma flowers, a bit of friendly cedar, something else, something else. So: Necessary?

Yes, no, maybe. Because: First of all, this is a SPORT scent. An unpretentious little diesel for the gym bag! For those brief moments after the refreshing anti-coma shower. If you expect more here, you should pay attention to the label: PUMA. Hello? They make sports shoes...

Secondly, a small bottle that matches the shower gel and body lotion makes perfect sense (for after sports, of course). From experience, Puma scents as shower gel and lotion are much better, tastier, and more expressive than as EdT. Just look at ""Puma Jamaica 1 + 2"". So why not take the whole set home?

Unless you want to be politically correct. Then keep your hands off. See below for Turandot!"
Exhale,06/16/2012,Turandot,F,839,,13,Floral-citrus - Guilt included,"Before I delve into the fragrance, I want to warn every environmentally conscious person to avoid using the above link: ""Free fragrance sample available here."" Go to Müller or your nearest department store and test the scent. I did it, ordered the sample, and today I received a postcard by airmail from Hong Kong (!) with a sachet stuck on it. There’s hardly a way to release more unnecessary CO2 into the atmosphere than this. The sachet doesn’t contain a soaked cloth as is often the case, but when you tear it open, about 1/2ml of fragrance splashes out at you.

The fragrance itself is exactly as one would expect. Fresh, floral, citrusy, fruity, and a bit playful. A nice scent for young girls, who can still be kept away from Lady Million. Nothing more, nothing less. However, I find the Esprit and S.Oliver fragrances to be much better for this target group, as they are not quite as banal.

We won’t have to linger long with Yellow, because as quickly as the Puma fragrances are thrown onto the market, they disappear just as fast. But my aversion to P&G has grown even larger with this test. Not because of the fragrance, but - see title."
Strawberry Feels Forever,08/12/2025,Cwong,M,6,,1,A journey through a deep forest,"The first spray struck me like an unexpected chord: warm, bright, and strangely familiar, yet entirely new. It was as though I had pressed my face against a piece of wood, its grain soaked in a mysterious liquid where citrus seemed woven into its very DNA. A soft sweetness floated alongside, but not the sugar-coated kind; this sweetness had roots, as if it had blossomed from the heart of a flower or the sap of a living stem.

For the first hour, it danced on my skin with that lively citrus glow. the, slowly, it began to shift. The sweetness dimmed, and cedarwood stepped forward, carrying with it the fresh, almost dewy scent of roses just cut from their stems.

By the time the fragrance settled, it had transformed entirely. Vetiver rose from the base like dry grass after rain, entwined with the deep green shadows of oakmoss. Vanilla whispered in the background: subtle, restrained, not the quiet, raw scent of the vanilla pod itself, still clinging to the earth that nourished it.

It is a journey that begins with light, passes through wood and bloom, and ends where soil meets the sky."
Strawberry Feels Forever,10/27/2025,Minigolf,F,2512,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Hearty Lemonwood,"A cool breeze blows in an otherwise sun-warmed environment - and it feels good! It comes directly from the forest and carries its herbaceous-green scents. I sit on a bench at the edge of the forest, refreshing myself with a bottle of homemade, real lemonade. With a good book on my lap, not just focused on the text, my gaze wanders everywhere.
Behind the bench, a thick tuft of herb-scented grasses - bright and slightly earthy at the same time. A bit deeper in the forest, moss-covered trunks. Delicately carved silver-green tendrils of oak moss hang down from branches and twigs..
In the clearing before me, lush green herbs grow, exuding a fresh, herbaceous-minty scent, along with some wild roses, whose delicate fragrance wafts over to me from time to time. Otherwise, the woody-aromatic scents of pines, cedars, and firs prevail. In the midst of it all, a small grove of birches. The white bark releases lightly peppery-scented resins with a delicate vanilla note.
Moisture from the last rain has settled as tiny droplets on everything.
Hearty and wonderfully herb-sweet, a sunny autumn day greets."
Strawberry Feels Forever,08/18/2025,Dionysos2022,M,946,,6,I am in the countryside and have an appointment…,"… with a carpenter who is supposed to make a chest for my perfume atomizers, and he is located right in the middle of the countryside. On the way there, you pass by orange and lemon trees that release their freshness. When I enter the workshop, I get a whiff of pepper in my nose. The young carpenter smiles at me and explains that this comes from the wood. Other woods also blend in. I show him my idea, and he says we can make it happen.

When applying this fragrance, the first thing you notice is a fresh, citrusy, peppery scent. Here, woody and floral accords mix in. The patchouli adds a deep darkness to this perfume. There are also green notes. A hint of vanilla is noticeable, but only very faintly in the background. The vetiver gives us a dry freshness, and the scent is extremely masculine. It vaguely reminds me of Perseus by PMF.

The longevity and sillage are good.

Here we have something different from the house of Lattafa than the usual sweet oriental fragrances. This very masculine scent is something for men from their mid-twenties. I simply cannot imagine it on women, no matter how hard I try. But as always, please try it for yourself. It is also a fresh scent that is an all-rounder, suitable for wearing all year round. During the day, it works just as well at university, in the office, in the workshop, over coffee, or while shopping, as it does in the evening at the theater, in a bar, in a club, in a disco, or at a party.

Anyone looking for a fresh, citrusy, peppery, woody, floral, green, deep, dark, dry scent should take a closer look at this one for a small price."

The tartness and creaminess comes together to create a comforting yogurt scent that's more realistic than I ever thought possible. However, if, like me, you don't find the thought of smelling like a dairy product appealing, this scent isn't for you. The longevity was quite average on me, with the scent drying down to a more generic sweetness within a couple of hours. The musk note also began to dominate in this phase."
Chelsea Morning,06/27/2024,Telekinec,F,498,,1,"Pineapple yogurt turns into a fruity, powdery dessert with a synthetic edge","Obtained a decant through a trusted Facebook fragrance group member with whom I've gotten a few decants from. Never thought I'd get to smell Nota Sugar since it's not sold through retailers I buy from, but I've seen it floating around social media so I was curious to get my hands on it.

The beginning is delicious. It smells like vanilla yogurt with good, sizeable chunks of freshly cut pineapple. Sweet, fresh, fruity and really nice to smell. I think the coconut is providing that creamy, lactonic twist that makes it smell like a vanilla yogurt. I barely smell any caramel, although it seems to provide some sweetness. As the perfume moves forward, I get the tangy raspberry note in the background, supporting the fruity vibe of the scent. Almond praliné is powdery and sugary. Even though the vanilla is found in the middle notes, I find that it permeates the whole fragrance with its lovely sweetness. At this point, the scent becomes a little more synthetic than what I wished for. At the edge, there's also the ghost of the functional aspect of sunscreen. It still smells sweet and fruity, but there's the powderiness that also comes through (which is less my thing). Pineapple smells a little more grounded, almost grilled like on a BBQ. The bottom notes further reinforce the sweet and powdery notes in this fragrance as it dies down to a powdery, musky vanilla with an evanescent accord of fruitiness.

I'm glad I got a decant so I could try it, but it won't make it as a full bottle in my collection. It's a different interpretation of a warm weather fragrance made with fruits and sweetness, but the evolution of the perfume is not really my thing. I loved how the pineapple and raspberries paired well together. I did enjoy wearing it and sniffing it throughout the day, so I'll gladly be using up my decant up until the end."
Chelsea Morning,05/24/2024,Shemsmeller,M,206,,1,Pineapple with caramel in front of Copacabana beach,"tested using a sample, I noticed that this perfume was being mentioned more and more on social networks, so I decided to test it out of curiosity.

it is a gourmand and sweet perfume. I had the impression of being in a palace kitchen surrounded by great starred chefs preparing a magnificent exotic dessert based on roasted pineapple as is done in Brazil with an addition of caramel.

a pleasant and natural smell of worked caramel, far from all those perfumes with cloying synthetic odors. the trail is incredible and the lasting power is impressive.

The perfume lasted 20 hours on my skin, the smell began to fade after 3 hours.

a touch of vanilla and coconut are felt afterwards, prolonging my travel immersion in an exotic country, I had the impression of being on a terrace by the sea and eating this succulent dessert.

The smell is unlike any perfume I have tried so far. Notice to all fans of gourmet perfumes, this perfume is made for you."
"By Night One Way, by Day Another",12/29/2024,ChilledFrank,M,12,,2,Polish Freshness,"This aftershave is publicly owned by only two users here in this forum, there are no reviews or statements about it, not even a rating. This product really doesn't deserve that, so I will step in and give the aftershave a bit more attention and love.

Olfactorily, one can read the crucial points in the short review of the Eau de Cologne by Byravit. The scent is citrusy, spicy, and a bit woody, making it overall very fresh and - since it is ultimately a functional fragrance as an aftershave - refreshing. The level of aggression after shaving is about medium: there are milder, but also significantly more aggressive aftershaves after shaving. It forgives minor shaving accidents but also reveals the weaknesses of the last shave, if any. The bottle is simple, classic, and allows for the application of a slightly larger amount, if desired.

The longevity and sillage are not bad for an aftershave at all; I use a generous amount of it. Since the scent is very similar to the EdC, apart from the concentration of course, it can be very well paired with its big brother.

My routine is as follows:
1.) After shaving, the aftershave
2.) As an aftershave balm, I use the inexpensive and odorless Penaten oil (500 ml bottle)
3.) With a bit of time in between, then as an olfactory and dermatological revival, the EdC from Lider.

After about 2 - 3 hours, enough time has passed to dedicate oneself to the perfume of the day or evening.

Conclusion: A good, refreshing aftershave, available at a low price, with sufficiently good sillage and longevity, unfortunately probably totally underrated. Just give it a try.

P.S.: For the wet shavers among us, here's a tip that there is also a nice shaving cream from Lider."
Lord of Goathorn,10/23/2024,Minigolf,F,2512,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,"Another ""Inimitable""...","So far, all attempts to compare this ""Scherrer"" with another fragrance have failed. Only ""4711,"" one of the oldest ""eau de colognes"" still available, bears a slight resemblance to this. ""Comes from the neroli and the galbanum""!!! That's what I claim now. And from the mint and the woods. But the Scherrer is ""icy-dry,"" while ""4711"" is refreshingly cool.
Yes, it is the ""dryness,"" the lemon-tea-like frozen quality that seems to come from the freezer at minus 20 degrees Celsius, that no perfumer has achieved so far. And that means a lot in the confusing, nearly inexhaustible flood of fragrances vying for the noses of customers. Niche! Absolutely! And incredibly green - but not ""synthetic.""

Ectoplasm,03/09/2022,Anamandy,F,107,,3,Sex in a Bottle,"Boy, this is so animalic. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Lovers of animalic scents will adore this perfume because that is what hit me on first spray. It does lighten up as the fragrance progresses, but it is always there right below the surface.

I have a vintage curvy bottle from Revlon with a gold image of an almost naked man and woman on the front of the bottle seated facing each other entwined in an embrace. SEX is what the image implies. Civet, animalic musk, castoreum, and indolic jasmine enforce that image. Intimate is just a nicer way to describe it.

Speaking of the bottle, just from looking at that alone, it's clear this was made in an age when even drugstore buys could exude some semblance of sophistication. (Word of warning about the sprayer though, it shoots out like a fire hose.) It's also clear the juice was made with better quality ingredients than many perfumes today.

The sandalwood is real here, not that synthetic stuff used nowadays in too many perfumes. It's a nice woody sandalwood too, beautifully blended in a resinous elixir of powdery rose, creamy gardenia, dirty jasmine and musk, highlighted with a light dusting of spice and a dose of civet. All is anchored on a bed of oakmoss and amber. Though classified a chypre, it comes across as an oriental to me, in the same way Dioresscence (classified by many as a chypre, but as an oriental on Dior's site) does. That spicy resinous texture gives that impression. This fragrance also reminds me of Tabu, but whereas that fragrance is syrupy, heavy, and I find oppressive, this is lighter, more polished, and refined. Tabu also lacks the sexy animal elements so prominent here. I'm not saying they aren't in Tabu, just that I cannot smell them in the same way I can here – front and center! Intimate seems to be nearer to what the creator of Tabu, (if stories are to be believed), thought (knew?) how a lady of the evening smelled. But in this case, she'd be a high-priced call girl who plays the stock market by day.

Would I wear this fragrance outdoors? Not on your life. I'd be afraid I'd be followed by wolves, both the two-legged and four-legged kind. Still, it was fun to experience this little time capsule in history and to marvel at how daring and glamorous women used to be."
Dirty,08/23/2016,Taurus,M,1164,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Neither Fire nor Flame,"I can still remember it very well. In the late 80s, these small pocket atomizers filled with perfume, resembling BIC lighters, appeared in some supermarkets, somewhere between tobacco and impulse items.

There were four different colors as well as fragrance directions (2 x feminine, 1 masculine, and 1 x unisex), and great luxury was promised at a low price. In principle, not a bad idea, but the core competency of the French BIC company lies in manufacturing ballpoint pens (exactly - those transparent hexagonal ones) and lighters (typically in the oval shape), not in creating perfumes, even if they are supposedly of the finest French quality.

BIC Homme No 1 suggests a masculine direction with a decent swing of sandalwood plus woody notes, a lot of oriental embellishments, and some green notes. Whether this can really be classified as fern, I doubt. Thus, Homme No 1 also captures the virtues of the 80s quite well, albeit more from the less tasteful side of that decade.

There are two things that still irritate me a bit. On one hand, the scent has a slightly bitter, almost tar-like undertone that expands a bit in the background. As if it were subtly paying homage to the tobacco industry, which would be understandable in a way but not acceptable. However, this could be due to the fact that my flea market find is no longer the freshest, although spilled fragrances usually smell different.

In connection with this, I note that BIC Homme No 1, for its age, is quite usable in scent, aside from the slightly tar-like undertone. And so I wonder whether this is more an indication of natural or rather synthetic raw materials. After all, we are talking about Firmenich as the manufacturer/fragrance supplier. On the other hand, a high proportion of natural essences is promised according to the blister text. Could one actually believe that?

All in all, this is a relatively usable men’s perfume, which, however, is long outdated both in terms of zeitgeist and concept. The latter is not so far-fetched, and for those who needed a more or less acceptable scent quickly for a few marks, it was somewhat satisfactory.
Got a nice rendezvous or a spontaneous night out planned? Before you smell like a polecat, here’s the solution. And even afterwards, stowed away in your pants or handbag, it’s ready for use at any time! After all, 300 sprays were promised. That should last quite a while.

But even back then, there were pocket atomizers that looked more valuable and could be filled with the perfume of your first choice. It doesn’t have to be this makeshift solution from the supermarket or gas station. Moreover, as mentioned above, BIC's core competency lies elsewhere. Fans of the BIC lighter design may have perceived it differently, provided they were interested in fragrances.

Nevertheless, the saying holds: Cobbler, stick to your lasts. And BIC, stick to your pocket lighters!"
Rose Jam,07/25/2015,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Fragrance with Bubbles,"Ginger Ale, many love it, but many do not, yet it is one of the most consumed non-alcoholic and slightly bitter soft drinks. It has a distinctive and refreshing scent that has been very well captured here.

The fragrance:
Wow, what a rendition. You immediately smell the typical and citrusy Ginger Ale scent, as if you had poured yourself a glass of this herbal lemonade.
But now comes the truly special something about this fragrance. You actually feel as if you could taste or inhale the sparkling bubbles of the carbonation in the drink. It almost makes your mouth water, so much so that you would like to drink the scent, which you probably shouldn’t do… even if it says Cologne on the label.

The longevity is terrible. At first, you enjoy the pleasant scent, and in the next moment, you wonder if you had merely imagined it. It lasts barely 30 minutes before it completely disappears.
The sillage is weak; it could be compared to 4711 Eau de Cologne fragrances. It is not meant to project the scent into the surroundings, but rather to refresh oneself temporarily.

The bottle is weak, as always. But it is sufficient, as always.
The label is weak, as before. It has a lot of stuff written on it, as usual.

This fragrance has been very authentically realized, and I also found it great that it could even convey that sparkling sensation.

Aside from that, it is one of the rarer Demeter fragrances that I actually find wearable, as it has a certain similarity to Eau de Cologne and similar citrusy refreshing scents. However, you can only enjoy it very briefly, as it unfortunately (oh no, I say unfortunately for a Demeter fragrance!) vanishes in the next moment. But I think it is a good alternative to 4711 if you want a quick freshness kick, although 4711 probably lasts more than twice as long.

So, feel free to test it. If you ever see it or get your hands on it…

The longevity is impressive at around 8 hours, and the sillage is also noteworthy.

I can't really dissect the top, heart, and base notes here, as it consistently smells brutally floral. Before I delve into the floral varieties I perceive, it's worth mentioning that it also has fresh, green, spicy, soapy, creamy, and slightly powdery nuances. In my view, the bouquet consists of lilac, freesias, roses, jasmine, a lot of hyacinths, lilies, lotus, lily of the valley, and a hint of tuberose.

This is indeed a well-crafted, fresh, and clean floral fragrance. But as I said, the price..."
Black Pearl,12/13/2015,Fhaldara,F,60,,0,Sweet Pear in syrup,"This is a very sweet pear, the kind you find in syrup rather than the crisp pear right off the tree. It's surrounded by honeydew melon, sweet florals, and vanilla in the base, so there's really nothing to balance or temper all this sweetness. Pink grapefruit is listed as a note, but my nose can't find a trace of it. Still, despite all the sweet notes this is a pretty fragrance, though not one I wear often. I like wearing it when I'm wearing lacy blouses and full ruffled skirts and other ultra feminine clothing. It's listed for wear by both men and women, but I think it would take a very confident sort of man to pull it off! Longevity and sillage are decent."

But after letting it sit for a few minutes, it was a sweet aromatic woodland scent. I think the lavender, rosemary, and lemon blend wonderfully with the juniper wood. It did leave a slight yellow-green stain on the testing strip."
Assassin Remix,07/29/2024,Landshark321,M,746,,1,Robust green mossy blend with juniper and lavender,"Pineward Perfumes Juniperus is a very recent release from this Colorado/Utah-based house, a bold green mossy woody sharp blend featuring juniper, lavender, rosemary, patchouli, and sandalwood. It has a vaguely savory background with the rosemary but mainly a bold center of that smells like rich spring outdoor experience in the woods, full of plants and life and a mossy greenness that seems to come from the juniper and lavender, a little sharp but not too sharp, and not really floral despite what I figure to be a good use of lavender. It feels like a relatively full masculine-leaning fresh cologne, perhaps something that might’ve appeared in the last 25 years in a designer lab but with a little more grace and authenticity. A very interesting release that I’m nonetheless unsure I would wear a lot. Overall, though, I like it very much.

Juniperus is EDT concentration and is priced at $135/80/50 for 57/37/17ml and performs quite well, so it’s a great value, perhaps better so than the line’s higher-concentration options at higher price points.

Fun Times,12/19/2012,MariellaMmmh,F,215,,20,If I had...,"... commented and rated you a year ago, you would have received full marks and a tailored hymn of praise. I would have appreciated your floral freshness, the slightly green notes, the subtle raspberry fruitiness, and the light woody finish. Well, if I had done that, you would have come off better.
But I didn't.
And now I will be ruthlessly honest with you.
You annoy me.
Your floral freshness smells artificial. You're chewing noisily on a raspberry Hubba Bubba, so also artificial raspberry, no subtle fruitiness, but a full-on smack right in the face. Ouch.
Your finish... Well. Just get on with it already. Thanks.

Overall: Met you while tipsy in the night, thought you were great, and took you home. The next morning, I was horrified to realize that I had drunk something pretty, and now in a rush and panic, trying to get rid of the souvenir.

So, when I'm drunk, it goes... ;)"
Fun Times,09/27/2011,Cristalle,F,45,,6,Fly with Raspberry Flavor - or Skin Chemistry Part Two,"Do you know Flit? It used to be very well-known and widely used, even though it really smelled terrible. Flit came from the Flit spray (unfortunately, I don't have a photo at hand) and reliably sent even the toughest six to eight-legged critters to the great beyond in no time. As far as I know, it wasn't particularly health-promoting for humans either.

Today in the perfumery, the bottle of Addict Shine caught my eye: clear lines and a color that promised a light elegance combined with freshness. The first test on paper cards confirmed: oh, nice, fresh - I'll give this a try. So I generously sprayed the ""addictive substance"" on the back of my hand. Indeed, the opening was as expected fresh-fruity-floral. Unexpectedly, however, something sharp almost burned my nasal mucous membranes, and that was definitely not the alcohol. Shortly thereafter, caramelized, sticky artificial raspberries covered the back of my hand. And to top it all off, a hefty dose of Flit with raspberry aroma (apparently a modernized version à la Impulse deodorant) followed, which proved to be extremely persistent. Any fruit fly or wasp would have already fled with flapping wings and galloping little legs at the mere scent of the artificial aroma.

I've encountered other Dior fragrances that I wouldn't subject myself to for any amount of money or good words, but that definitely doesn't mean I think they're bad. They just don't suit my taste at all. However, I never expected there would be a scent that would make me shudder in horror. There are now countless regulations that prohibit super delicious-smelling ingredients, which are bitterly missed by legions of perfume lovers, but who in the name of three devils is protecting us from substances that make every fly drop dead from the wall?! I'm going to start a petition now; surely Angie needs to bang on the table and give the Europeans a good kick in the pants.

So - I'm off... Scrubbing off the poison, averting a coma, and submitting the petition. (I'll post the link later if I make it through tomorrow)"
Fun Times,09/21/2010,Woelfin,F,243,,7,The Number 1!,"I've wanted this fragrance for so long, and I really hope it will be mine soon.

The bottle is a dream. I love these Addict bottles. They are simple, elegant, and showcase clear lines. They represent exactly what the fragrance conveys: There are no compromises here. We are talking about Dior!

While the ""normal"" Addict is a very intense, somewhat heavier evening scent, Addict Shine comes with a refreshing, fruity-delicious, and carefree note that invigorates its wearer and simply brings her to life.
It is definitely a fragrance that I did not expect from Dior.

Towards the ""end,"" Addict Shine also remains delicious, but it becomes softer, more feminine, and overall still uncomplicated and unobtrusive. In my opinion, the predecessor fragrances also have very clear positive aspects, but they can never quite match Shine (for me). A fragrance that leaves you wanting more. It works anytime, fits any occasion, and is still simply Dior.

I envision the woman wearing this fragrance running through wide, tall flower meadows, dressed in a light, loosely fitting dress. In the distance, fruit trees stand, gently swaying in the wind ...

I love it."

Lush Interior 2 White Kyara,05/14/2014,Seerose,F,775,HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Herbs in the Ruins without Arches,"First, I read FranFan's comment and stumbled upon the explanation of the origin of the name ""Arc"" L'Arc. Karnak and arches? I ran to our exhibition poster: ""Prussia on the Nile,"" where the ruins of Karnak are depicted in the 19th century and drawn in the state they were in when someone from a German expedition meticulously sketched them there. The then-modern cameras could not withstand the climate on the Nile. Drawings can often depict reality more authentically than photos, as is the case here.
These ruins look more like a further developed and very refined construction of Stonehenge. There are no arches, only columns with cross stones placed on them, artistically designed and smoothly finished, beautiful columns. Everything is covered with engraved hieroglyphs and people depicted in profile in the style of that time. Everything is in decay; tilted and broken columns, fallen stone blocks. And in the midst of it, to show the size relations, a small group of people is sketched, half sitting and leaning against the huge fallen stone blocks. No arches, nowhere.
So much for ""Karnak"" in the 19th century, now to ""Aventure"":
I have never smelled a scent like this before. At first, I smell a mixture of mandarin and sandalwood, strange and not unpleasant. Then a fruity acidity like that of unripe fruit mixes in. This acidity transforms into a citrusy one after about 20 minutes. I actually expected a foul-smelling jasmine. But I smell nothing of the sort, no jasmine at all. Or one that I do not know. ""Aventure"" has a peculiar scent. Something herbal is present, tarragon, possibly coriander leaves, maybe both could be it.
The L'Arc fragrances are not complicated; this one also has a short development for me and then stands: slightly fruity-woody and citrusy, bitter, somewhat herbal, without sweetness, without resinous notes. Musk or vanilla do not come through for me. It could be one of the herbal scents.
Overall, a subtle fragrance that, despite its strange scent mixture, does not trigger a washing impulse for me. The longevity is okay.
""Aventure"" is a wearable spring and summer scent for those who like such sour herbal fragrances without sweetness, in my opinion. Men could also at least test this scent."
Lemony Flutter,10/22/2025,Bostonfrags,M,1,,1,Velvet Passion Oud,"The opening is bright and fruity with a passion fruit accord. This quickly dissipates and turns into a smoky incense that is a bit mysterious and very satisfying to the nose. The dry down seems to be a slight oud with a silk scent. It is one of the smoothest oud dry downs I have ever smelled. The scent projects loud for an hour or two and lasts as a smooth silky oud scent for 6-7 hours.
As others have mentioned the DNA is similar to Oud Maracuja but there are difference. Oud maracuja is brighter and fruitier while Velvet Passion Oud is the smoky mysterious cousin. If you want to make a statement and want an in your face fragrance go with Oud Maracuja by Maison Crivelli. If you want a more subdued, mysterious fragrance go with Velvet Passion Oud by Dolce & Gabana.
I also view Velvet Passion Oud as better for cooler temperatures, where as Oud Maracuja thrives in hot temperatures."

Goddess,04/01/2025,Garnele,M,319,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Oud? More floral and fruity than anything else,"Musk wa oud, so Musk and Oud has not listed any Musk, which surprised me quite a bit, because I can clearly smell Musk.

The opening is very Musk-heavy, fruity, sweet, and at the same time fresh.
The fruity notes are not particularly authentic.
Everything feels a bit too synthetic and carelessly made.
I can't even say which fruit I really perceive; it could be
mandarin or orange, along with lavender, which also doesn't really come across as high quality.

In the dry down, the floral notes take over, of which I perceive freesia the most.
I must say the dry down is more bearable and somewhat more feminine than the opening, which I would describe as unisex.
Even the dry down is still unisex, but it leans quite feminine.
Even though the scent develops more pleasantly, it never really feels high quality.
I no longer perceive ""Musk"" as strongly; the fruity notes also recede a bit into the background and accompany the floral notes until the end.
No trace of Oud at all.

Longevity on my skin is 4-5 hours.
Of course, this can vary from skin to skin.
Sillage is rather weak to moderate.
In the first hour, it's at most moderate; afterwards, it’s more of a skin scent on me.

Unisex? Just barely, especially due to the floral notes in the dry down being a bit too feminine for my taste (W70%/30%M).

My conclusion: too synthetic, no character, feels very cheap, I would not recommend it.
Khadlaj can definitely do better."

Salarium,08/26/2022,Elysium,M,898,,4,The Dream Of An Endless Summer,"If you're wondering what an old bad boy like me is doing with a buddy scent, read on. First, Hollister is a brand I've known for over a decade. To be exact, I fell in love with the fragrance I breathed in stores about ten years ago, so much so that I bought it. And I'm talking about SoCal COLOGNE. Since then, I have bought no other perfumes of the same brand, apart from it, which I still own today and I adore. Until the other day, when I made up my mind and tested the three fragrances of the Hollister's Festival collection for him. I only tried Festival Vibes for Him and Festival Nite for Him as Party had recently arrived in the store, and they didn't have the tester. Having a 50% discount available, I ventured into a bulk purchase and then blindly took all three but Party. And since I couldn't resist, I opened it first, and now I want to describe it to you. The official website depicts it as fresh, aquatic, aromatic, marine, and young. I find it important to say that the three perfumes are not flankers of each other, and each perfume has a different aroma from the others.

Ouch, Festival Party takes off with a blast of alcohol, very strong and in the face. Be aware and wait a moment before smelling it. Then, luckily, a pleasant citrus note of lemon mixed with salty pepper replaces the alcoholic edge, with a clear blue lavender playing in the background. The first impression is an interesting summer cologne with fresh and aquatic undertones. Because of the very gorgeous, eye-catching light red box and featuring the mango element, I was expecting something exotic, overly sweet, and fruity. Instead, this scent opens up fresh and peppery, with a hint of nuanced mango that's nowhere near as sweet as I feared. Think unripe mango-flavoured water where the feeling is there but not the sweetness. So far, so good. Well, something familiar about that smell reminds me of another scent. I bet it is the mango, which has been used the same way in another fragrance. In the initial stage, the pepper and lemon mix stands out.

The scent turns mossy, aquatic, and still slightly fruity as time goes by. The heart releases whiffs of dewy flowers, which I guess are the waterlily blossoms, with a marine-like mossiness akin to algae and calone without the melon nuance. Of course, the green mango lingers around, not prominent but present. The middle stage merges sea and fruit.

Finally, the cologne dries to the earthy base of clean patchouli, enhanced by the presence of amber and a sweetish wood like guaiac. This final aroma stays long and lingers on the skin. As I said above, the perfume reminds me of another fragrance, and I think I'm not mistaken if I say that the fruity part in which the mango participates is very similar to the sensations released by Escape for Men EAU DE TOILETTE, the reformulated version in my possession. Same vibe, without the riot of aromatic herbs.

Festival Party dresses well in the scorching heat of outdoor summer afternoons and evenings. Most likely, the formula also includes a portion of Iso E Super because I still feel puffs of fragrance even when it's not as strong on my skin anymore. It has good duration, certainly more than half a day, and at the beginning, it also has a good projection. Promoted unexpectedly!

I base the review on a 50ml bottle I have owned since August 2022.

Coco Loco,10/22/2025,Pennantis,F,113,,1,Clean yet powerful yet tonka beast mode,"It goes for that creamy, soft-clean vibe, but on me it feels a bit heavy. Tonka bean totally steals the show — warm, sweet, with a hint of almond — so you really have to love tonka to enjoy this one.
It opens with a powdery, almost milky feel, then shifts into a sweet amber-vanilla base. I also catch some slightly indolic florals in there, which throw me off a bit — like, hmm? It’s missing some air, some contrast… it just stays kind of dense and flat.
Honestly, it reminds me of a Blanche Bête + lilac and wisteria added in. Chic in theory, but way too rich and overdone for my taste."

Cherry-floral with a slightly peppery summer scent, not too heavy, which is not the case for any of the candidates from the house. The opening is somewhat synthetic, a peppery, bright red cherry that drifts into a creamy note over time. Almost like a lovely cherry body lotion! I personally do not perceive either chestnut or violet, which is a plus for me with this perfume. In the drydown, sandalwood. The benzoin helps with better absorption and unfolding of the perfume on the skin. Those who want to experience the cherry-pepper kick again and again will unfortunately have to reapply throughout the day, but that is the case with all candidates from Zadic. The only exception: Just Rock Pour Elle."

Lush Sapphire,10/14/2014,Omni,F,71,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Love You Baby,"I was prompted to write a review of 'For Her' after smelling 'For Women' (white bottle) a few days ago.
This is the one (FH) with good sillage and elusive musks, the EDP is peachier with definite stickability.
The EDT is the equivalent of a Toyota Corolla, ubiquitous, rust free, user friendly with good economy. It lacks imagination but statistics show it benefits from repeat purchasers, and you can soup it up with the 'In colour' or 'Musc Intense' add-ons that men love, like a leather bound steering wheel or Recaro seats. That men love this is not in question, my husband loves the sillage hours after I have put it on.
Let's face it, it's a must have, it's your favourite pair of jeans or possibly your favourite pair of knickers; you, but better, with Narciso at the leather bound steering wheel, cruising the Napa valley, tasting astringent wines that mellow with age, For Her in a Toyota Corolla."
Lush Sapphire,08/26/2014,ScentFan,F,336,,7,Walking Sex,"I first encountered Narciso Rodriquez For Her while visiting a girlfriend in Chicago. Trailing this perfume, she walked by me after we'd gotten dressed for an evening out. The scent riveted my attention. I asked what it was, wrote down the name, came home and promptly bought it. Later I learned it's a favorite of Michelle Obama, which helps explain why a love affair's been underway for so long at the White House. Last night hubby sniffed it for the first time in a while. It must have riveted his attention, too, because he informed me that instead of wasting time studying and buying different perfumes, I could just wear this. It was better than everything I had.

He's biased, being male. Narciso Rodriquez is a blatantly sexy fragrance. Its rich indolic top notes combine with the luxuriously musky heart to create a classy come-hither perfume. Nice to have it in our arsenals because there are times when all a female of our species really wants to say is, ""Hey, you handsome rascal over there. Stop gawking, come here, and unzip me."""

My primary interest was as I had read that this might be wearable and venture into the unisex realm? Trust me other than ""maybe"" the final end with a hint of woody notes, no! This is ""extremely sexy and for her"" sorry for the lack of tact but there is no other word! I knew from the initial sample spray it was an intoxicating opening of musk and orange blossom. Shortly later I could almost taste the amber and vanilla sweet elixir! This would make me be so bold as to ask a strange woman respectfully what she was wearing and give her an enthusiastic compliment. It held on tight to my masculine skin on the wrist so I assume it is a close skin scent which can be both very discreet and also perfect for an enchanting night with a significant. If it's any indication of the effect on a woman's neck I could not keep my nose from dipping to my wrist for most of the day, very sensual and magnetic! I now see why it is consistently listed with Dior Poison, TFBO and Coco Noir etc. when a ""certain"" forum topic comes up looking for bottle suggestions....it deserves it!

Lush Sapphire,03/06/2024,DogiCoco,F,637,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,The most overwhelming musk,"This review is meant to be a warning from someone who dislikes this fragrance. Please read on if you think about gifting or blind-buying this.

I know that Narciso Rodriguez For Her is hugely popular since it first came out, and over the years I have smelled it on some other women on whom it developes to a sexy, sensual musk scent that just edges on dirty but never fully goes there.
On me, it doesn‘t work at all. Neither this EDT, nor the EDP, nor most of the fragrances that are considered similar. I have tried lots of these perfumes, Velvet Haze, Cleopatra, Romantina... Almost all turn sour and sharp on me. The combination of the specific musks in the For Her line with patchouli just doesn‘t work on every skin. And the original For Her EDT is the worst of them all, it can smell skanky and almost urinuos at time and also has that strong, floral opening that is like a punch to the nose for me.
I‘m no fragrance wimp, I like some strong scents and don’t hate many, but when I gave For Her EDT another chance in 2018 because I got a new sample and sprayed it not on me, but on my husband's arm, I had to leave the room because I found it overwhelming. Last week I sampled it again on a blotter because I had it in a travelling fragrance box, and nope, still absolutely not for me.

So, this is not a barely-there soft office friendly skin musk, as some suggest. Anosmia to musk notes is common and I imagine that that‘s the reason while some perceive this as sexy or dirty and others as light white musk.
It‘s also totally different from the Narciso range in the cube shaped bottles. Those all have a different kind of musk note. I think it‘s softer and cleaner and I love it. So if you like something from one Narciso Rodriguez line, it‘s not impossible that you hate the other line. But if you love any of the scents regarded as similar and don't know this yet, it's a classic that's worth a try. I guess.
Just please don‘t overspray this one!"

Surely you have grabbed such a garment, brought it up to your face and smelled the familiar traces of your life there, even though the sweater is clean.

For Her is a bit like that: It smells warm, soft, comfortable, familiar, and while it is a light scent, it stays with you easily throughout the day.
Not an grand entrance maker or a sillage monster, this one won't get noticed unless someone comes close, which is exactly how I tend to prefer my scents to behave."

Lush Sapphire,12/14/2023,SVP,F,39,,1,Sharp and Delicate. Sexy and Poised.,"I really like this perfume, but I can easily see why it could also be polarizing for some people. It is sexy, sharp, and poised, but it can be delicate as well. It’s musk and powder and beautifully dries down to a white floral, but a citrusness is also very present.

The reason I can see people not being into it is the musk. It is musky, very musky, it is animalic, even though there is a citrusness to it and a light floral, that are things we pair with cleanness, it has an underlying skankiness to it. I love it, but I don't think it's a safe blind buy."

Lush Sapphire,11/04/2017,Basti87,M,1064,,25,Balanced Women's Fragrance with Style and Elegance,"Narciso Rodriguez For Her is a fragrance that has accompanied me for what feels like an eternity. It is my mother's favorite scent, and because of that, I have smelled this fragrance countless times and even gifted it. Once, I mistakenly bought the pink EDP, thinking it was the same scent, just stronger. A beginner's mistake from some time ago. Today, of course, I know that Intense, EDP, and their counterparts often differ from the EDT. This is also the case here. The EDT is the big star of this brand. The entire series of this fragrance, with all its flankers, is very popular in the fragrance community. And rightly so. The brand itself is quite unknown, but with this fragrance, Narciso Rodriguez has hit the jackpot. I own the men's version, For Him, which harmonizes with this scent and goes in a similar direction. Both are designed by the living legend Francis Kurkdjian, here in collaboration with Christine Nagel, who is also no stranger.

The bottle is fitting for the fragrance: simple, elegant, and very stylish. A heavy, understated bottle that feels good in the hand.
Upon freshly spraying it, it immediately starts off very elegantly and impresses with a confident elegance. It begins with a lot of power, bursting with full floral intensity. Orange blossom and osmanthus are very present from the start. Soon, a lovely musk note joins in. For women's fragrances, this dosage is rather unusual, but it beautifully sets this scent apart and gives it an interesting individuality. It also pairs wonderfully with the floral notes. A touch of bergamot adds a slight freshness and lightens it up. A bit of sensual amber complements it. This fragrance is wonderfully sensual, yet not too provocative. Sexy in a stylish way. Towards the end, a light sweetness emerges, likely from vanilla. However, this sweetness is rather subtle in the background. What stands out throughout the entire duration is a lovely floral note with plenty of musk on a slightly powdery base. Extremely well done. It is very balanced and versatile.

The performance is quite good, especially in the first few hours. However, after 5 hours, it becomes quite weak. Unfortunately. It remains somewhat lasting, but more in a light version. Nevertheless, it has a convincing performance, as it radiates well for many hours.
This fragrance is also versatile due to its elegant balance. It fits especially well with a more sophisticated outfit. Wonderful to wear for the evening, in leisure time, or even in everyday work. It will definitely appeal to the majority. Additionally, it is a year-round fragrance, except in very hot temperatures. A clear recommendation for purchase for women and as a gift idea for men. It may not be cheap, but it remains within a reasonable range."

It is certainly not a bad perfume (so many fans can't be wrong) and the H/S is excellent, but: I cannot stand it on myself.

Lush Sapphire,04/30/2017,Parma,M,277,,18,"Wow, what a woman!","This fragrance leaves me a bit uncertain. On one hand, I find it very special and attractive, on the other hand, I feel that it might be just a tad too much for me or that I would eventually tire of it. Referring to the title, I would initially be fascinated by the woman if I saw her for the first time and even for some time afterward, before I would realize that she might be too much for me, too much woman. But that doesn't have to be the case; it's just a feeling :)
After reading that Kurkdjian developed this fragrance, I thought it fits. I find many of his scents to be very pleasant, very soft, enveloping, and dense, although never too heavy and of very high quality. However, over time, they usually become too much for me, perhaps because they are too perfect.

Fragrance development:
The opening is unusual, surprising, and beautiful. I perceive a slightly dry red wine note mixed with a gummy-sweet cherry note. This combination is quite fascinating. After a few minutes, it transforms into an elegant lipstick note with a slightly dirty-dry undertone. For the first time, I had the association of a mature (not in age), elegant, and seductive woman who is very aware of her effect. This lipstick impression lingered for a long time before a somewhat indefinable floral note pushed more to the forefront. Throughout the truly long development, this fragrance remains so floral-powdery, with vetiver and patchouli providing a very slightly herbaceous-earthy touch. I assume that the osmanthus oil, which is said to have a very intensely sweet and uplifting scent, contributes to this unusual, slightly cherry-floral impression.

Longevity and sillage:
The longevity was excellent at over 12 hours. After a night, I could still perceive it well on my wrist. The sillage was distinctly noticeable for over 12 hours, although it was never too dominant. This long and strong longevity was also a problem I had with the fragrance. It was on the verge of being overpowering for me.

Bottle:
I really like the shape and color; it symbolizes the modern, feminine elegance of the fragrance well.

Conclusion:
A fascinatingly elegant feminine fragrance, mysterious, seductive, lovely, floral, powdery, cherry-like. A great mix of softness and strength! For me, it's on the edge of being too much. Perfect for occasional use, especially for going out and seducing :)"
Lush Sapphire,01/22/2014,Missjo,F,39,,27,The Many Faces of Narciso Rodriguez,"Do you know that feeling when curiosity grabs you, and you can't rest until you've unraveled a secret? Or when ambition takes hold, and you practice until you've not only mastered something but brought it to perfection?

Not knowing or being unable to do something bothers me. Especially when it comes to my hobby. About a year ago, I noticed that I had a kind of ""scent blindness"" to musk fragrances. To be precise, I was testing Narciso Rodriguez's ""For Her"" and smelled - nothing. Or almost nothing. I recorded this irritating experience in my comment on the EdP. And learned that you can train your nose or your brain. You can guess what comes next ;-)

I started with a bottle of the EdP and then tested all the flankers that came my way. And there are quite a few, as Mr. Rodriguez has made it his mission to capture musk in all its facets and bottle it. I haven't gone through all the variations yet, but I want to give you a little overview - maybe it will help some of you with your selection.

“For Her” EdP: Musk as a floral-warm, rounded, rich scent. Sensual but not overtly animalistic. In the course, it is rather calm. Very nice, but more cuddly than seductive.

“For Her” EdT: in the top note significantly more floral, ""happier,"" and more effervescent than the EdP. Towards the base, a clear shift towards musk and vetiver, making it feel more restless and exciting. Overall more enticing, sexier, and younger than the EdP. Unfortunately, I can't reconcile myself with the vetiver note.

“For Her in Color”: strong similarity to the “For Her” EdP, especially in the base. Amber & musk are emphasized, making it feel a bit more animalistic.

“Musc Collection for Her”: even more musk and amber. The other notes are only barely perceptible to me; at most minimally floral, and on my skin also minimally sweet (but really only minimally). It clearly stands out from sweet-fruity mainstream fragrances; definitely unmistakable. Even more animalistic than “In Color” - for me, it's already too much.

“For Her Delicate” EdT: noticeably fruitier and a bit sweeter than the original, especially in the top and heart notes. Perhaps an approach to the currently preferred fragrance direction in the mainstream. Yet it is precisely the uniqueness that makes the NR fragrances so special and desirable. The base, however, approaches the EdT again; however, the vetiver is not as present, or is kept in check by the lingering fruity aromas.

“Essence”: the clean musk. Oh, is it CLEAN! It smells just like I imagined the scent of “Pure White Linen” would smell. Freshly washed, impeccably clean, pore-deep pure white laundry, dried in the fresh air of a spring day, amidst a meadow with small, colorful flowers. The opening is overwhelming. One could also say, penetrating. Clean. And even cleaner. After 1-2 hours, it becomes typically soft-creamy for NR, but it remains one of the cleanest clean scents I have ever smelled.

“Essence Eau de Musc”: more like clean, freshly lotioned skin than clean laundry. At the very beginning, it also has a fresh laundry note, but more citrusy than its predecessor. And it transforms in the next few minutes into a well-groomed, delicately fresh skin scent. Especially lovely in summer.

I intentionally wrote nothing about the sillage, as it is perceived VERY differently from person to person, especially with musk fragrances.
Some can't perceive these scents at all or only very faintly. Most perceive them fairly well, like other perfumes. When I apply 3-4 sprays of “For Her” EdP in the morning, most have to come quite close in the afternoon to smell anything. However, a colleague can still smell me in the hallway even then. Not that he minds - he thinks the scent is great (verbatim: “Incredible! IN-CREDIBLE!!”). Generally, “For Her” seems to be quite well received by men, but not in an overtly erotic way like, for example, “Hypnotic Poison,” but rather in a nicely groomed, feminine way.

If I have piqued your interest now: have fun testing! There’s something for everyone at NR :)"
Lush Sapphire,11/13/2013,BackToBlack,M,112,,36,Stop and let it sink in until the darkest spot in your soul,"""The black is like a cooling of the relative to the zero point.
In this ambivalent interpretation of calm and activity lies for me the principle of black, like a great breath."" - Reiner Ruthenbeck

Yes, I also have a great breath. However, it is not calm and certainly not regular when I smell For Her EdT. Yes, even when I think of it, it boils inside me.

I have recently become aware of it. It fascinated me from the very beginning. Yesterday I discovered it on my niece and was delighted to find that it also works well on my skin, even if only for a short time. But there is no tension at all. I sprayed it on my scarf and since I once again couldn't sleep much, I smelled it for half the night and let myself be intoxicated by it.

The bottle feels cool against my neck with its appearance. A simple, small block, dyed black on the inside, with the name of the perfume written in small pink letters.

It is only cool in its appearance. Narciso R. EdT is a very powdery, skin-close, and brilliant scent for the most beautiful moments in our lives. It has nothing evil about it, yet it has everything under control when one wants to approach it. It is powerful in its revelation and lets everyone know who is in charge here. To play around and wrap someone up is just as good for it as for a femme fatale. However, it seduces not with its appearance, but with its character. Gracefully and skillfully, it wraps many around its finger. In my circle of friends, the scent has a pretty high standard. Yes, it makes quite a few of us quite giddy. Let's take a little carousel ride, dear community, and then enjoy a really good vanilla ice cream ;0)

I have to think a little bit about soft sex first when I hold the scent close to my nose and really inhale it deeply. A little flirt, a tension between the two poles, hot glances... what started in pouring rain and then continued next to the fireplace. Sensual, bubbling little kisses fly onto my skin and let everything melt so beautifully into me. It literally merges with one... As DaveGahan101 wrote before me - I could lie down in this scent and linger in it for hours, it excites and ignites me so much!

The soft sex jumps off after the bergamot retreats to the background with the fine orange. The two form an extremely good connection with each other and do not play off against one another. They remain on the same line. They are straightforward, like the bottle of the perfume itself. Osmanthus is very aquatic for me here and keeps the scent somewhat grounded so as not to sink into the depths right away. All in all, a very clean, feminine scent that has very clear structures. No corners and edges - but hey! - also round and full, and in this case very, very powdery can be extremely interesting... I have to (and don’t know why) think of a somewhat plump woman when I let my imagination play. Full femininity, wrapped in beautiful, noble black clothing - round eyes and quite a respectable chest. The laughter always spread wide across her face and an aura that doesn't let go of you...

When the creaminess joins in, then it is perfect for me. Musk has spread its path wide in the perfume. It is the heart of the perfume. It gives it the depth it needs. But it never lets itself fall. The freshness has departed. Nothing is aquatic anymore. It is now powdery-creamy and has this unforgettable and very own floral touch. Softness takes the stage. So soft that the previous kisses return, but no longer melt into me, rather glide over my body like warm wax. Creamy, flowing, and so cuddly... It remains like this until the end. The passionate blood of my imagination pulses. The breath begins to hitch. The carousel spins faster and faster... The lights around me form a line - a spectacle for my eyes - a feast for my senses. I almost lose my grip within myself and seem to fall - even if it is only in a dream... And then this vanilla - noble, soft, and so arousing. Vetiver holds back in the background, supporting the vanilla and giving it a certain degree in the fragrance note.

The thought of soft sex is over. Now a very passionate thought of sex has emerged - pushing against the wall, kissing intensely and for a long time - then throwing oneself onto the bed - stressing the slats to the limit!

Narciso R. EdT is not something that comes off as dirty and cheap - no, on the contrary. It is a noble drop that carries so much softness within it that it makes the hard-boiled among us shudder. It ignites the senses and every man loves it when the bed linen smells of the woman after his veins and pupils have dilated...

The sillage is fine, the longevity is grand. I can imagine that the clothes still smell of the perfume even after a night of debauchery for at least two days.

So let it sink in until you reach the darkest spot of your soul. It will thank you for this - because Narciso EdT does not darken it, it only makes it brighter.

In this sense - I jump off the carousel and am still quite confused. A perfume that carries no hardness within it yet can dominate with its softness. I am slowly coming to my senses. Returning to the ground...

I would shine even in the glow of hell... But only with her. Only with the woman who reaches my heart with her skillful, feminine manner. Who gently woos me - lets me fall again and again - then takes my hand again and returns to the carousel.
Narciso R. Edt - You are unique and I am addicted to you!

I admit it!"
Lush Sapphire,05/30/2015,MarkusH,M,102,,26,.....Black Widow.....,"Twelve years have passed,
twelve years without seeing,
twelve years without smelling,
twelve years missed,
but now I have it in my hand, the happiness-bringer in a black silk dress.
I must confess that it has already been half a year since I first had Narciso Rodriguez under my nose on a test strip. At that moment, it already had a bit of a wow effect because I had never smelled a fragrance like this before.
A black heavy bottle protects this very beautiful women's fragrance like a bodyguard and gives off a minimalistically elegant impression, somewhat resembling the simplicity of Chanel's bottles.
Narciso Rodriguez for Her is a dark women's fragrance, without really appearing dark.
It has a very straightforward elegance with a very present aura that can make a woman shine irresistibly without being intrusive.
An elegant lady, dressed seductively in black silk, gracefully descends the stairs in her villa with an elegant presence. Her long, slightly wavy black hair
seems to flow with the black silk on her skin. A breeze breathes life into her dress, making it look as if she is gliding down the stairs. Darkly made-up eyes gaze at me from a pale face, whose lips are dipped in a dark red. My heart seems to stop for a moment, my breath catches. Time seems to stand still. Only the pendulum of the large grandfather clock in the foyer seems to move back and forth. My heartbeat synchronizes with the pendulum of the clock and brings me back to the here and now. Sunbeams break in the window and fall on her pale face, illuminating her beauty.
The scent of citrus fruits paired with floral nuances of roses swirls in the air, where the sweetness of a ripe peach joins to leave a fruity-floral odor in the top note. Her movements are like those of a fairy, her eyes are as deep as the sea, and I threaten to drown in them. The heavy sweetness of amber and musk envelops my nose and makes her visage appear irresistible; I am captivated by her beauty.
Like a balm, this fragrance lays a film over all the objects and people in the foyer, bringing warmth and coziness to this very high-ceilinged hall. With grace, she glides past me and completes her scent with noble woods and an aromatic vanilla, keeping a green nuance in reserve. This fragrance does not fall short of the shine and beauty of this mysterious lady for a single second. Narciso Rodriguez for Her is capable of giving every woman this beauty and mysterious aura, making her shine irresistibly and seductively. A fragrance that puts men in a dream and can see the true beauty of every woman. A very sensual, erotic oriental fragrance that honors the female gender as it deserves. For Her only emphasizes the beauty of every woman and accompanies her with a balm-like indulgence throughout the day, and thanks to its strong sillage, it does not let men pass by emotionlessly. A very beautiful fragrance from which I wish to have a similarly for Him variant."

This is probably due to the incredibly fluffy-transparent musk, which still somehow feels dense. The bergamot and..."
Lush Sapphire,10/08/2019,Pinkdawn,F,68,,19,Snow White's Evil Stepmother,"Since I love fragrances not just as perfume but in general, I ordered some pleasantly scented Yankee Candles and other scented candles online for the cold season. Along with the candles, I was kindly sent two perfume samples, which were very welcome. I always look forward to discovering new scents. One of these samples, which Flaconi provided me, was For Her by Narciso Rodriguez.
Right upon spraying, I felt as if I had stepped into a bouquet of spring flowers. Memories of Pleasures by Estée Lauder come flooding back. Yes, there it is again, that unmistakable clarity. The scent feels clean and subtle. So far, that's my first impression, which I can't rationally explain. Because in terms of composition, the two have little in common. Pleasures starts with a lot of green notes, violet leaf, and white lily, while For Her opens with bergamot, orange blossom, and osmanthus. Surprisingly, I notice little bergamot, even though I usually identify this citrus note quite quickly. However, the orange blossom, which I appreciate much less, also stays very much in the background. What seems to connect both perfumes is a rather unsweet freshness that soon becomes rosy. In Pleasures, it's rose and peony that make their grand, romantic appearance. Here, it must be the less romantic osmanthus, I think.
For Her briefly takes on a somewhat fruity character in the soon-to-emerge base note, which I can't explain from the ingredients either. Then, a dry, powdery sweetness develops that is very natural and has come to stay. It could be mimosa. Or daffodil. In any case, I am now surrounded by a pleasant, delicate soapy scent that is now revealing its uniqueness. Unknown flowers are opening up, which at least I cannot identify. The blend has something exquisite, noble, expensive - definitely unusual.
The scent has picked up speed, or so it seems to me, having found itself after all those detours. And it has matured. Still, it lacks no temperament. It has something new, striking, interesting, original, is trendy, yet always remains polished and unobtrusive. This sounds contradictory, but it is not, as everything unites in a kind of refined cheerfulness. Ideal for work in the management level or at board meetings. Elegant, but not too classic. A balancing act along the mainstream, it never pushes itself to the forefront. The freshness is long gone and has made way for a subtle exoticism that presents itself very forcefully in its dark presence.
In other words: The scent is quite pleasant, clear, straightforward, but also elitist, yes, dominant. It has nothing playful about it, rather something serious, determined, self-assured. Coquetry is foreign to it. In this sense, it is more suitable for mature personalities, which I don't necessarily mean in terms of age.
The sweetness is ultimately characterized by woody tones. The patchouli makes it earthy and quirky.
The unusual scent undoubtedly has a high recognition factor. I would call it heavy and strong. Perhaps too strong. At least for me. Not even the musk is sweet, but clearly black. For Her is striking, not easily categorized, irritating, uncompromising. Such a scent must be liked and, above all, worn. I miss the lovely, gentle aspect that I would have at least expected from the vanilla, which I can't recognize anyway. For me, For Her is too unwieldy, too challenging. I miss the smile, the charm, the flirt, a subtle eroticism and feminine sensuality in this scent. We are not made for each other. If this scent were a woman, we probably wouldn't become friends.
I hope no one will hate me for saying that the woman I could imagine wearing For Her would be Snow White's stepmother. However, the scent lacks all demonic, mysterious qualities that would suit a witch. What makes me think of the evil stepmother is also the unexpected coldness. Amber, musk, vanilla, and patchouli usually give a perfume warmth, even to the fiery, passionate extent. Here, you feel the coldness of determination. The woman who wears For Her cannot be imagined as hesitant or moody. Mood swings are foreign to her. She knows what she wants and has the strength to get it or assert herself.
Those who identify more with the poor, innocently persecuted Snow White will probably be too weak for this harsh, angular scent..."
Lush Sapphire,11/06/2019,Karloleo,F,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Lovely ❤️,"Today, a little tester of this fragrance fluttered into my home.
I unpacked it right away and sprayed it on.
Mmhh... A wonderfully delicate scent caresses my nose.
But wait a minute... I know this scent!
So I took another sniff.
I couldn’t quite place it at first.
But then...
Yes, it’s Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker.
For Her actually smells very similar, but without the overpowering woody note that has always bothered me about Lovely.
For me, it’s a scent a bit like baby oil. Soft and sweet.
Simply wonderful.
Lovely never made it into my collection because of that strong woody note that I didn’t like, but the scent has never let me go.
So I’m even more excited to have discovered For Her for myself.
It definitely has what it takes to end up in my collection soon."
Lush Sapphire,12/30/2021,Herbstblond,F,4,,28,Infinity,"For Her and I, we have known each other for quite a while.

Many encounters in life, whether with people or fragrances, turn out to be fleeting or companions for a season. And then there is the one who patiently waits in the background, who is always there, and has always felt like it. The one who understands you without needing a grand stage, who grounds you when you need support, who wipes the tears from your face when you are sad, looks deep into your eyes, and says that everything will be alright again, one day. And you believe him because you just know he is right.
He also accompanies you in good times. This love is not passionate, but it is real. And lasting. And on a level that all other encounters, which started off blazing and fiery, never reached.

I got to know the fragrance, like so many others, through a colleague who always over-applied it. No joke, even the samples she brought to the lab smelled of it. However, she never revealed the name of the perfume, but everyone knew whether she was there, or whether she had been there that day.

I had never heard of Narciso Rodriguez before, and through a sample from Douglas, I discovered which mysterious scent it was by chance, and I was already working somewhere else - so our paths came together. Because when a fragrance is so much claimed by someone else in your environment, I hesitate to use it. You surely know that feeling.

What I particularly like about For Her is this bitter note in the base, which causes many problems for others. I can't perceive a great scent evolution here, except that the opening with osmanthus can be quite loud and a bit overwhelming. However, that settles down after about half an hour, and then it remains as it is.

Patchouli is subtly in the background, as is the amber; the main actor is clearly musk, and somewhat ""dirty,"" physical, alluring. This note particularly emerges after many hours, best at the hairline the next morning, or on clothing (on which it lasts for days, by the way). Actually, musk is not really my thing, especially not the white one. This one is different. Many talk about the ""Narciso musk."" I can't judge, as I don't like the other Narciso fragrances.

I can imagine that the fragrance has an effect on men, also because it is not so ""in your face"" sexy, but more subtle. To perceive this sultry musk, one must get quite close to the wearer, as the scent does not radiate as much in this phase as it did at the beginning. I love this so much; For Her harmonizes so wonderfully with my skin that it becomes more of a ""body scent"" than a perfume - I can't describe it well, maybe you know what I mean.

The longevity and sillage are enormous for an EdT. You will definitely be noticed; even hours later, the molecules of the scent linger in the room, and sensitive noses will pick this up. If you don't overdo it, I can imagine For Her in just about any life situation, especially at work, as it radiates strength and seriousness due to its bitter note. By the way, I don't find it cool at all. A bit distant perhaps, but only in its projection. On the skin, it is warm, woody, and erotic. Two sides of a fragrance, if you will.

The bottle is timelessly beautiful; Narciso Rodriguez has created a true classic with For Her that I hope will never be discontinued.

For Her is not the type you hitchhike through South America with. Nor is it the one with whom you maintain a casual affair. For Her is the one you marry."
Lush Sapphire,11/01/2011,Turandot,F,839,,21,One should never say never,"Actually, such scents are not really my preferred direction, but I've been lingering here with my nose on my wrist for quite a while and find the perfume fascinating. Even though there is nothing fresh, nothing green, nothing dark, and nothing mystical about it, For Her EdT is wonderfully soft, powdery, and reminds me of the feeling of cashmere on the skin.

We can safely overlook the honey in the top note; it hardly comes to the fore, but the relatively simple flowers quickly merge with the rather extraordinary heart note. Orange blossoms take center stage here. Amber and musk are usually experienced only in the base, but here they give the fragrance volume and sophistication right from the start. For Her is rounded off with very subtle woody notes. Relatively simple, yet cleverly crafted, it results in a perfume that I could very well imagine as a winter scent - even though it would completely fall outside my collection. Powdery, skin-like, and incredibly elegant!

For me, this is further proof that one should not always test in one direction, but be open to all new scent experiences."
Lush Sapphire,12/20/2014,Unruh,M,97,,20,Gift for my favorite female nose,"My girlfriend is rather the minimalist and pragmatic type when it comes to perfumes. Not entirely selfless, I introduced her to both versions of ""For Her,"" both the Eau de Toilette and the Eau de Parfum, for testing some time ago.
While the Eau de Parfum met with restrained pleasure due to the slightly musty peach, the Eau de Toilette was a hit, especially regarding the more beautiful bottle!

A little aside: I tend to be more classically inclined when it comes to scents. For men, I prefer something spicy, dry, unsweetened, while for women, I love to smell light to opulent floral fragrances or sometimes a sensual gourmand.

Now, back to the fragrance...
The Eau de Toilette impresses with a fantastically full floral note, osmanthus and orange bloom in full splendor. In the heart note, the scent becomes softer and warmer, without losing too much of its top note, while amber and musk enhance its slightly powdery sensuality. It becomes subtly vanilla towards the end, as ""For Her"" fades away after many, many sensual, floral hours.
In my opinion, ""For Her"" is best suited for autumn and winter, perhaps also for early spring. At temperatures beyond the 20 °C mark, this fragrance could feel too heavy and too overwhelming, perhaps even too ""dark"".

...when the stylish little bottle finally appeared in one of her boots two weeks ago on St. Nicholas Day, we both found an olfactory fulfillment. She is thrilled, and I can hardly keep my nose away from her. ;D"
Lush Sapphire,04/22/2020,Eaumygosh,F,74,,11,Seductive Elegance -,"- or in other words: the tailored suit among fragrances, where the top button of the blazer can remain unbuttoned to reveal a glimpse of the lace top underneath.

Sometimes I have to force myself to find happiness. In the form of blind purchases. I try to keep my collection as balanced as possible, even though my love for powdery-sweet, warm scents is clearly evident. So sometimes I visit the local perfumery with a clear goal: I am looking for an elegant office scent. - In the end, I test my way through the selection and probably end up choosing another flanker that I already have in a similar version five times in my collection. Therefore, I also like to order blindly based on reviews in this forum. Especially when there is an attractive offer. This was also the case with “For Her EdT,” and a 50ml bottle found its way into my possession - in the hope of finally having found an elegant office scent.

The start of our story was bumpy. After the first testing attempts, the scent quickly ended up in the closet. Whether on clothing or skin - it was hardly perceptible to me. A hint of nothing. A trace of musk and that was it. If I hadn't known that the seller sold 100% genuine products, I would have thought the scent was a fake. But I quickly realized that I was the problem - the rest of my family could perceive it. Some described it as very delicate, while others even found it quite intense. Thus, “For Her EdT” led a miserable existence in the closet, at least for a few months. Then I gave it another chance, and this time I could perceive it; the spell seemed broken.

The first impression? Delicate floral body powder with a large dose of musk. Powdery, woody, well-groomed, slightly sultry, and somehow cool - distant. I perceive a rosy note - however, it is not pure and clear. Much more, it is a dark rose, without a fabric softener note. The scent does not leave a noteworthy scent trail on my skin - the first impression remains. The longevity is good, lasting up to 8/9 hours. The sillage is good - it is not overwhelming, but it is noticeable.

I find that “For Her EdT” is a very beautiful and unique scent. So well-groomed and clean, yet not pure. No, rather it comes across as distant, dark, and even a bit sultry. Dark roses, powder, and lots of musk. Not sweet and straightforward. Classic, sophisticated, elegant, and somehow also sexy. In a very grown-up way. It radiates confidence and class, which makes it so attractive.

I appreciate it and wear it on days when I want to feel particularly grown-up and elegant. Especially confident and classy.

Mission office scent? Check."
Lush Sapphire,02/17/2022,Annesyb,F,6,,19,"The ""little black dress"" in my collection","I rarely approach people about fragrances. However, a few years ago, I kept noticing the scent of a colleague. It was easily detectable without being overpowering, so I always knew in the stairwell if she was ahead of me. She revealed to me that it was Narciso Rodriguez ""For her"" Eau de Parfum. Never heard of it, so a few days later after work, I sprayed the fragrance in a nearby perfume shop and headed home. Oh wow! As good as it was on her, in the office air and in theory, unfortunately, I didn’t like it on myself. What a great scent! But the rose was just too dominant for me, and so it slipped into oblivion.

Fast forward 2 years later, I stumbled upon a fragrance review of the ""For her"" EdT and clicked on it for nostalgic reasons. Ah, the scent that is so beautiful, but I just don’t like it on myself… There I read with astonishment that the EdT and the EdP differ quite a bit, someone mentioned that particularly the prominent rose note in the EdT had been toned down, but the longevity was comparable to that of the EdP. The rest of the story is history…

The Narciso Rodriguez ""For her"" EdT is a truly wonderful fragrance that - I would claim - suits many women very well. A very voluminous and luxurious scent, the musk is clearly perceptible from start to finish. Floral-powdery with a certain sweetness and yet somehow cool. It changes little in the first hours, then towards the end becomes a cozy woody patchouli-musk-powder. A scent that is very difficult for me to describe, but it has a massive recognition value. It is dark, herb-sweet-creamy, yet very clean, sensual, and distinctly feminine. For me, it is the ""little black dress"" among my fragrances. Not a classic scent in that sense, but very seductive, feminine, and mature, yet tidy and clear.

Longevity is unbeatable for me for an EdT, 5-7 hours without a doubt, and even in the evening, you can still smell it on the wrist. Sillage is definitely there; personally, I don’t want to scent my entire surroundings, so I dose it sparingly, and yet it is perceived within a radius of a few meters. For me, it is more of an evening or occasion scent, which I also like to wear at home. In the office, I usually prefer ""Pure Musc,"" which is a bit tamer and less opulent.

For those who do not like overly sweet, heavy, oriental scents but are still looking for a more potent candidate that doesn’t smell ordinary and that you might actually get approached about, check it out! Unreserved recommendation from me. One of my declared favorites."
Lush Sapphire,03/29/2024,Greenfan1701,F,189,,23,HAPPY EASTER FESTIVAL,"At first, it's a total ""flower overload,"" but then the floral notes really unfold, and the woodiness mixes in, skillfully blending with the blossoms, making it feel a bit ethereal for me.

The soft, fine musk layer elegantly wraps around the floral-woody mixture, making the scent cozy and definitely a companion for everyday wear that suits any occasion.

I didn't even know it was over 20 years old; I thought it was younger. But it's good that I didn't know it back then; I surely wouldn't have bought it, as I preferred more masculine perfumes at that time.
But, as the saying goes, you get older and perhaps a bit wiser; now I really enjoy these very feminine scents, and this one is perfect for Easter. It brings joy and good spirits-what more could you want?

I wish you all a happy Easter festival with lots of colorful eggs and friendly rays of sunshine."
Lush Sapphire,06/30/2019,Smokeycherry,F,34,,11,The Thing with Roses,"When it comes to perfumes that smell like rose, it's a tricky matter for me. I absolutely do not like the scent of Bulgarian rose (think, the scent of Chloé?), but when I sniff a real rose at the nursery or on the farm, I find the scent incredibly beautiful; however, I find it hard to replicate that in perfumeries.
Unfortunately, many perfumes lean towards that Chloé direction, which I strongly reject. And I must say, For her smells very much like that to me, even though rose does not appear in the notes.
However, For her is slightly different in some respects, and that's why it's a perfume I enjoy wearing. It is woodier, powdery, and also smells very mature and sophisticated.
I also notice a huge similarity to Modern Muse by Estée Lauder.
The longevity is unbelievable. I treated myself to a half spray on the back of my hand for a quick refresh, and it really stays very present. I think this is the strongest perfume I own, and the sillage is also enormous. If I can't smell it anymore, I can rely on the fact that other people in the room still have it in their noses.
And to sum it up, anyone who loves roses will be very well served here."
Lush Sapphire,05/28/2014,Ergreifend,F,528,,19,You Fill My Heart with Love!,"According to Xavier, we are all born for love. Well, I completely agree with that. Unfortunately, neither Love nor Peace reaches every inhabitant of this planet. Sadly. The dream of peace and love slumbers in many good people. Unfortunately, it is not lasting. The thought of it is also shattered. Just at the first glance when you flip through the channels. Every day, you mostly hear bad news from the radio, you look into the newspapers, always some scandals, economic debacles, disputes, war, etc.

The world is the purest disgrace, my professor once said. A highly intelligent person who not only dealt with psychosomatics but also extensively with politics and, on the side, is active in a human rights organization.

I don't want to bore you with any world stories and paint the world in a bad light. Because you know what!? With so much crap (sorry), there is always something good. Life can be so beautiful. So full of love and completely free of sorrow. Do you know those days when you get up on the right foot, slowly but surely make your way into the oh-so-evil world with some really chill music? The first rays of sunshine greet you warmly, you are flooded with light, and you keep taking deep breaths. People walk back and forth, sneaking past you. Some even take the trouble to smile. Yes, it’s nice to be smiled at for a change. You suddenly don’t notice the noise of the city anymore, as you are well-rested and your body is completely rejuvenated. Great! I love this feeling and the thought that I am feeling so good. The body and soul are much more relaxed. Some tension just falls away from me!

On some good days, as well as nights, I put on For Her EdT. My mood skyrockets because I feel so much love for this perfume. From the very beginning, it left a fantastic impression on me. My fiancé was also so enthusiastic about the scent, and so far, I have already emptied two large bottles. I will surely be stocked up with For Her until death.

I like the pleasantness that For Her offers. It starts so harmoniously, and it’s as if the orange is whispering something in your ear. The perfume seems graceful and youthful to me. Something dark spreads in For Her, but somehow it also appears radiant to me. A bright spot in the black nothingness! That hits the nail on the head, in my opinion! Beautiful but slowly, this unmistakable musk comes into play and makes it more mature, cuddly, and above all, sensual. It also becomes powdery and makes my mood do daring somersaults when it goes there. So beautifully powdered, as if a shower of rose petals is falling on you, all surrounded by fine powder that gently lingers in the air... Then wood sneaks in, making it stronger and more dominant. However, the scent never slips into the masculine. It remains feminine, very steadfast, and still very alluring. The male world loves it. My husband is eating out of my hand when I wear For Her. Those are such beautiful moments in life. He holds on to me for a long time and surrounds me with his very own way. For Her EdT has a high recognition value, and I would also perceive it from afar!

But sometimes I just want to be alone when I wear this scent. I just want to have it for myself. To feel the scent on me, to truly perceive it, without any distractions. I can only do this when I am completely alone and really give myself to the scent. For that, I tune into Xavier and let myself be entertained. However, this does not diminish the relationship with the perfume.

Actually, we could all fly.. Yes! Why not?
Through pink, powdery musk clouds that linger above us!
You must live your life
Or this life will do with you what it wants
You can surpass everyone
When you fly, everything becomes so reverently still

With my soul, you are heart-touchingly loving
When I see you, you fill my heart to the brim with love!

AND ABOVE ALL WHEN I SMELL YOU!"
Lush Sapphire,04/23/2021,QooQi,F,15,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,Cool sexiness hits the mark,"I had to approach this fragrance slowly. The first time, the soapy musk overwhelmed me. So this is the highly praised Narciso musk?! I don’t want to smell like soap.
But the scent develops so wonderfully when my beloved Osmanthus takes away the sharpness, and then the fragrance comes across as both zesty and softly floral. Cool sexiness fits perfectly. Longevity 8h, top for an EDT! In South China, the Osmanthus blooms in winter. The wind carries the wonderful scent for miles, and thanks to this perfume, it now reaches my home as well."
Lush Sapphire,10/15/2022,Minigolf,F,2512,,21,Powder without Sweetness!,"I had underestimated DEN all along! Only ""beautiful""? Or extravagantly fantastic? Probably somewhere in between, but much closer to the fantastic! On one side very cool, almost frosty. This must be due to the musk that scatters its ice powder. On the other side dark and slightly smoky with a dark red glow from within. THESE ARE ROSES!! I think, even though there are none listed in the fragrance pyramid ""on top""! A bit defiant comes the answer to my own, uncertain question: I SMELL THEM, SO THEY ARE THERE!! Only to then dive back down to resurface later. Surreal? Maybe! Yet the aura is not sweet. A tiny little bit perhaps, with a lot of imagination. Now I return to the ""fantastic."" To be precise: When the osmanthus appears, I have something slightly smoky in my nose! Or is it rather the amber and patchouli? Or all together? Now the bitter roses are back and unite with the little ""sweet"" and the warmer notes, only to later switch to the ""ice musk."" The impression is one of oscillation. Sometimes almost stroboscopic ""flashlights""... And it continues to rumble beneath the cool surface, one thinks something sweet must be coming... but now it’s musk-amber-patchouli powder, looming in the cool room, trying to warm it up. Osmanthus always in sight... Then again the now patchoulized roses... Nothing sweet, but a lot of powder!
Fascinating? Of course!! :-))"

Lush Sapphire,03/25/2015,Profuma,F,213,,16,Black Velvet,"When storms rage outside,
you are my anchor

When the earth shakes,
you are my ground

When it becomes dark around me,
you are my light.

What power lies dormant in some fragrances.
I have never felt so secure and protected by a scent. This one wanted to conquer me. But I played hard to get. For a while. Yet it kept appearing before me, and so I eventually succumbed to it.
It has something that sets it apart from the mainstream and makes it special. The elegant black cloak it is wrapped in could not be more fitting. It is mysterious and opaque and does not simply reveal what lies beneath. One must earn the insight.

The elegantly floral opening immediately makes it clear that this is a strong fragrance that seeks and needs attention. The interplay of bergamot, orange blossom, and osmanthus opens the olfactory experience. To my nose, loud, intense, and demanding. And very alluring! When their grip loosens a bit, amber and musk caress. However, they never overpower but skillfully blend harmoniously with the opening notes. The, in my opinion, classically floral touch thus remains intact and is balanced at the end with vanilla. It does not appear in the usual and well-known sweet style but rather seems noble and refined. This vanillic cotton is not a pink cotton candy; this one is made of pure gold! This valuable and noble aspect receives a dignified and slightly bitter ""finish"" from vetiver, preventing a drift into an overwhelming sweetness. And so, everything in this composition remains intact for me. The scent no longer changes and accompanies me throughout the day. Even though it is sparingly dosed, it effortlessly showcases its full potential. Clothes, scarves, even a test strip in my handbag still smell days later and remind me of the occasion when I wore it.
It has an effect on me that makes me feel: anything is possible.
It has now reached the point where I wear it to particularly demanding meetings, job interviews, or simply in moments when I need special strength. I feel completely comfortable with this scent; self-doubt disappears, and I am one with the world.
I seem to radiate this as well. When I wear it, I am noticed. Everything comes to me more easily.
It is as if it protects me under a cloak.
Its cloak of black velvet..."
Lush Sapphire,09/01/2022,Leen86,F,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,21,The Mystery is Solved,"I believe it was about 15 years ago when I first walked past a woman while shopping and thought - I want to smell like her!! A clean, well-groomed scent, not too overpowering, creamy… almost so subtle that it could have been her fabric softener. This scent kept coming back to me, and sometimes I even dared to approach the ladies, but unfortunately, different fragrances emerged, though often NR variants. Mh strange… when I had freshly sprayed the mentioned fragrances, they didn't smell at all like THE scent.

About the EDT:
A very floral, even slightly soapy scent, but with an edge. For me, it's not an ""Easy Grab"" or ""Everyday Wear."" I find it very chic, cool, almost prim and yet sexy. How does that work together? It fits perfectly with the sexy secretary, wearing glasses, a bun, and a white blouse. One button undone more than is proper and a strand of hair that keeps slipping into her face. When she crosses her legs, you might catch a glimpse of the garter on her thigh. So “lady in the streets, but freak in the sheets.”
For me, extraordinarily feminine. However, the scent has no age limits for me and no specific season. The H+S are beast mode.

Now I come to my fragrance puzzle… after wearing the scent for a whole day, I woke up at some point during the night and - THERE WAS MY CLEAN SCENT! I am just totally into the Narciso Musk that always comes out at the very end for me with every NR. And you know what? The Pure Musc even smells exactly like that from the very beginning :)"
Lush Sapphire,10/06/2013,DaveGahan101,M,535,,10,Started strong and then became even stronger...,"..this time I changed the office joke a bit and turned it upside down.

For Him had been on my testing list for a while, even though Musc for Him did not convince me at all, but anything with Kurkdjian's name on it I have to test. Unfortunately, two weeks ago at Müller the tester was empty, and that resulted in a Shalimar purchase (but let's just make a big detour around that topic;-)).

I was all the more curious about the decant of Hasi & Mrs. Piggy from For Her. Especially since Mrs. Nagel was involved, who had previously excited me about the Lalique products..especially White! So the combination of Nagel-Kurkdjian..it simply had to be good.

It was not only good, but simply outstanding. A women's fragrance in which I could almost lie down to absorb it with all my senses..yes, to soak it up.

Wonderful zesty bergamot and osmanthus form the very lively opening. Osmanthus gives a non-citrusy fresh note..even slightly aquatic. The Different Company has dedicated an entire perfume to this note, which I found, similar to Kurkdjian's Acqua series, to be far too little as a scent..as a full-fledged perfume. Here it seems very concentrated to me and creates a beautiful contrast to the citrusy bergamot right from the start.

Just a few minutes later, For Her gets a creamy-powdery floral touch. This note is the heart of this fragrance..it remains the defining and characterizing note throughout. Musk merely adds the necessary depth, making it more dimensional..i.e., the fragrance appears more complex and lasts longer, and the wonderful blend of fragrance notes feels very dense and lush, which can be clearly seen from the excellent sillage. This will completely fill a car or the office with 2-3 sprays..I still can't imagine an overdose with this scent, as the fragrance notes smell too noble, too expensive, and high-quality...they seem intense to me but not overpowering...unless you reapply the scent in the elevator;-)

If the creamy orange blossom were not quite so feminine and the musk a tad stronger, For Her could also be worn by men. But the orange blossom becomes too floral and creamy-powdery (I'll refrain from the inflationary comparison with Dior Homme at this point).

No matter..it does say that it is for women..men can just stick to that..men only need a clear message(s) and then they know what's what;-).

In the end, For Her even becomes slightly cool without being able to name which fragrance note (mini lily of the valley note?) is responsible for it..because I can't detect vetiver, and vanilla certainly not..that would be more of a warm note.

For Her is a wonderful perfume that is ideal for autumn and winter. Even today, with a gray sky and damp, cold 12 degrees, there can hardly be a better choice. Therefore, the 100% is obviously due...and let's see if there will be a new tester for For Him next week!?!"
Lush Sapphire,07/10/2011,Very,F,164,,13,Completely Different,"This fragrance was introduced to me when I asked for ""something different than usual"" a few years ago in a mainstream perfumery. For Her is indeed a distinctive scent.

The top note starts with orange blossoms dipped in honey. The honey is very mild and not overly sweet. You are surrounded by a warm, soft aura. Gradually, amber joins in, along with an intense musk note. However, it never becomes too intense, as it is held in check by woods.

The fragrance has incredible sillage and longevity, so it should be applied sparingly. One spray is enough. You have to like it when people say to you: ""You left the room, but your scent is still here!"" For Her is definitely not an inconspicuous little water.

I would like it even more if the top note lasted a bit longer.
Since I sometimes get headaches from the scent, I prefer to spray it on my clothes, which I can change if my brain cells disagree with my fragrance choice again.

Nevertheless, thumbs up for a soft, creamy, warm, sensual, not overly sweet fragrance with longevity and sillage that is suitable as a signature scent because it is simply always wearable!"

Until then, I had never heard of Narciso Rodriguez, but that didn't deter my adventurous spirit.

Upon first contact with the EdT, I thought: No way, this is a bit too extreme for me. But as fate would have it, the bottle still found its way to me, and I have no regrets. It’s not a scent for every day, and I had to be in the right mood for it, but it definitely had that certain something. I wore it very happily when I was in the mood and even received a compliment or two for it. Recently, I even considered buying it again, but the world of perfumes is soooo vast that I’d rather try something new. All in all, though, it’s a beautiful, interesting fragrance with many facets."

I suspect it was the musk that I couldn't tolerate or didn't understand, and so the sample disappeared into the bathroom cabinet. I forced my boyfriend, who unfortunately is not a fan of perfumes at all, to choose at least one scent from my perfume collection that I could ""wear"" in his vicinity, and he chose the For Her (Eau de Toilette) by Narciso Rodriguez. Frustrated, I sprayed a bit on my neck and BOOM, I fell in love at first sniff! How can a perfume with only four notes smell so deep and multifaceted? It starts off floral-fresh for me and ends up totally sensual and seductive. The scent never becomes too much or too overpowering for me. In every season and mood, I only want to smell like For Her, and my boyfriend doesn't leave my side when I wear it. It's also great as an office scent; I've received many compliments thanks to it!

The calming effect showed itself to me a few years ago when I had a trial work day and was quite nervous. I hadn’t applied any perfume myself because I didn’t know how it would be received, but one of the potential new colleagues smelled of ""for her"" and suddenly everything didn’t seem so bad anymore.

The opening is dominated by orange blossom and a hint of bergamot, after that I only smell a wonderful amber, vanilla, and musk scent that I want to snuggle into.
That’s why I would describe this perfume as my signature scent, not because I wear it every day, but simply because it is a part of me and works wonderfully on me.
And thus it has perfectly achieved its goal with me.

Lush Sapphire,02/12/2022,Sami9,F,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,once upon a time...,".. that's how many good stories begin... including mine, which is connected to this fragrance...
I go back to my memory about 18 years ago...
It was a cozy Saturday evening, a few friends came to visit, there was delicious food, too much wine, and some stories from life, we hadn't seen each other for a while; one of my friends ""floated in,"" enveloped in an unbelievably good-smelling cloud of fragrance.. I looked at her fascinated and asked her about her scent, which completely blew me away... I had never smelled anything so wonderful before. She said, slightly flattered by my enthusiasm, ""Narciso R. for Her."" Aha... never heard of it, and as it turned out, the fragrance wasn't even available here yet; she had brought it from the USA as a flight attendant, and once again, they were ahead of the times. I was totally hooked and tried to get the fragrance IMMEDIATELY, which felt like it took an eternity (about 3 months, so for a WOMAN, that's forever, chuckle). But eventually, I held my fragrance treasure in my hand, sprayed the first spritz from the deep black bottle, and waited in full anticipation for the WOW effect, that catapulting back to the first evening of OUR encounter... indeed, it took a few minutes during which I irritably thought it was the wrong fragrance, similar but somehow different, until suddenly the super scent I remembered revealed itself, and I recalled the first moment of our meeting.
For me, this fragrance was for a long time THE fragrance par excellence and accompanied me through my eventful life for the next 15 years. The dear friend is no longer (for me) around (I hope she is healthy and well), we lost touch, but I think of her fondly every time I apply Narciso R. for Her, reminding me of that one moment of getting to know each other... intertwined with the person who wore it back then, a wonderful woman.
What does ""for Her"" smell like to me? It is a very multifaceted fragrance, starting with floral, rather cool notes, slightly soapy, but in a pleasant way, and then becoming a bit warmer, slightly woody, somehow very feminine, a bit sexy yet office-appropriate... is that even possible? For many years, it was an all-rounder for me, suitable for every occasion, in everyday life, on dates, in very intimate moments (often emphasized with the matching, slightly muskier shower gel and body lotion), I wore it often and with pleasure. By now, I have probably outgrown this fragrance, my interests have changed, a new chapter in life began at some point, along with my willingness to embrace new, completely different scent experiences. What remains is the memory of very beautiful experiences, a time when much seemed possible and some things actually happened... it was exciting... and ""for Her"" has faithfully accompanied me, like a good friend does... thank you, my dear, for this beautiful experience and the many memories intertwined with it."
Lush Sapphire,03/01/2022,Seladon,F,2,,16,Old love never rusts...,"or does it?
It has been several years since I first smelled Narciso.
Captivating, enchanting, I was completely taken by this intense fragrance of independence and strength.

It didn't take long, and he became mine and lived with me.
That time was a period of upheaval for me; theatrically expressed, I felt like the rise of the phoenix from the ashes, full of virtue, freedom, strength, and truth, and he was always by my side.
Although Narciso has relatively little in common with mythological birds, he represented all of that.

I was often approached, ""what smells so good,"" which brought a smile to my face every time, as I felt the same way.
Yes, it was love.

As time goes on, he faded more and more.
Just as I changed, he changed, until he completely disappeared.
I became acquainted with the powdery sister and the
floral cousin, and took this as an opportunity not too long ago to reignite the old love.
What can I say - old love never rusts, but it does change.
And so he remains in my closet, sometimes taken out and sniffed, but only for the sake of memory.

Thanks to my smoker's nose, I can't actually describe any individual scent notes, at most I perceive lily of the valley. Cool, they’re not even listed. Yeah, right.
That's why it won't surprise anyone that I don't notice a difference between the EdP and the EdT, not even in longevity.

I generally like fragrances that have musk and amber. But in ""For Her,"" in my opinion, the combination of these two components is the best achieved. I wear this perfume in winter and autumn, as it is a bit too heavy for the warm seasons.

Lush Sapphire,02/17/2023,Symphorosa76,F,10,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Love at Second Sight,"It is the year 2004. A short trip to Edinburgh/Scotland with my then best friend.
We are strolling through a truly magnificent department store in the city center when a somewhat pushy saleswoman thrusts a scent strip with the latest mainstream fragrance at me. I had already preferred more classic/vintage scents back then and was pretty sure this wouldn’t be for me. The first impression seemed to confirm my thoughts - an intrusive, synthetic white flower hit my nose…not my thing at all. I let the test strip disappear into my bag and immediately forgot about it.
Three hours later: We are buckled up on the plane home when I notice a beautiful scent. At first, I thought it must be from another passenger, opened my bag in the meantime, and realized that the scent was rising from my bag. At that moment, I knew I absolutely had to have this fragrance! But it was too late - the plane took off… and in Germany, the fragrance was not yet available… I guarded my little test strip like a treasure and eagerly awaited its appearance on the German market… Internet orders without a credit card were not possible anyway. Eventually, the time came: I had it, and our love story lasted about 2 years… NR for her was my signature scent, for which I constantly received compliments (even from taxi drivers)… but as it sometimes goes, I eventually craved something different… by then, the fragrance had also become too popular for my taste.
After an abstinence of at least 15 years, I bought it again for the first time this month… and spontaneously fell in love again!
It is mainly the drydown that makes this fragrance so attractive to me… a rarity among mainstream scents. Sillage and longevity are top-notch… one is surrounded by a sensual, feminine aura… I just can’t let go of it! My husband, who also mainly loves vintage scents, smelled it on me for the first time today and thought it was great too…"
Lush Sapphire,10/25/2011,Chanelle,F,752,,9,No Everyday Scent,"Narciso Rodriguez ""the First"" is rightly a successful fragrance. When it hit the market, I thought: ""Wow!"", because for a mainstream scent, it smelled refreshingly different, had edges and character, and was a successful overall package of fragrance, bottle, and great body care, which is always quite important to me.
But - and here comes the big ""but"" - it is not suitable for the office, as I find it too overwhelming for that. I certainly can't wear it all the time; I need to be in a very good mental and physical state to do so.
It has a lot of punch, not to say - cojones, and is unmistakably unique.
The top note is very in-your-face orange blossom.
I generally like orange blossom, but in combination with osmanthus and honey, it can easily be a bit much (or overwhelming).
The heart note is already more pleasant, creamy-musk cuddly, and above all, very sexy.
The base rounds off the cuddly aspect with a hint of woodiness.
I don't find the fragrance sweet or even honey-heavy; for me, the orange blossoms and musk come through very strongly, and for the first few minutes, if not the first hour, the EdT has a tendency towards an (?) osmanthus overdose, which can prick me and perhaps my surroundings.
Otherwise, it would be a hundred percent."
Lush Sapphire,04/18/2024,Melilino,F,4,,11,Sensual herbaceous floral scent,"The floral note at the beginning, I find not sweet at all. Together with amber and patchouli, the EDT comes across as almost herbaceous to me. That's exactly what I really like, the scent is not as sticky sweet as some women's perfumes.
Musk makes it feminine and mysterious. Rodriguez for her becomes rounded through its woody-animalic base.
I prefer the EDT over the EDP and I find it long-lasting. On clothing, it remains very noticeable for a long time.
In my opinion, it's not a scent for ""little girls"" ...just sexy."
Lush Sapphire,06/27/2019,Kaliha,F,4,,2,I finally did it...,"I tested it out, but I don't really remember what I thought back then. It arrived 5 minutes ago and was immediately sprayed on my skin. The first thought: lilac! Wait.. that's not in there. Could it be the osmanthus? Hm, bergamot would really be preferable for me. I gradually notice how it becomes floral-powdery. I am hopefully waiting for the base. Will it manage to convince my Chanel skin chemistry? I wait and will report back!
Okay, we don't match; I feel heavily perfumed, unnatural, artificial. The scent hardly changes, but remains very present. I can't handle this ""lilac"" at all. Headache potential extremely high!"
Lush Sapphire,09/07/2021,Muckelina,F,76,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,A Musky Bomb That Is Enchanting,"I received a sample with a fragrance order and was immediately overwhelmed.
Yes, it doesn't just smell of musk; it almost knocks you over. But only almost ;)
The scent reminds me of a walk in a flower garden on a summer afternoon. As it develops, I find the fragrance slightly fruity, although there are actually no fruits in it.
The scent is not heavy, but I wouldn't wear it at 30 degrees. More like up to 25, due to the risk of headaches because it is quite intense.
The fragrance embodies femininity in person.
The sillage is initially very strong, but it fades quite quickly for me. The longevity is also not great, lasting less than 4 hours on me.
However, since the fragrance is affordable and others rate it much better, I would recommend purchasing it."
Lush Sapphire,06/12/2016,Gelis,F,328,,6,A Charmer with a Pompous Appearance,"In my statement, I said: ""Nothing special."" But somehow, it still stuck with me. So instead of just a sample, I had to get a decant. Here we are:

Orange blossom and bergamot come together for a radiant, cheerful ""Here I am."" After about 30 minutes, osmanthus, musk, and amber bring the scent back down. It becomes warm and soft. The orange blossom-bergamot complex quietly sparkles in the background. I don't detect the powder shown above.

After two hours, I recognize the base notes as a very light woody touch. Sometimes I catch a whiff of vanilla, sometimes not... In the meantime, I notice the orange blossom more distinctly from time to time.

I would describe the scent as floral-warm-soft-lightly woody. A charmer with a pompous appearance. Not a scent I absolutely need, but it could certainly find a place in my collection.

Lush Sapphire,01/04/2022,Damy,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,14,"Hela, the Goddess of Death","When I first sprayed this fragrance, I immediately had a very specific association in mind.
I saw Hela before me.
A goddess dressed in black and green, moving with smooth, predatory steps.
One who takes what she wants without compromise.
One who radiates self-confidence and exudes incredible sexiness.

Of course, I mean Hela from Marvel's ""Thor Ragnarok,"" portrayed by Cate Blanchett.
Historically, it would probably be Hel, the goddess of death, ruler of the underworld.
However, I have no association with her, so I will stick with the fictional film character of Hela.

For me, the perfume embodies a woman who can assert herself. A woman who thinks analytically, acts decisively and purposefully.
One who possesses a healthy dose of self-confidence and never lets herself be pushed around.
At the same time, the fragrance also has a seductive sexiness that imparts a mysterious femininity.
It conveys a certain coolness, like the distant majesty of Hela, yet it never feels stiff.
After about two hours, the scent becomes closer to my skin, and I perceive a certain softness.
Does Hela have a hidden soft core?

When I wear the fragrance, it gives me a boost of self-confidence, almost like the ""Hela-to-go,"" a bit of support from the goddess.
Even though it may sound a bit overwhelming in my description, the scent is by no means that; it is quite suitable for everyday wear and a great companion for almost any situation.
For me, it does push boundaries with its incredible self-confidence.
Sometimes it's too much for me.
Sometimes it's exactly what I need."
Lush Sapphire,10/09/2022,Skimmia,F,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,0,The Sofa Cushion,"Living with a man who is rather indifferent to scents can be really frustrating: For months now, I've been making incredibly wonderful discoveries, constantly walking around with my wrist in front of my nose (the fact that I’m even tanned on my face this summer is a miracle), wanting to share my enthusiasm and thoughts... and the other person can at best be moved to a ""Hmnja."" Or (with each of my now quite numerous vanilla scents) to a ""Hmnja. Heavy."" Barbaric! But his comment on For Her EAU DE TOILETTE really took the cake, as he suddenly had a very definite opinion: He sniffed, sneezed, and said: ""Böh. Like a sofa cushion!"" Noticing my astonished look, he quickly qualified it, but not in a more sensitive way: ""Like a salon!"" (what he meant was ""Like grandma under the arm""). We quickly ended the conversation.
I even believe I understand what he perceives: The scent is indeed very dense, sweet, velvety, tightly woven, not a trace of ethereal, fragile, floating. I don’t perceive it as a cool, career woman scent at all, but rather as warming, charmingly sexy, and even sunny (though more so in cooler temperatures). But the association with dusty furniture with the haze of a thousand behinds in it? ""For Her"" doesn’t deserve that. I will continue to wear it with enthusiasm!"
Lush Sapphire,07/18/2012,MarieLaVie,F,45,,9,Female Refinement,"For Her ... a fragrance that practically merges with the skin.

To me, For Her smells of intimacy. Of natural femininity. It has just the right blend of musk and light florals to not come off as too animalistic, but also not too ""clean.""

For Her is light and develops on my skin into a skin scent after about half an hour. What remains for the next few hours is a seductive, feminine, private fragrance. You have to come close to me to perceive it, which only confirms For Her in its sensuality. It is not an extroverted scent, and I wouldn’t describe it as elegant, but it is reserved in an inviting way. Quite refined."
Lush Sapphire,02/27/2022,AnnaMariee,F,18,,9,I was looking for you! And then you were gone again...,"My goal was to find the perfect office scent. I am back in the office more often now and, due to my job, I am frequently on the go and in contact with clients. For that, I obviously need fragrances that work in almost any situation. Ones that appeal to almost everyone but are still not boring. A people-pleaser with style :) After reading the great reviews about For Her here in the forum, I arranged for a decant.

The first impression: great! Floral, but not too sweet. In a high-quality way floral. I also catch a subtle freshness, like just showered.

Shortly after, the heart note reveals itself. The floral aspect takes a back seat, and what remains is an elegant, self-assured, slightly smoky, cool sexiness that, like everything else about this fragrance, is not overpowering. I am thrilled!

Not even an hour later:
The scent is already a thing of the past. I have to really strain my nose to even catch a whiff of the perfume. And I really didn't hold back.
Oh, if only you weren't so fleeting!"
Lush Sapphire,11/14/2023,Shepilein,F,59,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Charm from the Past,"Better late than never! Somehow, I had overlooked the black bottle so far, as I always reached for Poudree or Musc Noir Rose. Unfortunately, I find the fragrances from Narciso Rodriguez to be quite similar. I always thought that if you have one or two, you don’t necessarily need another one from the line.

Recently, I received a sample of this fragrance and tried it out. It was actually the first scent in the entire line that was not crafted in exactly the same pattern as the others. For me, it has a slightly older touch, but definitely in a good way. Upon spraying, you immediately notice that it is floral. But Osmanthus is truly something unique. This is not your typical floral scent. It smells more like a velvety flower, where you can’t quite tell what type of bloom it is. Somewhat bitter, woody, a bit peachy. And then comes this patchouli scent, which for me is the epitome of vintage. The whole thing is enveloped in amber and musk, giving it that freshness and bitterness. These notes blur the floral scent. It’s as if the lens of a camera is out of focus. A retro blend that doesn’t clearly reveal what you are actually smelling.

Because this perfume has such a mysterious, older touch, it definitely has charm. So far, it seems to be particularly well-received by older people. A scent that women from the 50s would probably have worn. I must say, it truly captures the spirit of the older generation. For me, it is a fragrance that is definitely a classic and will remain so."
Lush Sapphire,03/22/2025,MajaDuft,F,105,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,A Clean Musk Allrounder,"I own several of the Narciso Rodriguez fragrances, which I believe are among the best designed by the brand. My favorites are Narciso EAU DE PARFUM POUDRÉE and the warm, clean musk bomb ""For Her Pure Musc (Eau de Parfum) | Narciso Rodriguez."" This fragrance in the black bottle is the original standard For Her scent and offers a lot.
It is a beautiful, clean, and crisp musk with floral undertones; the scent is warm yet light and powdery.
You can wear it perfectly in everyday life or for the office, I really like it. I must say that the Narciso Rodriguez fragrances are truly amazing, and I am glad to collect them, as each has its own beautiful characteristics and scent notes. They are great allrounders that have rightly become bestsellers; alongside ""For Her Pure Musc (Eau de Parfum) | Narciso Rodriguez,"" this one often appears on the best lists, and rightly so."
Lush Sapphire,10/24/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Feminine Musk Fragrance,"~ Inspiration ~
After testing the EDP and finding it too strong, I read here that the EDT is supposed to be the softer version.

~ Bottle ~
The simple design is the same as the EDP, but the EDT is now in black. It appears more elegant, and one might assume due to the dark color that it is also heavier.

~ Scent ~
Upon spraying, I immediately recognize the familiar ""Narciso Rodriguez - For Her"" presence. The scent is distinctly recognizable. Citrusy bergamot, orange blossoms, and spicy osmanthus shine here. With musk in the heart note and amber, it becomes sensually warm after a few minutes. Vetiver and vanilla form the slightly earthy base.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 7 hours, which is quite long for an EDT. A modest application is necessary, as otherwise it becomes very piercing, intrusive, and synthetic, causing headaches.

~ Occasion ~
It is best suited as an evening scent on cooler autumn and winter nights. For everyday wear or in the office, it is still too strong for me.

~ Conclusion ~
I find the floral-spicy top note pleasant, but the somewhat harsh musk-vetiver combination does not appeal to me anymore.

Strangely, I actually find it really nice on other women! It just doesn’t seem to suit me..."
Lush Sapphire,08/22/2010,Antoine,F,207,,0,Sensual,"For Her EdP seems to polarize quite a bit due to its intense musk note. I tested the EdT (thanks to Lolle), which has a significantly different composition. Musk is also present here and clearly noticeable. The musk note did not bother me, but the fragrance direction of For Her EdT (I would call it sensual-elegant-feminine) is simply not my thing.

For Her EdT starts with a sweet-floral top note and then quickly becomes amber-musk-heavy. The woody notes capture the amber-musk haze well. The scent has a very sensual quality and feels quite erotic. Nevertheless, it does not come across as vulgar or intrusive to me, but rather elegant and even a bit sophisticated. I did not experience any associations with cat pee or other organic excretions, but perhaps that depends on individual skin chemistry. I usually tolerate musk and amber well, but vanilla is often a disaster for me.

For Her EdT is a very present fragrance and extremely long-lasting. Where and when you wear it is, in my opinion, just a matter of dosage. If I liked this fragrance direction, it would definitely be a candidate for purchase for me."
Lush Sapphire,09/05/2023,Schmuppi,F,9,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Unobtrusive Compliment Giver,"Actually, I didn't plan to keep this fragrance. I bought the bottle online including a sample, so I could return it unopened if I didn't like it. The sample didn't convince me; I actually wanted to send it back, but as fate would have it (okay, now that's very dramatic :D), I printed the return form incorrectly and could only send the item back at my own expense, which wouldn't have been worth it. So I kept the bottle and thought I could either gift it or give it another chance. The scent was personally too piercing for me, a bit musty, not a nice, straightforward musk note like the other Narcisos.

Still, one morning I sprayed it on; I wanted to give it another chance before passing it on. It developed a little better; maybe my nose just needed to get used to it, I thought. Throughout the day, I forgot about it; I didn't smell it on myself anymore. But then I went shopping, and a woman at the checkout approached me. She asked what I was wearing, which I didn't understand at first. She said I smelled so good, and that was exactly what she liked.

Rattle rattle rattle. I thought about it. Oh, my perfume? What did I spray on this morning? Ahhh, the black Narciso. Really? Can you still smell it that strongly?

I must have looked a bit puzzled at first, but then I quickly pulled out my phone and showed her the perfume. Spelling out the name Narciso Rodriguez to older women who don't speak English or Spanish isn't easy; she was obviously not a Parfumo member :D But she was happy and diligently typed it out. She said she would buy it too.

After this compliment, I was quite surprised and wore it more often in the following days. The initially musty scent fades quickly, leaving a pleasant, subtle fresh fragrance with musk and flowers and a hint of woodiness, very fine in the background, perfect for everyday wear and the office. I really enjoy wearing it now and am glad I kept it!"

In short, it's an all-rounder. And why am I writing so extensively about my beloved piece of clothing? Because my Narciso for her has been empty for a few weeks now, and I only just realized that this fragrance is my all-rounder that I always reach for when I don't know what to wear…
If for her edt were a piece of clothing, it would be THE LITTLE BLACK DRESS. My safe haven. Three sprays and I'm ""properly"" dressed.

The scent is floral-creamy, slightly spicy - very pleasant. In a few reviews, I've read that the perfume is perceived as cool. I find the scent rather warm and cozy, somehow sensual. I can sense it on my skin for at least 8 hours - on clothing even longer.
P.S.: NR EdT has been repurchased and is now a permanent part of my wardrobe / uh, fragrance cabinet."
Lush Sapphire,02/11/2012,Cenwen,F,66,,6,Black or pink... that's the question here :D,"Since I've had For Her EdT in my collection for a while now, I will write a comment. I confess to being a Narciso Rodriguez fan and will always remain one. However, I must say that I will not repurchase For Her EdT once it's empty. The only reason for this is that it does not last as long as the EdP.

The EdT starts off more orangey, then relatively quickly transitions to a scent note that I absolutely love in the EdP - and this note fades away quite quickly. What remains is a fragrance that smells good but is rather mild and unfortunately not very noticeable (not to mention that I can hardly smell it after about 1 hour).

Personally, I prefer the bottle (since I'm not really into pink) - however, everyone else thinks the EdP suits me much better, and I agree. The scent lasts a long time, and this beautiful powdery musk note is also perceived better than in the EdT. I wear the EdP really in every season, and it fits perfectly ;).

I can definitely recommend the fragrance as it smells really good - but unfortunately, it is too weak for me. When I wear For Her, I want the full, warm, powdery scent that lasts for hours."
Lush Sapphire,08/25/2022,Jasminlove97,F,0,,12,Lady Boss or Date Night for Softer Angels,"It’s just before eight o'clock, the weekly meeting is about to begin. The employees are already seated, most of them middle-aged men in suits and ties. They are waiting for the boss. One minute before eight, you can first hear a gentle rhythm, then gradually getting a bit louder - not loud, but quite softly - click, click, click. Exactly at eight o'clock, the door opens, and she enters the room. She looks fantastic as always. Her hair, reaching to her collarbone, is tied back in a ponytail, and her black, elegant jeans make her long legs appear even longer. Her nude-colored pumps complete the look. Surrounded by a cloud of charisma, confidence, and professionalism, she walks to the head of the table and takes her seat. She places her folder on the table, sits down, crosses her legs in a ladylike manner, and greets her employees.

That same evening in a townhouse in the suburbs: she is getting ready for date night with her husband. The kids are already in bed, and the grandparents have just arrived to babysit. She wears tight jeans and a high-necked blouse. After applying a softly shimmering rose-colored gloss to her lips, she reaches for the bottle and sprays - not much, just two spritzes. She looks like an angel - gentle and lovable. However, the cloud of confidence and a certain sexiness that now envelops her changes her appearance. No one can quite put their finger on what it is. It’s as if someone has flipped a little switch; she has that special something. It’s not something that usually defines her or fits her in everyday life - but tonight, for this ONE evening, she is not just the sweet angel.

I see this fragrance on two women: on one hand, on a confident woman as the perfect signature scent, and on the other hand, on a softer, sweeter woman as an evening fragrance."
Lush Sapphire,12/14/2021,Ineke89,F,53,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Serious Clean Scent,"Fragrance notes (without guarantee):
Top: Bergamot
Heart: Orange Blossom, Osmanthus
Base: White Musk, Vetiver, Cedar, Amber, Vanilla, Patchouli

This scent will likely appeal to people who don't usually wear or enjoy perfume.
A clean, balanced musk fragrance. Fresh out of the shower, well-groomed, and stylishly dressed for the office.

The scent impression: Fresh, clear, subtle, elegant, well-groomed, unobtrusive, self-confident, serious, straightforward.
What the scent is not: Sensual, seductive, loud, exotic, mysterious, playful, sexy, romantic.

This scent does not clash. It is perfect for professional everyday life, leisure, or official occasions. You smell pleasantly well-groomed, but you are not trying to attract the wrong kind of attention. Sometimes you just want to smell good. Make a good impression while maintaining a certain noble distance. Perhaps even a bit aloof and not easily decipherable, yet exuding competence. For example, in a job interview.

I actually perceive the scent as unisex. I can also imagine it on men. Personally, I feel that the scent lacks the typically feminine, delicate quality that conveys comfort and intimacy. If you want something a bit more sensual and powdery, you should give the Eau de Parfum from N.R. For Her a chance. The EdP contains a bit more rose and also peach, which overall smells more like feminine skin than the Eau de Toilette being discussed here.

Blind purchase recommendation if you are looking for an all-rounder that does not clash and has that fresh out of the shower feeling to spray on."

Personally, I can't really identify the individual notes, but the overall composition is exactly what I expect from a good perfume.

For me personally, it's not an everyday scent; it's too heavy for that. But for going out or special occasions, it is ideal.
A definite recommendation."
Lush Sapphire,11/02/2023,Laurea,F,6,,9,Date Fragrance,"This is a perfect fragrance for a date.

Because I liked it so much, I bought a set with the perfume and a cream.

However, my nose only detects a slightly bitter, harsh, undefinable scent, so I first gifted the cream, which smelled totally great on my colleague.
A few weeks later, I also gave away the EdP, just as bitter, harsh, and undefinable, yet it was fantastic on her.

A few years later, I tried the EdT. The bottle smelled harsh, bitter, and undefinable, and from the first spray to several hours later, there was no change on either moisturized or non-moisturized skin.

I had hoped that I wouldn't react to it because of the few fragrance notes, but unfortunately, I do. I wanted to like it... However, I seem not to be the only one with this feeling. Just one spray and yet it overwhelms. Not soft enough, it lacks liveliness/some kind of complexity. I see a straightforward, self-confident, distant, self-focused office worker (of course, not everyone is like that)... Sometimes the simple scents are the go-to ones, but this one just does nothing for me. The mental imagery (I am a very imaginative person) is absent. I also feel somehow not ""up to it"" enough for it. Which is not necessarily good or bad.

However, although it takes on a fresh form over time, it creates a heavy feeling in the summer months during the first moments of boredom. I can't say that it is heavy for daily wear, but it is an ""ambitious"" or ""dominant"" scent. Clear and sharp character. You know, sometimes you want to smell fresh and light, peacefully, your current combination or the environment you are going into requires this; it does not convey the feeling of freshness, cleanliness, and lightness. It dominates especially in the first squeeze. Nevertheless, it is a perfume that cannot imitate a clear scent, very sexy, and you can never say ""it smells like this scent."" There are rumors that the formula contains pheromones, even compared to women's sweat. I love it and connect with it and never get bored.. I want to have it forever, thank you F. Kurkdjian.

I was sitting outside at the market, waiting. Petra rushed over and with her came an enchanting scent to the table, spicy, very woody, and fresh. I couldn't get enough of smelling her. ""What is that?"" I asked. ""For her, the black one, by Rodrigues, I treated myself!"" At that time, I was already looking for a new signature scent and I immediately noted this fragrance in my mind. Actually, fragrances from friends are taboo for me, but when you rarely see each other, it's okay. So the next day, I went to the city and bought this scent. My mother was still alive then and sniffed me, ""hm, herb, but nice."" Some time ago, I repurchased For Her, but now it doesn't smell woody and herbaceous anymore; instead, I primarily perceive sweet honey, which according to the fragrance pyramid isn't even included. I thought I might have accidentally gotten the ""rosé"" one, but no, it's definitely the right scent. Since then, I've been testing it again and again, but it doesn't smell the same on my skin as it used to, which is very unfortunate. At the next meeting, I will probably gift it to Petra."
Lush Sapphire,07/14/2012,Jennytammy,F,60,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Love at First Whiff,"I was fortunately able to get a sample. Since I had never tried a fragrance from Narciso Rodriguez before, I thought I would give it a shot, as the scent description and the comments sounded so good. And I must say, I love this fragrance! From the very first spray, I was in love :-) For me, it is a totally warm, sensual, and powdery scent. I don't pick up any honey at all; I don't find it sweet either. The amber note is very present for me, and that's exactly what I like so much. The longevity is quite good, but it could be just a tad better for me."
Lush Sapphire,01/14/2023,Elume,F,9,,10,Winter & Autumn,"At first, the scent feels a bit unfamiliar to me. I can't quite say why. However, the doubts disappeared after 20 minutes and I feel very comfortable. A very balanced and elegant blend. Not too intrusive. Works for me in the colder seasons always. However, it doesn't clash either.

I really like the bottle, the minimalist design, by Narciso Rodriguez anyway.

Great fragrance, it will have a permanent place in my collection."
Lush Sapphire,09/08/2023,MsGina,F,5,,10,The best friendships begin....,"....often with ""I didn't like you before."" I'm sure some of you know that, right?

With NR Fleur Musc, it was love at first spray for me. After reading the reviews of the original here, I thought I couldn't go wrong with a blind purchase. Far from it, I hated it. It actually made me feel almost nauseous and was immediately scrubbed off my wrist.
I had read something about a ""clean scent."" Strange.

After I eventually tested the EdP and found it bearable, the fragrance, which had been languishing in some dark drawer, got another chance, and this time a real one.
It no longer caused nausea with a light application, but it still wasn't sparkling at the beginning.

Strangely enough, I've never been approached about a fragrance so often.
Compliments like ""Mmmm, you smell so good again"" and ""Excuse me, may I ask what perfume you're wearing? It smells so good""
were suddenly the order of the day.
And with each wear, it grew more dear to me.

But how does it smell now?
For me, it's not sweet, not floral, not freshly showered, but warm and familiar, like me, and in an intimate way, erotic yet still suitable for daytime, as long as it's applied sparingly!

I just don't wear it while exercising; I wouldn't want to subject my ""boys"" to that.

In the past year, it has become one of my most frequently and dearly worn fragrances; somehow it merges with me. The EdP has also moved in with me, and both have almost replaced Fleur Musc."

Lush Sapphire,02/06/2024,MonetsMuse,F,3,,6,What is wrong with me?,"I feel like I've sniffed 99% of all designer fragrances, many of which I've worn or recommended, but I just can't warm up to this creation. To this day, it's a mystery to me why it is a signature scent for so many. So boring, unremarkable, but overall just intrusive. It does not flatter my sense of smell at all, and I wonder every time what is wrong with me?! This fragrance has managed to disappoint me anew every time; as soon as the sample is in the Douglas package, I give it a chance, and unfortunately, it always ends up in the ️, much to my annoyance. Maybe it’s all the result of an unresolved childhood trauma; psychologists among you may enlighten me. Until then, I will gladly keep my distance from this scent."
Lush Sapphire,12/29/2013,Tugendrose,F,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Without Words,"Unfortunately, it can't be done without words. But for this fragrance, you only need one thing: YES! I could write a hymn here, but that already exists. The only downside is that you won't find anything better when you feel like something new. I have reserved this scent for the most beautiful evenings and nights of the year. My everyday fragrances can't compete - but they are just everyday. For her is my dot on the i - but ""chen"" is too cute. My I."
Lush Sapphire,01/08/2024,Snifflikeani,F,10,,7,We Will Not Be Friends…,"So don’t get me wrong. The scent is certainly well-made, thoughtful, and many praise it to the skies; however, it is just not my cup of tea. To me, it actually smells a bit vintage, and the patchouli comes across as too blunt for my taste. I would say it is definitely not a blind buy candidate. I can understand why many like it, though. It does have something darkly seductive about it, but unfortunately, it does not seduce me."
Lush Sapphire,04/02/2023,Sobornable,F,14,,9,A Daily Companion - The Unobtrusive Beauty of Narciso Rodriguez' For Her EdT,"Narciso Rodriguez' For Her EdT is a wonderful addition to any perfume collection. It is an uncomplicated fragrance that gently caresses without being intrusive. The perfume is perfect for daily wear and can be worn on any occasion - it always works.

The For Her EdT by Narciso Rodriguez has a harmonious composition of floral and musk notes that create a warm yet fresh scent.

The longevity of the perfume is satisfactory, allowing it to remain pleasantly noticeable throughout the day. The scent intensity is neither too strong nor too weak, making it a perfect companion for everyday life.

Overall, Narciso Rodriguez' For Her is an uncomplicated and unobtrusive fragrance that gently caresses and always fits. It is a timeless classic that never goes out of style."
Lush Sapphire,01/24/2011,Woelfin,F,243,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,If only I knew ...,"... whether the EdT is on my right or left wrist, then I would already be a big step further, damn it. It starts off really well, as you can easily tell. And now I actually have to get up and somehow figure out which wrist I sprayed the EdT on and which one the EdP ... Very nice!

... So, now then. You really can't tell anyone what's going on with me.
So: First of all, thanks to the lovely Blanche for the sample. And beforehand: Personally, I find the difference between EdT and EdP quite small. So in that regard, I can only partially agree with Antoine. I can't deny that if you sniff a little more closely, you can definitely smell differences - especially in the softness of the scent - but if you served me the EdT and EdP side by side blindfolded, I wouldn't have the slightest clue which is which. Not a hint.

The EdT is very floral and yet has a distinctive note that I liked (and still like) right away. It smells elegant and feminine to me, and those who don't overdo it will be absolutely rewarded. I find these fragrance notes heavenly and a touch more pleasant (on me) than the EdP, which tickles my nose a bit. I don't perceive it as an everyday scent. Almost a bit too precious.

And the kicker is: I find the EdT much more present, even though it seems very delicate and creamy to me, than the EdP, which seems to be fading a bit on my other wrist.

By the way, this scent reminds me of something that I totally associate with Yves Rocher. I believe they MUST have something that smells similar. This scent feels very familiar to me, even though I have never smelled it before. But I immediately thought of Yves.

Conclusion: I want it!"

I bought it on my way to a date and because I was (as usual) running late, I sprayed it on in the café... spontaneously, the ladies at the neighboring table wanted to know what I was wearing...

Well, my secret of course... my dark one :-))))))"
Lush Sapphire,01/06/2022,Lunarose,F,3,,5,Elegant Everyday Fragrance,"The scent is perfect for every day and also for every season. It is a cool and pleasant fragrance that is absolutely not intrusive, but definitely noticeable. I imagine an elegant and confident woman with this scent, who knows exactly what she wants and has everything in her life under control. The perfume has great longevity and is absolutely recommended for the price."
Lush Sapphire,10/16/2024,Mimimamba,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Unique, elegant, modern...","and powdery... that's how I would describe the scent in just a few words. In fact, it struck me as slightly masculine upon my very first sniff on the test strip, but within just a few minutes, it developed into a truly unique and noble powder dream. Osmanthus and musk clearly set the tone here. However, the musk is so fine and clean, and all the fragrance notes are wonderfully connected.
Overall, this is a very mature scent. It radiates both a certain competence and a calm serenity, yet remains profound with that special something.
The longevity and sillage are in the upper range, and it is indeed one of the few fragrances for which I have received compliments so far."
Lush Sapphire,07/15/2013,Sephora88,F,4,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Prince Charming?,"The search for the perfect scent is a bit like the search for ""Prince Charming."" There are ups and downs, and it takes a lot of patience.
And the best love stories are known to be the complicated ones.
Between Narciso and me, it hasn't been entirely easy either.

I read about him here on parfumo, of course, and then I lingered around him for days. Every now and then, I was tempted to have a brief flirt with a test strip, but I wasn't quite sure what to make of him.
He was interesting, no question. But was he also the right one for me?
At some point, I decided that interesting is good, and I gave us a chance.
This first encounter was unfortunately a bit unfortunate, as I ended up getting quite a large amount of ""For Her,"" and he nearly clouded my senses. I fought against his musky charm with all my might after he had previously wrapped me around his finger with honey and orange blossoms. But this boy has musk, and a lot of it, and I have my issues with musk. So I asked myself, can I be happy with him if he doesn't always do me good? In the meantime, I had even considered pairing him up with a friend or my sister just to have him nearby.

He certainly didn't leave my side all day, and the longer he stayed, the more I learned to love him. And after we spent the night together and he was still there the next morning, so soft and cuddly, I was lost.
That's when I knew: I MUST have this scent in some form. I think I'll start by trying a smaller dose. This scent certainly won't let me go that easily.

Whether we are really made for each other will still be revealed, but I will enjoy the time we have together."
Lush Sapphire,02/16/2011,Bellemorte,F,107,,0,Musk can be delicious...,"Normally, my skin chemistry turns musk fragrances into a pure zoo ambiance. I smell like I've just escaped from the puma cage of a zoo (after some intense cuddling with the inhabitants).

Accordingly, I was very skeptical when I received this sample - so I carefully sprayed a tiny bit on a spot that can be easily washed off, keeping it far from my nose and waiting a bit... then cautiously bringing my nose closer to the sprayed area, gently inhaling and ... oohh, what is this? It smells really delicious!!!
For her (EdT) develops on my skin into a delicate powdery and very skin-like scent. Somehow not at all like those heavy, animalistic musk fragrances that I usually know and that do not harmonize with me at all. This musk is sweet yet fresh, subtly floral, and so wonderfully cozy in the drydown... simply delightful.

My first musk fragrance - and I am deeply in love :-)"
Lush Sapphire,11/24/2022,Idaronja,F,8,,8,Simply unbeatable,"The Narciso Rodriguez For Her Eau de Toilette is a musk fragrance in its most beautiful form. It is wonderfully soft without being intrusive; you simply smell very well-groomed and sophisticated when wearing it. I find the interplay of musk and patchouli very successful. The longevity is very good for an Eau de Toilette, about 6-8 hours, and the sillage is in the upper mid-range. All in all, a very successful fragrance."

I liked it again from that moment on, and since winter is just the right season for this..."
Lush Sapphire,09/15/2014,Noedde,F,51,,2,I almost thought this was my scent,"This is yet another perfume that gave me the feeling of ""oh yes, how wonderful"" the first time I sprayed it and made me want to buy a large bottle right away. However, on my skin, it developed a component in the scent that made me only use it to finally finish the bottle. It’s not empty yet because I lost the spray head, and so the fragrance has been sitting around for quite a while without me missing it. I have now ordered a Travalo to get the scent out of the bottle and give it a second chance after reading the reports here and the fact that I find it really great when I smell it on other women."
Lush Sapphire,10/09/2021,Kaja86,F,23,,4,Musk Kisses Orange,"This fragrance is simply sexy but not sweet-sexy, rather adult-sexy. Musk and patchouli come through quite strongly. Gradually, however, a lighter orange scent also emerges.
I can easily imagine this scent on a businesswoman who is right in the midst of life. A fragrance that gives you the aura of ""here I am and I have something to say."""
Lush Sapphire,08/08/2023,Jankapal,F,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Wow - Love at first, second, and last sniff!!!","This summer 2023, I trusted the countless reviews and got a sample of ""For Her,"" mind you the Eau de Toilette.
This scent can definitely become a signature for me!

The first time I smelled it on my skin, when I received the sample, it was love at first sniff and this love has lasted until now. I believe this love will last a very long time! (right now, it’s still fresh and in love)

What does the scent smell like to me?
Like a natural woman, it could be a personal scent, like a woman who carries a wonderful, natural, sexy personal scent (without having to wear any perfume).
It also smells like intimacy, as if a couple has made love and the scent of it is still perceptible on the skin. So: Intimate, sexy, feminine, natural, addictively one after the other, because you are so in love and can’t stop touching (in this case, smelling) and yet not too intrusive, but pleasant and mild enough to wear the scent for any occasion and in any season.

My sample is running out soon and after trying some more (other) perfume samples, I realize that no other scent has come close to this one yet.
A large bottle will be purchased soon :)"
Lush Sapphire,05/07/2011,Katinka,F,11,,5,Confusion,"Difficult scent. I have the Eau de Parfum version, which I liked very much. Then I discovered the Eau de Toilette on a friend and was thrilled - so much more adventurous, spicy, and also fresher than the original. Ordered it, sprayed it on - suddenly I wish I had the rosé version back. Tried it out. I don't like that one as much anymore either. Perfume crisis? Narciso Rodriguez For Her confuses. Definitely. Sometimes I smell sweet musk (honey fits very well there!), sometimes woody-fresh notes dominate. Then again, a sharp-spicy, animalistic ""scent"" emerges from the bottle. I stand by it: confusion. A pull that is already disappointing upon spraying - or not. Definitely not suitable for every day & me."
Lush Sapphire,07/15/2024,Meliizah,F,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Floral Fragrance,"For many, this blooming abundance may be just right, but for me, it was simply too much. The intense floral notes overshadow other possible nuances of the perfume. While the musk and patchouli base does give the fragrance a certain depth, the floral impression remains very dominant.
The elegant and simple bottle contrasts with the strong scent composition. Despite the fact that the perfume is of good quality and good composition, I found the floral intensity too strong. However, for those who are looking for a very floral fragrance, this scent could be the ideal option."
Lush Sapphire,10/11/2024,Fragranzlvr,M,3,,6,The Woman You Marry,"It is a simple masterpiece, not because it is so complex and unique, but because it is indescribably beautiful and a lifetime favorite. Almost all Narcisos have a slightly maternal quality for me, which feels so warming and provides a sense of security. It is not unpleasant at all and lasts very long for its scent character (6-7 hours). Great signature potential and also suitable for year-round wear. The fragrance does not have a significant progression, so the top note is what you smell the whole time, the beautiful Narciso musk and a light sweet rose, even though it is not listed, blend wonderfully with the skin; it is such a ""Your Skin But Better"" scent."
Lush Sapphire,03/29/2025,Butterfly198,F,9,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,From Meeh to Yeah!,"I have never experienced a fragrance that I perceive in such different extremes.
I got to know For Her EAU DE TOILETTE and the assessment of the scent direction from ""creamy"" to ""powdery"" immediately appealed to me.
Since it was praised so highly everywhere, I went straight to my trusted perfumery and bought the fragrance (it was on sale).

Once home, I first sprayed the fragrance on paper.
The first impression: Uuuuääää what is that?
Somehow musty, piercing, scratchy, and exhausting. Could that be? Was the fragrance not right? Or was I at the beginning of a cold? I had no idea which of the notes were responsible for this, but somehow I was quite sure... we were not going to be friends at all.

Nevertheless, a few days later, I made another attempt (pretty sure I wasn't getting sick) and sprayed it on my left wrist.
(Sleeves of the blouse NOT rolled up)
But again the same impression and disappointed.

In the evening, just before the bathtub was practically calling my name and I had put my clothes in the laundry, I stood in the bathroom and noticed a very pleasant scent.
Powdery, slightly sweet, and somehow fluffy.
Then it became clear to me.
The scent that I found ""piercing and disturbing"" was on my clothes and ""overpowered"" the actual scent development.
But the heart of the fragrance and thus the ""powdery-soft"" facet of For Her EAU DE TOILETTE I only perceived on my skin.

There, but only on the skin, I really like the musk classic and now wear it in every season.

In hindsight, I am incredibly glad to have given For Her EAU DE TOILETTE another chance, and I advise everyone not to judge the fragrance too quickly and to try not spraying it on clothes. It apparently needs a certain warmth and time to show its true potential."
Lush Sapphire,06/22/2025,Majka86,F,56,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Classic Always Works,"Recognition value 100% and by now a classic! One of the most beautiful women's perfumes for me.
No matter the season or time of day, this perfume simply works all the time.
This combination of orange blossom, bergamot, musk & woody notes makes it unique and sexy.
I really love sweet scents. Here there is only a delicate sweetness and yet I like the perfume immensely.
This musk scent that gives this line from Narciso Rodriguez its profile is simply the strongest here and somewhat animalistic.
Currently, I find myself reaching for classics more and more often because I like the selection.
Somehow, many perfumes hardly differentiate themselves from each other... Right now, pear, salt, tuberose, synthetic vanilla, etc. are trendy and are used everywhere.
Version 5000 of La Vie est Belle L'Eau de Parfum or Libre EAU DE PARFUM etc.

If you were to ask my 12-year-old daughter how she feels about this scent, she would smile and say ""this scent? - it's my mom!""

However, unfortunately, I can't find much else to say positively about the fragrance. To me, it smells quite outdated and cool, like an old laundry detergent or the scent that escapes from an old wooden wardrobe filled with numerous laundry fragrance sachets or similar items when opened, combined with cold fresh winter air and a slight chemical dentist note. Additionally, it has an indefinable musty, almost stinky note that becomes somewhat strange to me after a while. Unfortunately, this is absolutely not my fragrance."

Then I kept hearing great reviews and after a few years, I wanted to give it another chance and bought it again. It has to appeal to me; I love the typical Narciso DNA?! In short: I hardly reach for this fragrance; unfortunately, it doesn't compare to Pure Musc or Musc Noir Rose for me. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, but somehow we just don't connect properly."

The musk is so beautifully creamy, and although I don't like patchouli, it doesn't bother me in this scent at all. It's also exciting that this fragrance is not a typical jasmine-orange blossom-musk scent, but unique.
Furthermore, I must mention that I receive countless compliments for this fragrance. Not just a ""you smell good,"" but a ""who smells so good here, what is that?, your perfume smells sooo good."" The price-performance ratio is unbeatable. The bottle is elegant and timelessly beautiful. The sillage and longevity are good.

But what is it that makes me think so much about Eye Hatshepsut?
Well, it's simple. At first, this scent starts almost pure, powdery, dry, and cool smoky. Then it transforms a bit into something softer through the iris butter, tasty, fatty, but not intrusive. Kajal accord - does it refer to the color or the smell? It could be this dry, slightly earthy quality. A splash of wine, reddish, bright, and dry again. A very minimal fruitiness, unsweetened.
And then cinnamon - oh how I love you... becoming dusty sweet, without softening the coolness of the scent. The smokiness transforms into incense, mmmmh, not cold church incense, but a fine, aromatic incense that paired with the honey-scented labdanum becomes beautifully smooth. It doesn't stand out harshly at all, but flows along with the fragrance notes. Musk is not a dominant note, but it's present. It's terribly exciting, forever this slightly dark, gloomy, and then again the bright, soft. There is never a single direction, and that's really beautiful. It's an unusual scent that I can well imagine on a dark-haired, voluptuous woman who doesn't always reveal everything about herself - so I *g* ;-)
A fragrance that both genders can wear. On a man, it will certainly be a bit more rugged.
I want it because it's so outrageously captivating.

Tender is the Night,12/12/2020,Interdit,F,58,,0,The evanescent,"No woody notes, or green. No ""white flowers"", just a soft gardenia and a tuned down grapefruit note.

It is pleasant, but I most definitely get better results in both longevity and sillage from the Absolu. I would have to layer them both to get the perfect balance, and at the price tag the pure parfum goes it's a big disappointment. I was expecting way more projection, intensity in the accords, but they are subdued and too timid.

Personally, a pure parfum so weak it's not worthy the price. But as it goes, I have them both now and will layer pure over absolu.
It's a 5 out of 10 from me: keep your money and buy more absolu if you enjoy the woody grapefruit with faint flowery vibes. I honestly cannot believe how weak this extract is.

Btw... interestingly, Jour pure works wonderfully with Bottega Veneta (the orginal). Try to believe! :-)"
Mamma Mia,05/03/2021,SmellyPete,M,17,,2,Very poor performance (batch: 140120011037),"I recently reviewed Al Haramain's Amber Oud Tobacco. This 'Rouge' release couldn't be more different in terms of performance...

The tobacco last for days, the rouge (Batch Code: 140120011037) last for literally minutes...
There is almost no sillage right from the start - after 15 min I doubt that anyone will notice you are wearing this..
I can still smell this very faintly after an hour if press my nose right on the place where I sprayed...
I tried overspaying - not much effect

It's a real pity as this is a nice fragrance but completely unusable for me as a fragrance... I'd be respraying all the time.

Given the many people who report good performance all I can think is poor quality control in their manufacturing process...

The presentation is very impressive like for the tobacco - fancy hinged box and nice bottle. With all that effort it's a shame that the fragrance doesn't live up to expectations. This not a release that Al Haramain can be proud of.

BTW, I didn't find this for sale on the Al Haramain website - maybe the company gave up on this too.
Their Amber Oud Tobacco is really good."
Mamma Mia,04/02/2023,Alpischnalpi,M,21,,0,The Brother of BR 540,"Basically, I agree with my predecessor's review; the scent smells almost exactly like its predecessor, but a bit darker/less sweet and thus - if you will - ""more masculine."" Therefore, it is accurate to describe it as the brother of BR540 (as a sister). The fact that the scent performs a bit weaker might not be so bad, considering how often and intensely one encounters BR in everyday life. I find it very pleasant.
All in all, the scent is worth it, although it has also become relatively expensive, and cheaper alternatives are available (e.g. Baroque Rouge 540 for about 30 euros)."
Mamma Mia,01/03/2022,Laylush,F,5,,1,The Little Brother of BR 540,"Amber Oud Rouge has similar components to its predecessor, especially the saffron note is noticeable. I also own BR 540 and must say that the two are particularly similar in the dry down, but in terms of sillage and performance, Amber Oud Rouge unfortunately cannot keep up, in my opinion. BR is much more striking and fills every room with a cloud of fragrance, its little brother is not as prominent. However, I must mention that Amber Oud Rouge is truly the closest of all the dupes I have tested so far to BR. At first, Amber Oud Rouge was very affordable, making the price-performance ratio a 10/10, but since the fragrance apparently is no longer being produced, the prices have become significantly more expensive and at around €80 now, it is no longer worth it."
Yog Nog,08/21/2022,CJ42,F,10,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Sweet - Creamy - Leathery,"I tested this fragrance directly on my skin in a store without any knowledge of the fragrance pyramid. At first, a very sweet, berry-fruity scent wafted towards me - too sweet for my taste. After about half an hour, however, the sweetness diminished and a very pleasant creaminess emerged, making me want to sniff my wrist repeatedly. In the drydown, I then noticed a slightly sweet, creamy leather note that lingered for hours.
I think it's worth a try for all fans of sweet fragrances to test Authentic Moment; the price-performance ratio is definitely right."
Ginger,03/14/2023,DaniloRod,M,48,,4,Stunning leathery rose,"Andalusi is a stunning leathery rose.

There's rose and leather of course, being the main components of the scent from the beginning to the end. The leather is dry and well rounded with the perfect amount of fizz and strength, meanwhile the rose is delicate, yummy and airy.

Apple and saffron are super prominent the first hour along with a soft oud. The oud is little funky, but nothing fecal or animalic just in case. It's supporting the leathery facet of the main accord and is present for a short period of time.

When the things calm down, a red sweet note takes preponderance (maybe ethyl maltol?) and the musk arise too. There's some vanilla and amber undertones that give depth and warmth.
Although there is an obvious sweetness in this fragrance is not a sweet fragrance per se. I think it's very well balanced.

The blending and the quality of the ingredients are top notch. This fragrance moves through its life showing a considerable amount of complexity.

Performance is excellent on my skin. It projects very well for 2 or 3 hours and lasts forever. I can smell it even the next day.

Presentation is just out of this world. One of the best presentation I've ever seen. The bottle and the box are so unique and luxurious."
Ginger,07/13/2022,Staretsi,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,A Refined Layton Alternative,"In Andalusi, Arabian Oud has managed to remove some of the aspects of Layton and Layton Exclusif that I didn't enjoy, whilst adding a couple of oriental notes and boosting the performance. It is as if they took the Layton line as a blueprint and then sought to improve upon it.

As an illustration, saffron has been added to the top notes and it blends beautifully with the apple and bergamot. It is an intriguing accord which improves upon the opening of the original Layton.

In the mid dry down rose and very subtle non-cloying vanilla come to the fray. The dank note (civet?) that you get from Layton Exclusif is thankfully absent here. Here, the mid is an improvement on Layton Exclusif.

The base is very similar to Layton Exclusif with oud, amber, and sandalwood. However, instead of coffee and patchouli we have clean leather. Again, an improvement in my view. That dank dirtiness is gone.

So, here we have a Layton top with the addition of saffron, and a Layton Exclusif heart and base with the removal of dank and dirty accords and the addition of leather. It's an example of East meets West done well.

If you are a fan of Layton or Layton Exclusif, or found those two fragrances lacking in performance, or even put off by the dank accords, give Andalusi a try."
Lush Life,11/29/2023,SeoulBrough,M,39,,5,Spring Vibes,"This is my first Tauer fragrance and I must say, I am not disappointed whatsoever. Nexin will take you on a journey of smelling wild flowers in its natural habitat.

Initial spray, you’ll be greeted by the florals. Easily the orange blossom and cold geranium are noticeable. Also, there is a note I’m not familiar with that smells divine. Maybe lemon blossom or orris root? I’m not sure, but it marrys well with the other notes.

While the top notes are dazzling your olfactive senses, the earthiness from the vetiver, ambergris and oakmoss are running parallel from the start also. Kinda reminds me of a freshly watered flowerbed with damp soil. This is my favorite part because I love vetiver and oakmoss.

Nexin is unisex in the opening and leans masculine in the dry down, but I can see everyone enjoying this.

Sillage and projection are good.

If this wasn’t a limited run, I think many would enjoy wearing this in the spring, summer and autumn."
Lush Life,11/03/2023,PetraA,F,25,,2,Peacetul morning in a cottage,"Why did Andy Tauer decide to call this perfume NEXIN? He says it captures the essence of our connection with the cosmos and the stars. When you google what nexin means you will find out it is a proteinous inter-doublet linkage.... gets a bit more complicated but the linkage is the key word here.
My personal scent story with NEXIN is not under dark sky full of stars. I see it linked to morning sky.
I imagine myself inside a cottage, remote, on a hill. It is spring time. Early morning. I am in the kitchen baking a lemon cake and the smell of lemon zest is everywhere. On my windowsill I grow pelargoniums, the kind that have leaves smelling of lemon and rose. I look outside onto the garden and see a gentle breeze touching the white linen drying. Sky is pale blue and so is the sun. It is peaceful.
I see NEXIN linked to pale blue, pale yellow and white.
I see it linked to cripsy washed white shirts in L'EAU, orange detergents in Orange star and Alpine air in L'Air Des Alpes Suisses.
If you like above three, you will enjoy it."

Admiring the night, which unites all things, which causes its dark blanket and silence to descend: who has never enjoyed this sensation, admiring the magnificence of that moment?
Nexin takes its name from the Latin ""nexus"", which means connection: the connection of all the elements but also, in the olfactory world, of the fragrances of Andy Tauer, who here too manages to give us a true olfactory masterpiece.
An alchemy of notes that delights us with dusty and vintage accents refreshed by a whiff of citrus and warmed by woods.
Absolutely worth smelling, it cannot fail to be appreciated by lovers of niche fragrances.

Lush Life,03/30/2024,Thatbwoy,M,100,,1,A decent true 'Unisex' fragrance,"Unisex fragrances usually don’t strike too close to ‘a good fit’ for me. Usually they sit in a category of ‘Good but would I actually wear this?’

Most of the time it’s no, there’s a list of fragrances that I rate highly but just don’t couldn’t wear. The list of unisex fragrances that I would wear is short. This is not due to any prejudice against unisex fragrances moreover I have found them to veer towards sweet. I am inclined to think that this is intentional by the brand/perfumer

What Andy Tauer has created here is exactly the kind of fragrance that is truly ‘unisex’. It satisfies that particular narrow criteria that I have placed upon these type of fragrances. There’s no lean towards masculine or feminine but it remains squarely in the centre.

The issue though is that though this has so many notes that I like and would ordinarily go for, it’s not a fragrance I would see myself buying a full bottle of; I would happily wear this had I had a decant of or if I was gifted this - though I couldn't push myself to buy this. I don't understand this stumbling block (oddly I know this is limited and my chances of buying this are small). Though this goes back to what I was saying earlier, this sits in that list of unisex fragrances that I like; but I don't usually want those fragrances. I am unsure how to say that I like this but I don't want it."
Lush Life,11/03/2023,Jersey,F,21,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,How is Opus-Arte from Swan Lake by P.I. Tchaikovsky connected to the new perfume Nexin by A. Tauer?,"A fragile, breezy cool to metallic cold citrus scent with iris roots in moss, with slightly spicy woods from No. 12 and aldehydes from the aromatic pentachord trio (Auburn, Verdant, White) on a musk-aldehyde cloud. The perfume, released in honor of the brand's 18th anniversary, has the final digit 9 (1+8), with the number 9 completing the 9-year life cycle in a numerological sense. My bottle bears the number 163, which signifies 1 (1+6+3=10; 1+0=1 and the one is further enhanced by zero). Nexin can be seen as the end or even the beginning of something new in Andy's work. Let's see which direction he will take. And how does Nexin smell? As is Andy's habit when it comes to something significant. Nexin is something special - a delicate, strict, metallic cold, floral and distinctive scent all in one. What I appreciate about it is the uniqueness to neutrality and the detachment from the distinctly sweet or distinctly fruity, earthy and airy creations of the two nine-year-old predecessor lines. Upon seeing the white bottle, the Opus Arte music from P.I. Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake comes to mind. With each sniff, I associate this beautiful piece of music with Andy."
Iamesh,09/29/2024,Westwindchen,F,2,,8,"You think you have a simple floral water in front of you, and then...","The notes of the fragrance sounded very pleasant from the start - as a confessed fan of tea and floral notes, I felt immediately drawn in. Then I saw the price... uff. Does it have to be?
In the past, I have often tested expensive fragrances that were absolutely not worth the price. It was then easy to shake my head and let the samples go. I was fortunate enough to receive a sample of this fragrance, which was somewhat cheaper, but still quite pricey for a sample. Somehow, I still felt that it had to be.
The fragrance captivated me from the very first second. Yes, it is a floral tea scent. But it brings a deep, pleasant spiciness that elevates it from mediocrity. It remains ever-present, bringing both freshness and a certain warmth, making it no trivial floral water. The sillage is subtle, which I really like - the more familiar I become with perfumes and the older I get, the less I want to bother people with a cloud of scent. Rather, I wish for a fragrance that is always present but underscores my personality and not the other way around, true to the motto: I want to wear the fragrance, not the fragrance wear me.
For a fragrance with such a fresh, light-footed character, I find the longevity (about 9 hours for me, during which I perceive it constantly) perfectly acceptable. Nowadays, I find it rather creepy when a fragrance clings to me for days and doesn't want to let me go. For me, Extraordinaire Camelia is absolutely worthy of being a signature scent. Personally, I see it (also due to the price and character) more suited for a woman over 30. Of course, the name also makes me think of the Lady of the Camellias, a wayward woman who is willing to give up everything for love. The story is not nice, it is not pink cotton candy, and exactly that is not what this fragrance is either. For me, it is clear: This fragrance has left a lasting impression on me and is to be a part of my life from now on."
Iamesh,02/06/2024,Salibonani,F,3,,3,"The unique blend of freshness, spice, and flowers leaves a lasting impression","This fragrance brings back old memories. It reminds me of my childhood and a vacation in Italy. The beach, the warm sun, good vibes, and many nice people around me - all of this comes to mind, because somehow I perceived a similar scent back then.

Scent: The fragrance is characterized by a fresh, spicy, and floral note. In particular, I notice the clear note of pepper - I can't perceive other nuances as precisely. I like this scent so much that I will always repurchase it. Yes, this perfume will be my constant companion. The unique blend of freshness, spice, and flowers leaves a lasting impression that will last a lifetime - for sure!"
Iamesh,07/11/2023,Pollita,F,384,,48,"Soft, Spicy Embrace on a Gentle Vanilla Base","Extraordinaire Camelia 209. Yes, a high-class courtesan could indeed smell like this. Some suitors might weaken at the sight of this sinfully expensive fragrance in its elegant bottle, at the center of which lies the namesake camellia blossom. I myself have never consciously had a camellia blossom under my nose, so I can’t really judge whether camellias smell like this. This charming floral scent reminds me a bit of lily of the valley, freesias, or jasmine. Presumably, these three are also included in the formula. A touch of rose would also be conceivable. Unlike Mörderbiene, I really like the combination with the soft vanilla and musk. When it comes to fragrances, I guess I’m just a bit of a softie.

The sparkling, slightly fruity top notes are simply wonderful. And it doesn’t take long before musk, vanilla, and flowers enchant me. I usually prefer cardamom on the gentlemen of creation. Here, the spice adds fine spicy accents in combination with pepper.

A composition that, with its softness and fine spicy edges, also reminds me somewhat of my beloved Max Mara Le Parfum. Only that Max Mara is an understated scent, while this perfume has quite a kick. Not just in terms of spices. Yes, this camellia blossom is quite a little powerhouse, even though it initially appears delicate. The sillage lingers in the room, even with a subtle dose. And it has excellent longevity. Subtle fragrances don’t seem to quite fit the brand’s concept. However, Extraordinaire Camelia comes across as gentler compared to other spicier Krigler scents. A certain Mr. Polly considers the fragrance weak, but that doesn’t surprise me at all. I, on the other hand, love those little clouds that wait for me in the room shortly after I’ve left. Beautiful enough to make you kneel.

Although it was only launched in 2009, it carries a wonderful charm of the nineties. I remember deodorants and other cosmetic products that smelled somewhat similar. It’s a little piece of youth in a bottle. A bit of a time travel. A scent that immediately connects with me. It unites my preferences in such a wonderful way. Like almost all my floral favorites with musk, this one, and here we are back at the camellia lady, brings a tiny bit of dirt with it. This it shares with my wonderful Coralie from Ikiryō.

Well, I’ve tried for a long time to talk myself out of it, as the prices of this brand are astronomical. Does it bother me a bit? Does it pinch a little? Well, unfortunately no. I fear resistance is futile. And the bottles look so dreamily beautiful and are surely a showstopper in any collection. Yes, what can I say? It’s love.

A heartfelt thank you to Gandix for the opportunity to test this."

It's a bit sad for this perfume, because I actually want to like it and use it more."
Skinny Dip,03/31/2022,Sveglia21,N/A,2,,5,What’s really in here?,"I may be new to the game, but something doesn’t add up here. The website and also the notes listed here on parfumo are something completely different from what is written in English on the bottle itself:

top notes: Lemon Essential, saffron, wild berries
heart notes: cardamom, rose, iris
base notes: amber, sandalwood oil

That has nothing to do with each other.
Well, whatever. My friend and I both like wearing it. It smells spicy and fresh. It’s suitable for everyday use. Not a bore, but also not a fragrance monster. It works very well for us.

If someone can clarify the notes confusion, I would be very happy to receive a response."
Yuzu and Cocoa,09/18/2025,MrFragUK,M,9,,1,Armani Stronger With You meets YSL Myself,"Yet another high quality fragrance from Arabiyat Prestige. La-Di-Da may sound like a ridiculous name for a perfume, but Arabiyat's execution of blending two well known fragrances has been masterfully done.

In fact, you wouldn't necessarily imagine the DNA of SWY & MYSELF would work well together in the same fragrance. However, somehow Arabiyat Prestige have done it to perfection. The blend is beautiful, as is the quality of ingredients.

Sillage is initially strong, and it creates a nice scent bubble around you. However, longevity isn't the best at around 3 hours befor becoming a skin scent. Maybe maceration will help performance in a few months time. However, you do get an impressive pressurized atomizer.

Overall, Arabiyat fragrances may cost more money than other Middle Eastern brands, but what you're paying for is quality. If you like these two fragrances, then La-Di-Da is a very nice fragrance."

However, the longevity falls a bit short, and the bottle design with the paper sticker doesn’t quite match the experience of this scent."
The Olive Branch,06/10/2015,Gemini237,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Freshness and Warmth on a Summer Day,"My mother received the EDT as a gift when I was still a teenager.
Of course, I occasionally sprayed it on myself, somewhat secretly, always feeling a bit shabby for wasting this delicious water of my mom's :)
I must say, she liked it a lot, but we both thought it was a little 'too light' for her - perhaps better suited for younger people. This is, of course, dependent on the person and the situation.

About the EDT:
Sillage is medium strong, longevity is also average - typical for an EDT.

For the first time, I smelled a fragrance that was both warm and sweet, but also fresh! I haven't smelled it in years, but the memory is still so strong.
I was certainly influenced by the name, but I actually smelled coffee.
The opening is fresh, which I perceived as mandarin back then - not too sweet or overpowering - it was probably the cedar-minty freshness.
Then comes the heart of white flowers, beautifully comforting, and you are surprised by the following spicy notes. This lightness! A spring/summer day appears before my eyes, I am sitting in a café in a green neighborhood with iced coffee on the table.
A truly beautiful white flower scent, rounded and balanced. You just wish it would last longer on the skin!
If I had to compare it, it slightly reminds me of Woman No.1 by Betty Barclay.
P.S. My comment has turned out longer than expected, I guess it's due to nostalgia... :)"
Dear John,07/26/2013,Terra,M,646,,0,Are you all crazy?,"63%? What has he done to deserve that? If it says grapefruit, it won't smell like ebony, and pink pepper won't smell like raspberry.

No no, allow me the joke :). Everyone perceives the scent differently.

But I think this one belongs to those that truly are among the super new releases from the house of 4711. A wonderful grapefruit greets you, one that even Jean Claude Ellena couldn't do better, just different and with more Iso E Super. Alongside it is a slightly spicy pink pepper, which also has a certain fruitiness. The whole thing never becomes overly sweet but remains a wonderful summer fragrance. Simple, light, never intrusive, and fresh. Just pleasant.
And affordable.

Anyone who has issues with 4711 but likes colognes should definitely try Portugal, Pink Pepper & Grapefruit, as well as the Ice Cool Cologne from 4711. They can do it, really ;)"
Dear John,06/15/2017,TheScent,M,23,,9,real summer,"An honest scent that smells exactly like what’s written on the bottle, and in a VERY WELL crafted way. For me, it’s always the perfect companion in summer.
If another brand name were on the bottle, along with a sexy marketing campaign, this stuff would be a hit. Luckily, it’s not, and everyone always looks puzzled when you say that the scent is from 4711 :). LOVE IT!"
Dear John,05/03/2013,Chilly55,F,15,,11,"Funny, funny...","... contrary to the impressions that some of my previous commentators have, I actually like this Aqua as an EdC. I can't really notice a significant development either, but for me, the EdC starts off fresh and I can clearly recognize the grapefruit. This bitter-fresh scent can definitely be described as citrusy, but not lemony. With the other colognes from 4711 in this series, I had the impression that they sometimes smell artificial. Especially Lemon-Ginger was really not my thing. Just simple lemon.

I much prefer the sweet fruitiness of the orange mixed with the bitterness of the pomelo. I find it hard to judge Pink Pepper, but I do like using pink pepper in the kitchen...

So, I actually went into the kitchen to get the pink peppercorns and test them straight. Not spicy, more savory-floral and mild in taste. Yes, that sounds about right ;-)! For me, the scent has nothing musty or heavy about it, but is a straightforward, ""finer"" scent due to the pepper berries. It conveys freshness to me, but has nothing piercing, rather it develops (if one can speak of that) into a soft freshness.

Somewhere I once read that the scent of Pink Grapefruit is supposed to make you younger. I don't know if this grapefruit is of the pink variety, but at my age, one has to pay attention to the little things. The word ""pink"" does appear in the fragrance pyramid after all. That's something.

And now I hurry grapefruit-pink-peppered with youthful steps into the kitchen and put away the pepper berries. ""Pink"" and ""Grapefruit"" can stay."
Dear John,03/29/2019,Pinkdawn,F,68,,9,The anticipated freshness kick unfortunately did not materialize ...,"Recently - more precisely, on March 20 at 22:59 - spring has arrived here in Vienna. Time to look around at what is currently trending in fashion and to find a suitable new fragrance to start the still young season.
I wish for something fresh, light, citrusy. Perhaps grapefruit. It makes one feel so uplifted. Apparently, grapefruit scent is said to make us appear younger. I can imagine that well. In aromatherapy, the euphoric effect of grapefruit when encountered olfactorily has long been well known. Perhaps that’s why I love this bright, cheerful scent. Therefore, Aqua Allegoria Pamplelune and Aqua Allegoria Pera Granita, both by Guerlain, are among my perfumes and are often used by me.

Somehow, I then stumbled upon 4711 Pink Pepper & Grapefruit. Due to its freshness, this Eau de Cologne apparently enjoys great popularity, as I gather from several reviews online. Coincidentally, Müller has a special offer for a set consisting of the Eau de Cologne and a shower gel in the same scent. This combo pack seems very appealing to me. So off to Müller …

Before I decide to buy, I make sure to try the perfume using a tester. I don’t know it yet.
There they all are, the currently popular 4711 Eau de Colognes. The packaging of all the scents is very appealing. The Pink Pepper & Grapefruit, for example, comes in a pretty, pale green box adorned with branches of pink pepper. The glass bottle, reminiscent of cut crystal glass, appeals to me less. This type of cut crystal simply seems too old-fashioned to me. Like something from the 50s, when this cut was in vogue.

Aside from the set with the shower gel, the EdC is available as a spray in a 170-ml bottle. The price for the latter ranges from a modest € 20.99 to a less budget-friendly € 47.95 online.

I begin my test. I imagine Pink Pepper & Grapefruit to be refreshing. Urban, perhaps a bit cheeky, trendy, young, and citrusy. An ideal scent for warm days. But unfortunately, I do not find that here. This cologne only seems fresh to me at the moment of spraying. The anticipated citrus fireworks are limited from the very beginning. Unfortunately. Instead, the pepper with its spicy aroma is immediately very present.

I don’t mind the combination of spicy and fruity. But it simply doesn’t work for me. The scent quickly develops a somewhat harsh, dull quality - I can’t describe it any other way. As I said, I do not find the desired cheerful brightness and zesty freshness of grapefruit here, or it is too little.

The scent also does not change. I stand around for a while, sniffing my wrist repeatedly. The only thing that happens is that the scent noticeably becomes weaker and weaker very quickly. I have hardly ever encountered a perfume whose scent fades so fast. Okay, it is an Eau de Cologne. But I know many scents from this category with good longevity - not least the classic from 4711.

Pink Pepper & Grapefruit could at best pass as a body mist in my eyes. It certainly does not convince me. The thought of buying it drifts further and further away. I had a completely different idea of this scent. I also do not know any grapefruit scent that comes across as so dark.

But since I am already standing in front of the shelf with the 4711 Acqua Colonias, I also try the Eau de Cologne Blood Orange & Basil as well as Mandarin & Cardamom. Both seem very interesting to me in their composition. But they ultimately disappoint as well.

It is as someone has aptly written in a review: You get what it says on the label. And I add: But nothing more … Perhaps 4711 has taken inspiration from the Guerlain Aqua Allegoria series, which also features fragrances that combine fruity notes with spices - for example, Mandarin Basilic, which is even in my collection.

But what a difference! Also in price, of course. In bottle design anyway. But above all in scent.

There are many things that Germans excel at. Poetry and thinking, inventing useful things, composing, writing literature, painting, constructing technical or physical precision instruments, and much more. However, the creation of subtle fragrances does not seem to be their greatest strength - compared to the French, for example.

And so the fragrance experience with 4711 is quite one-dimensional, almost crude. You get what it says on the label. Nothing more. This means that I miss the refinement, the play with aromas, with top, heart, and base notes, the allure of a scent that reveals new facets over time.

Pink pepper and grapefruit - what delightful nuances and contrasts could that have offered? Yet the scent remains the same from beginning to end. And the end comes, as mentioned, so quickly that it is hard to believe.

Of the three 4711s I tested, the “Pink Pepper” lasts the least long, and by a wide margin. For a price that is not even that low for an Eau de Cologne, one could have expected more.

“Pink Pepper” is considered a unisex scent. I have little experience with such perfumes. I usually prefer feminine scent notes. Perhaps that’s why the fragrance turned out so harsh. I would have preferred more citrus and less harshness.

I’m sorry if I do not perceive this perfume as the wonderfully refreshing scent for hot summer days, unlike others. There are better ones - like the Pamplelune by Guerlain, which, although it is also not a wonder of longevity, does not give you the feeling of needing to reapply every 2 minutes, as is the case with “Pink Pepper.”

The scent is more spicy than fresh. But even the bitter note lacks refinement and subtlety in my opinion. More could have been made from this combination. Perhaps a bit of bergamot at the start, lemongrass, verbena, and cedar, maybe even mint, would have worked better for summer freshness.

I have no problem with the brand 4711. The classic Eau de Cologne with plenty of bergamot still offers a pleasant refreshment and is still quite wearable today, I think. However, the Acqua Colonias that I tested yesterday seem a bit plain and uninspired to me. You have to like that - or not.

Conclusion: In my opinion, these scents are for those who are rather undemanding and possibly have little experience compared to more interesting fragrances of this type. They cannot compete in any way with the conceptually similar Guerlain fragrances from the Aqua Allegoria series, in my opinion.

As always, it applies here too: Trying is better than studying …"

Although there is little innovative offered here, this unisex cologne is definitely successful, pleasant, and exceptionally summery. The longevity is around 4-5 hours, which is once again modest, and the sillage is similar.

I will also summarize the top, heart, and base notes here, as I can really only identify 2 components. It smells exceptionally citrusy with grapefruit. Additionally, there is always a spiciness from pink pepper. Interestingly, these citrus accords smell rather sour, subtly green, and fresh instead of overly sweet or even synthetic. This is probably why I like it so much.

Dear John,04/20/2013,Hibiscus,F,36,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Freshness in Pink,"Another one from 4711 that I liked right away. Wonderful freshness with a hint of pepper. Super!
The 50 ml bottle fits in your handbag in summer and is refillable. Funnel included.
I completely agree with T.E.'s comment - it smells like what it says on the label.
Period!"
Dear John,06/15/2022,Sprotte,F,1,,3,A Whimsical Summer Scent,"First, about the bottle: it looks nice, not too obtrusive. The cap is not magnetic, but it closes very well and stays on. The sprayer is not really high quality, but it sprays decently.
And now to the important part: the scent. The name says it all, and even for beginners like me, pepper and grapefruit are easily recognizable. It smells fresh, not too sour, invigorating, summery, and light. Unfortunately, the latter is also a disadvantage in terms of longevity. Because on my skin, the scent lasts no longer than 2 hours. However, it doesn’t change much and simply becomes weaker. I find that pleasant in such rather citrusy fragrances.
Since the cap closes well and doesn’t leak (which is not always the case in this price range), the scent is also easy to take along without needing to decant it.
Another plus point: there are different sizes of the bottles, and visually it matches the other Eau de Colognes in the line."
Dear John,02/20/2021,Mballers,M,7,,2,Absolute Insider Tip,"You can find a perfume like this on your own. If you're looking for something special for under 30 euros, this is the one to choose. Unfortunately, the cologne fades after 2 hours, but the strong grapefruit is intense and mixes particularly well with the pepper. It is especially suitable for summer. Throw on a shirt, add Pink
Pepper and grapefruit, it doesn't get fresher than this."
Dear John,01/28/2022,Overroller,M,4,,0,"Cologne good, longevity nonexistent","The scent is good and has a fruity note alongside the classic fresh cologne smell.
I personally really like the bottle as well, but unfortunately the cap feels very cheap.
However, for the price, you can overlook the cap.
Right at the sprayer, the scent has an alcohol note, but on the skin or when sprayed, the fragrance develops pleasantly.

What unfortunately doesn't work with this fragrance is the longevity.
A longevity of about 2 hours is unfortunately far too little for a perfume.

It's a shame, otherwise it would be a recommendation."
Self Esteem Machine,06/24/2020,Elysium,M,898,,1,Monsieur Privé The Perfect Match,"Miami South Beach has been called the American Riviera and an Art Deco Playground. The sparkling emerald water and the white sand beaches are a must-see for any Miami visitor; even for locals, the beautiful beach doesn't get old. Take a stroll down Lincoln Road for the best people-watching in Miami or cozy up to a fancy bar with Haute cocktails. If I think of Miami Beach, I imagine the endless beaches with the houses facing the ocean, the fresh breeze blowing from the sea, and, therefore, all this makes me suppose that ZARA's new perfume can evoke all these feelings. It is not wrong to associate this perfume with A&F Fierce. At the first spray, the two fragrances are very similar. But the resemblance ends here because soon after, everyone goes their way. Fierce perseveres in its fougère vibe, resinous fir, aromatic rosemary, and dry mossy down, which is in its characteristic, while Miami Beach is aromatics up my nose. My first reaction to this was that it has a very familiar smell. It took a few moments before I knew it. Well, read on if you want to find out more.

The lockdown aftermath forced some perfumeries to remove the testers from the shelves. I, therefore, purchased it as a blind buy, but considering the budget price, I was pretty confident I wouldn't be disappointed. I wasn't, and something is appealing about this scent: despite it having a synthetic element, it's sensual in its coolness. That alone makes it stand out from other fougères. Miami Beach is classified as woody, amber, fruity, and as soon as it reaches my skin, it opens with a punchy smell of sour fruity accords. There is a bit of apple and a tad of green pineapple. The two of them are not dominant in this scent, meaning that we don't have here the Boss Bottled's apple nor the Creed Aventus's pineapple, so do not expect a similar vibe. The fruity aspect is seasoned with a spice clove that smoothly rises as soon as the scent warms up. I perceive a bright citrus tone, not harsh, reminiscent of citrus blossoms and leaves, In this initial stage, the cologne has many similarities with A&F Fierce, yet I would not state an exact clone of one another.

The heart eventually fades back into a more delicate, less abrasive floral accord with a pleasant touch of aqua. It's classy and refined with nice creamy lavender feel that almost sways things into barbershop territory but never fully lands there and ends up becoming cleanly and soapy. As far as lavender-centric barbershop scents go, this is hands down the greatest. It's lavender and jasmine with white freesia as well into the dry down. However, the lavender isn't overly sweet as in Azzaro pour Homme, and it isn't coupled with anise, which is the Azzaro sign. The jasmine makes the whole thing smells and feels very luscious, and with slight freesia, it retains an old-world sort of character to it.

To get anywhere close the dry down, you have to wait a while. The scent turns mild, a crisp cedar and amber take part in the final stage. What I smell here is a sweet and dry cedarwood, the sweetness coming from the presence of the roasted Tonka. There is even a graceful woody amber dryness of ambroxan, though the overall base is not a modern ambroxan-based cologne a la Dior Sauvage. A musky, metallic, and clean finishing.

Miami Beach is closer to Égoïste Platinum or the more fruity Montblanc Legend Intense, a slightly different formula in the same spirit, a little less vibrant and round, but more fougère-like and surprisingly louder. It's loud but not shrinking, it's pleasant but not dull, and it'll last 'til the end of time. Miami Beach is a clean, soap-like, aromatic that's so versatile you'd be hard-pressed to find the time when you can't wear it.

The accords resulting from Miami Beach make me prefer it during mid-seasons, both Spring and Fall days are good. Sillage and longevity are both excellent. Once again, that good ZARA quality is there, making this inoffensive, extremely versatile, well blended, and comfortable to wear. If you have smelt Égoïste Platinum by Chanel, picture this as a polished and more refined version, which makes this a great office fragrance that you don't have to worry about touching up.
If it smells the same to you as another fragrance, then don't buy it. As for me, I love it. It is clean, minimalistic, with just enough flair to be noticeable, yet without an overly dramatic character.

This review is based upon a 100 ml (3/4 fl.oz.) I own.

Hollyhocks - Bramble,03/01/2012,Florblanca,F,1168,HELPFUL REVIEW,12,The rose with honey and chocolate,"Rose Absolue is the diva rose. Durable like glue, with a pretty decent sillage, a strong rose that has been sweetly and chocolaty wrapped. Somewhat like candied rose.

The entire Secret d'Essences series features really well-made, high-quality soliflores, including this rose. Nevertheless, it brings a rather overwhelming sweetness, making the rose seem even heavier and darker than it already is.

What is pleasant, however, is that the sweetness diminishes upon reaching the base, leaving the rose with its own space. And this base truly lasts forever. It easily survives 24 hours. It is certainly wearable during the day, although I wouldn't wear it in the daytime; it should then be applied very sparingly, perhaps just one or two sprays on the hair.

It will definitely stay with me, as it enriches my rose collection. Unlike Vanille Noir or Voile d'Ambre, I wouldn't buy the EdT of Rose Absolue, as it cannot compare to the Extrait, smelling distinctly soapier and stale."
Frozen,12/12/2020,Interdit,F,58,,0,The evanescent,"No woody notes, or green. No ""white flowers"", just a soft gardenia and a tuned down grapefruit note.

It is pleasant, but I most definitely get better results in both longevity and sillage from the Absolu. I would have to layer them both to get the perfect balance, and at the price tag the pure parfum goes it's a big disappointment. I was expecting way more projection, intensity in the accords, but they are subdued and too timid.

Personally, a pure parfum so weak it's not worthy the price. But as it goes, I have them both now and will layer pure over absolu.
It's a 5 out of 10 from me: keep your money and buy more absolu if you enjoy the woody grapefruit with faint flowery vibes. I honestly cannot believe how weak this extract is.

Btw... interestingly, Jour pure works wonderfully with Bottega Veneta (the orginal). Try to believe! :-)"
Inhale,05/03/2021,SmellyPete,M,17,,2,Very poor performance (batch: 140120011037),"I recently reviewed Al Haramain's Amber Oud Tobacco. This 'Rouge' release couldn't be more different in terms of performance...

The tobacco last for days, the rouge (Batch Code: 140120011037) last for literally minutes...
There is almost no sillage right from the start - after 15 min I doubt that anyone will notice you are wearing this..
I can still smell this very faintly after an hour if press my nose right on the place where I sprayed...
I tried overspaying - not much effect

It's a real pity as this is a nice fragrance but completely unusable for me as a fragrance... I'd be respraying all the time.

Given the many people who report good performance all I can think is poor quality control in their manufacturing process...

The presentation is very impressive like for the tobacco - fancy hinged box and nice bottle. With all that effort it's a shame that the fragrance doesn't live up to expectations. This not a release that Al Haramain can be proud of.

BTW, I didn't find this for sale on the Al Haramain website - maybe the company gave up on this too.
Their Amber Oud Tobacco is really good."
Inhale,04/02/2023,Alpischnalpi,M,21,,0,The Brother of BR 540,"Basically, I agree with my predecessor's review; the scent smells almost exactly like its predecessor, but a bit darker/less sweet and thus - if you will - ""more masculine."" Therefore, it is accurate to describe it as the brother of BR540 (as a sister). The fact that the scent performs a bit weaker might not be so bad, considering how often and intensely one encounters BR in everyday life. I find it very pleasant.
All in all, the scent is worth it, although it has also become relatively expensive, and cheaper alternatives are available (e.g. Baroque Rouge 540 for about 30 euros)."
Inhale,01/03/2022,Laylush,F,5,,1,The Little Brother of BR 540,"Amber Oud Rouge has similar components to its predecessor, especially the saffron note is noticeable. I also own BR 540 and must say that the two are particularly similar in the dry down, but in terms of sillage and performance, Amber Oud Rouge unfortunately cannot keep up, in my opinion. BR is much more striking and fills every room with a cloud of fragrance, its little brother is not as prominent. However, I must mention that Amber Oud Rouge is truly the closest of all the dupes I have tested so far to BR. At first, Amber Oud Rouge was very affordable, making the price-performance ratio a 10/10, but since the fragrance apparently is no longer being produced, the prices have become significantly more expensive and at around €80 now, it is no longer worth it."
We Believe in Glinda,05/23/2025,Waterlily,F,20,,2,Ahh... Oh no...,"I fell in love with this perfume on a paper strip. I loved the smell of the lemon which faded into a nice, dry herbal note.

Unfortunately, now I've tried it on my skin several times and generally been able to spend more time with it... I don't like it. Relative to my initial impression, the perfume feels much more sweet and sticky. It really is reminiscent of a Ricola candy or a breath mint.

I just wanna smell like lemon and rosemary, not sticky candied lemon and mint. :("
We Believe in Glinda,06/16/2023,Chnokfir,M,214,,18,What a Load of Rubbish,"I used to regularly enjoy going to Lush. I often treated myself to a delicious shower gel or a bath bomb. Although you had to scrub the tub for much longer after a bath bomb than the time you actually spent in it. But at some point, the shower gels just became ridiculously expensive - EURO 20-35 for a medium-sized container is a bit excessive, even if it is vegan, cruelty-free, and smells really good. Moreover, I regularly got frustrated when each of my favorite shower gels was already out of stock 2-3 months later when I tried to repurchase them. No, that’s where the fun completely ends. Recently, however, I was at my trusted Italian lingerie specialty store, and when I asked what smelled so heavenly, the staff told me that the Lush store at the other end of the street was probably airing out its products again. Off I went...

The Lush perfumes currently all come in these uniform black-brown sliding boxes, which can, to put it mildly, drive one rapidly insane if you’re not particularly patient. The bottle is a rather unimaginative square with a very minimally designed label sticker and an even simpler black cap. Ms. Herrera, Mr. Rabanne, you could learn something here! Sometimes less can be more!

""Junk"" starts citrusy sharp and zesty like a bite into a lemon fresh from the tree. A few more bitter and sweeter notes of mandarin come into play. But don’t get too excited too soon, as the blackcurrant lurks with all its sweet-bitter fruitiness. Taking a deeper sniff reveals a wonderful twist: green freshness from the herb garden with a hint of fresh mint.

That’s it. But that’s all it needs to be. Full-bodied fruity notes, underpinned with delicate green herbs. A linear scent without twists and turns, without a late flourish. No secrets, no disappointments, completely without frills. I love ""Junk"" for that. Sometimes I just need the simple things in life that completely uplift me and put a constant grin on my face for the rest of the day.

A wonderful unisex feel-good scent for every day. Uncomplicated, pleasant, radiating positive vibes. And also good lasting, moderately perceptible for about 8 hours. But that’s all it needs to be. If you want more or longer, just reapply, which poses absolutely no problems with such a simply constructed scent.

I’m baffled as to why this great scent is called ""Junk."" Maybe it’s just a joke from someone in charge because the overpaid marketing teams came up with nothing but brainless nonsense for their bullshit bingo, and they’d rather print some ""crap"" on the label instead of any content-free advertising nonsense. Whatever the case, I like this rubbish. Feel free to give me more of it. I need to go to Lush again soon... especially when a perfume costs hardly more than a shower gel. What a load of rubbish!"
We Believe in Glinda,10/02/2021,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Who invented it?,"“Junk” comes quite close to the famous Swiss herbal pastilles with R, but it definitely has enough character to smell like perfume and not like (albeit fresh) oral cavity...

Lush sometimes feels to me like the Comme des Garcons of the mainstream. Not that a scent like “Junk” seems magically experimental or artistically valuable or even industrial, yet it is far beyond the normal drugstore level in its creativity and interplay of ideas, reflections, and colors, much bolder and more natural. Not to mention the exemplary commitment to animal rights in the beauty segment. “Junk” is a green-herbaceous sweetie, a bit icy, a bit fruity. I wouldn’t deny the phrase “Ricola to spray.” Still, it’s definitely better than it sounds for many, as few would want to smell like herbal candies and a lingering cold. Or like waste, as the name flirtatiously suggests. Both are, of course, wrong and cheeky - because “Junk” is anything but disposable. Much closer to a keeper than to the brown bin. A gentle sage beauty, a cheeky rosemary rascal, a youthful currant.

Bottle: unspectacular, but good
Sillage: very subtle and candy-like
Longevity: very narrow - 3-4 hours, even less

Conclusion: not trash, can’t throw it away. More sensible recycling than a leftover bin!"
We Believe in Glinda,07/10/2020,SignoraPaola,F,6,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Not Junk but a Ricola Herbal Candy :-D,"This was my first thought as I eagerly unwrapped the bottle and took a sniff. But first, let's go in order...
I was strolling through the city center with my partner when it suddenly hit me that I wanted to visit Lush. I hadn't been inside a Lush for a long time and, accordingly, hadn't bought any products, but the unique scent of the ""Comforter"" was still fresh in my memory. So, I did what I said. I stood in the corona-related line outside the store and was soon allowed to enter. Unfortunately, the shopping experience is somewhat marred by the fact that you can no longer smell the products yourself; instead, if you're interested, you have to call over a salesperson who then assists you with your purchases. Understandable in the current situation, as not everyone should be pressing their dripping noses against the unpackaged products. So, I had a nice saleswoman wrap up a ""Comforter"" for me, and then she asked if I was already familiar with the scent that corresponds to the ""Comforter."" I said no. When she then asked if she could apply it on me, I of course said yes. The ""Comforter"" as a fragrance? *scream* How cool is that? She enveloped me in a cozy cassis cloud, and I melted away. I had to have it! So both the perfume and the bath bomb ended up in the shopping cart.

Happy and a bit high from the time spent in Lush (anyone who has been in a Lush knows what I mean...an olfactory giant orchestra!) I blissfully floated back into my partner's arms, cradling my treasure.
We continued to stroll through the city, and I kept sniffing my arm, each time pure delight.

Back in the car, I naturally couldn't hold back and had to smell this sensational scent again. But as soon as I took the fragrance out of my bag and read the name, I started to hesitate: ""Junk""? Shouldn't it actually say ""The Comforter""? I shrugged and pushed the doubt aside for the moment. I sprayed a bit into the cap and smelled again, and I was shocked. This was definitely not the scent of the ""Comforter."" It smelled like a very fresh Ricola herbal candy. What had happened? Had the saleswoman made a mistake? Did she perhaps even trick me into promoting ""Junk"" because it might have been a slow seller? I don't know. My partner suggested simply exchanging the fragrance, but I didn't want to, because somehow I liked my new Ricola.

The scent initially smells very herbal. Rosemary and sage are clearly recognizable. The sage is a bit more dominant to my nose at first, but not by much. Gradually, the mandarin and lemon join in. However, this does not smell or feel artificial. I didn't even notice the blackcurrant at first. It only appeared after several tests on my skin.
And what can I say? The more I wear it, the more I like it. And the more I wear it, the more it smells to me like the ""Comforter"" bath bomb. However, not as sweet as the bath bomb, but fresher and a bit more bitter, without being too masculine or heavy.

I find the longevity to be above average. I can still perceive it on myself for a long time. Nevertheless, one should indulge in a maximum of three sprays, as it is quite intense.
My partner, for example, doesn't like it at all. To him, Junk smells like cleaning products (the philistine!)
I, however, like it very much, and when I want to completely step away from my gourmand perfumes, I gladly reach for it. So, you see, opinions are divided on it.

In my opinion, it can be worn all year round. Sparingly dosed, it lasts all day. The bottle is simple and functional. Not a design highlight, but the inner values count, and those are great.

Conclusion:
Junk is a lovely herbal-fruity scent that lasts long. I would definitely recommend it to men as well. The herbs, citrus fruits, and blackcurrant together create a rounded, fruity-bitter blend. In short, a Ricola to scent yourself with :-D

P.S.: I researched for a long time and finally found out that there once was a fragrance named ""The Comforter"" by Lush. Unfortunately, it seems to have been limited and is no longer produced. Whether Junk is now a fresher version of the old scent or whether the two have no connection at all, I couldn't find out. Maybe someone among you knows more details?"
We Believe in Glinda,07/04/2025,JazzDazz,F,1,,1,Gum with Cassis Flavor,"I'll keep it very simple..

Who doesn't know it.. this breath-freshening gum in purple with cassis flavor. Period.
Fresh, cheerful, cheeky, and distinctly noticeable, it holds up quite well. For the price, it's definitely not run-of-the-mill, for those who enjoy cassis and minty rosemary freshness.
I like it and wouldn't want to miss it in my collection."

Sung by Amy Winehouse. How do I end up mentioning the great Amy in a review of Nocturnes? You will find out, because in my opinion, Nocturnes, the house of Caron, and Amy have some similarities. Is that a stretch? Really?
Amy, born on 14.9.83, died on 23.7.2011, was one of the greatest soul talents of the 21st century. I followed her career with great interest, especially since I really like soul and blues. The brilliant, talented, unfortunate, foolish young woman who ruined her life and career. But should we judge her? No. An old Native American proverb says: ""Never judge a person until you have walked a mile in their shoes."" With soul came the blues, and the blues remained... Amy died on 23.7.2011 from alcohol poisoning.
Her death at 27 places Amy Winehouse alongside Robert Johnson and Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones and Janis Joplin on the list of pop culture icons who left this world too soon, all at the age of 27.
The house of Caron has had a similar fate. There have been many highs and lows. Chanelle described it very well in her blog. Personally, I can only hope that the highs continue and this traditional house recovers permanently.
Nocturnes is among my absolute favorites, along with Parfum Sacré, Nuit de Noel, Tabac Blond, and Montaigne.
Nocturnes is of dark beauty. Dark and NOT gloomy. At night when golden veils fly. Nocturnes sings in soul with a dark alto voice. Aldehydes not soapy like cologne, but frothy, supported by quite gentle citrus fruits. Gold-yellow and not fresh lemon-yellow.
Nocturnes sings the song of the night and is not a squeaky cheerful little scent that might make you think of playing funny games like hoppe, hoppe Reiter or the plumpsack goes around.
You are not accompanied here by white flowers, but by blooms with an intense to lascivious scent. Mysterious when lily of the valley chimes to the moon.
Even the creaminess of amber with woody undertones and dark green meadow notes lets the night sink into soul and blues.
Nocturnes is a perfume I truly miss since my bottle is empty. Many others have also left me over the years, but I say: It was lovely while you were here, but there will be no reunion."
Lush Getaway,11/16/2020,Elysium,M,898,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A Hint of Maleness & Sensualness,"I remember very well my Arrogance Uomo. It was 1987, I was 23yo, and this perfume was sharing the market with Krizia, Missoni, Ferré, Versace, Trussardi, and Armani, all Italian designer brands. When I saw it on the shelf of a supermarket, in promotion, I tested the product on my skin, and promptly images and memories of that time appeared clear and vivid in my mind. I didn't notice any reformulations right off the bat, apart from a modification of a bottle's look. So I bought both the 30 and 75 ml. And what follows is the description of the sensations that this perfume still gives me.

Arrogance Uomo is an old school Italian perfume that boasts a rather unexpected development: is a green, aromatic, and woody all-round perfume. I'm not sure I recognize all the notes listed in the olfactory pyramid. Perhaps they were present in the original concept. However, on my skin, it starts nicely with a loud burst of citrus and lavender. The blend is intensely aromatic, bright bergamot, and soothing lavender is detectable and very pleasant, giving me beautiful fougère undertones. Soon, balsamic mugwort joins the mix, while the other opening notes quickly subside. In this first phase, the scent is fresh, with a notable influence of British lavender. It almost seems to sink your nose into a handful of freshly picked and crumbled lavender flowers in your hands.

The heart is involved, dimmer, with greenish geranium leaves and dried carnation flowers. The perception of white flowers is scanty, and the rose, if it is truly present, drowns in a sea of dark red flowers and greenish leaves. The herbaceous and fougère quality remains in this significant phase.

The bottom is deep, made of roots and moss, with a vibrant musk-like feel and a lot of sandalwoods. I get herbs and musk—a good dose of dry cedarwood and oakmoss that oozes later. Oops, I almost forgot to mention the vetiver, which you can smell from the first notes, and then it dominates as the perfume dries. The last track has a barber's touch, which could not be missing!

The overall effect is that of perfume with very virile tones: it is green, it is woody, it is earthy, it is dry, an aroma that is like a withered woodland. It's made of quality ingredients, despite its budget price. An exclusive perfume, still exciting today amid gourmand and amber sweeties, to admit that it does its job very well. Arrogance Uomo is one of those ultra-cheap perfumes with an exceptional quality of all respect, so beautiful that you can risk a blind purchase if you are fond of the genre. The overall quality is outstanding, with longevity that is still excellent, a full working day, and the sillage that is moderate after the initial blast fills the surrounding space. The nuances suggest rocking it during the chilly days of spring and autumn and trying on cold summer nights. People looking for safe office fragrances may consider trying it.

This review bases upon a 75 ml (2.5 fl. oz) bottle I own since November 2015.

Lush Getaway,07/27/2018,Jazzy76,F,320,,0,A touch of class and mystery (...at an affordable price!),"This fragrance is timeless and evergreen. Born in the late 80es, in the era of opulent fragrances, this one keeps nowadays its balanced character, strong but not intoxicating, deep and masculine, but also gentle with its unexpected flowery heart. A wonderful classic you can enjoy whenever you want for its quite affordable price. It could be the perfect gift for a classy and mysterious man for its elegant black bottle and it could be stolen by an unconventional woman who likes playing to the ""gentleman"" stealing this scent from her man's perfumed wardrobe! Why not?"
Lush Getaway,02/05/2011,Apicius,M,1328,,26,Surpasses the Original!,"I've been putting off the comment about Arrogance Uomo all week. This scent is simply elusive; just when you have it, it’s gone again. I’m almost at a loss for words.

I pulled Arrogance Uomo off the shelf at Beauty Affairs in Düsseldorf. Amidst all the expensive and noble fragrances stood this distinctly cheap-looking bottle: Yes, it is indeed dark gray hard plastic, adorned with a tiny ribbed pattern that is presumably meant to resemble crocodile leather.

To the connoisseur, this looks immediately familiar: Trussardi Uomo, whose container looks almost identical. And Trussardi Uomo is the cornerstone for Arrogance Uomo. I have a special relationship with Trussardi Uomo. In the early nineties, when people were dousing themselves in Cool Water en masse, I fell for this dark, noble, and quite masculine Italian scent. I believe I already mentioned that I primarily wore it with a leather jacket. Back then, I really enjoyed smelling a bit ""older"" - it somewhat emphasized my natural authority!

Trussardi Uomo was probably released in 1983. It’s not a clear leather chypre, but it’s also not a proper aromatic fougère. More on that perhaps another time. In any case, by 1990 it was almost out of fashion again. Arrogance Uomo apparently appeared a few years after the Trussardi fragrance, and its exterior gives the poor impression of a cheap fairground copy. When you hold both bottles side by side, you almost want to throw Arrogance Uomo away.

But then the surprise: Arrogance Uomo surpasses the scent of Trussardi! Yes, I have no objections to such imitations.

The first impression confirms the closeness to the Trussardi scent - it’s the same style, the same feeling. It takes a minute or two for the differences to emerge. In Arrogance Uomo, a slightly bitter spiciness is added as a secondary note, which makes this scent appear a bit rougher. Later on, Arrogance Uomo develops into a scent note that I - but I’m not entirely sure - consider to be a dark, quite masculine musk variant (musk ketone?). With that, Arrogance Uomo moves a bit away from the Trussardi scent, towards another, quite wonderful perfume - Rodier pour Homme. There, too, this masculine-musk-like note is present - quite pronounced, in fact. Moreover, at one point I briefly sensed a hint reminiscent of shaving soap, which brought to mind the good old Tabak Original.

The latter has fallen into disrepute mainly because its wearers usually overdo it. This is due to the strange phenomenon of numbing one’s own olfactory nerves, which is characteristic of that perfume. Well, Arrogance Uomo has to do with that too. I sprayed the scent on and perceived what I’ve described here subtly around me within a few minutes. To feel something more precise, I smelled my sprayed wrist - almost nothing! It took hours for a little scent to reappear at that spot. Instead, I only occasionally noticed the cloud that must have formed around me: With a gust of air or a turn of my body, Arrogance Uomo briefly announced itself in my nose, only to disappear again in the next moment.

Did my surroundings perceive Arrogance Uomo just as fleetingly as I did? How does one evaluate something like that?

I see it this way: perfumes with these characteristics keep a secret. They do not lay themselves bare before you and wait to be dissected. They elude you, and it is a gift, a brief moment of joy, when Arrogance Uomo occasionally makes itself known in your nose. I think such a scent can remain interesting longer than many other perfumes.

Arrogance Uomo smells forbiddenly good. In the list of ingredients, I read among other things: Evernia Furfuracea (tree moss) and Evernia Prunastri (oak moss). Real oak moss is no longer used nowadays, so my bottle must be somewhat older. I googled Arrogance Men a bit. Right now, the remaining stocks of this rare perfume are being sold off, some for under €20. A - reformulated - new edition does not seem to be in sight. So it’s time to grab it, and quickly. At this price, I especially recommend to fans of Trussardi Uomo to take a chance on a blind buy; you won’t regret it."

However, the comments from esteemed predecessors here were so positive and stimulating that this Italian gas scent has now been living here for a while, hidden in the second row. And its older, bulkier, and darker brother (Arrogance homme) is here too, along with the Arrogance Uomo Aftershave, which, by the way, also gently swings through the morning quite persistently.

The scent is very hard to describe, but I perceive a rather beautifully tempered concerto with a melody of clove, quite strong yet gentle and less sharp than, for example, in Dunhill Edition. And underneath is a somehow fluffy and soapy clean bed with accords of flowers and woods that I cannot break down. The vetiver perhaps provides a general bass, but so pianissimo that it is hardly noticeable as such - not comparable to strong vetiver scents like Guerlain or Encre Noirs.
In Germany, this ugly duckling with the soul of a beautiful swan seems to be rarely caught online, likely easier in Italian drugstores.

For those who prefer subtlety, the aftershave is sufficient, lasting longer than most of its kind. The sillage of the EdT is rather strong, and the longevity is good at about 8 hours. I find that this fine scent with an unpronounceable name can be worn quite well in summer and winter - except perhaps on extremely warm or extremely cold days, when it might come off as piercing or somewhat flat.

One problem remains, of course: what to say in a demanding environment when asked about the name of this nose-pleaser. Arrogance Uomo is hard to get over the lips of an adult with manners. And the justifying references to the rightly high insider community rating on Parfumo.de turn one from a honnete homme into a specialist nerd...

So what to do to get out with the fine scent?
A very good confinement companion!"
Lush Getaway,06/20/2025,Taurus,M,1164,,16,Level only looks like arrogance from below,"Although the bottle is matte black, I see the color green milliseconds after spraying it. A rather dark green that transports you right into a forest full of ferns, oak moss, coniferous trees, and much more.

The addition of lavender, artemisia, nutmeg flower, and sage brings ""Arrogance Uomo"" appealing fresh-spicy vibes, including a slightly bitter twist.
In the base notes, classic notes like patchouli, oak moss, as well as minimal leather and a bit of vetiver come through. It also has decent longevity along with projection.

All in all, it is obvious that we are dealing with a fragrance from the 80s and that ""Arrogance Uomo"" was truly created for men who know what they want. I imagine the wearer as a gruff commissioner or a daring inspector from those rough crime stories, who sometimes break conventions and laws to solve or avenge a case.

However, I can well imagine that ""Arrogance Uomo"" shone more intensely back then than it is allowed to today. My version seems almost a bit too mild for an 80s fragrance, yet it remains unusual and appealing, as well as slightly out of time without appearing old-fashioned. This arrogance definitely has class."

I have one more:

""When God created me, He wanted to show off.""

And a few more:

- ""In every dispute, there are two viewpoints: mine and the wrong one.""
- ""This charisma, this smile, this intelligence, this charming face, and those beautiful eyes...
But enough about me, how are you?""
- ""Here, everyone can do what I want!""
- ""I'm not perfect, but so close that it scares me.""
- ""I don't need the world. The world needs me!""
- ""I urgently need a bigger balcony so I can speak better to the people!""
- ""I would admit my mistakes if I had any.""
- ""Everyone has the right to my opinion!""
- ""You can find me in the dictionary under 'perfect'!""

Before you think you've accidentally landed on the homepage of Portuguese football star Christiano Ronaldo, let me quickly return to ""Arrogance."" Specifically, to ""Arrogance Uomo,"" the (little) brother born in 1987 of ""Arrogance Pour Homme,"" which first saw the light of day in 1982.

2.
This fragrance begins with a natural, but this time ripe, bergamot, which greets us in a fruity yet not citrus-fresh way. And above all with spices: nutmeg, sage, mugwort, and lavender. No, our bergamot does not play the lead role here. It is not a soloist that defines the spicy top note. Rather, as a ripe and natural fruit, it is best described as a ""team player"" in a group. And our olfactory ""Spice Girls""? No one stands out there either. Even the usually so Mediterranean-radiant lavender receives a slightly peppery touch from the nutmeg. Everything is beautifully intertwined. It almost feels slightly creamy.

In the heart note, the doorbell rings immediately. It's our friend from the ""Fleurop delivery service."" You can believe me: he is heavily laden. The (fruity-ripe) bergamot takes a backseat, and we are presented with a rose. A spicy rose. Similar to the big brother ""Arrogance Pour Homme,"" it is a long-stemmed pink rose here. Delicate and naturally fragrant. However, accompanied by a garden carnation, which - in interplay with the still (but not as strongly) present spices from the top note - slightly diminishes the feminine radiance of our ""Fleurop rose,"" making it appear more masculine. This masculine rose is surrounded by a light breeze of lily of the valley and jasmine. Just very lightly; it remains spicy-masculine.

And the base? Here comes the ""concentrated masculinity"" again: earthy oak moss and grassy vetiver steer this fragrance in a darker, more mysterious direction. Having initially taken a stroll through an autumn-spicy flower meadow, we have now definitively arrived in a dark forest. Warm and mysterious, it surrounds us. It is not the damp forest after a heavy rain shower. No, smoky cedarwood with a hint of mysterious patchouli gives this base an earthy, profound, and still spicy touch. Unlike in ""Arrogance Pour Homme,"" the patchouli plays at best a supporting role here, so that even those fragrance lovers who find the ""patchouli solo"" of the big brother too intense might find something to enjoy. Nevertheless, one must like spicy fragrances. Because: there is nothing fruity-sweet here. The dense treetops allow only a few sunbeams to reach the long-stemmed pink rose from the heart note. Instead, it is caressed by the comforting warmth of a warm (amber!) summer evening. The coconut indicated in the fragrance pyramid is very hard for me to perceive. If at all, it is fresh coconut shavings, caressed by a bit of leather. Thus, it is by no means a sticky-sweet praline. ""Arrogance Uomo"" is certainly not a gourmand.

My conclusion:
From its year of release (1987), this is a fragrance from the eighties. It is certainly not a close-contact whisperer. But by no means is it a loud powerhouse fragrance either. Rather, it is a dry, mysterious spice candidate. Everything is very finely and beautifully coordinated. Friends of fruity fragrances or even gourmands will probably not find much to enjoy here. ""Arrogance Uomo"" impresses more with its masculine -creamy-woven- spices, which are enriched in the heart note by a proud rose and in the base by deeply warm earthy aromas. Very beautifully and elegantly crafted. Personally, however, I prefer its big brother ""Arrogance Pour Homme"" in its uncompromisingly masculine style a bit more. But, one must like patchouli..."
Lush Getaway,02/23/2021,Minigolf,F,2512,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Bottle: Arrogantly Wobbly. Scent: a casually noble nose-tickler!,"Nope, I really don't place much value on the beauty of bottles! But it has to stand well! This one doesn't, as if it wants to arrogantly resist my good intentions of placing it freely next to its scent companions. Now it's ""wedged in,"" flanked by two sturdy ones. Serves it right! :-))
But the scent, which is what matters most to me, is in a class of its own! Instead of arrogance, it shows a casually jovial elegance. And it is very kind to my nose. It pampers it with herby fresh spice right from the first sniff. And it has much more to offer. A finely spiced floral heart, which it presents to me like a good friend. And a warm woody and grassy blanket that it kindly drapes over my shoulders. And it doesn't forget the mossy bed underneath.
And it has good manners too: It doesn't want to be a show-off with its scent accords. No one is so bold as to shout at me with ""loud-mouthed roaring."" It's a pleasant and fair conversation with a certain style. Nor is it a professor who wants to bore me with unnecessary technical knowledge. Everything is very clever and sensible. A round and slightly mischievous noble ""nose-tickler"" with genuinely friendly intentions!"
Lush Getaway,01/21/2019,Ursus,M,18,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Arrogant ??,"Fresh and spirited, yes, but easier to wear than its brother pour Homme.
A dry vetiver makes its presence known and, together with cedar, is the main actor.
The little floral notes in between make it all a
bit lighter.
Those who appreciate masculine, classic, expressive - vintage scents will surely find this one satisfying.
A fragrance with edges and corners that stands firm on both feet from start to finish.

Very strong sillage in the first hour. Longevity: after 8 hours it is still there.
Very nice to wear in summer at not overly hot temperatures.
Its AS is good."
Lush Getaway,06/18/2014,Cappellusman,M,358,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,"It's not that ""arrogant""...","... at least not nearly as arrogant as its ""brother,"" the patchouli burner, ""Arrogance pour Homme."" After a rather diffuse start, where you can't quite tell where the fragrance is headed, it becomes really beautifully floral and unobtrusive, indeed quite pleasant in the heart and especially in the base notes.

If I can trust the fragrance pyramid, this is likely due to the vetiver, which, while dominant in the drydown, never becomes too aggressive.

I can't quite follow the comparisons with Trussardi; the latter is clearly ""darker"" and more leather-heavy. ""Arrogance Uomo,"" however, is not that, yes, you could almost call it ""fresh.""

Overall, another successful Italian from the 80s that can definitely show its strengths, especially now in summer."
Lush Getaway,08/11/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,5,"Herbaceous, mossy-fresh spice","I recently got to know the very broadly standing ""Arrogance for men,"" which already has - in the animalistic sense - hair on its teeth and soapy testosterone in its blood.

With its successor, things are, as mentioned below, more leisurely. Mind you, in an 80s sense, because the ""Uomo"" is certainly a robust child of its time.

The first quarter of an hour doesn't appeal to me very much. A bit chaotic, a bit confusing, the fragrance hurls aldehydic spices and herbs through the room, especially too much strict-dry-nutty nutmeg, which I don't particularly like in fragrances anyway.

Then it becomes softer, more accessible: The rather herbaceous arranged flowers of the heart phase push themselves to the forefront, especially jasmine, dark-toned lily of the valley, and clove.

The aldehydes ""embrace"" the whole fragrance package quite smoothly, while increasingly a slightly scratchy-earthy, subtly smoky patchouli note emerges, heralding the base.

The coconut is, comparable to ""Santos de Cartier,"" more shell-like and sober than sweet, while it increasingly becomes oakmossy, slightly herbaceous-leathery, and softly cedarwood in the background.

A truly solid 80s fragrance, which is certainly more versatile than its predecessor. The latter, however, seems to me to be somewhat more creatively conceived. In the end, a tie."
Lush Getaway,08/28/2024,ActaNonVerba,M,85,,10,The Arrogant Charmer!,"Admittedly, I didn't come across this one on my own. In the context of my review of the big brother Arrogance Pour Homme, I was made aware of Uomo by the user Korinth. The Pour Homme is a rough character with animalic notes and a herbaceous, angular bouquet. A wonderful blast.

The smaller brother Uomo is far less harsh. Citrusy, herbal. Prototypical fougere-like. Right from the start. Lavender, geranium, wood, and moss. Slightly angular but very cuddly. Surrounds you like a fabric made of lightly floral and angular mossy elements.

The perfume can be worn for any occasion. No matter when and no matter where. In the summer heat, it might be a bit heavy. But other than that....

I miss a bit of the animalic, but this is compensated by the beautiful herbal combination.

For me, Uomo is a revelation and a hidden gem as a fougere fan. It really delivers. A bullseye.

The price is unbeatable. You don't need to spend a fortune on overpriced niche fragrances. There are still plenty of gems resting in the dusty drawers of the past. You just have to be willing to reach in there.

Uomo is one of the best fougeres for me. In the upcoming autumn, I will wear it more often.

Thanks again to Korinth for the tip."
Lush Getaway,09/15/2014,Rickthedog,M,50,,4,...which plagiarism?,"A U does not seem to me to smell like a plagiarism.
Certainly, finer noses than mine can judge better, but I cannot understand that A U is a copy of Trussardi Uomo '83. Coincidentally, I still have about 30 ml of T U '83 - and so I was able to compare.
A U definitely goes in that fragrance direction, but it has its own place. I became curious due to the comments here and got myself 30 ml (yes, sometimes I am brave...) and was not disappointed, even though my hope was to get a good copy of T U.
A U somehow fits me like a lid on a pot.
It is not intrusive, as was more common in the eighties, but rather subtle.
The purchase was definitely not money wasted for me. I just find it great, without being able to evaluate it according to the fragrance pyramid and elements - maybe I will be able to do that one day.
So all I can say is:
Yes, the Arrogant is delicious and will be one of my staple fragrances! It's a pity that it seems to be available in Germany only in the 30 ml version right now..."
Lush Getaway,07/19/2024,Henriquatre,M,25,,7,A Fragrance Between Worlds,"Awesome stuff, I thought a few weeks ago... at first not. Because I got the concentrated arrogance at the same time, and the older brother, Arrogance pour Homme EAU DE TOILETTE is an old-school men's fragrance in the best sense and in an elegant bottle, a masculine and distinctive herbal water of its time, resembling some of its contemporaries, labeled as a grandpa scent by some modern peers. I like it, even though I hope that becoming a grandpa (although biologically possible) will still take a few years. But I digress...

So: The Arrogance pour Homme EAU DE TOILETTE immediately revealed itself to me in its tried-and-true nature. But the Arrogance Uomo EAU DE TOILETTE, its only a few years younger brother, initially left me puzzled. WHAT IS THIS? A wobbly hard plastic bottle with a seam and pseudo-leather marbling. Hiss! Lavender and bergamot are, typically old-school, still right up front. I still don't know what nutmeg flower smells like, sorry community. Unlike the ""green"" brother, the cheeky rascal quickly veers into, I would say, blue-floral, yet spicy, while also slightly synthetic realms. There’s so much in it, I can’t really describe it adequately. (And keep your base notes like ""leather"" and ""oak moss"" away from me! If only the world / a fragrance were that simple, especially when it comes to the end.)

I see the 1987 Arrogance Uomo EAU DE TOILETTE as a perfectly successful art product of a transitional period. We’re talking about the late 80s, the sweet wave of men's fragrances was still far away, Jaguar was still green, Adidas still herbal, and the apple scents of the 90s like Boss Bottled EAU DE TOILETTE were still a long way off. In this time, when a change of eras might have already been in the air (don’t ask me, I was still in kindergarten), someone here subtly picked up the old and prepared some new things. Today, it could easily pass as ""niche."" But it still exists. Hats off!

And the bottle... is the ugliest in my possession. This was probably also a (un)subtle signal towards consumer criticism. Hey, it’s what’s inside that counts. And you can easily drop this plastic monster from 2 meters onto the tiled floor. That immediately bumps it up by 3 stars. So that makes 4."
Lush Getaway,08/30/2025,ShaunBaker,M,103,,1,Too Late,"As it always is with fragrances that are nearing the 40-year mark or have already surpassed it. The scent still has the same name, and the bottle may still look the same, but often the font or placement of the perfume name changes, and from that point on, you automatically know: Something has happened to the fragrance.

This is also the case with Arrogance Uomo. The bottle has changed, the ""Uomo"" has shifted to the right under Arrogance, and the fragrance has been ""adjusted.""

Arrogance Uomo didn't last forever in the past either, but from now on, you have to prepare for about 15 minutes of top notes still reminiscent of an old Italian classic on the skin, and the remaining 2-3 hours will be a skin-close scent. The fragrance from the bottle shown here definitely offered a bit more.

What has changed less, and I must commendably say, is the scent itself.
Spicy herbal notes and a hint of soapiness at the beginning still fit.
Once the notes have settled, Arrogance Uomo lives on clove, geranium, oakmoss, and vetiver. It's kept very green and spicy, and still olfactorily transports you to Mediterranean realms, albeit unfortunately only on a low flame. As is often the case, I missed the chance to secure a large vintage bottle back then. Now I have to make do with the new version. At least I still have vintage deodorant, which lasts longer than the current EdT."
Superworld Unknown,09/18/2024,Engar,M,13,,1,Luscious floral with a little bit of oud,"Trifecta Lotus Oud by Kannauj Perfumery is a rich, exotic and captivating floral with three varieties of lotus and strong Hindi oud. An all-natural blend with high quality ingredients that give the perfume a luxurious feel.

A blend of pink, blue and white lotus masterfully blended in the traditional attar making process makes TLO a delightful experience. Lavender adds a fresh touch to balance the richness of the fragrance.

Over time, the fragrance doesn't evolve, but I find this to be a strength given its beauty. In the end, TLO leaves a lingering scent of lotus and oud on the skin. It's a testament to the power of natural ingredients and the skill of the perfumer.

A 2% Hindi Oud gives TLO a very good longevity and projection, the fragrance bubble stays for 8-10 hours with 4-5 sprays with medium projection up to 4 hours.

TLO jumps into my favourite floral scent, along with ALD Ottoman Empire, and 1 of my top 10 scents.

This is my first encounter with a lotus-based fragrance, but it won't be the last."
Two Hearts Beating as One,10/30/2020,Cravache,M,64,,0,Familiarity and the Evening Essence of the Day Experienced,"I have been in touch with the olfactory treasures of the West since my early youth. A youthful key experience was a lengthy personal conversation with Jean-Paul Guerlain. Another key experience I had about 8 years ago: the discovery of the fragrances from Hind al Oud in Dubai. While high-priced perfumes from the Arab world generally orient themselves entirely or largely to the European (or rather specifically to the French) perfume tradition, the inexpensive and often also the mid-priced fragrances from this region are unfortunately mostly of rather mediocre quality. And often anything but an olfactory revelation.

Hind al Oud confidently aligns itself with the craftsmanship of Arab perfumery, without compromising on quality. For European noses, the scents are undoubtedly unfamiliar, foreign, surprising, fascinating, exciting - comparable to the first reading of the Epic of Gilgamesh. If one allows oneself to be seduced by the olfactory treasures of Arab fragrance culture, letting go of the prejudiced notion of the olfactory Orient, one is rewarded with a wonderful broadening of horizons into a region that is also the cradle of our Western-European (fragrance) culture.

Na'em Al Oud evokes images of a vast cow pasture where one would like to rest. Surrounded by fragrant wide meadows in rich summer flower colors, the eternal snow of the alpine peaks on the horizon, the sky a deep blue. Until recently, majestic brown cows and a few rabbits grazed on the pasture. One sits in evening attire or tuxedo on a sunny day, relaxed at the edge of the warm and summery cow pasture. The scent of an old, flower-adorned, magnificent Emmental farmhouse, whose wood tells the story of generations. The sun warms the face, the hair, the meadow, the old dark brown wood of the farmhouse. The scent of wood, the meadow, the cows, and the flowers cuddles one into the summery warmth of the pre-Alpine nature.

If one likes this direction of Oud, they will find Na'em Al Oud very appealing. In this kind of warm Oud resides the magic of love. If one does not like such Oud, they will perceive the scent as repulsive, like an involuntary bath in cow dung. The perfumer of Na'em Al Oud must be an animal lover - or a friend of animalistic persons (did the Minotaur have a cow-eyed sister?). Those who work in an open-plan office or wish to be nibbled by a vegetarian should probably not use Na'em Al Oud.

The body-warm, animalistic Oud note is the red thread throughout the fragrance journey. Na'em Al Oud starts warm and spicy. Black pepper emphasizes the pleasantly stimulating, animalistic note of the Oud upon application. When the pepper has dissipated in the summer air after a few minutes, the fragrance develops in a fresh-spicy direction (saffron, fruity like kiss-red lips). Musk quickly joins in.

At the beginning of the fragrance journey, the musk is noticeably more animalistic, without drifting into a Mephistophelian animality. The musk forms the bridge to the typically Arab floral notes: A red rose with animalistic aspects and a few lustful body parts, as well as jasmine - elegant, warm, sensual, with light hay notes. Jasmine has not yet showered; the skin and hair smell of a mixture of familiarity and the evening essence of the day experienced. She sits in a dark evening dress on the large white musk bed. Between her lips, she has a few black berries. One tries to steal the berries with their lips.

Towards the base, Na'em Al Oud becomes warmer, woodier, and earthier - which emphasizes the animalistic Oud note a bit more strongly again. The erotic ""usable area"" of Na'em Al Oud is considerable: the perfume oil lasts forever on the skin, and the sillage is strong."
Lush Noir,09/17/2023,Minigolf,F,2512,,1,Bittersweet Autumn Approaches!,"A beautiful fragrance is a must. One that captures the lingering summer, projects the ""golden October,"" and announces both sunny and cooler days with morning fog.
Beginning with the warm-golden sun, several citrus fruits make their appearance. Very soon, spices emerge, aromatic, dark green, somewhat resinous. Cardamom is a key player in this scent. Also, the wonderfully herbaceous-floral rosemary, whose small stiff leaves release their typical aroma upon touch.
Another ""highlight"" is the fine incense that lies like the first fog over everything. And the grassy-earthy vetiver, which seems to mimic the scents of fresh autumn leaves. Of course, we must not forget the oak moss, whose inky forest aroma puts everything into a slightly melancholic mood. A ""bittersweet golden autumn"" in a bottle. Subtle, yet profound. No ""monster sillage,"" but perceptible for a long time. In the end, powdery, bitter aromas swirl around the nose and spirit like delicate veils of mist. A true scent of relaxation! :-))"
All is Full of Love,12/05/2024,DogiCoco,F,637,,1,Pink bubble gum and powder,"This is a sweet, girly, very pink smelling floral gourmand. It doesn't smell like cotton candy to me, more like bubble gum or soft, chewy candies. I don't get the crunchy, freshly caramelized sugar note that cotton candy has, the sweetness here is creamier.
Besides that, I can detect a lot of fizzy citrus and a sweet, raspberry-esque rose.
The opening smells a little vintage-like and alcoholic for the very first moment, but it's not impossible that this is due to the age of my sample.
Then the scent turns sweeter quickly. In the drydown it even becomes a little powdery, with lots of vanilla and white musk as a base.

At this point, when most of the grapefruit has burned off, it really smells like I imagine a opening a glass bowl full of creamy caramel candies and pink bubblegum would smell like, with a little clean powder on top of that.

So far, the few other fragrances I tried from 4160 all felt kind of homemade, typically indie to me. This one smells a little smoother and more ""professionally made"" (for the lack of a better word). Not like a designer scent, but closer to that.

Since it is a spicy-woody scent like Homme, it is intended for the autumn or winter months."
Lush pour Homme,09/16/2025,ComputerMaus,M,264,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Quite a Diverse Ground Biom,"Air, Sea, Land - The ASL series aims to cover the classic ""elements,"" although it forgets about fire, but with 4 bottles, it wouldn't have worked so well with the Mercedes star anyway.
Considering the thematic template, Land would certainly have been the easiest olfactory representation to implement. Earthy notes have existed for decades, if not centuries, and a bit of green here and wood there would have surely completed the conceptual basis. Surprisingly, however, Land is the scent that most closely dedicates itself to its theme in a nearly niche manner (don’t worry or get false hopes: ultimately, it is still a designer). Instead of classically blending patchouli and vetiver with resins (labdanum, styrax) and the darkest woods (guaiac), it opts for a softly powdery iris (little root, much lipstick), balsamic-woody fir, light freshness from geranium and rosemary, along with spicy pepper and a touch of patch for the aromatic-earthy aspect.
So, is it land under? No, the scent stands on its own even when it doesn't quite meet expectations.

A minimal sweetness is realized through tonka bean, while the actually subtle cocoa nicely rounds off much in the background, taking the unpleasant edge off the synthetic rosemary and preventing the woodiness from drying out. Without it and the geranium, Land would likely have become more niche, but in the designer sector, you need gently binding elements to ensure sufficient mass appeal. That doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing; sometimes it’s just nice to smell socially acceptable. And as Käse has already written in their statement: Land is quite unisex.

In terms of price, however, the country egg could have done a bit more. Solid sillage, lasting about 2½ hours - that’s okay. But only 4 to 5 hours until it’s close to the skin? More is needed there. That affects the price-performance ratio.

Land is somewhat different from the usual iris representatives (very distant similarity to Dior Homme Original (2011) EAU DE TOILETTE) and only partially touches on the theme, but convinces me precisely because it is not too ordinary, yet still typically designer everyday wearable."
Lush pour Homme,08/21/2023,RAT6EBER,M,73,,1,Land of the Ephemeral Iris with Ginseng Hint and Muted Patch Note on a Synthetic Base,"Since I started testing perfumes intensively, around 2021, I have been longing for one that smells something like the first 20 minutes of this one. An earthy, ginseng root-like direction, for example, through patchouli, iris, and pepper. Cocoa and tonka might also add something good to it. Unfortunately, this land loses its earthiness after 40 minutes and evaporates into floral and wine cask notes (slightly boozy?).
What a shame, just barely missing a perfectly beautiful scent or just passing by briefly. So, for the rooty iris impression that I love, I still have to keep returning to my Saffron&Iris from 4711, even though it is so airy, and I still wish for something earthier and spicier. DHI also captures it quite well at first, but then you drown in vanilla. Maybe I should try a ginseng perfume after all. Otherwise, it can be said about Land that it ends up leathery after 40 minutes. I would need to test it a few more times to say whether the synthetic sweaty floral base bothers me, which I almost fear will be annoying. By the way, the perfume is relatively weak overall. But for a budget option, Land would definitely be in my collection."

I find this fragrance to be very feminine, sensual, sexy, and breathtakingly beautiful. Due to the vanilla and musk, it exudes a cozy warmth and comfort. Perfect for this time of year when the weather outside is cold and dreary, and perhaps a fire is burning in the fireplace while you cuddle together on the sofa, simply enjoying each other's company and experiencing a wonderful moment of happiness.

Potion,02/06/2013,ParfumAholic,M,257,,25,Lady Fragrance,"After being completely enchanted by ""Ambre Sublime"" from Stendhal, which has of course long since found a place in my collection, I was curious to see what else Stendhal has to offer.

So here we have ""Elixir Blanc"". The opening is relatively fresh, with the delicious cherry blossom and angelica primarily filling my nose. The pink pepper tickles a bit, but it doesn't disturb.
Slowly, Madame Rose and iris join in. The rose is a very refined lady, somewhat reserved, yet still present. The iris quickly gives the fragrance a pleasantly powdery touch, which it retains even after hours.
Then the base notes spread out quickly, primarily sandalwood, vanilla, and musk. However, they do not overpower the rose; rather, they lay beneath it to support its noble scent.
I only notice the cedar at the very end, but its woodiness is not as pronounced as in some other fragrances.
What remains? A super elegant mix of rose, vanilla, musk, and woods. I know that perfumes cannot be ""delicious,"" but I can't think of a better adjective for this one.

All in all, I find this more than balanced fragrance to be very elegant and feminine.
It is cozy, subtly sexy, clean, not sweet, rather close to the skin and unobtrusive.
In terms of quality, I would classify it as top-tier; its longevity is astonishing (the few drops from last night I could still faintly smell this morning after waking up), and I perceive the bottle as a true reflection of the fragrance: exclusivity inside and out.

Since the white elixir is a bit too feminine for me, I will (admittedly with a heavy heart) not use it for myself.

So I will have 10ml left over ;-))"
Prince,11/03/2025,Kerkyra74,F,669,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,I hardly dare to say it,"....aaaaaber So lost in you clearly appeals to me more than Musk Therrapy....and why? It’s not so piercing..it’s blackcurrant/creamy mandarin. The fruity clean girl scent! Not soapy, no lavender or pepper. Fruity, creamy, just clean. In the opening, the juicy blackcurrant, mandarin falls into musk cream, bam, this is where I like it best. Those who compare too much with Musk Therrapy or expect something along those lines will find the opening too sweet. Please be patient for a few minutes. If Mont Blanc Signature is too scratchy, Musk Therrapy too expensive, and S.oliver, I think White Seduction too weak and bland, then this candidate is worth testing. By the way, no biting lily of the valley. For me, the sweet mandarin is the note that dominates the most. I’m already looking forward to when my bottle arrives. In my olfactory world, wearable all year round."
Grass,07/22/2025,Mo3366,M,3,,1,Interesting and challenging,"This is a funny one because I am a huuuge fan of AEOOJ, and there are some similarities, but where I find AEOOJ ""dry,"" this one is ""wet."" Where AEOOJ conjures a sun baked open road, this has a musty-ness, like an overgrown barn. It's largely pleasurable, but there is one note that turns me off. I am not sure what it is. Maybe Civet? idk."
Grass,06/24/2025,needlefx,N/A,9,,1,Rats in the hay shed (Positive),"I'm not one for writing reviews but my experience with Caji seems quite different to others so I thought I'd share. It may be my skin, or my nose struggling with top notes or my inexperience, but I did not perceive this as a ""fresh green"" foin coupe at all. I didn't even realize it was supposed to have a cucumber note since I had read a summary of the description that only mentions the hay, jasmine, orris, and civet.

When I sprayed this, I certainly smelled hay- but not green nor fresh. I seem to have skipped most of the top notes and didn't get jasmine or cucumber. I smelled hay, and ANIMALS. Then vanilla came through gently over time. I honestly enjoyed it and it was very familiar and comforting to me, but I couldn't put my finger on it.

After some thoughts, I've concluded that it smells akin to the rodent section at a pet store (but don't turn your nose up at this!). Like a room full of bunnies and their feed, or picking up and sniffing your beloved pet ferret or rat. Dried hay-like, warm, and sweet, but just also a bit ammonia-like and dirty. But in a good way (to me). I think the civet is front-and-center for me, unlike it seems to be with other reviewers.

I really enjoy it, but the way it smells on me might not be the most pleasing to others, so I'm unsure when I would wear it. Will be returning to it with a fresher nose to attempt to find those top notes eventually."
Grass,12/30/2023,Floomf,M,5,,2,"Expansive, gentle hay on a cloudy afternoon","When I saw that Chris Rusak was releasing a foin coupe I got so hyped. I love grass/hay scents. After the notes and description were released I was nervous - so much jasmine and civet, notes that I'm typically _very_ wary of. I shouldn't have doubted. It's great.

It opens with an expansive green, wet, fresh-cut lawn scent with a vague rooty undertone that leans suede/rubber or wax (orris?). My initial notes described it as ""grass stains on new white sneakers"". My nose is not particularly adroit, so I don't really get the cucumber or violet leaf in the published description, but i suspect the cucumber is what lends the vague watery accord. It's incredibly reminiscent to me of sitting on this athletic field of artificial turf during and after the lockdowns in summer of 2020. It's gentle, relaxed, unhurried - not things I associate with the pandemic itself but with the brief respite given by sprawling on the grass in the sun outside in the late spring with all the fear and chaos a safe distance away.

As it settles, the grass starts to dry out - the suede/rubber becomes a little more noticeable and the more watery accords of the top notes fade, transforming the fresh mown lawn grass into something much more hay-like and wildflower. It stays airy and expansive, with soft green powdery pollen and the waxy/rubbery note wavering on the edge of some kind of heady solvent, like fuel for a mower or oiled tools in a shed.

In the drydown, it becomes reminiscent of the base of AEOOJ. The rubbery/suede/waxy note fully transforms from rooty to solvent, mixing with a difficult-to-pinpoint musk. It lays close and light on my skin as a musky heady-aromatic floral, with the barest touch of hay. I don't notice the vanilla from the published description, and the ""extreme dose"" of civet stays very soft and subtle (at least to my nose). But perhaps I'm anosmic at this point?

After another hour or two later the airy rubbery accord disappears and in its place the musky suede is all that (barely) remains. It's animalic in a warm-fur-and-skin way, kinda like huffing the scruff of my cat or my friend's ferret. Fuzzy, comforting and pleasant.

Projection is good. It's no nostril-blasting nuke, but it develops an effective bubble. Longevity is low-moderate - it's down to a subtle skin scent after about 4-5 hours.

The PR copy says ""Caji is a contemplative perfume, the sort of pleasure perfect for a day of inclement weather spent indoors, relaxing in comfort."". Today's a rainy, unseasonably warm day for December and I agree it suits the mood well. It's a gentle scent, overcast without being lugubrious. Also: my neighbor's cat loves it too! Must be the civet."
Honey I Washed the Kids,12/09/2013,Madkat,F,53,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Melon and Lily delight,"Another green that I can wear without it turning into a sour sweat smell on my acidic skin.. I normally stay away from green but this is a melon green, not a leaf or grass green..

I mainly get an aquatic melon with lily of valley, ylang ylang and jasmine.. the peach, rose, and sandalwood lay quietly in the background. I get a hint of the rhubarb but I'm not finding spices or vetivier in it.

Sillage is very good and it lasts over 6 hrs which is also very good on me.

I personally do not care that much for the bottles especially since this diamond line all look basically the same.. I painted a strip of nail polish around the 'studded' section in order to tell them apart faster, too bad they didnt put a couple red/green/blue rhinestones there in the first place"
Honey I Washed the Kids,08/05/2012,Awesomeness,M,247,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Better in Vintage,"D&S wears great on paper, not on me. The mix of florals (jasmine, lov, freesia) is headache & asthma inducing. It's very strong for an EDT, even with a light hand. I like it but can only wear it on clothing or scarves. It's a contemporary bottle that looks as pictured.

I've since tested Boucheron Jaipur & Boucheron Jaipur Saphir. To me, ET Diamonds & Sapphires is similar in scent, but not quality, to these 2 Boucherons.

UPDATE: I've acquired a small vintage bottle in EDP formulation, in a solid gold canister with simulated diamonds. What a difference this makes! The vintage version a much more wearable and better quality. It's just enough to change my rating from neutral-minus to neutral-plus.

White Diamonds and Black Pearls are also ET fragrances that are better in vintage."
Honey I Washed the Kids,07/07/2012,LadyRogue,F,166,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Lily Of The Valley Bomb.,"I saw an interview once with Mrs Taylor in which she explains why she wanted to make perfumes. Apparently, all the perfumes she tried she didn't like, plus a lot of perfumes smelled alike to her and she ended up layering several perfumes to get one scent she would like. Somewhat recognizing this complaint, this story sounded interesting to me. So much so, that when I saw ""Diamonds & Rubies"" and ""Diamonds & Sapphires"" for a bargain price I decided to take the risk and -blindly- purchased both.
Well, The bottles are very pretty, they remind me of her jewelry penchant (I think that is the point).
I sniffed ""Diamonds & Rubies"" and can say: it's a pleasant and warm oriental that I shall be wearing one day; I just haven't found the right mood for it yet.
""Diamonds & Sapphires"" is another story, I sniffed it and almost got a headache! Lily of the valley, that is ALL I smell! And not in a small amount either! I guess it's a perfume that one only uses one spray of or walk through the mist after spraying it in the room. Any other form of applying is -for me- too much lily. I have it stored and am undecided about it. But just the other day I saw ""Diamonds & Emeralds"" for a bargain price (all these are 100ML!) Shall I succumb and purchase? For these bargain priced perfumes they never offer a tester. Hmmm

Darling Elizabeth, I am not afraid of Virginia Woolf, but your Lily is scary! x.x.x"
Honey I Washed the Kids,10/30/2025,Martelle,F,29,,1,Mix of flowers.,"It’s become a bit of a quest for me as I have grown really curious about old perfumes that were created long ago. So I bought this one from this great actress, and what I liked the most is the bottle :) The perfume itself is quite nice but very-very flowery and, to my taste, a bit suffocating. Definitely a granny’s perfume, sorry :))"
Honey I Washed the Kids,02/26/2011,Medusa00,F,841,,17,Willful and Beautiful,"I want to start by saying that this fragrance is not sweet at all and that fans of sweet floral or candy scents will not find what they are looking for. While there are plenty of floral accords, they come from candidates that are not particularly sweet in nature. Diamonds and Sapphires is not even powdery or just with a hint.

A sparkling, cool, faceted beauty from the house of Taylor (or rather, Arden).

The opening has a slight prick in the nose, and I am glad that the lily of the valley does not dominate, although it is clearly perceptible. Freesia is also not the sweetest of flowers. This is fully intentional and immediately conveys the purpose of this perfume. Beautiful, cool (but NOT cold) and willful.

Throughout, there are occasional similarities to White Diamonds, but this one is brighter and more radiant. Diamonds and Sapphires is a bit darker, but no less intense. The rhubarb (also a funny ingredient) really ensures that a small biting acidity remains. But I think it is meant to keep this willful note intact.

The base becomes a bit softer, with no trace of vanilla coziness.

A completely ""non-cozy"" fragrance, beautiful, but creaky and somewhat rough. Not suitable for winter."

Honey I Washed the Kids,03/20/2022,Minigolf,F,2512,,17,Little Fuss about Much Green!,"I am surprised that there are not more reviews and statements about this ""May scent."" After all, it radiates a lot of freshness and floral beauty, making it a joy to sniff.
Everything wintry falls away, allowing the sometimes quite cool, sometimes quite warm spring air to flow freely. And all of this is wrapped in much green and bright blossoms. Nothing sticky-sweet emanates from it. Nothing oppressively heavy.
And yet it is substantial! Brimming with bitter lily of the valley, delicate freesia, a bit of rose, and... probably also quite a bit of galbanum, which brings in that slightly bitter-spicy note. The green of fresh leaves, the green of a bright birch grove.
And a slightly green woodiness that forms the solid base of the fragrance. No fuss with a lot of frills, just bright and clear. And with a certain ""knowing"" elegance that only a few fragrances possess. These diamonds and sapphires radiate clarity. And their ""setting"" is made of simple silver. The ""ornaments"" are formed by the fragrance itself. It doesn’t need much ""fuss"" around it. Because it is already such a one in green and bitter-floral!"
Honey I Washed the Kids,04/10/2016,Serafina,F,479,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Sparkling Cool Elegance,"One thing first: I only have a miniature of this fragrance, but in the Extrait concentration. It may be that the current EDT is different or at least weaker. Also regarding reformulation, my comment refers to the original version. My copy, purchased in the mid-90s, has a distinctly orange tint, but is olfactorily intact.

This fragrance feels very opulent and intense on me. A few drops are enough. It is floral-heavy, yet simultaneously radiates a cool elegance. In this regard, it is somewhat similar to ""Eternity,"" which I like less than D&S. I envision a dark-haired woman in an elegant blue evening gown, adorned with a sparkling silver rhinestone necklace (after all, hardly anyone can afford real gems with diamonds and sapphires in noticeable sizes...). Yes, it would have suited the beautiful Liz! Although she probably wore different perfumes during her lifetime than those marketed under her name. She also had the matching (real) jewelry in her legendary collection...

I like to bring out the small bottle on a spring evening, even if there is no occasion for an evening gown."

Lush bouquets of flowers waft around my nose, with a pleasant greenish undertone.
The stems are included here.

On my skin, it develops slightly soapy and sweet, without losing its brightness.
Could it be the freesia and jasmine that make it shine?
In any case, the gemstone theme is well executed.
Musk makes it sparkle again, and sandalwood makes it beautifully cuddly.

Ginger,08/12/2013,Malte93,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Pleasant Youth Fragrance,"This is my first comment. I'm just going to write freely.

The perfume from BB About Men is the first one I used because it was a gift for my 16th birthday.

The scent of BB is not intrusive, but still subtle. For my age back then, it was actually just right. The fragrance is very fresh and spicy. The fruity top note and the heart note are in a very refreshing combination with each other.

Unlike with big fragrances like Terre d'Hermès, for example, from my ex ""Ew, you stink!"", the reactions to this perfume have always been positive.
Today, I like to wear About Men in my simple everyday life, like at work. However, I find the longevity quite short, as I can no longer perceive the scent on my skin after a good 5 hours.

For the price, I think there is nothing to complain about with this perfume. :) Therefore, I recommend it especially for young beginners or for simple everyday use."
Ginger,07/03/2012,Leimbacher,M,2870,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Apple Memories,"I wanted to test some perfumes at Mallach, but the saleswoman seemed to be on an extended lunch break, so an alternative had to be found... off to DM and tested some ""cheap perfumes""... why not...
With all my might, I tried to push aside the price, the brand, and the environment, focusing solely on the scent qualities... but unfortunately, I have to say that you always have in the back of your mind that the fragrances there don't carry the big names... how easily influenced I (and certainly most others) am :-(

Bruno Banani About Men was the second perfume I tested on my skin there... first impression: strong, unique, extremely sweet, fruity... what is this? Pear, banana, or apple? After a few minutes, I settled on the latter, and it smells like this for a long time... a chic, noble, oriental, fresh, intense, interesting apple...
After a few minutes, I realized that I knew this scent from somewhere... I went through in my head which big name could be a scent twin? But no, I couldn't think of anyone, and then I remembered where I knew the scent from: I must have worn it before, yes, even owned it!
I started collecting perfumes half a year ago, before that I wore One Million, before that Cool Water, and before that... I think just Axe or something^^ I was still a teenager/child, but I must have received this scent as a gift from my mother during my youth, otherwise, this scent memory cannot be explained^^ I absolutely could not remember the inconspicuous, more than boring bottle (rightly so!).

The scent, however, is far better than the bottle, but due to its sweetness and uniqueness, it is difficult to categorize and wear... my poor classmates in middle school, when I wore this every day back then, that must have been a bit much^^
The sillage was really good for me yesterday, but maybe only because I concentrated so intensely on the smell... longevity also top. At a level where you wish for every scent (8 hours!).
In the drydown, it develops away from the sweet apple towards the beautiful tonka bean.

All in all, a good scent from BB, I think maybe even the best... clear line, not such a mishmash like many other BB scents! Still, my nose (+ my brain) has simply gotten used to other scent levels...
+10 nostalgia % ;-)"
Ginger,02/24/2014,KleineKiwi,F,12,,4,Subtle and Light,"My boyfriend uses it and I really like it.

It smells masculine without being too strong or overpowering. Strangely, I mostly smell the floral heart note very strongly in About Men. Nevertheless, I can confidently recommend this fragrance to any man.

In my opinion, the sillage is also longer-lasting than most men perceive. I can still smell it on my favorite wearer hours later ;)"
Ginger,07/02/2023,Xenophilius,M,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,2,A Final Farewell,"Of all my ""nice"" drugstore perfumes that I owned during school, only two are still available for purchase, namely Mexx Man (Meh!) and this one - now also off the market, but still obtainable. Out of sheer nostalgia, I decided to go for it - and I didn’t let the endearing product name ""Toilet Water"" on the re-import deter me. And since I can't help but share my two cents, here’s an obituary:

""We have gathered here to bid farewell to you, our brother Bruno. Born as the son of a lingerie manufacturer and a chemistry lab technician, you grew up in modest circumstances. In your childhood, you were truly sweet; people who knew you described round, red paradise apple cheeks.

You never sought the big stage, always remaining humble, inconspicuous, calm, and friendly. Yet your closest friends always appreciated you! You were the coolest member of the chess club and the uncoolest member of the prom committee. Far too soon, you leave us now. Ashes to ashes, tonka bean to tonka bean!”

In plain terms: I used to really like this scent, but now I’m somewhat disappointed due to its really poor performance on me - you have to spray a lot to get anything out of it, and you can repeat the process after 3 hours! I also don’t think it’s due to an old bottle.

The scent itself may be strongly synthetic and too simple for the local, niche-fragrance-spoiled audience - in its ecological niche of youth fragrances, it can certainly be positively mentioned - absolutely not an overt shower gel freshie, and just as little an overly sweet calorie bomb, a scent that shouldn’t really offend anyone and that I honestly don’t find difficult to wear, yet it still has something quite unique. At the start, a very sweet apple, later a mild-spicy clean man scent with dominant tonka bean. From the heart note with the indicated flowers, I hardly perceive anything.

The bottle inevitably makes me think of the Titanic... even though in the 30ml version there is at least no risk of tipping over, it’s just not beautiful. Nevertheless, it can happily remain as a guilty pleasure at the back of the shelf."
Ginger,04/05/2010,Nw1990,M,66,,5,Not suitable for everyone,"About Men is for me a perfect men's fragrance if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a rather heavy but truly great scent.

Lush,06/29/2013,Coutureguru,M,237,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Love at First Sniff ...,"I fell in love again today ... with yet another of the many faces that the beautiful Rose presents. Having been after trying this fragrance for the longest time I finally made the hour long drive to my nearest niche outlet and this 'Rosebud' has captivated and enchanted me.

Adding to the pleasure, this fragrance was on seasonal markdown so I immediately bought one of the three left in the store. This appears to have been a fatal mistake ... I should have bought the lot, an oversight I intend on correcting as soon as possible.
Bouton de Rose opens with a tart blast of Cranberry, quickly followed by a delectable surge of green ... definitely the Papyrus. What follows is the beautiful intensity of a naturally grown rosebud about to burst into flower, still clinging to it's green bits but with the promise of heavenly sweetness, cleverly provided in this blend by the addition of Freesia and Peony. There are subtle hints of white florals too in the smallest amounts of Jasmine and Tuberose, as if adding their soft whispers to this budding voice from another corner of the garden ... paying homage to the Queen about to be born.
The dry down of Bouton de Rose is simply wonderful ... the woody earthiness of Frankincense and the resinoid Amber softly recalling sap and freshly turned, damp soil with a fungal, mushroomy touch.
I've seen on other fora that this fragrance is classified as a feminine. I beg to differ ... with Roses for men like ""Declaration d'Un Soir"", ""Twill Rose"" and ""Rosissimo"" on the market, there is no reason that Bouton de Rose cannot be worn successfully by either gender.

This creation by Le Prince Jardinier has skyrocketed to a place in my top 5 all time favorite Rose fragrances. It will definitely be a staple in my rotation."
Lush,02/26/2015,Florblanca,F,1168,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Pink Rosebuds,"Bouton de Rose - the rosebud - is an interesting rose scent. Yes, you should like rose fragrances to wear it, and yes, it can definitely be worn by the male faction as well.

Bouton de Rose does not correspond to what I would have expected from the garden prince. It is actually just a bud and a bright rose at that. Pink, white, or very delicate light yellow. The scent starts fruity-fresh and it takes a little while for the flowers to develop.

The rosebud does not smell alone; many delicate little flowers surround it and give it volume. I feel transported to an English rose garden, where the roses have not yet fully bloomed, but they are already showing their colorful buds and conveying their delicate scent.

Initially quite sweet, the sweetness gradually diminishes and the scent becomes clearer and finer. Up to the base, Bouton de Rose is extremely subtle and close to the skin. Longevity is so-so, it could be better. For the original retail price, I would not buy the scent, as the longevity is too poor. However, since I got it very cheaply on the bay, I will gladly use it and probably finish it faster than my other rose fragrances.

The LPJ EdTs are no longer available on the LPJ website and are sold out at most perfumeries. So it could be that they might disappear from the market in the foreseeable future. Where available, the prices are significantly reduced, making a purchase definitely worthwhile."

I like fresh scents anyway, and with mint, I was excited.
Now I'm just recovering from the remnants of my cold, yet I could smell enough to clearly say that this scent is a real stinker for me.
I feel like I'm being suffocated by the rose scent.
I don't find it fresh at all; I smell something sharp and this dominant rose fragrance.
I washed it off right away, which says it all."
Lush,08/26/2014,Asphaltblume,F,133,,2,Tea and Rhubarb in the Rose Garden,"I initially thought Diamond Sparkle was a sweet rose scent after the sniff & scratch test on the cellophane packaging and decided to take it with me. There were no testers available.
Unfortunately.
Because what I smelled after spraying it was more robust tea and sour notes of rhubarb and tart citrus fruits than rose, and certainly not sweet rose.
The development was ultimately reconciliatory, as over time the rose comes to the forefront, and the scent becomes sweeter as well. However, it is a type of sweetness that I perceive as rather crystalline and angular, not a soft, gentle sweetness. When I was little, I enjoyed dipping raw, peeled rhubarb stalks in crystal sugar and eating them, and this scent reminds me of that. Intense acidity meets intense sweetness, and it crunches and crackles wonderfully.
But even this angular sweetness becomes a bit softer over time, and the acidity noticeably diminishes. Then the tireless strong tea and the roses dominate.
In the dry down, slightly woody notes make themselves known, and the overall impression becomes softer and rounder.
This scent is not very long-lasting; after five or six hours, I have to get very close to my wrist with my nose to smell anything."
Lush,07/14/2014,Nochoi,F,39,,2,Mud Fruit for Rose Cultivation,"I recently snagged a bottle for about 9.00 EUR at REWE in the Tchibo corner. Actually, I didn't like it that much when it came out last year, but now there was no tester, and for the price, I didn't want to leave it behind.

At first, it's very intense. I usually like strong scents, but this one is already heavily overdone with just two sprays, at least when it's over 20 degrees. I keep smelling something like roses with berries and pepper rising from my wrists. Even now, here at the computer, and after more than 6 hours, the scent is still wafting up to my nose. It has also clung to the sleeves of my jacket; hopefully, that will fade...

Unfortunately, it doesn't remind me of Nivea at all, unlike Lissy, and it doesn't come off as powdery to me either. See the title, I don't want to say much more about it. The only other thing that comes to mind in this context is mothballs.

Really a shame, maybe it just doesn't handle the heat well?

into a perfect niveous note and envelops with a gentle powderiness.

Fragrance where have you been! A limited special edition???
This is a masterpiece in liquid form.
And another edition is urgently requested.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PSSSSST: Attention folks, 4711 Wunderwasser Women has sneaked up on Sparkle."
Brightside,11/10/2025,Shadows444,F,86,,1,Pool Worthy,"Oui opens with some bright and sugary fruit, lots of citrus, but the pineapple is fairly easy to spot too. It's very, very uplifting. Fresh fragrances are either a relief in hot weather, or they're a transporting relief in cooler months. Either way, this is no exception.

It settles into a shampoo-y and floral scent, familiar and summery. Orange blossom goes white well with citrus IMO, but this isn't noticeably *orange blossom*...it's just a malange of white florals.

It's aquatic, it feels quenching and wet. I kept thinking of how I would wear this to the pool as I smelled it today. It's a weird thing to say, but I love swimming, and I've often thought of what works or doesn't at the pool, and this is absolutely something that would. I'd bet on it.

""Splash"" is a great title for this, and the blocky bright blues even remind me of pool toys/inflatables!"
Lush Palm,10/26/2024,WhyDoMen,F,23,,1,Meant to be paired with Wild Sand,"This scent was released as a pair with Wild Sand in 2023. They are intended to be layered to create a unique scent. I'm not into florals, so I don't love this one as much as Wild Sand. If layering the two together, you will need to spray LOTS of Wild Sand and just a spritz or two of Endless Sea. Endless Sea is much stronger and overpowering.

Last year I bought the hand soap, and it's a shame the spray didn't smell closer to that. I LOVED the smell of the hand soap! It was fresh and clean."
Elemental,05/27/2013,Flavorite,F,241,,2,A Epic Spicy Citrus Potion,"I love this fragrance! I can't believe I got multiple samples of it on my last visit to the Diptyque counter several months ago and have never tried it until today. I was busy trying to convince myself that somewhere within Diptyque's Volutes, L'eau Tarocco and L'eau de Lente, lay my new Summer signature scent. I love the low-moderate sillage as well as the transparent quality of Diptyque creations and I also love the dichotomy of surprisingly good longevity with this line, at least on my skin. L'eau de L'eau starts off very citrusy and fresh on the top notes with a sunny lemon note with a pinch of dry cinnamon powder. I don't really smell any grapefruit or petitgrain, but perhaps I am blocking these out since they are not my favorite notes. For the first five minutes my reaction was ""Meh, that is just o.k."" and then suddenly it was as if someone wearing a beautiful orange blossom, lavender and geranium scent walked in, lit a clove cigarette and ordered a chilled candied ginger martini with mandarin zest peel curled over the side. Then I realized it was, in fact, L'eau de L'eau. This scent definitely changes and expands over time. The top was fresh, almost professional, brisk and urban. The middle is clove-a-licious, dark and spicy almost Goth and the base is a mello, soft and calming Tonka and Benzoin. I don't detect the patchouli here, but that is a good thing, IMO. It all mélanges together culminating in a Your-skin-but-spicy-scent. This is masterfully blended and would make an ideal signature scent for a man or woman. I would wear this primarily for daytime- it's very close to the skin after the first hour, but seems to be lasting a good 6 hours. I'm almost sorry I got into this sample because now definitely need a full bottle ASAP!"
Elemental,09/24/2016,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Aquaman's Scent!,"L’Eau de L’Eau… so if I understand correctly, the scent is now water from water or water out of water or something like that? How does one come up with such a name?

This could have been thought up directly by Aquaman himself… and I, being a nerd, am already mentioning a comic book character again… oh no, oh dear! … and to top it off, a rather unpopular character (I quote Raj from The Big Bang Theory: “Shitty Aquaman!”).

Be that as it may, since Philosykos I have been testing Diptyque fragrances from time to time, but I have hardly found a scent that I liked as much as the mentioned fig scent. I even found some quite dreadful (e.g., Olène), but as they say, one does not give up (unless you don’t want to read any more comments from me, then I’ll quickly and sadly disappear from here *sniffle*).

Well then, let’s get to the scent…

The scent:
At the beginning, you can definitely smell a grapefruit, which also smells nice, but for a scent that one might think is fresh because of the name, it is quite spicy. Because right after application, you can perceive a very intense cinnamon and clove note, with the clove being so strong that it can almost overwhelm you if overapplied.
A little later, the scent has a slightly classic touch in the background, which might be due to the notes of lemon and lavender. The cinnamon fades a bit, and the clove also becomes calmer.
Along with the roses, slightly floral notes come in, lightening up the scent a little.
The fruity notes from the base remind more of oranges and fit well with the other scents.
A bit later, you can detect a slightly soapy-synthetic component, which you have to smell for specifically, and the impression is almost lost through the somewhat sharp clove, which is still well detectable in the base, while the slightly sweet cinnamon remains in the background.

The sillage and longevity:
The projection is strong, the scent will definitely be noticed by others, and that for a somewhat longer period of time. If sprayed on generously, a scent cloud will surely remain!
The longevity is quite good at about eight hours!

The bottle:
The bottle is tall and more rectangular than the somewhat rounder bottles usually known from Diptyque. It is clear and has a transparent label with a frame on the front. Besides the name, there is a drawing of a rocky stream and trees.
The cap is black and cylindrical. Everything is nicely done, although it might have looked better if the label had a white background.

Okay, I am glad to be able to write here that L’Eau de L’Eau has turned out to be quite a nice scent (and not yet another Diptyque flop for me). The scent gives off a rather autumnal atmosphere for me, as it comes across warm and is not as fresh as the name L’Eau might suggest.

As a daytime scent for the somewhat not-so-warm summer days or early autumn as well as in spring, it is quite usable. Additionally, it is more of a daytime or casual scent than one meant for going out.

I wonder how Aquaman sprays himself with a scent underwater? No,… I’ll stop with the comics, you probably don’t want to know anything about that anyway (whyyyy...??).

Yes, the scent is finally a Diptyque fragrance worth checking out, as long as you don’t have an aversion to a strong clove scent!"
Elemental,04/20/2011,Ergoproxy,M,1130,,6,Summer Oriental,"This scent is strangely good! You definitely have to like the combination of cinnamon, fruit, and clove. I really enjoy what I'm smelling.

My first impression after spraying: mulled wine in a fresh-fruity summer version. Although the cinnamon and clove are noticeable from the very beginning, this fragrance is not heavy at all.

Even with the heart note, the scent remains pleasant and does not drift into a wintry territory. The ginger gives the heart a nice light spiciness.

It then transitions into the base with a spicy-fresh character. This becomes a bit sweeter, while the cinnamon note fades. Patchouli and tonka bean are well balanced. Despite the oriental note, it lacks the typical heaviness often found in orientals.

As a fan of oriental perfumes, I say in this case: thumbs up for L´Eau de L´Eau!"
Elemental,03/03/2010,DeGe53,F,560,,3,Inverted Order,"Whoopie! Cinnamon is in charge here. All phobics, hands off, please.
What’s amazing is that even in the top note, a strong cinnamon note stands out. It seems to detach itself from the back of the hand and waft around in the air. You can’t ignore it at all. Occasionally, a few fresh, slightly prickly tones peek out cautiously from under the spice cloud, but they don’t really dare to come out.
This scent is for spice lovers. After the spectacular cinnamon appearance, the clove slowly joins in, running protectively in front of the ginger. This doesn’t weaken the intense onslaught (somehow the blend reminds me of rice pudding with sugar and cinnamon, warm, cinnamon freshly sprinkled), but it does become calmer now.
Where can you wear this scent? Naturally, everywhere. I would be a bit cautious with it in the office."
Trinity,02/17/2016,Sorceress,F,216,,1,Just Roses On A Trellis,"Roses wrapped with musk. I wish I could get more from this perfume, but after wearing it twice, sadly I cannot. There are other notes that did draw me to it, but I'm disappointed that Trellis is basically pure roses on me. If you truly enjoy roses, then this is one for you. I do believe there are other offerings on the market that could be better for that type of floral offering. Pretty, but too linear and not as full-bodied as I expected. Very soft and sits close to the skin."
Lush Pink Dragonfruit,10/20/2018,Greenfaerie,F,86,,2,Nice approximation of the redwoods,"Sandara makes me feel like a little fairy floating around the redwoods. The fragrance smells woody and a little damp and makes me think of ferns and forest streams. I get violets, which creates that cool water feeling. It's not necessarily one of my very favorites, but I like it well enough to wear it on occasion. I find it lasts, and sillage is on the quieter side, which I like anyway."
Damsel - Lush,09/12/2018,Jazzy76,F,320,,2,"My ""Paradise lost""","I'm going to write about this perfume as I could write about a beloved person I've lost. In fact, this fragrance was the mate of my 20years and it represents the springtime of my life.
I discovered it and tested the first time in a drugstore in Brescia, Northern Italy, where I studied at the university.
It was love at first smell: so flowery-fruity, so soft, so perfect for my Young age!
I cannot forget the gorgeous rasperry top notes characterizing this scent as rich as a secret garden . Then, I remember the warmer and very feminin flowery bouquet revealing all its innocent sensuality.
At the base, the unforgettable sweet vanilla notes lasting on my skin for hours without resulting too intoxicating or sweetish. The sillage was good and the result so ethereal and so perfect for a ""jeune fille en fleur""!
It was a little corner of Paradise, contained in a very romantic and refined bottle which was a little masterpiece to show on the bathroom perfumes shelf.
A scent connected to the springtime , to the first ray of light of the day, to a bon ton and flowery dress , to pastel nuances.
This paradise is lost not only because the oerfume was unfortunately discontinued by the Maison Givenchy (and I ask myself: Why?) but also because, changing my address and transporting too many objects, I didn't find anymore the precious 50ml bottle I owned and which was one of the last presents given to me by my mother for Christmas.
R.I.P. dear ""Fleur d'interdit""...I'll smell you in my best dreams!"
Damsel - Lush,07/11/2023,Nanachka,F,7,,3,Farewell to Love,"After repeated, but alas, unsuccessful attempts to find a single drop of well-preserved vintage, I have to say: ""Goodbye, Dear Friend!"" May you remain in my memory as young, fresh and beautiful, born for joy and seduction, as your creator intended you to be.

Apparently, you were too tender, time and conditions could not preserve your green and watermelon notes, some flowers in your heart have faded, sour shadows are imprinted on your profile and only the base reminds of what you were.

You've aged, we've aged, but it's a natural process, albeit a little sad.
You were unique, as evidenced by the lack of a large list of similar one. Your wonderful bottle I will tactilely remember always, in my memory you will forever be a favorite. And I will still look for you in new incarnations and hope that someday you will be re-released, rejuvenated and modernized.
Goodbye my beautiful, my Fleur d'Interdit!"
Damsel - Lush,04/21/2022,BrianBuchanan,M,363,,1,Aquatic / fruity-flora / woody musk,"Like Xeryus before it (also Givenchy) Fleur d’interdit is an odd mixture of styles.
It’s an aquatic - fruity-flora hybrid which re-jigs the classic feminine to appeal to under 25’s.
There is red fruity sweetness jostling with bitter moss and thin aquatic notes, and a sour woody musk coming from the base; three different tropes at loggerheads...
Needless to say, if you work on the principle of throwing enough muck at the fan - till some of it sticks - you won’t come up with a Jackson Pollock."
Damsel - Lush,12/24/2014,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,19,it is what it is,"Today, on Christmas Eve, I am in a contemplative, yes somewhat sentimental mood, as so many dear people are no longer present for the family celebration.

They are in another place.

I have to come to terms with that - but I still miss them.
But my thoughts are with them.

I rummage through my scent memory box, which tells so many stories.
Christmas is the festival of love - and completely unexpectedly, a fragrance comes into my hands that has a lot to do with the theme of ""love"".

It is Fleur d`interdit by Givenchy.

I had already resignedly saved it under ""Had I"" - but it is indeed still there!

I wore it during the time when I fell in love with my husband, and he with me.
He is not a fragrance fan, but Fleur had captivated him - alongside my humble self.
This multifaceted scent underscored our getting to know each other until the wedding, like the film music of a romance.

The beautiful flower may be forbidden because it is so irresistibly attractive.
One cannot escape its charm, just as the sailors of the Loreley could not resist, and crashed their boats, intoxicated by the lovely song of the beauty.

Hyacinth, strawberry, and melon taste so sweet that one cannot get enough.
So it was with us - we had to always be together - and we still must.

Violet, rose, and lily of the valley are unabashedly romantic, but deep oak moss and dark iris admonish and warn.

Should one embark on the adventurous journey together - when one does not really know where it leads?
But do we have a choice?

I think of Erich Fried:
What it is

It is nonsense
says reason
It is what it is
says love

It is misfortune
says calculation
It is nothing but pain
says fear
It is hopeless
says insight
It is what it is
says love

It is ridiculous
says pride
It is reckless
says caution
It is impossible
says experience
It is what it is
says love

The forbidden flower has brought our souls together, and our little ship faithfully rocks through rough seas and calm waters.

Sometimes we land, sometimes we move on - but always the two of us.

The forbidden flower may possess magical power."
Damsel - Lush,03/23/2020,ElysaShades,F,148,,13,The Scent of My Elementary School Teacher *shudder*,"Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about scent memory. My example was Fleur d'Interdit. I assume my elementary school teacher wore it. This was in the mid-nineties, and back then, we still had somewhat rougher manners in elementary school, especially when the teacher - like my Mrs. F. - was tenured and couldn't be fired as long as she didn't hand out slaps. But otherwise, there weren't many limits to the cruelty. Luckily, she didn't have it out for me (thank goodness my mom sang in the same choir as her), but when I enthusiastically sprayed my Fleur s'Interdit that I had won on eBay a few years ago (I had no idea it smelled like Mrs. F., and I had completely forgotten about her), my hair stood on end. I spent about 20 minutes wondering why the scent was so unpleasant to me, and then it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks. The teacher... And little Lisa in between, somewhere between fear and wanting to please, and aversion because she was always going after the best friend, who eventually broke down in tears, that wild boy, it was outrageous, and there was nothing to do but look down awkwardly and write his homework next time. That's Fleur d'Interdit.

SO unfortunate, because actually, it's so beautiful... As I already mentioned in my blog, I wore it quite often to drive away the unpleasant memories. And it works. Somewhere in the back of my mind, she still lurks, Mrs. F., but I can now enjoy the scent for what it is. A - now - completely out-of-fashion floral fragrance, lush, elegant, detail-oriented, like you can't find anymore today. Exactly my thing!

When spraying, there’s now a slightly sour note. My bottle must be about 25 years old, so it could very well be the signs of time. Looking at the top notes, that could fit as well. With melon, raspberry, wild strawberry, it can sometimes smell a bit sour, but the warmer it is, the less I perceive that. Even though Fleur d'Interdit is anything but a lightweight, it develops best in warm weather. I have the impression that the longer I wear the scent, the clearer the individual notes become. The flowers are expansive from the start. Lily of the valley, hyacinths, violets, lilacs... Everything grows wildly together. After about 3 hours, the fruit notes also become clearer. Strawberries, raspberries, with leaves in the sun. Green notes often seem cool and damp to me. That's not the case here. We definitely have green notes, but bright and sun-drenched. Really beautiful!

Fleur d'Interdit lasts effortlessly all day with strong sillage. Careful dosing is advisable, also because the scent is so out of sync with the current zeitgeist. It can happen that you stand out unpleasantly.

The base is rather inconspicuous, creeping in over time. Nice scratchy oak moss, cushioned by clean musk, slightly powdery, not really woody.

This one really takes off, and as is known with many high-quality vintage fragrances, the overall picture changes constantly, and the scent remains lively all day. I like it more and more the longer I wear it. I prefer it on really beautiful summer days when it's warm but with a light breeze. If you like this type of fragrance, grab a bottle somewhere. It's really worth it.

Fleur d'Interdit on my teacher was the first perfume I consciously noticed on someone, basically my prototype perfume. And I liked it a lot back then (Mrs. F. is mean, but she smells good). Now I'm very glad I kept the bottle and didn't sell it due to unpleasant memories. If you set those aside, it actually belongs to my all-time favorites."
Damsel - Lush,03/09/2013,Florblanca,F,1168,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Ming Shu and the Ming Dynasty...,"...have just as much to do with each other as Fleur d'Interdit and L'Interdit or a Chypre! Sure, the comparison is a bit off, but I did not choose it lightly. Fleur d'Interdit is - despite its large pyramid - not a Chypre and not a blockbuster (for Medusa: a bang *g*). I admit, I expected a kind of flanker to L'Interdit, but Fleur d'Interdit is not that either. In the..."
