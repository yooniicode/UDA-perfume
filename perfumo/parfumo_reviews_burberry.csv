Body,07/28/2018,Shamis,F,47,,12,"""Makeup"" without Makeup","Those who know how to subtly apply makeup in a skilled way can sometimes pass as ""pretty and completely unmade up."" However, those who use such tricks can see through the seemingly natural beauty of others. And they know the reasons: one simply wants to look a bit better without feeling painted on in any way. Obvious makeup, which is immediately recognizable as such, is perceived as ""too much"" in everyday life; on the other hand, feeling completely unmade up feels somewhat naked.

""Mistral Female"" is, for me, an olfactory counterpart to this. A fragrance that simply makes one smell a bit better without feeling perfumed. Upon spraying, one clearly recognizes fresh citrus notes, but these dissipate quickly. I don't notice the floral notes, but I find the base of musk, tonka bean, and cedar successful: musk adds cleanliness, tonka bean brings a bit of sweetness and warmth, and cedar prevents the whole thing from becoming too sweet. I perceive ""Mistral Female"" as a consistently clean yet warm fragrance. Since it also stays very close to the skin, most people probably don't even perceive it as perfume. One easily passes as ""unperfumed"" with it.

In my collection, there are now several representatives of this direction: ""Comma,"" ""Nuit Marine,"" and surely a few others. Pleasant, but also subtle and rather inconspicuous. No olfactory challenges, no big statements. However, it is well-suited for days when I actually don't feel like wearing perfume, but would feel olfactorily naked without it. I also like to use ""Mistral Female"" to scent my clothing. I like it very much, only the longevity could be better."
Body,08/14/2011,Very,F,164,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Calm Winds,"I've probably seen this scent 100 times on the shelf, but I thought it was definitely not for me, someone who learned to surf in calm winds.

Thank you, dear Medusa, now I know that it is indeed meant for this type of surfer.

Mistral starts citrusy fresh, but without making much of a breeze.

The heart is floral and delicate. Does the scent represent the shy girl who watches the surfers from afar?!

No, definitely not! Because suddenly the base comes in with a wonderful cocktail. It almost reminds me a bit of Virgin Island Water by Creed.
What? There's no coconut in the base? Is my nose being fooled by tonka bean and cedar?
The longevity is average. The scent lasts about 3 to 4 hours on me.
Anyway, to quote SpongeBob: ""Yammi Yammi Yam eh eh, delicious, delicious eh eh..."""
Body,05/23/2011,Baeumchen,F,160,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,A Wonderful Wind,"For some time now, Mistral has been available at large drugstore chains. (Schl... is not one of them).
Mistral is a word that I am familiar with, but I couldn't recall it. I quickly looked it up and now I remember:
A Mistral is a WIND.

This wind is fresh yet warm on my skin. It is subtle, a light breeze and not a hurricane gust. It remains consistently clean, pure, and smells of the coast! It is also somewhat floral!
The Mistral brand stands for water sports: sailing, surfing... sportswear... Essentially for outdoor activities by the coast.
With this scent, you are well advised in everyday life. You can't go wrong.
All the notes harmonize very well together. All in all, Mistral is finely tuned. The floral notes are carried by the wind, so light are they.
Mistral is not a mild breeze that quickly disappears, but this warm, gentle, pure wind envelops me for a long time.

Addendum: fresh, clean laundry - of course air-dried in the countryside. The cuddly soft bear would surely also enjoy this scent!"
Body,05/03/2011,Gwenidina,F,17,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Target audience younger??,"The displays and advertising suggest a younger target audience, but I wonder if they really feel attracted to the scent?
(I would be interested to know)
I don’t belong to that group anymore, and I wouldn’t gift it to a very young woman either. However, of course, I could be wrong -
By chance, I tried the scent, even though I initially didn’t feel addressed by it, and I was then completely thrilled by how pleasantly warm and natural it surrounds you.
I tried it again and can’t quite agree with the advertising. Woman on the beach, young, sporty...? Yes? - I perceive this scent more as a very pleasant daytime fragrance, lightly floral and warm-scented - by no means intrusive and rather for women (approximately) from 30 and up. (depending on personality and type)
I can detect some freesia, woods, and a bit of warm musk, a subtle beautiful blend, not an overwhelming perfume, but that’s exactly what makes it special, so I treated myself to it. People next to me shouldn’t faint from the scent but rather perceive it as a pleasant something in the background. - It’s not hard to afford, it just doesn’t cost that much; I was able to buy it at Rossmann for just 12 euros (30ml), which is already a great price; I think it’s worth spending a bit more for this pleasant scent, with which you can’t go wrong if you like pleasantly subtle fragrances from this category.
Try it!
I think, Mäurer & Wirtz has created something good here, similar to what is often done by Mexx; I find this type comparable (price, effect... not the scent itself).

And by the way, regarding the male scent, that is the scent for him: I see it quite similarly and brought it to my beloved right away, and: he likes it (someone who rarely uses fragrances and prefers subtle ones). The shower gel also smells really pleasant.
It would be important that the deodorant for him is also available soon in a pump bottle; I reject aerosol sprays - but deodorant is often much more subtle than a full fragrance (for him).
I’m curious about other comments that might see it quite differently ;-))"
Her Elixir de Parfum,05/30/2017,Serenissima,F,1222,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,in the summertime,"On days like today, ""Vocalise"" is a delightful refreshment.
The 30° mark has already been exceeded, thunderstorms are approaching - it is incredibly humid.

The fragrant freshness of ""Vocalise"" is very welcome.
For ""Vocalise"" is not only a beautiful piece of music by Rachmaninoff; it is also a fragrance that I do not want to miss on such days.

It is not just the fruity and green notes that almost invigorate; there is also a wonderfully rich selection of fruits, flowers, and woods.
I particularly enjoy the Black Currant here as well. It stands out against the sweetness of the flowers and fruits with its tart and refreshing character.
For as beautiful as the almost balsamic Jasmine, Lily of the Valley, and Rose are, they need a fragrant counterbalance.
The base completes this fragrance composition in a perfectly harmonious way. It gives it the necessary stability.

For a mere summer fragrance, ""Vocalise"" is very full-bodied and has long-lasting wear. Sprayed on in the morning, it is still a whisper that surrounds me in the afternoon.

I first got to know and love ""Vocalise"" in 1998. Like so many of my fragrances, this one also fell into oblivion for a long time.
Yes, even perfume lovers can be unfaithful!
In the meantime, I have it back in my collection and I am very pleased about it - especially on days like these.
Outside, a storm is raging, the rain is lashing - but ""Vocalise"" still surrounds me with its wonderful scent!"
Her Elixir de Parfum,05/20/2010,Bowser,M,10,,8,more than a fragrance,"a really good scent that adapts to the mood and can be loud, soft, delicate, or strong like a voice.
a successful blend of fresh and fruity, softly floral, woody notes.
I like to spray this fragrance throughout the apartment and on the bed linens.
it immediately lifts the mood of the room and feels incredibly clean.
it's a shame that this scent can no longer be found in perfumeries."
Brit for Him,12/06/2020,Drseid,M,828,,1,The End Of The Hunt For The Elusive Unicorn...,"Calvin opens with a sharp bergamot laced herbal green mix of sage-like artemisia and oakmoss rising from the base, with underlying anise-like tarragon support before transitioning to its heart. As the composition enters its early heart the bergamot vacates, leaving remnants of the artemisia to couple with the now focal tarragon and rugged mossy green oakmoss with sharp, woody vetiver and earthy patchouli adding significant support. During the late dry-down the development stays highly linear staying herbal green throughout, as the tarragon, oakmoss and woody vetiver remain the focus with relatively dry sandalwood adding support through the finish. Projection is outstanding, and longevity excellent at over 12 hours on skin.

Calvin has proven quite elusive to find on the aftermarket nowadays except at what some may consider ""crazy"" prices, making sampling the perfume difficult over the years. Luckily, I was able to get my hands on a mini from the 80s to see what all the fuss is about as I don't recall smelling much of it back then. The first thing I noticed when applying the perfume on skin was its powerhouse strength. The oakmoss and herbs project seemingly for miles and miles... Anyone growing up in the 80s would recognize this strength as ""the real deal."" If I were to gauge influences for Calvin, it would have to be perfumes of its age like the original Polo, and it in turn influenced perfumes that immediately followed like Quorum by Puig. In truth, I think it is closer to the latter. There really isn't much in the way of development throughout, and while Calvin smells excellent, it never challenges the *true* greatness and originality found in its much more accessible Polo predecessor, making the argument for seeking it out somewhat tenuous. The bottom line is the $433 per 100ml bottle on the aftermarket Calvin is another ""very good"" to ""excellent"" 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5 rated example of the sublime powerhouse 80s, but it doesn't quite distinguish itself from its contemporaries to merit the hunt and relatively stratospheric cost of seeking it out today, earning it a recommendation solely to 80s vintage perfume completionists."
Brit for Him,10/10/2025,Krmarich,M,225,,1,In the beginning...,"I remember wearing Calvin in 1985. It was the best thing CK ever created for a man. It complimented my CK jeans and t-shirt. I felt like I was at the hight of American fashion.

The original formula was last seen in 1995 still in tact. I would now refer to it as a woody chypre. Then it was just perfect. Herbal, spicy, woody and very clean. The blue bottle matched the contents. It was the perfect male counterpart for the ladies red bottle. No endless, mindless flankers were required. They stood just fine in any season.

Then along came Obsession, Eternity and all of that other mass produced ""bug sprays"". The name CK has become something less. Do they even make jeans anymore? It is now a great memory from an age of innocence in America..."
Brit for Him,08/20/2014,Soulmates,M,57,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Phantom,"Like a phantom, this mysterious scent and its modernist-dark bottle haunt the scene; it suddenly appears and then disappears again, largely unsung by fragrance critics. Those who want to know what Calvin smells like should take a dark musk fragrance, Fougère type, about halfway between Kouros, Polo, and Marbert Man, and largely replace the animalistic notes with an intensely turned-up citrus tone and a gentle, white clove note. Calvin is hyper-masculine, retro-barbershop, and extremely musky in a clean-soapy, skin-like direction, clearly more conservative than its appearance suggests, and feels like the men's fragrance that everyone knows from somewhere and many love. Many do not, however. The radiance at the beginning is ""powerhouse,"" which calms down after 30 minutes. Throughout the day, crisp citrus waves, noble soap, and the typical connection tone of skin and musk - especially for the wearer themselves - remind you that you are wearing a high-quality Eau de Toilette. The search is worth it. Pure coincidence that Balafre, Patou pour Homme, Macassar, or Nobile are currently the stars - Calvin holds his own easily. Simple (and) exciting."
Brit for Him,05/22/2012,Apicius,M,1328,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,CK with Flared Pants,"Calvin Klein is a rather strange brand: for years they have been successful with pale, pastel-colored designs. Just as indecisive as the presentation are most of the fragrances - often unisex and made for people who don't like to commit, because they don't really have their own opinion - and if they do, it's a very tame one. Fans may forgive me - but that's how it all comes across to me.

The original Calvin appeared at a time when this brand had not yet found its current indecisiveness. Calvin is very much a child of its time, as the look at the pyramid suggests. There we have the variety of aromas that is so typical for that time, making it impossible to quickly dissect the scent. In general, it is soapy with a tendency towards sharpness. The remaining notes all point in different directions and sort of cancel each other out. It leaves a musky-patchouli background. In this respect, Calvin already hints at that indifference which today characterizes the perfume style of Calvin Klein.

No, this cannot excite me - this is CK with flared pants, but unfortunately without the cult factor. No one will miss that.

Many thanks again to AromiErotici, who has supplied me with plenty of samples of vintage perfumes from his collection."
Brit for Him,09/04/2011,Skylab,M,184,,3,The Calvin Universe,"Calvin Klein, the lifestyle brand from the 1990s that achieved cult status with models like Mark Wahlberg, Kate Moss, and Milla Jovovich, has covered pretty much every segment with its fragrance range and reached every target group.

All age groups have been catered to in 30 years of the fragrance business.

There are the Orientals ""Obsession,"" the Spicy ""Escape"" and ""Eternity,"" the Floral ""Beauty,"" the Fresh ""Truth For Men,"" including the seemingly 20 Eternity summer flankers, the Sensual ""Euphoria Woman"" and ""Secret Obsession,"" the Youthful ""Crave"" and ""CK In 2U,"" and of course the Androgynous ""CK One.""

The latter is probably the most successful Klein fragrance and likely the best-selling young classic in the world!

Speaking of unisex - for many young people, including myself, the journey into the world of perfume began with this neutral-scented water.

However, few know that the actual Big Bang in the ""Calvin"" fragrance universe took place back in 1978, 16 years earlier, with ""Calvin"" (Woman).

CK entered the men's segment three years later with the male counterpart, which also bore the simple name.

The (fragrance) bottle, completely unknown to me until now, presented itself simply.

A slim, androgynous bottle in classic black.
The rounded plastic cap features the ""Calvin"" name in large letters.

At the time, it was an optical revolution; today it may seem a bit uninspired, even cheap.

The packaging, also entirely black, stays true to the motto ""Black is beautiful!""

The print campaign featured a young gentleman with slicked-back hair in a suit, confidently and characteristically gazing into a baroque mirror.

The fragrance was contemporary and classic for its time.
It is a typical fougère with a herbal, ozonic flair.

""Calvin"" disappeared in the early 1990s and was re-released in 1999 in a limited edition.

I am commenting on the reissued version (many thanks to TrueBlood, who gifted me his bottle), which should not deviate significantly from the original.

The opening features a gray lemon note that, combined with chamomile, has a herbal, floral flair with a bitter undertone.

There are similarities to YSL's Kouros Cologne Sport, which has a similarly cool presence.

The ingredient list is rich and creative, yet I can only discern a few ingredients.

As the scent develops, a spicy cinnamon note becomes noticeable.

The fragrance departs earthy/green and leaves a masculine/bitter touch.

The longevity is average - 5 hours are quite possible.

In summary, an interesting men's fragrance that would certainly stand out from the Klein mainstream range today!

My Burberry,12/19/2023,Telekinec,F,498,,3,Generic and a bit boring,"I forgot to write my review about this one when I tried it yesterday and I think I forgot about it because there's nothing really to write about. It's not a bad fragrance by any means, but it's so generic and boring... I still don't know why they decided to name this fragrance like this.

An evanescent note of ambrette at the beginning that offers the only jolt (of something) for this perfume. Generic florals that smell soapy and fresh like soap. A perfume that fades away too soon. For the price, this could be a body mist and nothing more.

I really have nothing more to say so I might as well just stop here. Will not be adding to my collection."
My Burberry,04/04/2023,Hartsy3,F,99,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,So clean and so wholesome,"From the opening, this is such a very clean and ""soapy"" smell. As it dries, it doesn't change much at all. Smells a like a shampoo, in a very cozy, sexy way.

For me, this is soft, comfortable and intimate. Something about it makes me think of a newborn baby who has just come out of a warm bath. It makes me feel like I'm sniffing directly into a loved one's hair right after they've washed and dried it. In that way, it feels like a warm embrace.

For a clean skin scent, this also has a surprisingly strong sillage and longevity. It doesn't command attention (look at me!) but holds its own, respectfully.

This has become one of my signature scents. At first, I thought this was somewhat neutral/unisex. But I've come to view it as a very womanly smell. I feel like a grown woman when I wear it. Something about the clean aroma makes me feel like I have my life together. Like a mother who is holding everything together for my children and still always making time to hold them lovingly in my arms."
My Burberry,06/07/2023,Rosymel,F,122,,3,This is fine,"This is totally fine, if slightly pedestrian. That’s okay! Not everything needs to be daring and outré. It’s quite pleasant, but this definitely does not seem like a perfume worthy of its price tag. This is more like a nice body spray in my opinion.

It’s very citrusy on me and stays quite linear. I get bergamot, a little cassis, and some florals; very little musk and no patchouli. It’s fresh, clean, straightforward, and inoffensive. It really reminds me of something nostalgic, but I just can’t put my finger on it—a drugstore product from the 1980s or 1990s, maybe?"
My Burberry,02/01/2025,DogiCoco,F,637,,2,"The myth of ""your skin but better"" perfumes","Myth starts out with a mix of classic florals and fresh bergamot. The first moments smell more old school than I expected from this relatively new brand. Then the blackcurrant comes and makes everything a bit sweeter.
Ultimately the scent turns into a skin musk quickly. The musk has the same quality as some affordable white musk classics, like the ones from TBS, Jovan or even Cacharel Noa. It reminds me of clean, warm skin fresh out of the shower. In my opinion this kind of musk is much nicer than the harsher musk of the last 10-15 years.
Besides musk, florals are the most important notes here. The lotus adds a lovely transparency to the scent, jasmine is responsible for the classic vibes of the opening and orchid makes the base slightly powdery.

It's an enjoyable, inoffensive, even charming fragrance that is perfectly fine for daily wear. There are some little flaws though, I think the sweetness in this can turn a little to artifical at times. When it comes to ""your skin but better"" shower musk fragrances, I think I can do without blackcurrant, even though I do like this fruit.

I don't think that this is particularly similar to Byredo Bal d'Afrique, like the votes and some reviews suggest. Even though Myth is nice, I prefer Bal d'Afrique for its lively freshness."
My Burberry,08/11/2024,VintageWitch,F,31,,3,Perfect boring scent for the office...,"I was thrilled to finally see that my local Sephora (at Kohls) had some of the Ellis Brooklyn line out. I sprayed Myth on a tester strip and was pleased with the overall scent. Clean scents like this are totally my jam and I tend to reach for them for everyday use. I need to try this on skin, but this reminds me ever so slightly of Nemats Amber oil with a touch of their Egyptian Musk oil. Is it groundbreaking? Nah. Boring? A bit. But it would make a great scent to wear when you just want to smell good and extra clean."
My Burberry,07/09/2025,emmaspotts,F,4,,2,"Lovely, clean, simple","This is the perfect clean-girl scent. I’d describe it as the scent of Biolage shampoo with a soft musky background. It makes me feel like I’m braiding my sister’s freshly washed hair: salon shampoo, clean skin, and the familiar warmth of a loved one. I’d reach for this daily if it had a little more power to it. I find that I have to put my nose up to my skin if I want..."
My Burberry,09/22/2025,Caitycat5,F,1,,2,Very pretty wish it lasted longer,"Love love love the opening and initial dry down. The musky, slightly fruity and floral notes really give the spa shampoo vibe to me. Between the wood and patchouli there is also a pleasant earthy element in the dry down to me. My one gripe is the longevity, I maybe get 3 hours at best on this. If I hadn’t picked it up on sale I would be more upset about it, but it is a..."
My Burberry,09/06/2022,Mlleghoul,F,458,,1,"babe, I love this journey for you","Myth from Ellis Brooklyn is initially the sort of crisp, dry, cologney-fresh fragrance I typically don’t love because it borders on the standard generic cliche of the guy with the abs and the towel wrapped around his waist in any old perfume ad. Except in this instance...there’s nuance or detail here working in its favor. So imagine instead of the cruelty and foolishness of the Echo and Narcissus myth…let’s say the gods kept their dicks in their pants and didn’t get carried away with petty vendettas, no one was scorned, humiliated, or shamed and these two just got to fall in love and live their lives. Maybe they opened up the blissful sanctuary day spa together. Maybe it features a reflection pool fed by a cool, clear spring, energetically charged by healing crystals, in the middle of a lush garden surrounded by shady woods and teeming with heady, fragrant jasmine and beautiful orchids. Maybe after a session of massage therapy, light healing, and intuitive counseling, they encouraged their clientele to spend a moment gazing at themselves in the still, crystalline waters, muscles loose and relaxed, skin pumiced and oiled, and then boop their own watery image on the nose and say “babe, I love this journey for you.” Myth is an uncomplicated, clean, woody mildly floral musk that just embraces and epitomizes feeling good about yourself."
My Burberry,07/20/2025,Meownarchy,N/A,13,,1,"the myth is always better than reality, huh?","I think in theory, I like this brand. They've explored interesting profiles, pushed a more gender neutral approach to their scents. I love myth, but only because it's easy. It's shampoo, fresh out the shower, clean, musky. It's easy to grab, easy to wear. I wish it was more mythical, more complex. But it is a solid staple, especially since it is often at major discount at places like Ross, Marshalls, etc.

But it's not exciting! I wish this brand was more exciting. Aesthetically, it's so good. Bottles are beautiful. They have (had?) such good names for their scents. It seems like they've gotten more timid, and leaned even more into mass appeal. Easy gourmands, simple fruity-florals, trendy notes. With very on the nose names.

I won't pay full price for this, but if I need to feel clean I'll wear it. Myth feels like such a waste of a name for a scent that feels like suave shampoo. Still nice! Still a disappointment!"
My Burberry,06/15/2025,HappyHoya,F,18,,1,"Pleasant, Complex-Clean Scent","This is a pleasant and clean scent, but with some complexity. It isn’t groundbreaking or head-turning, but I think it’s more complex than most reviews here give it credit for. All the notes are sort of clean and even-keel, but this does evolve in my skin throughout the day. I typically prefer a stronger perfume, but this is something I wear when I’m not feeling bold or want a gentle scent. For some reason, in a world where I smell way too many gourmands while out and about, I find these clean scents more sophisticated than other easy reaches."
My Burberry,07/18/2020,Wentogym,F,2,,1,"Myth--Loved as a sample, not so much the atomizer","In the sample, Myth seemed like a soft and work-appropriate fragrance. Subtle and nuanced, but not particularly long-lasting, I purchased the full-sized bottle. To my disappointment, the atomizer shot out like a jet of product. Returning for what I thought was a defective bottle, the second bottle was the same."

My Burberry,09/29/2025,lucekingg,F,157,,1,Sweet Pencil Shavings,"One of my elementary school friend's house smelled like this. I'm getting a mix of floral and woody and creamy notes, and despite no aquatic notes I'm detecting some of that as well. This is really light and bright and lovely! I wasn't sure how much I would like it but I got this in the Ellis Brooklyn Mystery set and so far this is my favorite."
My Burberry,02/17/2025,this1life,F,2,,0,The Name is Not the Program,"Under a ""Mythos,"" I would have imagined a mysterious, exciting note in the fragrance. On my skin, the scent is simply floral with a hint of musk and rather boring. It doesn't develop particularly well either, but simply fades away after a few hours. In my opinion, the fragrance also feels somewhat outdated and has an 80s vibe for me."
Her,07/14/2025,Charades,M,33,,1,Sissa: Review 32,"I’ve been craving this perfume for months on end. The notes made me feel like wearing this would simulate a warm fresh sesame bun hugging me on a bed of tonka. And oh yes it is. This smells like a warm fluffy bread with toasted sesame seeds that was also baked with vanilla extract, accompanied by a warm glass of milk. Starts tonka and coumarin heavy, dries down more sesame and warm. Super cozy and beautiful, will buy this soon."
Brit Sheer,06/23/2013,Florblanca,F,1168,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Pois de Senteur - a story of dots and fragrance?,"When we moved into our current apartment five years ago, there was no house built across the street, but a wild plot of land, overgrown with grasses, daisies, tansy, yarrow, yellow bedstraw, and wild sweet peas.

Pois means dots, specks, peas in French, and Senteur means scent, fragrance, but sweet peas are called Pois de Senteur!

Wild sweet peas may not have a scent, but their small, purple flowers are a sight to behold in a vase.
Even more beautiful are the noble sweet peas, which can be found in many gardens. The scent of the noble sweet pea is a very special fragrance and differs significantly from all other fragrant flowers. Soft and sweet, enchantingly sensual and feminine.

This exact scent has been captured by Corday for Pois de Senteur in the bottle.

At first, for fractions of a second, there are still waxy aldehydes detectable, then the top note surprises me with a musky note that I certainly did not expect here.

After that, the sweet pea gradually and gently reveals itself. From here on, the scent is a soliflore. At first, it appears delicate-floral, but it becomes stronger and more voluminous by the minute.

Surprisingly, Pois de Senteur has a remarkable sillage and the scent projects quite clearly and voluminously. Nevertheless, it does not come across as overpowering, as the sweetness corresponds to the sweetness of the flowers and the whole composition is exceptionally pleasant and sensually feminine.

The longevity is quite good at around 8 hours, and the scent fades with a very soft, understated vanilla note.

My little treasure is an Eau de Toilette in an old, beautiful pouring bottle that I received from France. Its extremely good condition is a testament to good care - it surely once belonged to a fragrance lover who kept it for many, many years. Now it can adorn my collection - visually and olfactorily!"
My Burberry,12/20/2014,Cappellusman,M,358,,2,There’s still a spot free in the salon...,"... and it’s for this colleague next to ""Weil pour Homme"" and other hits from that era. At just seven years younger than the Weil, he is probably not its son, but rather the ""little brother."" He has adopted the manners and impeccable demeanor to please the elder, all in the noble family tradition.

""Lord Molyneux"" is consistent: Conservative to the core, stoically strong, and free of any self-doubt. He knows that he will eventually inherit the family estate and will carry on the family legacy in a fitting manner. There’s no rush; there’s still time, time for excellent port wine and fine cigars.

The fragrance pyramid is missing here; however, one is listed on fragrantica that confirms my initial suspicions. Cedar, mahogany, tonka bean among others. Well, actually not just among others, but practically exclusively. ""Lord Molyneux"" doesn’t linger with a citrus-fresh opening. No, he opts from the very beginning for wood, leather, spice. He has so much of it that he even adds a touch of sweetness with a sly grin, which is by no means ""sugary."" Longevity and sillage are officially in line with his claims.

Remaining stock is still available. I acquired my bottle in the USA."
Amber Heath,06/15/2025,itscoraline,F,171,,1,Grandfather’s Cabin,"Opens strongly with cinnamon spiced smoke and something a bit camphorous (eucalyptus? tea tree?). At this stage I was a little alarmed by how powerful it was and worried I’d made a mistake.

However, the strong edge fades surprisingly quickly, and after about 10 minutes I’m left with a much more mellow and intimate patchouli and tobacco blend.

I would have enjoyed a slightly stronger earthy note (or perhaps even a bit of worn leather?), but overall it’s warm and comforting, like snuggling into a chair by the fireplace at your grandfather’s cabin in the woods."

The Beat,01/14/2020,FvSpee,M,323,,40,Farewell,"Harry Lehmann's Fougère is a wonderful scent. It truly makes me sad to have to say goodbye to it.

This fragrance is terribly old-fashioned, but not in the way a phone from four years ago is, rather like a perfectly crafted Bakelite telephone with a fabric-wrapped power cord and a mechanism as sturdy as an airplane wing. And attached to it, at least as a thought, is the Miss from the office and the whole wonderfully mysterious, silently efficient organization of the Prussian telecommunications system with its army of officials.

Fougère is so dry that it dusts, and so woody that one must have a fire extinguisher nearby in summer. Its accords are as hard as if they were played on strings pulled to the point of breaking. It is green in a peculiar way. And it surely has lavender, probably eucalyptus, but both are so special that they definitely smell different than you think right now.

If I could only have two fragrances, it might be this one and its Chypre brother ""Russian Leather"" from the same house. Both wonderfully complex, both wonderfully masculine. One as distinctive as the other. Both last from Friday evening to Monday morning, no matter what you do during that time, and both keep you awake throughout that entire period without coke and energy drinks, like smelling salts perhaps, because they vibrate with energy. Both are probably still from the pre-war era, and both were - or are - available at pre-war prices. And both are - or were - quite modern again, because they are regional and sustainable for refilling.

If you want to know more precisely what kind of scent this is, then first read the comment from Apicius from the early days of Parfumo, and then the 10-point comment from the hair salon Korianke a.k.a. Fittleworth (which apparently has also said farewell to Parfumo, which makes me sad as well), because I can't say it more beautifully: This is not a scent for confirmation candidates, but for established, self-assured men with good footwear. Resinous and creaky, but not overpowering.

It is said that Fougère had to be reformulated at some point and that in the last version only a fraction of the original oak moss content remained. If that's true, then surely with the original version, one would have immediately gotten a mossy coating on the neck after spraying. In any case, this truly still impressive version has now also fallen from grace. Oak moss is no longer allowed to be present in fragrances, not even in traces, and the beautiful fixatives that provided the weekend effect are no longer considered kosher either. Oak moss & Co. seem to be the worst environmental problems plaguing this planet. Another reformulation was no longer possible, so the fragrance was discontinued and is sold out. And I only have 7 ml left.

So now you are an outdated model, old house, soon you will be forgotten. You are not different from all of us here. We all have to make room for the new at some point. Farewell, Fougère, up there in perfume heaven!"
The Beat,04/28/2016,Fittleworth,M,89,,40,Do you know the ...?,"Take a seat, Mr. Jeheimrat! Nice to have you honor me again.
What can I get for you? As always? Haircut? Shave, perhaps?
But please, yes, but please quickly!

How do you like it, sir?
Yaaa ... I've noticed that too. Everything that is good and tried-and-true is often mocked as old-fashioned. I can't understand that, you know.
I mean, if something is good, we shouldn't want to replace it just to have something new, right?
Do you agree with me, Mr. Jeheimrat?

Just a moment, please don't answer now, or I'll slip with the brush into your esteemed mouth. So, now please turn that noble head to the other side ...
Where was I?

Oh yes - the new and the old.
Old is not the same as bad, and new is not always the same as good. Now I'm not talking about medicine and such. I can accept that everything is getting better and newer there. But if you look at how it is in other areas ... you wouldn't believe it...

Just take fashion. I'm talking specifically about men's fashion. Where can you still find proper men's clothing? I mean really for men?
It's just a uniform mush everywhere.

How do you like it, sir?
Yaaa, exactly my opinion! In the past, you could stroll through the department store and find clothes for grown men. For men who wanted to dress like gentlemen.
But with all due respect, Mr. Jeheimrat, what is offered today ... no. That stuff looks like there are no men anymore, just little boys!
And if they want a noble jacket, they get a little jacket that is way too small and way too tight, and they look like a desperate confirmand ...

Just a moment, let me wipe the shaving foam off you so you can breathe better.
Where was I ...?

Oh yes ... old-fashioned and all that new ...
Just take the whole fuss about men's fragrances.
Yaaa, very true, entirely my opinion! Most of these are no longer men's fragrances. It's just sweet stuff, all vanilla and powdered sugar, downright horrible, I always say.
But you see, a real men's fragrance can only be worn by a man. Yaaa, that's how it is!

You see, and there belongs a certain wardrobe to it. If everyone is walking around in worn-out jeans and hoodies, then I don't want to hear about all those sweet and intrusive new perfumes. The exterior simply doesn't match the scent - with all due respect, Mr. Jeheimrat, I wouldn't even want to call it a fragrance anymore.
But if you take something really old-fashioned, something truly for the gentleman who takes care of himself ... I mean, wearing a suitable suit or a classic combination of a well-tailored jacket and matching trousers and then proper good shoes ... you can't just pour a sweet broth over the whole ensemble. That simply isn't appropriate!

What do you mean?
Yes, but of course! One wants to stand out a bit from all the original individualists who all wear the same original costume and walk around in jeans and hoodies ... they can't even afford proper shoes anymore. Or they are always on the go for sports because they have sneakers on their feet.
No, Mr. Jeheimrat, no one like that comes into my establishment. They don't want a proper haircut - just look at my clientele, they are all respectable people like you.
Just old-fashioned. You can see that right away.
And for that, you also need an old-fashioned fragrance. You know, something really gentlemanly.
Something from the past, when it was still common for a man to want to be a gentleman because he took care of himself.
You see, and I have something here that you certainly don't know yet.

How do you like it, sir?
I'm glad you like to hear my recommendations. Thank you very much! I always say, taste develops over the years, but it also needs opportunity.
Where was I?

Oh yes - that old-fashioned fragrance.
You see, one of the oldest men's fragrances is the Fuchsär.
So what if it's green, but it's solid and durable and above all distinguished!
No, it’s not intrusive at all. Just very much longer lasting than some expensive stuff that is considered modern. Classic is the word that applies here.
So, I'll hold the flask under your esteemed nose.
And ...?

Well, I thought so. Yaaaa, this is really, really old school! Such a thing can only be worn by a gentleman.

So green ... but a restrained green. So herbal, so natural ...
I assume this comes from oak moss.
And there - take a sniff. Do you recognize it? Anise!
Refined, I find, how it combines with the lavender. So you simply can't wear jeans and be unshaven and have messy hair with this.

But please, just a little drop behind the ear? But of course!
Certainly, this is intense, so please take only a little.
Yaaa, there are herbs in it, it's just hard to say which ones. Green, herbal, but above all not sweet. Instead, there’s a certain freshness that never overpowers. I find it really elegant. A bit of mint, I suspect.
How do you like it, sir? Yaaa, eucalyptus could also be in it.

Elegant, do you agree with me, Mr. Jeheimrat?
Resinous and woody, just as a fragrance for the real gentleman should be. It's not sweet, but masculine.
Many are quite surprised by such things nowadays ...

Yes, yes, sandalwood and cedar are definitely in there, they simply belong in it.
You see, the scent is not dark, even if it is a bit strict, resinous and perhaps creaky, but not like grandpa, but just masculine.
Green, I already said it, but also elegantly distant. It makes a better impression than many of the modern liquids ...

Lehmann, that's the name of the company. By the way, they are based here in Berlin.
I can only recommend it!
Well, I knew I wouldn't have to convince you for long. I'll give you the little flask to try out.

What do you mean?
You like it, you like it very much, I suspected so.
Well, that makes me happy! It really seems made for you!
Thank you very much for your esteemed patronage, Mr. Jeheimrat.
Honor me again soon!"
The Beat,01/30/2018,Pluto,F,353,,33,.. I am a kitten by the fireplace..,"After a long break, I spontaneously decided to shop again at Harry Lehmann, 4 fragrances last week and another 4 today. With the last order, in addition to the lovely handwritten invoice, there was also a price list included, which featured 2 fragrances that I hadn't seen on the website, so I weakened again... and only 2 aren't worth it.

Fougère, according to classification, is rather for men. Yes, I would agree with that, but it suits me quite well. Says Mr. Pluto, who smells of smoke, which I do not. Fougère starts like moist pipe tobacco, brand Sungold, green-spicy-herbaceous and develops on my skin after a while not as harsh as the other comments and statements suggest. I assert that there is a hint of vanilla or tonka bean in it, just a touch, not to sweeten, just to warm. The whole thing is finely balanced, feels grounding to me. I feel like a kitten, comfortably and contentedly napping on a cozy blanket in the kitchen by the fireplace, while the master is sitting in the armchair packing a pipe, but not lighting it, just drawing on it dry. From the ceiling hang upside-down bundles of herbs to dry, it’s twilight and the rain taps on the window. Those are my associations while wearing Fougère. Overall, I find the scent quite cozy; I know women's fragrances that I perceive as much cooler and harsher, like Cabochard, One Love, or Beyond Rose, which I appreciate as well.

Longevity and sillage are very good, the scent is noticeable, but with moderate dosing, it is not heavy. Due to the restrained freshness, Fougère is not only reserved for the cold months, but only up to 25 degrees (we usually don’t have higher temperatures - thankfully for me). And of course, it’s also for girls."
The Beat,07/07/2017,Minigolf,F,2512,,15,"The Green Harry, or How Lavender Finds Its Mossy Elegance","To be honest.. as an ""experienced"" perfumer, I had never heard of Harry Lehmann, well, I'm not ""Doctor Know-It-All."" But since the exchange with another ""Parfumo member,"" I will definitely remember the brand with bright colors ""behind my ears!!""
So I can only recommend ""Harry"" further.
No elaborate frills, an elegantly simple square bottle with the label of the respective fragrance, plain, beautiful... like in pharmacies for medicine...
And ""medicine"" is this fougère. Green medicine, a balm for the soul.
Wonderful, blue lavender fields in the first morning sun, the stems still covered with dew... light-filled pine forests all around. Scents dance in a circle and unite into a turquoise-green mélange, lavender-like, coniferous, spicy.
""Keep going, keep going...."" it whispers within me. ""This is only the halfway point... the fragrance landscape has much more to offer....!""
Field jasmine by the roadside, the scent of the flowers is herb-sweet, wild carnations with their ""royally"" herbaceous scent.....""let's pause for a moment, the bench beckons....""
I rest for a while and enjoy the olfactory greetings.....
Soon I move on, leaving the lavender field and the pines behind, but they still scent along with the flowers long after I've reached a wooded area with gnarled old, moss-covered oaks.
These radiate an almost sublime elegance in their primality. They have ""heard"" and ""seen"" a lot........ and.... ""smelled""..... ""but"" the ""Gentleman""/ ""Gentlewoman"" Lavandula from that field brings them, along with their moss, a special joy....."
The Beat,05/16/2010,Apicius,M,1328,,11,Wonderfully Traditional,"At Parfum-Individual, you get very traditional things, such as a ""Fougère."" However, how much it has in common with the original Fougère remains to be seen, as it is no longer produced and lies hidden in archives. So let's take the best of it. Unfortunately, the company Harry Lehmann does not make us familiar with the fragrance pyramid, and ""green note, elegant"" is all that is revealed about this scent.

So I will try to describe what I smell here. It lacks citrus notes. Instead, there is more of an ethereal freshness, like that of mint or eucalyptus. This is distinctly sharp, and I would consider this almost biting sharpness to be the standout characteristic of this fragrance. Thus, Fougère stands outside of today's fragrance habits and demands the corresponding openness from the wearer. The label ""Green"" is understandable. Could there be some vetiver in here? Sage? Moss? Additionally, there are woody notes; I suspect sandalwood rather than cedarwood. There must also be spices in it; I suspect a pinch of nutmeg, perhaps even cinnamon. Possibly something resinous as well. And in the top notes, there is an indefinite floral accord that fades after a while.

Am I getting close to being right? It is a ""bright"" scent; I suspect light musk in the base, although typical musky attributes like creaminess or soapiness are missing.

This Fougère is very good! It somehow comes across as penetratingly medicinal, yet dry, sharp, and in a wonderful way, gnarly, rough like a grater, and yet softened by something. Quite something different. If this is a scent from the past, then it is in a very good interpretation.

With such pleasantly affordable fragrances as those offered by Parfum-Individual, one might think of cheap fairground diesel. However, the motto ""What costs nothing is also nothing"" does not apply here at all. When I remember that recently Pierre Guillaume, with his new Papyrus de Ciane using Mousse de Saxe, has connected to very early scents, I must say - this perfume holds its own in terms of quality. I would see another kinship with some English gentlemen's fragrances, such as those offered by Castle Forbes. But this Fougère is not directly Barber-Shop-style.

I will wear Fougère occasionally and am curious if there will be reactions. I believe that those who enjoy the feeling of burning aftershave after shaving will love it. With that, I see it more as a men's fragrance."

The Beat,11/05/2014,Terra,M,646,,0,Vetiver Fougère,"I could almost say everything with the title; however, I must express my surprise. I thought the sample would be a little olfactory torture for me. Because two or three other Lehmann's that I tested I found really terrible.

I find this scent surprisingly good. I believe I smell a very green and smoky vetiver note in the foreground. Alongside it, there is something subtly fresh, perhaps slightly citrusy, but also somewhat soapy, I suspect oak moss. Overall, the scent reminds me a bit of Malizia Uomo Vetyver, but smells more robust and smoky. The development lasts surprisingly long. This robust opening lingers for several hours and becomes softer until it glides into a soft, velvety base that only shows green-smoky accents and no longer has any soapy quality.

The scent is definitely successful, I think. A little clean, but also dirty-green-smoky. Somewhat fresh and bright, but just as deep black.

Overall, everything feels a bit old school, but that is how it is intended. Nevertheless, the scent can be worn at any age and could also look great on an 18-year-old.

I tested the Eau de Cologne, which, however, is more intense than some EdPs and shows very good longevity. The scent development is remarkable, and at a price of €5 per 100ml, you can't go wrong here. The scent gives a more premium impression than much from the €50 price range and is not commonplace; so definitely worth a test."

At the beginning, I pass by the herb bed. I take a few leaves of lemon balm with me. But soon, some bitter-herb greens join in.
Then I throw away the lemon balm, randomly pluck a few more leaves, and smell again.
But then it's break time, and a cigarette is on the agenda. After that, the collection of leaves smells smoky and a bit like tobacco.

At first, I thought: I am standing in the forest, as I perceived woods, moss, ferns, etc., as well as herbs.

There must be eucalyptus in it, which brings a barely noticeable hint of freshness.

The scent is strong and lasts a long time."
Brit Gold,01/02/2025,Dionysos2022,M,946,,2,I sit in the summer at...,"... late afternoon after work in the garden and I'm just peeling a blood orange. I have prepared an orange iced tea for myself that I made early in the morning. I lean back in the chair, put my feet up, and take the book in my hand and start reading while I keep nibbling on the orange and sipping the tea.

When applying this perfume, the first thing that hits the nose is a citrusy, berry-like, and spicy scent with a decent sweet freshness. The pepper adds a bit of sharpness, there's something green from the sage, the iris gives the fragrance a powdery touch, and the lavender adds a calming effect. To make it more masculine, vanilla and wood are added, which get a mysterious vibe from the patchouli and become dry with the vetiver.

The longevity and sillage are good.

This scent is well-suited for warm days and can be worn from around 18 years old. For younger people, it feels a bit too mature for me. I would wear it during the day at the office, school, while shopping, or just relaxing in the garden. The ladies might also enjoy this fragrance due to its sweet accent.

Anyone looking for a citrusy, slightly berry-like, spicy, sweet, fresh scent with masculine accents will find a good deal here at Zara for a small price."
Brit Gold,12/27/2023,Ravn1904,M,41,,3,Short but great! (That's what she said),"A beautiful blue bottle, a good price, a nice feel - we’ll keep silent about the sprayer - good prerequisites for another surprise from Zara. But can the scent keep up? Yes, the scent definitely can. A fresh, tangy blood orange immediately reminds one of ""Polo Red (Eau de Toilette) | Ralph Lauren,"" but without the sweet warmth. Not too heavy, not too synthetic, making it a good companion for slightly warmer days, as especially on cooler days the performance quickly hits its limits. It lasts on clothing, but on the skin, the magic unfortunately fades away rapidly, requiring reapplication soon after. At this price, that's completely fine, but experienced noses will surely get bored quickly. Thus, EAU/02 Tanto Amore is more suitable for beginners."
Brit Gold,11/16/2023,GokuSan,M,11,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,A Fragrance Full of Love - Tanto Amore by Zara,"After testing my first Zara fragrance this week (Somewoody) and being really positively surprised, today I’m sharing my impressions of the second fragrance I purchased called ""Tanto Amore"". The bottle design is kept simple, with blue tinted glass and a dark wood imitation cap. The shape of the bottle bears a strong resemblance to the bottles from Mancera. The sprayer could be a bit better.

The design conveys a cool, clean, fresh, and aquatic first impression. And the scent reflects this - it clearly belongs to the ""blue fragrances"" category. I immediately thought of Yves Saint Laurent Y, which may be due to some of the similar notes such as juniper berry, sage, lavender, and vetiver. However, it is by no means a copy; it just has a certain similarity - it is an independent fragrance. In the top notes, the blood orange is very prominent, giving the scent a fruity freshness. The heart note is, as mentioned, similar to YSL Y, and the dry down is slightly woody. There are currently many fragrances on the market that follow this pattern, but Zara does it quite well here, as the interplay of the notes is quite successful. The composition sets itself apart somewhat from other blue fragrances, yet it does not forget the well-known characteristics of such scents: fresh, clean, slightly aquatic, slightly woody - you can't go wrong here, the fragrance can be worn anywhere. I especially think of sun, beach, vacation in Italy, Spain, or the South of France. Or simply spray it on right after showering; you just feel good doing it. The longevity is good for such a fragrance, I get about 7-8 hours, and the sillage is not perfect but in a good range for a freshie.

Conclusion:

Tanto Amore has convinced me. It is a good ""blue"" fragrance that gives you a nice feeling. The quality and price-performance ratio are top-notch. You can't go wrong here. I might become a Zara fan if the quality of other fragrances from the brand is just as good."
Hawthorn Bloom,12/21/2023,Sbosy,M,6,,1,Fresh!,"For me, number 2 from the Fresh collection, right after Salado. To me it is more similar to Salado than other summer/sea scents on the market. A slightly fig-like, less salty version of Salado.

Great scent, a bit salty, a bit figy, but if you expect a large amount of it based on the name, you will be disappointed.

Overall perfect unisex in my opinion :)"
Hawthorn Bloom,10/26/2025,Vik2314,M,0,,0,Good Summer Scent and Introduction to the World of Fig,"I wore Fig Man by Carner Barcelona all summer long and was very satisfied overall. The scent perfectly captures for me the feeling of a warm, sunny day. The fresh citrus notes blend with a creamy green fig and a clean, soft musk in the background. I received multiple compliments on the fragrance.

It feels light, well-groomed, and relaxed at the same time. What I particularly like is that it never comes across as too sweet or artificial. For me, Fig Man is an ideal introduction to the world of fig fragrances because it presents the note in a very natural way.

The only small point of criticism is the longevity. I would have liked it to last a bit longer on the skin, as after about five to six hours it is only subtly perceptible. Nevertheless, I wore it with joy all summer long and will surely reach for it again when the sun is shining."
Hawthorn Bloom,10/10/2022,Laguna,F,10,,0,"Citrus - warm fig - woods - warm, soft tonka","Fig Man was an addition to a sample set...a happy coincidence!

I've been eyeing fig scents for a while...I believe I can sense that they match wonderfully
with my skin chemistry...Since I don't like to be disappointed, I always wait to test my favorites...to preserve this fig dream. Now fate has assigned me a wonderful representative...

I tested the scent beforehand on a paper strip...I already liked IT very much there!
On paper, the bergamot comes through more, with the fig serving as a warm base for the wood...
It had something cedar-like, fresh, almost aquatic...masculine, suitable for a younger man who enjoys spending time outdoors, plays sports, a carefree, cheerful young man...

On my (creamed) skin, the scent appears much more complex, refined, intense, and warmer. The wonderful fig immediately emerges with the bergamot, warm and noble - hmmmm... The fig is so beautiful in this scent :-)

Later, the woods come more to the forefront...the fig becomes less prominent, the citrus a bit stronger. For a short time, I noticed the ""shower gel vibe"" mentioned below, which is somewhat disturbing and inconsistent with the initial impression.

On my skin, this shower gel character doesn't last long. The woods recede, or become softer...then merge with the more perceptible fig, which subtly supports the warm, soft creamy tonka note... From my perspective, women can wear this scent very well...It would be interesting for me to smell this scent on a man's skin...

I have fallen very much for this gentleman, and I look forward to more dates with
HIM ... hoping the enthusiasm continues ... turns into passion...perhaps into a (great) love?
If that is the case, he will move in with me...

P.S
Longevity was about 6 hours on creamed skin, sillage medium"
Hawthorn Bloom,02/14/2021,SaSu77,M,26,,2,Great fruity fig summer scent,"A fruity summer scent that smells as if you just picked fresh figs from the tree and sliced them open at that very moment.

The ingredients are surely natural and not synthetic.

I think the scent is perfect for summer and can be worn particularly well even in great heat.

In fact, I received the scent here in the perfume community as a bonus (thank you for that) and I ordered it right after. Otherwise, I wouldn't have had the scent, or the brand Carner, on my radar at all.

So, for anyone who enjoys a very naturally smelling exclusive fig scent, this is a great choice. And for a perfume lover, the price is, in my opinion, also reasonable."
Burberrys for Men,11/07/2012,jtd,M,484,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"Ho, ho, ho","There was a television commercial for make-up that aired when I was young. It tried to sell the viewer on the notion that nobody would even know you were wearing make-up! Not too bright, I took this to mean that make-up did nothing whatsoever. I thought if nobody notices, why wear it? To this day, I’ve never understood make-up.

Nuit de Noel strikes me similarly. It smells identifiably ‘perfumey’ yet on the level of perfume, it comes off as forcefully non-descript----intentionally under-recognizable. It is a soft chypre, soft like a seat-cushion filled with marshmallows. It doesn’t evolve over time so much as it fades into the skin. Once on the skin, though, it doesn’t disappear. It gives the impression of of something ostensibly hidden but easily found. It’s the person playing hide and seek who heads for the nearest tree, then hides behind it, peaking out often to see what’s happening.

Low wattage, low sillage, if you close your eyes, it might smell like either a tiny spritz of perfume or a whole lot of make-up. Great for a man if you’re willing to accept the implication."
Burberrys for Men,12/24/2014,GothicHeart,M,133,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A frame in time...,"It's a freezing and dreary day. Not just every day however. It's Christmas Eve. And a proper one I might say, since there's a lot of snow around. And what's more, I got all lucky in my ""thematic"" shopping this morning. I stumbled upon a near mint antique bottle of Nuit de Noël in a flea market, complete with its jade shagreen case, tassel and stuff, and since I've always thought of it as one of the most elegant packagings ever made, I grabbed it without further ado. I guess that wishing it was full too, would be sort of pushing my luck.
With a solid piece of history in my coat's pocket, I think that having a couple of drinks while sniffing it wouldn't be such a bad idea on this cold winter day.
So, pretending that it's 1922, I enter an old bistrot in the city's most popular square, and order a glass of fine cognac.
From where I am, I can see a girl sitting on the stairs of a building's entrance, lying opposite to the bistrot's side windows.
A cascade of fiery red hair is bursting from her beanie.
She's like a torch burning in the snow...
She has placed her bag on the cold and wet marble and she's sitting on it. She holds a small paper bag in her hands and looks excited. I wonder what the cause of her exhilaration could be. I take a sip of my cognac and smile.
What she takes out of her small paper bag makes my heart miss a beat. I recognise the plain black-capped rectangular bottle. Or, to put it better, I recognise its label. She opens it and dabs a few drops on her wrists and on the sides of her neck. Now if this is not a coincidence, then it has to be fate signing at me.
Encouraged by the spirit of the day, I decide to be a little more daring than usual and find out which of the two.
...
""I'll show you mine if you show me yours.""
Her amber eyes widen with surprise.
""What?...""
""Your Christmas Eve.""
""What about it?""
I sway my bottle in front of her eyes.
""Hey! This has the same name, but it's so more beautiful and looks so old. What is it?""
""The grandmother of yours. Care to meet her?""
She accepts my offer for a drink. After all it's freezing outside.
...
""Oh my God... This is magical...""
Although the perfume is long gone, its soul is still lingering. And sometimes an echo can be louder than the sound itself.
She remains silent with her eyes closed for quite a while. Although I suspect where she might have been drifting, I ask her anyway.
""I was trying to imagine some of the hands that once held this bottle and some of the words that were whispered because of its content being worn. Anyway, my bus leaves in four hours. Can you stand me being ecstatic for this long, oh my noble stranger?""
""Noble stranger"" is how we agreed calling each other, to maintain some of the mystery that is weaved with this special and magic day.
But in any case, I tell her that I could possibly stand her more likely for four years, if she could be that dramatic the whole time.
She smiles.
""OK, my turn now.""
Although she has it dabbed also on her wrists, she lifts her hair, tilts her head, and invites me to sniff her neck. This upretentious and impulsive gesture warms my heart. But I guess this is what this girl is all about, warming people's hearts.
I go for the sniff, and...
I don't know if it's her gesture, the perfume itself, the surrounding festive atmosphere or any combination of them, but what I smell almost brings tears in my eyes.
I struggle not to kiss her neck, but it's my apparently cold nose tip that spares me the struggle, cause it touches her skin slightly and startles her a bit.
She steps back and sees my nearly teary eyes.
""Hey you dummy... Stop spoiling me! Do I smell that good?""
""You smell like the angels working in Heaven's pastry shop, while a forest wood fire is roaring in its fireplace...""
...
She won't stop giggling and laughing heartily for the whole three hours we'll spent together. She won't stop sniffing her wrists either. She looks so happy and carefree.
It's time for her to leave and catch her bus.
We walk outside and we stand for a while, staring at each other.
I don't know what to say.
She doesn't seem to know either.
She hesitates for a moment.
Then she leans towards me and with her frail hand tracing my cheek, her lips brush mine for an instant.
And by this fragile token of affection, I know that her scent will remain on me forever.
She turns her back and starts to walk away.
After a few steps she stops and turns her head back.
""I'm Maria!"" she shouts, before vanishing in the crowd. I stand still among hundreds of people who are walking around me hastily. I light a cigarette and lean my back against a wall.
I close my eyes and try to imagine what she might be thinking when she went outside for a couple of minutes to buy a pack of cigarettes.
I close my eyes and try to imagine her surprise when she'll discover the flacon in her bag...
...
I hope you're happy beautiful Maria, wherever you are.
I never saw you grow old. I never saw you become distant. And you never saw me either.
Your icon remains immaculate in my mind, just like this little wonder that made our paths cross, that cold winter morning, 28 years ago.
Your laughter is still ringing in my ears.
And like a friendly and beloved ghost, you shall visit me once more this year, on the same day that I will allow myself a dab of the perfume that is you.
Forever young... Forever happy...
Forever my Maria from the Christmas of 1986.
My beautiful Maria of Nuit de Noël..."

Burberrys for Men,08/22/2015,DorothyGrace,F,107,,3,Smokey Whispers,"The Nuit de Noel I am today wearing is the most recent Eau de Toilette (in the bottle with a current bun top and purple box with gold dots - from somewhere around 2008 - 2010 give or take a couple of years). I am frugal with this perfume as the Eau de Toilette is no longer made; only the Parfum concentration is available. From my fragrances Aromatics Elixir is most like it in character with Aromatics Elixir (from the 1990s) being far more dense, strong, longer lasting, and a touch herbal.

Nuit of Noel is the smokey whisper hanging in the room from an open fire, Christmas oranges and brazil nuts heaped in cut glass bowls for the children to dip into as they wait for tea; the dry sweetness of sachets hung between the curtains filling the room with rose, jasmine, oris; the scent of a single languid tuberose as it mingles with sweet wood; the quiet hours before dawn, happiness and contentment.

Yes, I am frugal with this one; I simply don't want to be without it.

Still lots of scent on my skin some 12 hours after application."
Burberrys for Men,04/06/2025,Misca,F,17,,2,Christmas in Spring,"Nuit de Noël was created in 1922 by Ernest Daltroff for his lover, Félicie Vanpouille, who loved Christmas Eve. Don't be fooled by the name though, as the fragrance evokes so much more than christmas nostalgia. I would even go so far to say that this a must-have for vintage lovers. Not easy to find, I was lucky enough to get this one in a sealed box and bottle, that preserved the beauty of this essence over the decades.

It has a generous overdose of real mysore sandalwood, that, in addition to moss, adds a beautiful creamy balsamic touch to the typical Caron spice, mxsks and subtle florals. This has a woody, sensual warm, sort of exotic vibe to it, which makes it a great accessory for a night out or special occasions.

Cleopatra's Boudoir found this beautiful reference""

But, if a woman were to enter wearing Nuit de Noel, all the other women would become invisible.""**

Burberrys for Men,04/29/2014,Inger,F,112,,53,Christmas can be anytime!,"At the first whiff of Nuit de Noel, I knew right away: I want this for Christmas. It fits perfectly. At some point... after all, it was created as a Christmas surprise.

In Graz, I discovered a small perfumery - unfortunately, far too late, as they are closing now. How many beautiful fragrances did I find there, how much I enjoyed going there to browse!

Last Thursday, I was at the doctor’s and afterwards, feeling a bit down and remorseful, my little world slightly shaken, I decided to head back to that perfumery one more time. Sometimes a distraction does good.

The older couple who owns the shop greeted me with joyful smiles. They stood there as if they had been expecting me. One single bottle of Nuit de Noel was left, and they wanted to give it to me! I was touched and overwhelmed. I was so incredibly happy.

Before I got on the tram, I looked back one last time. The two were standing in front of the shop, waving goodbye to me.

I carefully brought my treasure home. Now it stands here on the old dresser, an heirloom from my grandparents-in-law. The beautiful bottle fits in so well.

I have never celebrated Christmas particularly, rather quietly and contemplatively. As a child, I always waited for the animals to start speaking on Holy Night.

Nuit de Noel is not a Christmas fragrance. The name makes it so. Nuit de Noel is a warm, soft powdery scent. The citrus fruits at the beginning immediately embrace the powdery iris, jasmine, and rose. I can smell ylang-ylang, the overwhelming oak moss, and sandalwood; the spices are present, very delicate. The vanilla note makes the fragrance so cozy and sweet. Beautifully floral and gentle is the night, slightly spicy and woody-smoky, enchanting - simply magical!

The longevity is good. Although the scent is very magical and captivating, it never pushes itself to the forefront.

Every time I smell Nuit de Noel, I am once again overwhelmed and impressed, transported to another world.

I wish to bring someone such joy too - at the right moment, when it couldn’t be more perfect. Everything else is in more powerful hands. And I know, miracles happen - not just at Christmas. It could be today or tomorrow."
Burberrys for Men,10/26/2018,Jumi,F,41,,34,The Turntable,"“Give me your hand!” The little one pulled up the even smaller one, helped her up, peeked down into the yard from above to see if their mother was watching, and closed the attic door. Their mother always scolded when the little one climbed the old squeaky ladder. And especially when she had the even smaller one in tow... But the old attic drew her in, mysterious, full of memories, and like a treasure chamber, like a magnet. They had already explored the front part, now they squeezed further between the boxes, big and small, old and older.

In one of those boxes, behind the antique brass floor lamp, they had accidentally discovered IT. A gramophone, the little one declared knowledgeably. But it was probably broken, as it was missing the long 'talking thing.' It used to play music. One of the old records from the same box was taken out, the needle placed on the record. And - nothing. “What now?” The smaller one was impatient. Frowning, the little one decided to start the concert by hand. Spinning with her little fingers, the record moved faster and squeaked, whined, and howled under the needle scratches. The little ones giggled happily and sneezed occasionally from the stirred-up dust. Then it was suddenly there. Briefly and gone. And back again. A very soft voice. They looked at each other and around in shock. “It’s the grammy thing, it works!” said the little one and began to spin the record again. And then, behind the howling and whining, a soft male tenor could be heard. What he was singing, they couldn’t understand. Nevertheless, they leaned their heads over the record, held their breath, and listened to the long, drawn-out tones. Dust danced slowly in the sunbeam pushing through the small attic window, settled on the wood of the floor and the lamp's brass, pushed the rafters apart, and let the little ones dream in the midst of a grand hall, adorned with flowers, bathed in golden light and filled with music, somewhere in 'Once upon a time.'

It’s been a long time. Now my sister and I (no longer 4 and 8) know that it was just an old turntable and one of our irrevocably scratched records that surprised us with the gentle male tenor and sent us on a “time travel.” I appreciate scents that do the same. I have only known Nuit de Noël for a short time, just two years. I like to wear it just for myself, at home, when I’m “ready to travel.” Then it catapults me back immediately to the old attic. It lays down a classic, somewhat scratchy aldehyde start, swirling up a lot of iris dust, shining brass-matt-metallic-clove-spicy, revealing its moss-covered old wood. It is neither frighteningly chypre nor dead serious soapy. In between, the floral heart sings, draws long notes, speaks an old language. Ylang and sandalwood - the tenor and the music - a tried-and-true, exotic-classic duet with a magic that still works. It has already worked in 'Samsara' and even more in 'Bois des Iles.' Here too. As if one suddenly stood in the midst of a grand hall, adorned with flowers, filled with music, bathed in warm, sweet, golden-cream light. Vanilla-happy... not like fresh young pudding, but in the old, almost “Guerlain-esque” way, serious, grown-up. And a bit out of time, with that magic of 'Once upon a time.'

P.S. The only thing that could connect the scent to Christmas for me would probably be the box with the Christmas decorations that my 4-year-old sister sat on with gusto."
Burberrys for Men,12/19/2020,Violett,F,63,,27,Fräulein Rottenmeier loosens up,"Serious. That was the first word that came to my mind when testing Nuit de Noël.
Strict, old-fashioned - extremely old-fashioned. Probably somewhat fitting for the time when it was released in 1922. I had to think of a strict governess (last name possibly Rottenmeier). In a long, modest, preferably black dress, with a collar, high-necked. Hair tied back in a severe bun and an impossible hat perched on her head. A conservative lady with very precise ideas about what is proper and what is not. If I were to meet her, I would make a quick getaway as soon as possible.
However, my first associations, which I had while strolling through the vineyards with my family on a sunny September day, do not do justice to this fragrance. They misrepresent it.
For it to unfold its beauty, it doesn’t have to be Christmas Eve. But it should at least be cold.
Bittersweet, this fragrance begins, with a somewhat stricter note right at the start. I can smell a bit of moss, I think. It certainly has a somewhat green, herbaceous, and bitter scent. Gradually, more softness and warmth unfold in a beautifully rounded, full floral scent. Calm and without intrusive sweetness. The flowers, however, are always somewhat muted and restrained by a now subtly perceptible candle wax scent. A tiny bit, I also feel reminded of forest honey by the smell, but as I said, it doesn’t get too sweet.
Then, gradually, a spicier and waxier aspect joins in.
Finally, I simply smell aromatic candles. They smell incredibly good, by the way. So good that they could be made of beeswax. A subtle bitterness and floral quality continues to resonate.
Due to its calm festivity and the many candles that I sniff in this fragrance, Nuit de Noël actually fits very well into winter, the Advent season.
And yes: Of course also for Christmas.
This is not about what we eat or drink at Christmas. No cinnamon, no cloves, nuts, almonds, etc.
It's about other aspects of the celebration.
About quiet contemplation and coziness.
About reflecting on the past year. The bitter as well as the sweet moments.
Despite everything, it doesn’t smell puritanical, but rather enjoyable and sensual.
Nuit de Noël is for me like a song that you have often listened to without much passion until you suddenly realize how great it actually is.
Often tried and then cherished.
The strict governess has donned a casual 1920s outfit and now looks really nice. Together with her, winter cold is fun. That she has accompanied Karl Lagerfeld through several winters, I do not hold against her after the initial shock."
Burberrys for Men,12/25/2021,Fabistinkt,M,31,,35,Eau Tannenbaum,"A country house, idyllically buried under the Austrian snow. Two older ladies, Omama Mitzerl and Lilibeth, sit at the kitchen table after the gift exchange. Both are visibly worn out from the Christmas Eve events.

Omama: That was the worst Christmas I have ever experienced! I need a nut schnapps to cope with this. Would you like one?

Lilibeth: Just not, thank you, no. But maybe a tiny shot of eggnog?

Omama: I'll bring you one... This is a shame, a real disgrace. I wanted to make you happy. Since morning, I've been in the kitchen slaving away and cooking for you. Just like before, as it should be. And what happens? That Luiserl is getting drunk, the kids are running amok, and the Christmas tree is burning. This is no holy night! How good that Papa doesn’t have to experience this anymore. I always made sure that Papa and Hansi had a nice Christmas. We didn’t have much money. I saved everything from my mouth so that everyone would be happy -

Lilibeth: - you are right, Mitzerl. Ingratitude is the reward of the world. Maureen from London always says that. She hired a private piano teacher for her children and paid for an expensive boarding school, far away in the countryside. And do they ever call? No! I tell you, in the end, we old ones have to stick together. And that’s why I brought you something, dear Mitzerl. I wanted to wait until after the gift exchange so that Kati and Luiserl wouldn’t get jealous.

Omama: That’s sweet. Oh, now I have nothing for you. If you want, I’ll give you two of my self-knitted -

Lilibeth: - for heaven's sake, no, thank you. That’s quite alright, Mitzerl, don’t worry about it. I know that your means are very limited. I expect nothing in return. Here, take it!

Omama: Now I’m curious! Oh, such expensive wrapping paper, what a waste... Oh, what a lovely little bottle is this?

Lilibeth: This is a perfume from France, Nuit de Noël!

Omama: Nüde - what?

Lilibeth: Nuit de Noël. That means Christmas Eve, remember?

Omama: We didn’t learn French in school, only German. And I didn’t stay long either: I had to work hard to get something to eat.

Lilibeth: That’s quite foolish, if you ask me. Foreign languages broaden the horizon. Maureen always quotes Sir Peter Ustinov: “Education is not limited to school. It goes relentlessly on until the end of life.” And he was undoubtedly right. Especially at our age, it’s important that we stay mentally fit. You get senile so quickly, don’t you, Mitzerl?

Omama: I’m not stupid yet, you know. How do I open this bottle now?

Lilibeth: It’s quite simple. Here, we carefully open the wire, then you slowly pull out the cap and dab it on yourself. A drop behind the ears, one on the wrists, and one on the décolletage. And don’t you dare drip it onto a tissue. This is not Tosca, after all!

Omama: Don’t make me laugh. Something as noble as Tosca I’ve never had, only cologne.

Lilibeth: Cologne, that thin soup? We used to call that cleaning lady perfume. Can you smell something already? The perfume contains rose oil from Provence. Very fine and powdery, with a slight bitterness from the iris root. I also think there’s a bit of clove in it. And real oak moss metaphorically transports the darkness of the evening. Do you smell the gloom, Mitzerl?

Omama: No. But it really does smell good, like the ointment from Interspar!

You can watch the two wonderful anti-Christmas films with Mitzerl and Lilibeth on YouTube. Happy holidays!

Burberrys for Men,05/19/2014,Florblanca,F,1168,,24,Which crazy person tests Nuit de Noël at 25° C...,"One cannot be crazy enough as a perfumist to not test such a fragrance even at 25° C. So I tested it. It almost knocked me out, but only almost!

Right off the bat: Nuit de Noël is such a beautiful scent that it takes my breath away, which is due not only to its beauty but also to the power of this Caron.
In any case, it contains everything that is listed in the pyramid and even more! In the opening, I sense more aldehydes than citrus fruits, and the iris! Dry, yes, powdery, it already makes an appearance in the top notes.

And then the fragrance - and I - open our hearts! Jasmine and rose, ylang-ylang and vanilla, in a richness that can leave entire theaters fainting. These flowers are so beautiful here, so soft and perfectly intertwined, and they smell with an incredible strength that occasionally made me run out to the balcony for fresh air. So much for the sillage!

I tested simultaneously on a scent strip and on my skin, and the test strip has been sitting on the table for 5 days now, scenting the whole room. So much for the longevity!

Oak moss and sandalwood best stabilize the fragrance, but they do not give it a distinct scent note.

Strangely, I do not think of Christmas or the Advent season at all here, but rather of a church space lavishly adorned with these flowers, prepared for a wonderful wedding!
The flowers are covered all around with moist moss to keep them fresh for a long time. White jasmine, yellow ylang-ylang, and champagne-colored roses. In between, branches of light and red wood.
I can see the scenario right in front of me and would love to step into this church immediately, but I do not want to damage the petals scattered on the floor. The sight is heavenly - and the scent even more so!

That Nuit de Noël should only be worn on cold days - that is, autumn and winter - is not a question for me. In this respect, the Christmas idea fits again. The dosage should be as fine and minimal as possible; otherwise, there is a risk of suffocation!

Nuit de Noël is indeed one of the most beautiful Carons, and anyone who does not know it should definitely get to know it. Just a sample is worth it, and I thank a very dear perfumist for mine.

Addendum 28.06.2014
In the meantime, I have brought home a vintage lotion of Nuit de Noël and, in joyful anticipation, immediately decanted 30ml and sprayed some on my wrist. But what was that???? A very animalic note flew around my ears, or rather, my nose, and it took about 45 minutes for the true Nuit de Noël scent to assert itself. Yet despite the weak concentration - lotion is comparable to the EdC - the fragrance lasts incredibly long and gives me what the extrait de parfum does from the very first second: a dream scent from Caron. Had I encountered this lotion BEFORE the extrait, my great love for Nuit de Noël might not have happened..."
Burberrys for Men,12/23/2012,Esclarmonde,F,37,,28,Passing on the Flame,"Who doesn’t know, love, and cherish the annual rituals? Only in recent years have I become increasingly aware of how valuable rituals and traditions within a family or community are! Only since my father passed down the cherished family recipe for THE Christmas dinner, which has been cooked in my family for generations and ONLY on Christmas Eve, do I recognize from a new perspective how beautiful it all was, back then, at home. My father no longer has an audience. The kitchen remains cold, the children are all gone. Instead, our parents now take their seats on Christmas Eve at my brother’s table - and are served the Christmas dinner there! Meanwhile, I cook the dish for my beloved's family. Last week, my father was overjoyed to shop for ingredients with me, which deeply touched me. Because - as one of my favorite sayings goes - tradition is not the preservation of ashes, but the passing on of the flame.

But: The rituals, the magic, one must also create as an adult; it doesn’t come entirely on its own. One must buy and decorate the tree to make the living room cozy. One must invite guests to become a festive gathering. One can also dress up nicely to avoid feeling like it’s just another day off in sweatpants on Christmas.
So, I strive to create my own traditions. I dress up on Christmas Eve (just like my father used to, standing in the kitchen in a white shirt and dress pants!) and cook all morning and into the afternoon. I put on something nice, style my hair up, play festive music, wear jewelry, and - guess what - yes, a lovely fragrance.

Now we have arrived at the core of the matter, which you might know: which one? As someone with numerous fragrances, one often finds oneself in the position on special days to crown one as the royal scent, to choose the one that suits best at that moment. I often find myself staring blankly into my fragrance drawer for minutes on end during birthdays, celebrations, days when I’ve accomplished something, or on special occasions. Meditatively.
This year, I will initiate a new tradition. This year, Nuit de Noel has come to me.

I have read so much and so varied about Nuit de Noel that it confuses me. It starts with the pyramid: Caron itself reveals only three notes on the website, namely jasmine, Saxon moss, and amber. Saxon moss is supposed to smell similar to oak moss? In another place, I read a pyramid that contains no iris, which already rules out my perception of the fragrance: I recognize a delightful iris note that lasts for quite some time!

There are also many tales about the creation of Nuit de Noel. Ernest Daltroff is said to have dedicated the fragrance to his beloved and business partner, Felicie Wanpouille (who, by the way, was also responsible for the packaging at the house), who supposedly loved the magic of Christmas. A lovely thought. Furthermore, he is said to have tried to capture the scent of fresh marron glacé, candied chestnuts, in Nuit de Noel. A hint of Christmas desserts, then. Also a lovely thought. But: Do we even need these thoughts for a fragrance that is clearly dedicated to Christmas Eve? Don’t we each have our own wonderful associations that come to mind? So, I was curious and eager to test the Christmas magic and introduce a new festive fragrance tradition - perhaps, if I like it.

And: Nuit de Noel pleases! Even though it is not an easy character, I had to sniff it for days to learn to appreciate it. None of the pyramids I found list cloves or other spices, which is surprising because the very first and also lasting impression is one of pronounced spiciness. Clove, cinnamon… something in that direction. In the background, the Caron rose. Underneath, a bitter amber note. The fragrance also has something green (the Saxon moss, perhaps!?), which does not bring any coldness. And then, after a few minutes, the iris! Suddenly it appears, stepping forward from behind the other notes and becoming very prominent. Simply beautiful!

Thus, Nuit de Noel smells of noble, dry spices, subtle flowers, and amber as well, but by no means like a Christmas fragrance blend, not like a potpourri for the house or an attempt to conjure up roasted almonds and cotton candy from the Christmas market. The vanilla remains quite subtle in the background. It is also not light or overwhelmingly lively-floral. It slightly reminds me of L’Air du Temps by Nina Ricci, due to the clove spice note.

I dream of Christmas Paris on Christmas Eve. I imagine the festive city, snow-covered, Notre Dame on its island, Sacre Coeur glowing in the starry night from afar. A dark shadowy blue lies over the enchanted parks and streets, warm festive light spills from the tall windows into the biting cold streets..."

To all devout Catholics, bow and sorry, the roasted Christ Child is meant symbolically, but otherwise, nothing is sacred to me and our family is a wild mix of atheists, agnostics, Protestants, Jews (way back in the family tree), and Buddhists. But we all celebrate the holidays. We have no Catholics in the background. However, Christmas is sacred to us. Blasphemy!
This is a scent to my husband's taste (whom I want to weave in here again), because he hates most of my chypres and finds some orientals ""overwhelming,"" but with the Carons, he has so far said: ""Noble, noble, noble.""
So what do I do now? Get Nuit de Noel for seduction over 50-year-olds at Christmas? Scratch head.
NdN starts almost restrained and subtle. Well, none of us is really in the Christmas mood yet when gingerbread is lying around in the supermarket in early September.
But then it ramps up, the Christmas markets are being set up! The Strietzelmarkt in Dresden! The most beautiful Christmas market in Germany, ah all these scents and impressions are conveyed by NdN.
Later, a dreamy and almost cozy floral note joins in. Iris and Ylang-Ylang, I could lose myself in this fragrance!
Despite oak moss and all the other ingredients in the base, not a chypre!

Burberrys for Men,12/31/2013,Chanelle,F,752,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Christmas Time (Don't Let The Bells End),"I probably have a rare mental illness, but when it comes to this fragrance in connection with Christmas, the only evergreen that comes to mind is the one mentioned above by The Darkness, whose title I borrowed to express my emotions succinctly.
Nuit de Noel is a true masterpiece, a classic, so to speak the Shalimar from the house of Caron. Unfortunately, Caron is not as famous in Germany, or perhaps worldwide, as it should be. The quality, composition, and longevity (I am referring to a 90s edition) are brilliantly good.
However, it must be noted that the scent is not for everyone.
You really have to like iris! I have no problem with iris or its root, and thus I enjoy the fragrance from the iris-heavy top note, through the development into the rosy, and also the chypre base.
I wouldn't dare to call the scent a chypre. I also wouldn't classify it as a gourmand; it is too oriental, woody, and smoky for that. Nevertheless, I do not find it heavy, in the sense of Shalimar, Habanita, and other recognized classics of its era.
Christmas, in my opinion, is not sensual; it is rather gender-neutral, whether Jesus was born or not.

Nuit de Noel expresses for me the joy that Christmas can bring, the zest for life, the anticipation, and the unrestrained joy one feels when a chapter of life has been successfully completed. Above all, however, it expresses innocent, childlike love that brings shining eyes."

Burberrys for Men,04/17/2014,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,The Spirit of Christmas on Its Easter Vacation,"After Je Riviens completely failed today, at least Caron kept its word and didn’t tarnish its good reputation. Especially not with one of the absolute classic ladies' fragrances from their house. Caron is a very solid brand with great scents - I’m just mentioning Troisiemme Homme, Yatagan, or Pour Un Homme. So, over the last century, enough joy has accumulated for men. How the ladies' classics from the house will perform remains to be seen. I am extremely curious about Tabac Blond. But today, it was Nuit de Noel's turn.

Powdery iris, a bit of rose, a lot of sweet moss, which I have rarely if ever smelled - sounds like a rather un-Christmasy mix. True, it fits almost better in spring. Only a bit of cinnamon and vanilla remind of December. The rest is universal, beautiful, and not for those who don’t like powdery perfumes. I love powdery and sweet perfumes, so I’m in the right place here. Definitely one of the sweetest and most modern chypres ever.

Bottle: much more Christmasy than the scent.
Sillage: quite strong, but definitely not a pure winter perfume for me.
Longevity: solid 7 hours - neither more nor less.

A beautiful floral oriental chypre - if such a thing should exist. A must-sniff for iris lovers, so I’m surprised it doesn’t score even better with me..."

In the form of ""Nuit de Noel"". Translated into German, it means ""Holy Night"", ""Christmas"".
But this fragrance is much more and intended for so many more occasions than just the Christmas season..
And not just for winter, although it generates a cozy warmth through its flowers, mosses, and woods.
Even in the initial scent with its warm, citrus notes (probably bergamot and neroli), this Eau de Parfum opens a sequence of fine spice, with a hint of clove and cinnamon, before the flowers join in; I can already sense the soft mosses.
Like in a forest in early spring on the first mild days.
A lasting ""wave"" of slightly smoky vanilla and olibanum in the depth of the fragrance.
A pull of the seasons, letting summer, winter, autumn, and spring pass by.
A greeting of eternity and eternal change.
A wonderful fragrance that knows no real boundaries."
Burberrys for Men,11/15/2010,Lotus,M,65,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,CHRISTMAS??? Nuit in the Shady Pine...,"Well, I was really looking forward to the scent, it is supposed to be great from everything I've read about it, and Mr. Lagerfeld always carries a bottle with him in December (I think he just carries it!!!)
Well, the top note knocked me out.... why isn't it mentioned in the above details that the aldehydes hit you like a ton of bricks (and I have big ears)? But I should have guessed that it wouldn't be a soft, quiet scent, given that it was released in 1922, what can you expect but endless aldehydes.
No, it's not my thing.... too bad because I would have loved to have it lol
Just the name NUIT DE NOEL::::: sounds so poetic..... but no, it comes like a snowstorm and the aldehydes knock you out,
apparently I have the reformulated version, it suits ladies with silver hairspray and fur coats, but really not a modern young woman.... Then I'd rather have Havana Vanilla, or Oriental Dreams by Montale, that's Christmas but not this, this is more like Nuit in a nursing home.....))"
Burberrys for Men,11/25/2010,Fran,F,253,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,"Lotus, take me with you, don't leave me here...","... in the Shady Pine! I not only feel too young for this, I actually am. I hope I have many years ahead of me before I move into these legendary halls. I also wouldn't want to spend Christmas here; it's all too nostalgic, too festive, and too s-teif (with a sharp ""st"") for me. And - yes, too old-fashioned. Christmas à la 1922 is not quite to my taste.

I quickly go to the corner and shamefully admit that I can't warm up to this venerable creation. I philistine. Although I have a few years under my belt, too old-fashioned, too aldehydic, and too ""madammig"" has never been my thing.

I acknowledge that Caron has created a high-quality and exclusive fragrance here, which is very soft and round and particularly shines in the base, which is warm-woody with a hint of vanilla. But both the top and heart notes are, for my nose, classically old-fashioned - and thus not for me.

But that's okay; I have lovely plans for Christmas with family & friends, lots of good food, plenty of relaxation, and fun, with Swinging Christmas Songs, somewhere between festive and casual. And I'm sure I'll find a more suitable fragrance for me than Nuit de Noël."
Oud Storm,05/23/2025,ClaireV,F,969,,1,The Jicky boldness of this thang!,"Royal Parvati is Jicky (Guerlain) as seen through an indie sandalwood haze. The resemblance to civet-laden Guerlain classics is helped along by (I suspect) either a dollop of black-brown ambergris, with its intimate, halitosis-like funk, or a synthetic civet material. The lime-peel brightness in the opening recreates with eerie accuracy the famous ‘curdled cream’ topnote of both Jicky and Shalimar. In the case of Jicky and Shalimar, it is the meeting of lemon and vanillin that prompts this effect. In Royal Parvati, it is likely the cream of the sandalwood interacting with the silvery, high-toned topnotes of the Peru balsam or orris root. It never fails to amaze me that the complex note interactions that makes a Jicky or a Shalimar so distinctive can be arrived at – whether accidentally or otherwise – by smashing other materials with broadly similar effects into each other at high velocity.

Over time, the filthy ambergris or civet swells up even further, impregnating every fiber of the creamy woods. Royal Parvati eventually settles on the aroma of split logs in an Indian sandalwood forest – humid and milky – but with the crotchy funk of a hot woodsman who has marked his territory by rubbing his nether regions into the grain of the wood. The result is a deeply musky, civety wood scent that gives you all the naughty bits of an unneutered Guerlain without weighing you down in baby powder. In my humble opinion, Royal Parvati is one of the true standouts of indie oil perfumery."
Midnight Journey,08/10/2025,SunShine1110,F,180,,0,A Sweet Surprise...,"I have now tried many Lattafa fragrances, including ""Yara / يارا (Eau de Parfum) | Lattafa / لطافة"", which didn't exactly blow me away. It feels a bit too synthetic for me and doesn't match my skin. However, the ""Yara / يارا (Perfume Oil) | Ard Al Zaafaran / ارض الزعفران التجارية"" from Lattafa surprised me in a positive way.
Compared to the Eau de Parfum, which, as I said, seems rather artificial, almost ""squeaky"" to my nose, the oil is significantly more pleasant, softer, and also more balanced.

The scent starts fruity and slightly floral with tangerine, orchid, and a hint of heliotrope, creating a gentle, fresh opening. The oil remains oily on the skin for quite a while before it absorbs. It quickly becomes creamier and sweeter, with a distinctly gourmand note and tropical fruits that don't push themselves too much to the forefront. The drydown is my personal highlight: vanilla, musk, and sandalwood blend into a warm, skin-close scent that lasts long without being overpowering.

The ""Yara / يارا (Eau de Parfum) | Lattafa / لطافة"" is for me a squeaky sweet and strawberry-like scent, a strawberry cream dessert with a lot of cloying synthetic notes.
The ""Yara / يارا (Perfume Oil) | Ard Al Zaafaran / ارض الزعفران التجارية"" is more like a fine strawberry sorbet sweetened with bourbon vanilla, leaving a pleasantly fruity sweetness on my skin.

I particularly appreciate this restraint in the fragrance. The oil stays close to the skin but still has presence. No piercing or disturbing notes, just a rounded, soft, and feminine scent that suits almost any occasion if you like gourmand fragrances.

For me, the Perfume Oil is clearly the better choice - more elegant, natural, and much more pleasant than the Eau de Parfum, and the wonderfully small roller fits perfectly in any handbag or travel luggage."
Burberrys for Men,12/30/2023,Ratigail,F,18,,1,An insant staple,"I first tried Yesterday from Scentbird over a year ago -- my very first Scentbird order, and really my very first attempt at trying out perfume outside of some Bath & Body Works sprays I liked in high school. An insanely lucky first choice, because it's one I've reached for constantly and eventually repurchased.

The application is immediately bright, spicy and woody -- the vetiver and cardamom don't hold any punches. But the dry-down smooths the spice down with its citrus notes (that always makes me think green apple, even if apple isn't actually present) and sweet geranium. While this scent remains spicy, it's so nicely balanced with the fresh, crisp, sweet notes that come in during the wear that no note is truly overpowering the other. They work together to take you on a journey.

The mix of notes makes this a solidly unisex fragrance. I find that it lasts for most of the day, fading in strength at probably the six hour mark. The woody-spice aspect of it leaves a bit of a trail, but not offensively so.

Easily an everyday, all-year round scent for me ️"
Burberrys for Men,05/24/2025,Musicandarts,M,227,,1,A lovely rhubarb fougere fragrance that is versatile,"Yesterday is a rhubarb and bergamot fougere perfume from Room 1095, created by Amélie Bourgeois. This brand projects a counterculture personality that is well-displayed on their website. My curiosity was spiked when I saw this brand on Jovoy Paris and I ended up getting two samples. This review was initially written for a sample vial from Jovoy, but it has been updated after I got a full bottle.

The Room 1095 website lists bergamot, caraway, sweet orange, basil, thyme, cardamom, lavender, rhubarb, davana, vetiver, sandalwood, musk, amber woods and tonka bean as the main notes. The notes reveal this perfume to be an aromatic variant of the classic fougere, with rhubarb and davana replacing the floral notes from the typical fougere formula. The top notes open strong with bergamot, orange and some minor aromatic notes. Caraway, basil, thyme and cardamom are not identifiable as separate notes but could be contributing to the mildly sweet aromatic accord. The lavender and rhubarb from the middle are perceptible almost immediately. I won’t be surprised if some noses list lavender and rhubarb as opening notes. The rhubarb is long-lived on my skin and defines this perfume. Some of the sweeter notes from the bottom percolate up into the heart notes, producing a beautiful woody, musky, aromatic body. The base notes on my skin are woody notes flavored with musk, vetiver and tonka. This is a nicely blended ending, so most notes don’t stand out individually. I can still smell some of the rhubarb from the heart notes in the end. The transition from middle to bottom notes is not very defined.

The performance of Yesterday is excellent on my skin, very much in line with a rhubarb-fougere fragrance. The main notes last for 6-8 hours, but the projection is not monstrous. I recommend this as a versatile work perfume, if you don’t mind the rhubarb.

Yesterday is a beautiful modern interpretation of the classic fougere formula. If you are interested in this olfactory pyramid, you should also check out the very similar Jovoy 21 Conduit St. The Jovoy perfume has a green cannabis-like accord in the opening, and rhubarb disappears earlier than Room 1095 Yesterday, giving it a slightly more gourmand vibe. Both are great perfumes in my opinion, with Yesterday exhibiting less variations in its progression. They are both similarly priced, around $130 for 100 ml."
Burberrys for Men,07/09/2025,AlexD76,M,103,,1,A Walk Down Memory Lane,"Inspired by a Beatles song, Yesterday attempts to focus the bittersweet sensation of looking back, while keeping you firmly rooted in the here and now.
It's a personal and contemplative fragrance that sits close to the skin. It feels like it's inviting you to reflect quietly, much like going through old pictures or remembering a moment in time that brings you joy. The initial bit of freshness dies down to soft warmth, which feels impressively familiar.
The ""yesterday"" theme may make you think this is purposely vintage, or overtly retro-aesthetic, but Room 1015 has done a remarkable job of blending classic notes into contemporary vision. It feels timeless instead of tired. It is the sort of fragrance you would wear for yourself, in moments of wanting to feel connected to your own past-but unencumbered as well."
Burberrys for Men,04/14/2018,Windspiel,M,3,,15,Perfect Summer Fragrance,"Hello Parfumos

I have been reading for a long time and today I am also giving a review. Although I didn't really want to expand my collection again, the rising temperatures lured me back into the perfumery I trust. This time it should be a summer fragrance. Citrusy, fresh, long-lasting, as natural as possible. These requirements are hard to meet, because first of all, most citrus fragrances tend to quickly fall into a cheap heart note, and secondly, they often have a very modest longevity. On top of that, my signature scents are more spicy and oriental (at the moment I prefer Idole by Lubin).

Enough of the backstory. The salesperson listened to my requirements and confidently reached for Yesterday by Room 1015. First sprayed on the strip and yes, the genre was not reinvented. But the top note perfectly matched my expectations that I had when visiting the perfumery. However, most other citrus fragrances do that too, until they unfortunately quickly become unpleasant. So the skin is sprayed and the store is left.

Yesterday has a powerful sillage at the beginning. If someone had been searching for me at that moment, they could have turned off the tracking device and just used their nose. The scent brought a relaxed smile to my face in combination with the sunny weather. I constantly had to hold my nose to the sprayed spot and take another deep sniff. The aroma is almost purely citrusy. I even thought I could detect a hint of lavender, although this ingredient was not used. The fragrance is definitely harmonious with a tendency to be euphoric, depending on the weather and mood.

The best part: even after an hour, the top note held strong. The scent remained more or less constant at one level and did not transform, like so many other citrus fragrances, into a chemically smelling stink bomb that smells more like toilet stone than perfume. Some representatives of this genre don't even make it to the heart note, but disappear as quickly as they came. In this case, there is a citrus note in the head, heart, and base. Through and through! Even after 6 hours, this pleasant scent was still clearly noticeable on the skin. After 8 hours, it noticeably faded. The performance in this genre is incredibly good.

The perfume has been added to the collection and will be regularly sprayed this summer. I like it very much, even though the wheel was not reinvented. Anyone looking for a great, summery niche perfume that has above-average performance and wonderful naturalness should definitely try this fragrance. Unisex factor: high."
Burberrys for Men,01/23/2024,Serenissima,F,1222,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,the enchanting scent of yesterday and tomorrow,"Flacons, small bottles, samples, test strips, and those contact strips in magazines and journals contain not only fragrant chemical compounds; they contain so much more:
Dreams, memories, and hopes; they tell stories, little anecdotes, and sometimes they also refuse to reveal themselves to us: Then they simply remain silent during testing.
Every now and then, one still finds access to them; but most of the time, one has to come to terms with the silence of a fragrance and look for other beauties.
Fortunately, we have the choice.

""Yesterday"" represents for me, especially now in the middle of winter, both memories and hopes; for the summer of yesterday and tomorrow:
Memories of last summer and hope for the one that will come.

After just a few spritzes, I find myself in the midst of a rustic Mediterranean garden; the sun warms and a gentle breeze playfully tugs at the hem of my light skirt: I have left the winter skins behind; perhaps they lie in the small stone farmhouse across the way.
It is beautiful here: Everything is a bit more rustic, no fence, no hedge separates this pleasantly herbaceous wilderness from the expanse of blooming lavender fields that stretch in gentle rises and falls towards the distant mountain ranges.
The spicy scent on my skin is a blend of these and the fresh-spicy aromas of the nearby citrus grove with its lushly leafed trees, whose lacquer-like dark green leaves and numerous fruits in varying degrees of ripeness and colors from bright unripe light green to vibrant yellow and gold-orange: A caress for the senses.
Green and herbaceous spiciness from this kitchen garden clearly dominates: What would Mediterranean cuisine be without robust thyme and basil with its well-known peppery note?
I do not recognize every herb in the fragrance blend, but I delight in every scent note that wraps around me like a gentle embrace.
Of course, woody and earthy nuances also belong to a balanced fragrance profile:
Old acquaintances from many base creations meet us here in the form of sandalwood and vetiver.
A light cloak for cooler moments must not be missing.
But instead of the usual rich, warmly embracing vanilla aromas with the familiar slightly animalistic-erotic undertone, to my surprise, a good dose of the more innocent tonka bean cuddle scent has been woven here into a harmonious finale, this time paired with white musk, and together with the other richly developed fragrance notes, it evokes one of the lilac and golden, so romantic sunsets of Provence and its beautiful scent paintings.

Sillage and longevity are very rounded and balanced for such a summery composition.
This creation awakens with its summery Mediterranean charm the memory of many past summers and at the same time the hope for the coming one.
I like this, because how quickly in our time ""The day after tomorrow"" is already ""Yesterday."""

Instantly recognizable as an Andy Tauer.

Brit for Men Limited Edition 2010,05/28/2015,Palonera,F,467,,26,...and yet...,"Whenever I am about to encounter a Tauer, I am as excited as I once was before a date.
This has been the case since ""Desert Air,"" which continued with Andy's Cologne - and since ""Miriam,"" I have been smitten anyway.
At least a little bit.
They certainly don't make it easy for me, the Tauers, none of them - they have edges and corners, they are rough, sometimes almost shy, stubborn, quirky, and in a touching way, defenseless, almost vulnerable.
No scent that reveals itself in a day, no scent that, just applied, names the destination of the journey.
Patience, mindfulness, and openness.
Time and leisure, letting things happen - expectations are hindrances.
Lessons that not only Tauer teaches - but one Tauer in particular.

After ""Miriam"" had stolen my heart and ""Loretta"" had played her confusing game with me, a lot of time was to pass before ""Ingrid"" stood before me.
I had no idea what to expect - I thought of Ingrid Bergman, the cool Swede, of Ingrid Steeger, and of Aunt Ingrid.
Three women who could not be more different - the one ethereal-elegant, the second the embodiment of voluptuous femininity, and the third round and radiant, small and gray with a heart of pure gold.
And finally ""Ingrid"" in an unassuming vial that revealed nothing of its content and nature.
What would this time be the secret?

Five days have passed since then.
Five days during which ""Ingrid"" has accompanied me through sun, wind, and rain, at the academy as well as playing with my children, with my beloved on the sofa, and in the supermarket between milk and bread.
Five days, during which mornings ""Ingrid"" envelops me without any detour through any kind of freshness in a light plaid of finely woven, amber-golden threads, light and delicate, closely hugging my skin yet floating, barely touching in its transparency.
Dimly glowing cinnamon, dry, almost dusty, neither sharp nor sweet, free of any ballast.
Clove, heated, spicy, its taste deep on the tongue.
""Dried fruits,"" says the man who shares his life with me.
Not for me, for my nose - but what do I know.
A hint of ""Theorema"" - a cocoon, tender, soft, fragile yet stable, hour after hour, morning and noon and night.
No flowers, no blossoms, no leaves on my skin - only deeper it goes, warmer it becomes, dark golden incense resin, soft, very soft, gently merging with powder dust, sandalwood dust, shy in the coolness, shimmering on sun-warmed, velvet-creamed skin.
A hint of sweetness, dark, crackling, needle-fine tips under bronze brocade, in its folds the scent of fine soap, dull-silky shifting in the flickering light.
Soft and serious, gentle and strong, restrained yet always present, always close, always with me.
The whole long day, the whole short night - and even the next morning, her smile lingers in the pillows."

Her London Dream,02/12/2024,Landshark321,M,746,,4,Outstanding honey / baklava scent,"Zaharoff Signature Aurum is the second-to-most recent release of the house, a captivating honey-rich scent that captures the baklava dish with lots of nuance, including notes of honeycomb, cinnamon, mixed nuts, vanilla, and tonka. It’s sweet and rich while not being overly sweet, with a vaguely floral brightness that makes it feel more honeyed that perhaps a baked good, at least to me, and a lot more wearable for those that find gourmands challenging or overbearing. This is a great answer for those, and takes for the form of a unisex fragrance that has great density without being at all overdone in any one aspect, its balance demonstrating the care and patience that went into it. I guess it’s the first gourmand of the Signature line, but I hope it’s not the last, as it’s yet another outstanding expansion of the line into new territory, a further challenge met and exceeded against. I really love this creation, definitely among my favorite honey scents with Zoologist Bee and Hiram Green Slowdive, albeit not as syrupy as Bee and not as spicy as Slowdive, nor as floral as either, fitting for a gourmand. To my nose, it does not evolve a ton, a little sharper at first spray and a little smoother and creamier in the dry down, but that’s to be expected, frankly.

The line’s pricing remains very reasonable for a high-quality, high-performance product, especially at the greater size, at $195/155 for 120/60ml, sold through the house website exclusively in the US, I believe.

Burberry,06/01/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,,11,Arabian Dentists on Company Outing,"And the journey through the Rasasi fragrance palette continues. This one is not a home run like Tasmeem, but certainly wearable, even here in the West.

We're heading straight towards the famous mushroom wood, as the name suggests, Khaltat Al Oudh. However, it is not as extreme an oud bomb as I initially thought after first testing it on tissues. It smells predominantly of wood/oud and rose. Additionally, I have strong associations with clean leather, for example, in a luxurious dental practice. Not quite as extreme as the Vetiver from Guerlain, but there is a certain disinfected purity. Perhaps this is also due to the sweet amber combined with the aforementioned old acquaintances. Overall, it is dark but not sad, pure but not really clean, Arabic yet somehow cosmopolitan. A versatile fragrance for many occasions with an undeniable Arabic touch.

The bottle is fine and unembellished, at least for a Rasasi. Therefore, there is hardly any plastic or fake diamonds. Very good. The sillage is strong, but significantly inferior to the other Rasasi oud bombs. Which is good, because those are on the edge of wearability, and this one is far from weak. Longevity is absolutely good at 8-10 hours, much longer than the Western average, which is largely due to the profound oud scent.

With M7, the oud enchanted me. With the Rasasi fragrances, that magic is gone; it feels dark, Arabic, mysterious, earthy, and slightly musty and sweaty. However, the perfume discussed here is definitely wearable and a nice rose cavalier with a career aspiration of dentist and a lot of oud in the suitcase."
Burberry,06/18/2014,Jensemann,M,217,,8,Blindbuy Must-Have!,"""Khaltat Al Oudh"" by Rasasi is a blindbuy must-have. For under €10, the buyer gets a classic rose-oud scent. The theme of these two fragrance notes is not new, but they are usually priced differently. At first glance, one might hardly pay attention to the bottle with a smile, but once the spray settles on the skin, the eyes are wide open.

A bargain with decent qualities! How can that be?

Rasasi seems to have it figured out. From the very first moment, you can sense the juiciness of the rose, which is beautifully interpreted. Along with a bit of oud, which gives off a typical hairspray note, and a hint of musk that adds a touch of softness to the fragrance. It sounds quite simple. And it already has Montale-quality, though not quite the punch that they possess, but that doesn't always have to be the case. The wearer just has to forgo a bit of sillage. If you prefer something a bit more subtle compared to Montale, Rasasi is just right.

The rose is as fantastic as I have never smelled in any other rose-oud fragrance. Not musty heavy, but delicate and still fine, intricate. The oud plays a background role here and comes across rather ethereal, neither particularly musty nor fecal, which harmonizes well with the rose.

Burberry,11/17/2018,Minigolf,F,2512,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Sandalwood-Rose Soap.....,"......just as I remember it from the past.
In many places, there were small Oriental shops in the 70s and 80s that offered a lot of ""Indian"" and ""Afghan"" items. From colorful cotton blouses to flowing robes and baggy trousers, as well as the finest fragrance oils and soaps.
I used to buy those beautiful scents in small bottles and the soaps every now and then back then.
Nowadays, you can search for these shops with a magnifying glass, but fortunately, there are brands like ""Al Haramain,"" ""Swiss Arabian,"" and not least ""Rasasi"" that offer such ""old-fashioned-beautiful"" perfumes that are not too expensive.
I experience this fine surprise with ""Khaltat al Oudh,"" which I swapped for here. A finely spicy woody-bitter rose defines the entire scent progression. However, it does not remain static and uniform at a certain scent level but slowly transforms through various ""phases.""
From the slightly dominating woods at the beginning, over a slightly dominating rose around the middle, to notes that ""hand over"" like amber... then fine patchouli with a hint of musk... finally back to rose-sandalwood, delicately soapy, with a tendency towards floral-bitter-sweetness.
A scent property that probably only comes to life through the interplay with the ""quirky"" sandalwood. Because this wood has so many olfactory facets and tones that it could even be considered a standalone perfume.
And if, as it seems with ""Khaltat al Oudh,"" the real thing has been used, it's definitely a much more nostalgic scent for little coins.
