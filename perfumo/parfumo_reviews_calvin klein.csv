CK Be,09/28/2023,IlMillimetro,F,4,,1,The song of a bamboo forest,"I'm a haiku lover: so simple to read, very difficult to write, disarmingly innocent. Here there is few room for interpretation: it's all clear from the beginning. This perfume celebrates silence or, maybe, the song of a bamboo forest. The opening is pure, citrusy bergamot with just a touch of rhubarb to give a bitter touch. The evolution of Amai Arashyiama plays with your imagination: some green, very smooth and woody note contribute to create a bamboo accord, sweetened by sugar and bamboo milk. As the fragrance dries down, the vertical structure of this bamboo forest invites your soul to elevation: another accord, this time a sacred one...incense. Defilitely not a liturgical one but more of a resinous, traditional frankincense smoke.
So easy to wear, the fragrance is not overwhelming and the projecetion is quite intimate (which to me is a plus!)"
CK Everyone,12/14/2013,Gold,F,726,,1,Unpretentious,"Olivier Pescheux created many best-selling fragrances, for example ""1 Million for Man"" for Paco Rabanne, ""Iris Noir"" and ""Voile d'Ambre"" for Yves Rocher or ""Feérie"" for van Cleef&Arpels. But he also did many ""niche"" scents for Diptyque. ""Let's move"" is a fragrance Pescheux composed for Benetton in 2012 and it's probably not going to become a blockbuster. Why? I guess it's too light and fresh and the formula is too commonplace. Up front we have citrus&pepper, followed by lavender&cedar. Tonka&vanilla smooth down the edges with their customary softness. ""Let's move"" is a very open and unpretentious scent, but it will probably not manage to insinuate itself into classic male cologne status. Not modern enough, not sexy enough, too quiet. But quite likeable."
Eternity for Men,11/10/2025,Ahmed22Ali,M,1,,1,Good for winter nights,"I completely in love with the scent of this fragrance the rosemary and the bergamot in the opening are great Start in dry down it's going darker with the woody notes and leather joining. It is very similar to amouage interlude black iris . Maybe more fresh in the opening.
Scent 9/10
Performance 8/10
Giving me 2 hours of projection and 7 to 8 hours of staying on the clothes and maybe 3 hours on the skin"
Eternity Moment,10/04/2025,riaxx,F,9,,1,This is everything that was missing in the original in my opinion,"I always felt like such a weirdo, when the original Libre wasn't my fav, I didn't hate it, it just wasn't me. Even the intense one. I am not the biggest vanilla girl, but something about this is just so well balanced. It smells expensive and floral and not heavy. The bottle is stunning oh my days it is gorg and i like this perfume a lot girl."
Eternity Moment,09/08/2025,Shadza,F,7,,21,Libre has been tamed,"I was very curious about this new flanker in the beautiful bottle.

The typical Libre DNA is recognizable here as well, just significantly simplified.
The orange blossom has been toned down considerably, and the lavender is also much more restrained than in the predecessors.

During the first half hour, Libre Vanille Couture evokes the least from all the flankers in the series for me.
Familiar yet different, it feels a bit too arbitrary. Hm...

Once the opening settles, the new promised twist becomes apparent.
A vanilla that beautifully shifts between soft sweet and warm soft.

I don't catch any rum in my nose.
Too bad, I could have imagined a well-crafted boozy touch as an exciting variant for cold winter evenings and fancy occasions.
On the other hand, Libre Vanille Couture thus avoids drifting into the more gourmand territory and can maintain the more mature aura of its predecessors.

Overall, the fragrance becomes significantly more harmonious from this point on, gaining a snug quality that I can particularly envision for the colder months.

So, is it a new candidate for purchase?
I love the Libre line mainly for its rather ""edgy"" DNA, the interplay of cool and warm, bossy and feminine.

This somewhat gets lost in ""Libre Vanille Couture | Yves Saint Laurent,"" which is why the fragrance will probably not replace my favorite variant ""Libre Le Parfum | Yves Saint Laurent,"" which it actually comes closest to for me.

For anyone who already has one of its sisters in their closet, it’s probably not a revelation, but still nicely done and worth a test.
Even those who found the predecessors perhaps too harsh might find happiness with this toned-down version."
Eternity Moment,08/24/2025,Ungestresst,F,33,,14,Dreamy Drydown,"Do I really still need you? I thought to myself after I heard about the release. I see the bottle .. read the notes .. YES, my Libre collection is probably going to get bigger! Ordered online from Paris right away .. a few days later it was there and I got to smell it for the first time .. once again a pricey blind buy. It was worth it! The original Libre is still there although for me it’s more the Libre Le Parfum but with such a dreamy vanilla drydown .. heavenly! I am in love! By the way, I don't perceive anything in the rum."
Eternity Moment,09/05/2025,Arrosa,F,48,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Name is Program,"Here you initially get the original Libre DNA - lavender, orange blossom, and jasmine combined with vanilla - so nothing new at first.

However, the scent is distinctly warmer and more vanillic from the very beginning (and of course throughout its entire development). It strongly reminds me of the Libre Le Parfum variant, but it is actually ""different"" in its vanilla. The listed candy vanilla shines through wonderfully here. An authentic, slightly earthy, and perhaps even minimally animalistic vanilla. So definitely not a mundane baking vanilla or something similar. I find the twist very exciting. However, I don't get the listed rum or any other boozy note.

The bottle is also a dream and a ""must-have"" for Libre collectors and lovers. The limited edition makes it particularly appealing.

Anyone who generally likes Libre and is not averse to vanilla should definitely give it a try. But please make sure to test it on the skin and give the scent a little time. The scent on the test strip was not remotely like it was on my skin even after several hours."
Eternity Moment,09/08/2025,Sabrina001,F,7,,5,A Gem!,"Wow.. the appearance is already a highlight, and the scent even more so! At first, I was a bit hesitant due to the price, but my eyes simply made the decision. It feels significantly more sensual than its predecessors. I imagine it being perfect for winter, with an elegant coat, red lips, and a tightly pulled-back ponytail on a date.. After over 60 fragrances, I still don't have a clear favorite in the number 1 spot… maybe this will be it? Absolute recommendation, and perfect for gifting."
Eternity Moment,11/10/2025,Majka86,F,56,,2,"The Most Beautiful, Why Limited ?!","Libre is unfortunately not my line. I’ve tried them all, and somehow the lavender note doesn’t resonate with me here. Only the Libre EAU DE PARFUM INTENSE was the warmest for me.

It's a shame that this one is limited. I would immediately add it to my collection after just one test! The vanilla is more dominant here than the lavender, which makes it interesting for me, and the rum here... It won me over right away!

But limited, and I really don’t like that! I don’t like a love that’s limited in time.

But maybe it will eventually be added to the permanent collection.
It would definitely be the most beautiful in the line.
I also like the vanilla note from ""Black Opium Le Parfum | Yves Saint Laurent,"" and this is exactly it here!
Divine"
Euphoria Blossom,02/26/2018,Serafina,F,479,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The Moomins from Finland,"The Moomins - friendly, troll-like mythical creatures with a hippopotamus-like shape - were not entirely unknown to me from my childhood, but apparently I was a bit too old for such series when they became more prominent on German television in the late 70s. I only just learned that the first books were written and illustrated by the Finnish/Swedish author Tove Jansson as early as the 1940s. The virtual home of the Moomins in the far north seems to have also inspired the Moomin perfume series by Demeter (alongside “Finnish Snowfield,” there’s also “Icelandic Aurora” and “Norwegian Wood”).

“Finnish Snowfield” is, in my opinion, a delicate, light floral scent with hints of lemon-juice-spiced herbal tea. The association with a bright sun shining over a powdery snowfield seems quite fitting to me, but I also can’t help but think of the first spring flowers waiting for their moment to emerge beneath the snow. Therefore, for me, it’s a perfume for the waning winter.
Moderate longevity, but at least it’s a perfume that is suitable for wearing and not just for “bringing to mind” certain scent images."
Truth Men,10/01/2025,Bex,F,36,,1,Fresh for a Sunday,"I got a dabber bottle in the Winter and I wasn't impressed. It smelled generic and fruity with some fresh notes but I didn't love it. I didn't even like it, it was SO boring. The bottle was still pretty so I kept it on my desk at work for decoration. Now that Spring as come around, so have I. I went to work perfume-naked and reached for my Pretty Pink for the first time in months. Today it's 50-65F and sunny and for the first time this scent makes sense. Pretty Pink is a summer cocktail that brings freshness for the fruit lovers. The citrus, basil, and Bellini notes stand out the most, with the floral middle notes blending everything together. The ambery, musky base is familiar and safe. If you typically love fruity florals and want something that's a little bit fresher and greener, but still in your comfort zone, Pretty Pink will get you through the warm weather, and look cute on your vanity for the rest of the year."
Truth Men,05/22/2025,jettodesu,F,19,,2,"Nice, but totally unexpected","We already know not to judge a book by its cover, but never judge a fragrance by its bottle! Not only the bottle, but the name of this perfume as well evoke something hyper-feminine, sugary sweet, and maybe tropical or red fruits. Instead, this is citrusy, fresh, and shockingly... unisex? So any guy that is brave enough to have a fragrance that looks like this, I think it might be worth a try. But to be honest, it doesn't seem like that unique of a fragrance, so if the bottle bothers you, you can probably find something a little less... ostentatious that gives you the same effect.

Anna Sui, you really know how to put some simple ass fragrances in extremely fancy bottles. And damn it, I'm gonna keep buying them until I have all those bottles... I'll just refill them with more interesting (or at least more fitting) fragrances."
CK One Summer 2020,09/26/2024,Dionysos2022,M,946,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,On a Early Morning...,"... standing in a hot day in the middle of the garden among the blooming flowers and inhaling their scents along with the freshness of the damp grass and the woods of the surrounding trees. I hold my coffee cup, sipping it enjoyably while I glide my bare feet over the grass. This is how every morning should start.

When applying this fragrance, the nose first encounters the green of the cypress, mixed with the slightly sharp freshness of ginger. A spicy and floral accord quickly follows. The woods that join at the end make the perfume dry and woody, giving it a masculine touch.

Here we have a beautiful fresh woody aquatic scent that can be worn by any age group. On warm and hot days, I see this as a great all-rounder for daytime wear that can be worn anytime and anywhere. The scent is masculine and is not necessarily for the ladies, but can certainly be tried, as perfumes smell different on every skin.

Anyone who enjoys a fresh woody aquatic masculine fragrance will find this quite suitable, and at a very good price."
CK One Summer 2020,06/24/2024,Koray3000,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,So beautiful yet underrated! Summer on the skin.,"In search of a new summer fragrance that suits me, I tried many perfumes. I stumbled upon this bottle and honestly didn't think much of it at first. It fits perfectly within a small budget but can easily compete with designer scents. I sprayed it on my arm and let myself be surprised:

The opening starts off beautifully citrusy and fresh. The citrus note isn't listed, but you can definitely smell it. However, the zesty opening fades away, transitioning into an iced tea vibe. Not peach or lemon, but a very unique, homemade iced tea that you would love to order on a warm summer day. The scent becomes a bit sweeter and smoother like an iced tea. At this point, you can really notice the similarity to YSL La Nuit de L'Homme.
As the summer day turns into a summer evening, the fragrance also shifts in that direction. It leaves behind a creamy, sweet scent reminiscent of a lemon muffin.

At this point, I have to mention the longevity. Unfortunately, it isn't very good, which is why I tend to spray it on multiple times a day because it’s just so enjoyable. You want to have it around you all the time and experience the evolution of the scent again and again.
That's why I carry it in a small mini atomizer to-go and sometimes reapply. At this price, that's also manageable without putting a strain on the wallet.

All in all, great scent, very underrated, and perfect for summer like an iced tea full of ice cubes. Highly recommended, and during the sale, you can get the 30 ml bottle for very little money."
CK One Summer 2020,12/28/2023,RichyScents,M,5,,4,Absolute No-Brainer!,"In my eyes, a completely overlooked freshie. I love the scent and have been wearing it almost daily for some time now. It's just very nice and fresh, but still a bit different from the others. The scent has replaced 360 Red by Perry Ellis for me as a feel-good, no-think fragrance. Sillage and longevity are top-notch for this category. Additionally, I find the bottle an absolute eye-catcher. Anyone looking for a new fresh scent should definitely give this one a chance."
Sheer Beauty Essence,02/19/2025,exii,F,2,,1,Almost My Signature Scent,"I (27F) received Exceptional Parfums' Simply Belle as a free sample dabber and fell in love with it on first sniff. It has checked all the boxes for me - except one.

It is bright, fresh, and uplifting without being overly juicy or juvenile. For me, it is the perfect ratio of floral to citrus, without one overpowering the other, nor blending so much that it smells overripe or sharp. I appreciate its simple and straightforward scent, as complex and wood-based blends gives me a headache. Its drydown melds into a sort of youthful, musky skin scent on me, still keeping that same floral-citrus blend with no specific notes screaming out.

I ordered this perfume in the winter and have been wearing it even in colder months, but it would definitely fall under a spring and summer scent. I could wear this any time of the day, but would envision it more of a refreshing morning and afternoon scent.

The one disappointment and only box it does not check is its longevity. It disappears after the first hour on my skin, which is quite disappointing for an EDP. On clothes, it lasts around two to three hours. There is almost no sillage after the first half hour, so on the positive side, it is safe for the office. Its market price is reasonable, so I don't feel guilty generously spraying it around like an EDT. I am currently trying different methods in hopes of prolonging its scent on me.

All in all, this would 100% be my signature scent if the longevity was better."
Sheer Beauty Essence,04/01/2021,Scentwitch,F,292,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Not worth it,"I was given a bottle of Simply Belle to try it out. It’s not impressive. The floral notes don’t stand out singularly. I can make out Lily of the valley and Waterlily only. The rest falls together into a soup. At the end there’s a bit of musk, but overall this perfume doesn’t change much over time.
The scent is unappealing to me. It could be my personal chemistry that doesn’t boost the perfume. I don’t know.

The sillage is about 18 inches tops, longevity blessedly short. I don’t know how much it is new, but I wouldn’t buy it for myself. Perhaps a teenage girl might enjoy it."
CK One Summer 2012,02/01/2021,HannahHoch,F,11,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Dusty green,"I do not understand the mediocre rating of this perfume, I think it is a very interesting fragrance. On my skin it turns out a little soapy jasmine at first and then the fragrance becomes very powdery, as if it could be crumbled with your fingers. At the same time I find it green but not fresh: it is like the green of leaves that are already very dry, like they are aged or tanned by the sun. I am not one of aromas with a floral predominance, but I really like this one from Rania J."
CK One Summer 2012,02/24/2014,Kxnaiades,F,50,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,a 180 from A La Nuit and other creamy indolic jasmines,"The bergamot hits at the opening and remains quite persistent on me. The musk, sandalwood and jasmine play supporting roles in this on my skin. The heliotrope gives this scent a powdery vibe, somewhat akin to the powder in YSL's Paris. It also has a similar bright sparkling nature, like in old bottles of Yvresse/Champagne. The sillage and longevity are good, about a foot from the body and longevity over four hours so far and maintaining the sillage. I find the quality good with no synthetic notes apparent. However this is more of a green/citrus scent and not so much a jasmine oriented scent. It would be on the other end of the spectrum from creamy jasmines like Serge Lutens' A la nuit."
CK One Summer 2012,02/14/2016,Turandot,F,839,,20,If only it were just Jasmine....,"I love the scent of pure, clean, heavy jasmine on a summer night. The most beautiful jasmine I experienced was in Tunisia. I think Egyptian jasmine, as indicated in the pyramid, is experienced similarly. I was all the more excited to test Jasmine Kâma and all the more disappointed by the result.

Jasmine as the theme of a fragrance may tolerate a leading top note to avoid coming on too strong. But everything else that has been added around Jasmine Kâma disturbs and distorts the animalistic heaviness of jasmine and robs the fragrance of the vibrant mood it is otherwise capable of evoking. This feels irritating and makes the scent simply loud and oppressive.

Patchouli and woods unnecessarily roughen the otherwise oily-silky smoothness, heliotrope is a lovely scent on its own with its friendly and rather harmless sweetness, but it does not fit at all with jasmine, and vanilla seems to be indispensable and is used almost inflationarily in my opinion. The base is quite pretty on its own, but for me it feels like it was accidentally added.

The name of the perfume had led me to expect a classic soliflore. But such a note must be allowed to stand on its own. Similar to a solitaire as a piece of jewelry, it cannot tolerate any other decorative embellishments, and thus, in my opinion, the jasmine in this fragrance has been robbed of its beauty."
CK One Summer 2012,10/12/2014,Ergoproxy,M,1130,,0,The Full Blast,"I waited until the last moment to test Jasmin Kâma, as I suspected a true floral monster with such a perfume name.

I was right with my assumption!

Jasmin Kâma should be called Jasmine Anesthesia for me!

I can't speak of a top and heart note with this fragrance, as aside from a soapy, animalistic jasmine note, I can't perceive anything else for hours.
What surprises me, however, is that despite the numbing intensity, I never felt uneasy or had a headache at any time.

Only after an eternity does the floral anesthesia fade, leaving a truly pleasant daze in the form of a really beautiful base note.

The jasmine then submits to a soft, pleasantly sweet accord, which nearly makes the strains of the floral blast fade into oblivion. But only nearly!

Aside from the base accord, the sillage is expansive, and it will probably not surprise anyone that the longevity is also quite impressive. On me, Jasmin Kâma lasted noticeably until the next shower, and even after that, I could still perceive a faint trace of it.

Those who, like me, do not particularly enjoy overly floral fragrances should be a bit more cautious with the dosage when testing Jasmin Kâma. However, jasmine lovers will surely get their money's worth here."
Eternity Summer 2013,03/12/2019,AromaX,M,33,,0,A pink fluffy cloud of muskus decorated with red berries,"""Pavlova"" is a pink fluffy cloud of transparent muskus decorated with red berries. Not the smell of the ""Pavlova"" dessert itself, but a sensual representation of it. Strawberry juice, an echo of ""Strawberry in cream"" (a popular candy from the USSR times) and a layer of sweet and sour jam from red berries. The muskus cloud here is not something I smell. I rather feel its presence as a sense of transparent fullness within the smell. A scene for the berries to play their role. It also remember similar musks as a feeling of pink mist from some aquarel-like perfumes of roses and peonies. An lovely light and airy fragrance..."
CK One Summer 2015,06/26/2023,ChicoRoch1,M,163,,2,Top marks for Nina,"Nina Ricci has been around for quite some time and she's not exactly know for creating masculine fragrances but the ones that she HAS made have all been very very good and Memoire D'Homme is no different. This nuclear sized spice rack acts like something right out of the 80s with great longevity and high quality. Nina Ricci brings it home and I wear it sparingly as it's not a casual everyday fragrance. The winter is when it behaves the best as the spicy woody notes permeate through the cold just like a hot knife through butter.

At 1st the beginning is kind of raunchy as the Licorice note sticks to your skin like glue but as time passes the other notes start to make their presence known throughout. I will say this though if you're not a fan of licorice then you probably will not care very much for this however. As for myself the Licorice note is not only nice but very necessary because that's the one note that makes it's presence clear. 4 or 5 sprays is all you'll need to get you through the day and most of the night. The other big players are Ginger, Nutmeg, Grapefruit, Pomelo, Vetiver, Amber, Cedar, Opoponax, Myrrh, Ambergris and Musk. As you can see this fragrance uses major league masculine notes and anyone within a few feet of you will know there's a true MAN in your midst. I can't say enough about it except try it for yourself."
CK One Summer 2015,10/12/2014,Zakaria80,M,10,,1,A well behaved licorice.,"Not the rule, but when you see a house with a lot of perfumes and only the very few are masculine (at least marketed at) then you get the impression that some real effort focus and time went down to create these special ones. The one I owned for quite some time and really liked was Memoire d'Homme.

Upon spraying you get the feeling that this is your typical men's cologne but it is not! You get a citrusy initial bang taking up almost the entire frame, but some nutmeg, ginger and definitely licorice are photobombing in the background.

The licorice... I got really acquainted with this note thanks to my partner's black soft licorice caramels she was stuffing my mouth with in the winter. In this composition the licorice is done right with a balanced feel to it thanks to grapefruit in the beginning and then the nutmeg. The ginger has a sparkling role keeping the structure somehow fresh.

And then there is the amazing woody semi sweet drydown that keeps going for hours on skin, not to mention its persistence on clothes. For me this is where this scent really shines. Like staring down at a pine(?) forest from a higher point with the traces of a licorice caramel you were torturing in your mouth to melt for 10 minutes. Great stuff people.

I am keeping the ""oh my god!! why did you discontinue such a wonderful underatted superfantastic scent?!?!?"" for some other time or scent...

Screw it...

oh my god!! why did you discontinue such a wonderful underatted superfantastic scent?!?!?"
CK One Summer 2015,01/02/2013,Drseid,M,828,,2,Bad Citric Woods...,"Not a fan. Many compare this to one of my favorite scents, Terre d'Hermes, but I really don't see much of the comparison... On my skin, this is all about licorice, nutmeg and cedar after the initial grapefruit top note. The cedar being the main similarity between the two scents to me. The grapefruit top note here is nice, but it lasts for just a few seconds and is gone, leaving just the licorice behind; transitioning to the nutmeg and cedar notes. I regret my blind buy of this one and have gave away my bottle with no regrets. Memoire d'Homme gets a below average rating of 2 stars out of 5 and an ""avoid"" recommendation."
CK One Summer 2015,12/25/2010,Bullitt,M,85,,0,Too Bold a Mixture...,"here is my first comment :-)

I received this fragrance as a gift about 4 years ago...

Unfortunately, my taste was completely missed!

The base notes might not be bad, but it seems to me that everything has just been mixed together at will. What ultimately comes out is a sweet - fruity mixture...

For anyone who, like me, prefers woody / leathery / spicy fragrances, this is definitely not suitable!"
Dark Obsession for Men,05/07/2022,Blinfluenced,M,6,,3,Lots of blue notes - From the sight of a blind,"Oxford by roberto Ugolini ( Instagram: @roberto_ugolini_bespoke_shoes ; @the_nose_behind )
Oxford was the first fragrance that I bought from the house of Roberto Ugoline, completely ""blind"", I have relied completely on the reviews in
the social media channels. I can imagine that someone else also make it this way, but with a perfume in the high-price segment of more than 200 € not normality. But I must admit without reservation that I was not disappointed!

The first spray envelops me with pure freshness, citrus and grapefruit, a nice spicy peppery note rounds off the first impression. After some time, the very fresh opening evaporates and the spice comes through very well tuned,
my compliments to the perfumer! Often I personally feel the pepper note too extreme, here is the necessary balance for me. The spicy tension remains very long, until finally after some time woods join in and give the fragrance a
great finish. The woody aroma in combination with a very slight sweetness is a real dream. | In my head immediately manifest themselves some blue tones, which gradually reach a great homogeneity, a brief touch of purple is
also present. The pepper I perceive not as a color, but rather as many small rough balls that spread in my yet very sensitive nose. Pleasant, very pleasant. The base I perceive as a very dark beige, I think it is due to the
sandalwood and the slight sweetness that round out this great finish.
This fragrance is universally wearable, office, date or even funeral, you can't go wrong with oxford

Dark Obsession for Men,06/19/2025,Ezroni,M,56,,2,Season of Formality,"Oxford was the first fragrance created for Roberto Ugolini. Meant to be a business- and office-friendly scent, it's nice and masculine with its pepper and grapefruit opening and heart. I love it and use it on a weekly rotation especially if I'm meeting clients for work.

I've used this for a job interview in the past and for plenty of meetings, paired of course with Oxford dress shoes. It's a nice and fairly heavy citric-spicy combination. This is the fragrance that gave me love for the grapefruit aroma.

Associated with cleanliness: dressed, shaved, ready for business. Maybe a tie with the odd pattern to keep things fun, that's up to the wearer. This is what I use Oxford for, anyway. However, despite the formality that accompanies the Oxford shoe that this fragrance is named after, this is still a versatile scent for the man who might not choose to wear a suit but still finds himself in more business-forward occasions.

Strong performance. I used three sprays on my first ever wear and felt it was too much. This juice lasts me eight or nine solid hours.

This is a purely masculine fragrance to my perception, but likely due to the scenarios in which I personally use it.

The only thing I would change would be to swap the bottle colors with Derby. Usually, (the more formal) Oxford shoes are black and (the more casual) Derbies are brown, so to me it would make more sense to imitate this through the bottle colors. Just a geek's two cents! :)"
Dark Obsession for Men,11/26/2024,Jevanston,M,4,,1,What an old school man would smell like,"Think of a dark fragrance that got a lot of character to it but presented in a very fresh, woody but also likeable and airy way. Definietly a masculin fragrance that shouts ' I have got my shit together' but in a very elegant way. Easy to pull off. For me personally, an everyday fragrance. Can pull this off with a Tuxedo but also with a tank top. Thats how versatile this is! Projection is moderate to skin scent but creates a nice bubble around you where everybody notices the fragrance!"
Dark Obsession for Men,03/24/2022,BFellmeden,M,32,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,23,Makes a Slim Foot,"Since early morning, I had been tracking the DHL vehicle, which according to the app was only 10 stops away from me. How long would it take to deliver 10 packages? Now I know, it took almost 3 hours and that nearly drove me crazy.

Normally, I'm not an impatient person, but when I mentally already have my package in hand, it drives me insane. Minute by minute, I wondered if the DHL vehicle might have been involved in an accident, in which café the driver was taking a break, if he might have been invited in by a lonely housewife, or if he was taking a nap in some poorly visible parking lot.

But then I saw the yellow van with the highly visible red DHL stickers from afar. I rushed out of my apartment, down the stairs, and to the front door, even before the vehicle had come to a stop.

The friendly delivery driver handed me a black package. The sender was Kai Porten, whose promotion for Perfume Day I took advantage of to order two fragrances from Roberto Ugolini, which he had discounted by 20%. Besides that, I had ordered a discovery set with the fragrances from Schwarzlose Berlin, but that's just a side note, as I actually want to talk about one of the two Roberto Ugolinis, namely the Oxford. Nevertheless, I want to take a moment to thank Kai Porten, who kindly included a 50 ML tester of the fragrance ""Treffpunkt 8 Uhr"" from Schwarzlose Berlin in the package. As influencers like to say: ""Shoutout to Kai, you're totally cool, man. Thank you!""

So, now to the Oxford. The bottle is like all bottles from Roberto Ugolini. They all look the same, differing only in color. I now own 5 of them. The Oxford bottle is transparent brown, feels heavy in hand, and conveys to me, like its brothers, a decent quality. Personally, I also appreciate the horn caps. I once had the fun of weighing the bottle. It settled at 302 grams. Compared to other bottles, it is rather light, but its tactile feel suggests otherwise.

However, this shouldn't be a dealbreaker for a perfume. The packaging of Ugolini fragrances far surpasses many others by miles.

A first tentative spray on my forearm. I probably should have waited, but I was really curious. After all, this was a blind purchase. Many others, even here in this community, didn't make the decision to buy this fragrance for me, but at least they strongly endorsed it. There was often talk of a certain elegance, of a fragrance for the older gentleman (and at 59, I undoubtedly fit that description), of a fragrance for the self-assured gentleman. While I don't see myself as an elegant gentleman, I am fundamentally very interested in characteristics that underline such attributes. This includes stylish clothing, also expensive handmade shoes, and indeed fragrances like the Oxford from Roberto Ugolini.

In fact, I come to the conclusion that this fragrance is exactly what has been described in various reviews here and elsewhere. After the first few seconds, I wasn't sure what exactly I was smelling, but it quickly split into a not too aggressive citrus note and a distinctly recognizable pepper note. I also detect the rose after just a few moments. I find the beginning of the fragrance development to be exceptionally pleasant. A cloud surrounds my head, and indeed the elegance, the grooming, the self-assurance of a well and expensively dressed older gentleman, who is quite aware of his effect on others, becomes palpable for me.

This fragrance combination lasts - I would estimate - a good hour and then develops into woody notes. They smell good too, but I feel the need to re-spray because I just don’t want that cloud to dissipate. But I suppose I have to endure that; after all, I can't refresh it every hour.
In short, although the pepper and rose recede a bit to let the woody notes take the lead, the fragrance loses none of its elegance. It was beautiful, it is beautiful, and it remains beautiful until it becomes barely detectable on my skin after about 8 hours, but that is far from bad.

So, this blind purchase ends with a happy ending. I can unreservedly recommend this fragrance, at least for a more mature gentleman. From my perspective, it's definitely not for women; that's my opinion. Oxford is more of a subtle fragrance, but that is certainly in line with its wearer's intent. It makes sense in the office, but it is also definitely suitable for dining out, for cocktail bars, and for larger family celebrations, etc. I, for one, am glad to have it."
Dark Obsession for Men,08/25/2021,NicoHxl,M,1,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,17,A Scent Like a Shoe,"Dear perfume lovers,
as this is my first review, I would like to ask for your understanding.

This perfume lives up to its name. I do not mean to say that it smells like leather or a worn shoe.
Rather, it is the association and presence that the perfume and the gentleman's shoe share - the classic gentleman.
Elegant, classic, versatile, unobtrusive, and yet striking.
But how can an unobtrusive perfume that smells of grapefruit, pepper, and wood still be so noticeable? Precisely because of its timeless elegance, which is rarely found today.
An elegance that only a gentleman can exude.

A scent that is simply noticeable when entering a room. Even though it has no ambitions to be loud and take center stage, this scent cannot be overlooked. Through class, charm, and its unobtrusive presence, one inevitably perceives this fragrance with great interest.

Anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting a true gentleman and conversing with him knows what I am talking about. His style, radiating class and elegance, and his character, full of charm and depth, inevitably entice one to engage in a long conversation with the respective gentleman and learn more about him and his life.
This is precisely what characterizes this wonderful scent by Roberto Ugolini.

When I spray Oxford, I immediately notice notes of grapefruit and pepper. The longer I wear it on my skin, the more pronounced the woody and resinous notes become. After about 5 hours, the scent becomes softer, and I detect a light hint of vanilla and earthy patchouli.
This scent can definitely not be called a sillage monster. In my opinion, that would be completely misplaced and would not do justice to a gentleman as I have described him.

Some recommend Oxford only for those aged 30 and above. I would like to disagree with that. It is a scent like a shoe. Wearable by anyone, if combined appropriately. Whether for leisure, office, or dinner; this scent is suitable for every situation and incredibly versatile. Those who wear this fragrance will be remembered for their unmistakable style.

Stylish and fragrant greetings,
Nico"

Upon spraying, pepper, orange, and rose. After an hour, fantastic wood notes with a hint of vanilla. Great dry down and still noticeable on me the next morning. After three hours, it strongly reminds me of Terre EDP with a bit more vetiver.

Good craftsmanship from the shoemaker master from Italy! The all-rounder for any occasion for men over 40. Not a youthful scent."
Dark Obsession for Men,03/23/2021,Ischgelroi,M,289,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Elegant and always suitable like a good Oxford shoe,"I have been testing Oxford for a longer period now, and I can say right away. The scent lives up to its name; it is simply always suitable for both a casual linen shirt and a tuxedo. Oxford is like its namesake, always fitting for any occasion. At first, I was a bit hesitant and struggled with whether I should test Oxford, as I somehow always had the fear that there might be leather in it, which I absolutely do not like in perfume. Fortunately, Oxford has no leather note, which relieved me greatly. Right after spraying, the freshness of grapefruit comes to the fore, complemented immediately by spicy and bitter notes. I particularly smell pepper, cedarwood, and something sweet, which probably comes from the sandalwood and vanilla note. I can't really detect the other notes, but that's not a problem because the notes I can perceive very well create a wonderful scent that simply fits in any weather. The exception might be above 35 degrees. Oxford is a very nice fresh, spicy, and slightly sweet scent that is truly very universal. However, I find the unisex classification not very fitting, as I can better imagine the scent on a man due to the combination of the spicy notes; also, the name Oxford evokes the association of a men's fragrance for me. I believe the scent deserves significantly better ratings, but unfortunately, the brand Roberto Ugolini is quite underrated. I recommend you test Oxford and give the fragrance some time."
Dark Obsession for Men,04/13/2022,S1m0n3008,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"My ""daily"" for the office","The alarm rings - brush teeth - shower - do hair - put on Oxford and into the suit. My daily morning ritual.

Whether in meetings or on a ""quiet"" day in the office, Oxford always works for me.

It's all about the blend - citrus freshness, a bit of pepper, and wood without being intrusive, yet still noticeable to those around. After a while, for me, a hint of vanilla comes through with the woodiness, but without becoming overwhelming.

I would recommend the scent more for men; I wouldn’t perceive it as unisex. Age, in my opinion, is not a factor - as a 20-year-old student, I would have loved to wear it too."
Dark Obsession for Men,06/30/2023,Ellinas94,M,4,,8,Love at the Third Sniff,"I acquired this fragrance as a decant based on a recommendation from my colleague, and I was not impressed at all during the first wear. I quite liked the scent DNA, but I couldn't confirm that this fragrance lasts long.
Naturally, I was annoyed and disappointed, although I was happy that I had ""only"" gotten a decant, as a blind buy would have been much worse.
When I wanted to give it a second chance, I approached it without any prejudices:
I wore a suit and was scheduled for a business meeting.
I applied the fragrance only on my skin and NOT on my textile, as I have often experienced that less is sometimes more, and our noses tend to give in faster the more we apply. (Scent blindness)
Then, on a mild, cloudy day, as I stepped out of my house and got into my car, I was overwhelmed by love for this fragrance to the point that I didn't know what was happening.
Woody notes, paired with citrus and pepper. However, everything is very, very, very unobtrusive!
Sometimes you smell the fragrance, sometimes you don’t. People around you smell it sometimes, then again they don’t. The perfect variation for serious meetings in a suit. I absolutely cannot stand it when someone in the room smells so strongly of perfume that the entire room smells like that person. Many people ruin a scent for me this way. Can we already talk about a kind of scent abuse? Well… That’s why this fragrance is anything but loud, yet people notice it, and of course, so do I.
It goes so far that I can still smell this fragrance in the evening, but very discreetly, now and then :)
Since yesterday, I am a proud owner of this masterpiece and can truly say that it is my absolute favorite for the office!
Give it a second or even a third chance. You won’t regret it :)"
Dark Obsession for Men,03/08/2024,DuftDave,M,4,,6,Terre d'Hermès in Niche,"Like the shoe from which Ugolini got his name, the fragrance is perfectly suited for special occasions. But even in everyday life, the Oxford rarely comes across as intrusive. In my opinion, it is a very good signature scent for a mature man. It feels more refined and has a good touch of elegance and complexity compared to the modern classic from Hermès. The Oxford has less freshness than Terre d'Hermès. The grapefruit disappears very quickly here, and the orange is similar to that in Hermès, but it plays a slightly smaller role in this case. As the fragrance develops, the Oxford becomes a bit heavier, woodier, and gains a slight sweetness from the vanilla, which is only subtle. I can't complain about the longevity and sillage. 8-10 hours are no problem on my skin. The projection of the fragrance is also very satisfactory. The sillage is strong and only starts to fade after several hours."
Dark Obsession for Men,12/04/2023,LGxAsyouwere,M,10,,7,(almost) perfect,"I found it while searching for an office scent that doesn’t smell like generic shower gel. I really enjoy wearing TDH (EDT and Pure Perfume), and since it is often associated with it, this was a blind buy that I do not regret.

It is quite different from TDH, with a strong dominating pepper and woods. TDH is consistently citrusy and fresh, while this one is citrusy and spicy. I wouldn’t say: If you have TDH, you don’t need this one anymore - rather, if you already have TDH, you need this one even more, as it interprets something similar in its own unique, slightly more potent, and truly beautiful way.

I find the longevity to be excellent; I was able to perceive the scent well for 12 hours today - it lasts better on clothes than on (my) skin, and I don’t quite understand how it only gets an 8.0 for longevity here. Also, regarding TDH: it definitely doesn’t achieve this longevity for me, as it fades after 6 hours, both EDT and Perfume. And that’s a good thing, as the difference between niche and designer should not only be recognized in the price but also in the quality and performance. This is the case here!"
Dark Obsession for Men,12/23/2021,Rerano99,M,13,,5,Great Woody Scent,"For me, Oxford has been my absolute favorite for the office for some time now. It lasts a long time but is not too overpowering.
Especially the woody drydown is very pleasing.

Initially, it has a slightly alcoholic note right after spraying, but that disappears relatively quickly. What remains is a very pleasant fresh woody note.

I still perceive the scent very intensely even after a long workday."

Dark Obsession for Men,05/13/2022,RichardHorn,M,80,,5,Really Gentleman´s Darling! Really?,"The Oxford shoe as a British classic and Oxford as a breeding ground for a so-called stylish elite already hint at this popular fragrance: Herbert Stricker's Ugolini manufactory offers a typically complex scent experience with Oxford as a perfume, which elegantly and effortlessly fulfills its daily duty on its wearer and scores at all times. Always wearable, always understated, with a noticeable but never unpleasant presence.

Oxford starts off very fruity in the top note, the peppery heart note with rose geranium leaf brings spice, a slight sharpness, and invigorates the scent and is distinctly present, but never unpleasant (I tend to like pepper in perfumes rather rarely). The broad, beautifully woody, slightly smoky, somewhat vanillic, and earthy base carries Oxford for several hours and projects well, but does not overwhelm anyone. In the drydown, Oxford oddly has a slightly soapy finish and also faint hints of aftershave, but never unpleasant or too pronounced. This Ugolini is therefore rather something for men, but I would be quite interested in the scent on women...

Anyway: Oxford is actually suitable for any occasion; I can't think of a scenario where it wouldn't fit. Without thinking, I say: Spray on without a second thought! Moreover, it also has this optimistic undertone of: Enjoy your life and try to have fun and convey this good vibe to others.

A noble, elegant, understated scent with decent presence. Indeed, a gentleman's fragrance!"

It starts off so wonderfully spicy and is also somehow fresh! The combination of grapefruit and orange with the pepper is really fantastic. The woods in the base then ensure that the scent gets a solid structure. The woods, patchouli, and vanilla also make it very elegant, which fits very well for me in the office.

Sillage and longevity could be a bit better, but it is never intrusive or bothersome.

Dark Obsession for Men,06/09/2023,MummPitz,M,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,The more expensive/complex alternative...,"First of all, a classification - I love Terre d'Hermes and wear it regularly on all occasions.

Now I wanted to try the much-praised Oxford and after the first sprays, I didn't know what to think. YES, Oxford is spicier at the beginning and doesn't come with such a bitter grapefruit, but otherwise, it really differs little from the aforementioned scent.
Of course, Terre d'Hermes eventually loses its power and you only have light resinous-woody notes LEFT, BUT does that justify the price difference?

Please don't get me wrong - I find Oxford very good and would claim that any man can wear this scent for almost any occasion.

The question that arises for me - do you need Oxford if you can have Terre d'Hermes?"
Dark Obsession for Men,01/29/2023,Inkedskin,M,13,,4,A Masterpiece,"“Oxford” by Roberto Ugolini is a work of art full of sensuality and sophistication. The perfect balance of floral and woody notes creates an aura of elegance and mystique that enchants the wearer.

Dark Obsession for Men,07/28/2025,Basti87,M,1064,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Beautiful Woody Spice for Everyday Use,"This Roberto Ugolini definitely needs to be reviewed by me. A quite popular scent from this brand. Christian Carbonnel has certainly created a great fragrance for Roberto Ugolini that could be called an all-rounder. It combines several styles and is also not too heavy to wear. Many here refer to this scent as an office or everyday fragrance. You can definitely do that, but for me, it’s an all-rounder that can also work very well in the evening due to its woody-spicy DNA, which slightly leans towards ""Gucci Intense Oud | Gucci."" This one is a bit easier to wear than the Gucci, but you should definitely test it before buying. You get a soft woody scent with a pleasing spice. There’s also a citrus freshness active in the background that makes this fragrance extremely suitable for everyday use. It also has enough charm for the evening and definitely possesses great gentleman vibes.

In terms of pricing, this brand is quite fair, especially if you shop in stores with decent discounts. You can already get 100ml for under €150, which is absolutely fair for this quality. The fragrance comes in the usual orange Ugolini packaging. The bottle is pretty with this leather patch, and here the bottle comes in a cozy brown that matches the scent.
The fragrance already smells really elegant right after spraying. Even though the top notes of grapefruit and orange suggest a very fresh opening, this creation is only conditionally fresh, as the woody-spicy notes are present from the very beginning and provide beautiful vibes that are particularly good on autumn days. Styrax from the base also sets in early and adds a slightly balsamic-resinous note that brings some warmth. Pepper and a gentle geranium also come through, giving it a nice soft spice. Wood comes from sandalwood and cedarwood, offering a great combination that impresses here. Vetiver makes this creation somewhat classic and quite elegant. Patchouli adds a bit of edgy and slightly earthy vibes. I don’t perceive vanilla as this scent is very unsweet. Minimal in the base perhaps, but it’s kept in check. Nevertheless, the whole thing is very rounded and also sensual with this soft woody base. Overall, a great all-rounder that unfolds best at temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees.
Performance is good as expected from fragrances of this type. The scent impresses with a nice sillage and a longevity of 8-10 hours. Thus, it’s great for everyday use but also for the evening in a more elegant outfit. As mentioned, it’s a great all-rounder.

Overall, once again a great Ugolini release. This brand almost always impresses me with great quality and wonderful DNAs."
Dark Obsession for Men,09/01/2023,GratWanderer,M,228,,2,"More conservative than the Rossos, yet a solid benchmark","Oh yes, the citrusy opening is immediately ignited in the first minutes by an underlying pepperiness. Not pure citrus summer vibes, but interpreted in a masculine spicy way; the combination of pink and black pepper works well, the earthiness of one, the invigorating fruity-fresh spiciness of the other.

The transition to the heart is smooth, remnants of the citrus peels linger nicely for a bit longer, 30-60 minutes in and they can still be perceived behind the new green freshness. In comparison to the two Rossos, however, this one has a distinctly more conservative progression so far. Sure, there's pepper, but not so spicy that it becomes very niche, and otherwise we find ourselves in familiar territory, lacking the exciting smoky note of 4 Rosso or the special peach integration in a rose men’s fragrance of 17 Rosso.

90-120 minutes in, the base plays more, the combination of woods with grasses and styrax has this special note that always reminds me of roasted nuts and is pleasing, cedar adds a bit of freshness, vanilla rounds it off nicely. Here it becomes warmer, remnants of the pepper are present and play nicely with the woody notes.

I don’t know, to be honest, it was a bit of a disappointment after the 2 Rossos, which positively surprised me with their somewhat unusual, everyday composition. This one is definitely more conservative and ""Ah yes, I know that one."" Don't get me wrong, it's still a high-quality fragrance with very good longevity, medium sillage, etc.
But I would rather reach for something more special from the house; that might just be my hipsterism. ;)"

Dark Obsession for Men,02/06/2024,Phidill,M,5,,2,A Suitable Start into the Niche,"After my first purchase of Blue Suede Shoes by Roberto Ugolini, I wanted to learn a bit more about the brand's perfumes and came across Oxford and 17 Rosso.
First, I took a closer look at the Oxford:
Through my research, the Oxford was described to me as ""an easy entry into the niche,"" and that is pretty much what it is. It is uncomplicated and easy to wear, but it stands out with its fruity, spicy, and also woody characteristics.
It starts off for me with a fresh grapefruit, which is quickly complemented by a peppery note. After a while, the scent begins to transform into a very masculine woodiness, which is still accompanied by pepper and a slowly fading citrus note.
By now, the Oxford has practically become my signature casual scent. Unfortunately, it would be too strong for work.
All in all, in my opinion, it is the perfection of a ""standard"" men's fragrance and definitely worth acquiring.

Dark Obsession for Men,11/30/2022,JonasParfüm,M,2,,1,The Serious One!,"My opinion on Oxford. First of all, the scent is named after the men's shoe Oxford and not the university. The name actually says everything about the fragrance. It fits perfectly with brown dress shoes. The scent is very mature and very serious for me. In the top note, I mainly smell fresh notes. After about 20 minutes, the pepper kicks in. The pepper makes the fragrance very spicy in a positive way. An hour later, the sandalwood and patchouli come to the forefront. The sandalwood makes the scent very rounded, and the patchouli adds a playful touch for me. As for the performance, I can only say that it is good, but not outstanding. It is definitely not a BEAST mode fragrance. Perhaps that's why it is so perfect for the office and everyday wear. I perceive the scent for about 6 hours.
Conclusion: I think the scent is great, but for me, it is suited for men aged 25 and up. A blind buy is recommended if you are looking for an office/leisure fragrance and enjoy pepper and leather."

The sillage is not too strong; most people comment on the scent when you walk past them in motion. The price might be a bit too high.

Dark Obsession for Men,04/23/2023,Dennis1104,M,995,,1,Noble Fresh Fragrance with a Spicy Accord. Fun to Wear,"The Oxford is for me a truly high-quality fragrance in the fresher category.

grapefruit-orange combination in the top notes. This mix lasts really well and is supported by spicy accords that fit perfectly.

As a fundamental base, the Oxford has something woody paired with patchouli and vetiver.
Green vibes resonate.
As sweet counterparts, vanilla and styrax come into play.
The resinous element combined with the vanilla nicely rounds off the base and, together with the other notes of the fragrance pyramid, creates a fantastic overall work of art.

The Oxford feels totally serious, elegant, and high-quality.
For a fragrance of its kind, it is particularly special.

Longevity and sillage are really good for a fragrance that tends to be fresher. Commendable!

Dark Obsession for Men,01/06/2025,Nesim,M,3,,1,Good Allrounder Niche Fragrance,"When I first smelled this fragrance, I was immediately convinced. On the skin, it is even better than just in the nose. For men with class, whether in the office or for going out. It can be worn well in everyday life, neither too strong and intrusive nor too weak and characterless. Recommendable, moderate, and masculine for those who like it smoky/woody/leathery."

I can't believe someone would take such a unique brand name and innovative bottle design and stick this purple high fructose corn syrup inside. I rarely say such things, in fact I try not to be boastful, in general...but I think I as an amateur fragrance maker, I could have done a better job with this one. Admittedly, I didn't get too far into this one, before my gag reflex indicated it wasn't for me. I got a blast of Ylang ylang and I sensed that bold rosewood note followed by the undeniable tuberose-jasmine complex and a bit of Osmanthus. Then all of a sudden...way too much sugary sticky Myrrhe, sticky heavy amber and candy vanilla. I never made it to the base notes, so I can not comment on the full dry down or the longevity. But I would put this in the corner with Cacheral's ""LouLou"", Susanne Lang's ""Midnight Orchid"", Bill Blass' diabetes inducing ""Nude"" and a number of other over the top toothache inducing fragrances. This is a 3/10 as far as expectations versus reality for me. Sillage 6/10 and abstain from the vote on longevity since I had to remove it long before it was ready to let go of me. Pesky fruit flies all around...ugh!"
Eternity for Women Eau Fresh,01/25/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Mediocre Fruity-Floral,"Flight of Fancy isn't as strong as I thought it would be, and that's a good thing.

When I read the notes I was preparing myself for an intense blast of lemon, litchi and yuzu, however when I actually tried this fragrance, the opening was light and sweet, not at all sour or sharp.

In fact Flight of Fancy is rather mild. It's peaceful and delicate, a great composition in my opinion. The fruity and floral notes come together nicely. I also detect a subtle hint of musk closer to the drydown which really softens the scent.

Flight of Fancy is wonderfully inoffensive. I wish that more people, especially young girls wore this. No matter how much of this you apply, I doubt that it would ever become too overwhelming.

This may not be the most unique fragrance you'll ever come across, but it certainly is appealing. It's pretty and feminine and that's all that matters to me. I'll admit that I was shocked to like this seeing that I've disliked most of Anna Sui's other scents."
Eternity for Women Eau Fresh,01/06/2015,Bookwyrms,F,14,,3,Plain scent /pretty bottle,"This scent Flight of Fancy , is a plain , most likely inoffensive neutral scent. It strongly reminds me of United Colors of Benetton Essence of Woman . That is to say it smells like defanged ,watered down , light stonewashed patchouli, with some soft fruit and clean floral. Bottle is gorgeous! I'll be getting one for myself and probably one for my young niece ,as she'll probably spray herself silly with it."
Eternity for Women Eau Fresh,11/16/2019,Abgeklebt,F,3,,11,I fancy you,"I don't even know how to begin describing this miracle water. A few years ago, I stumbled upon it while searching for a fragrance that I could wear - not the other way around.

What can I say, it was love at first sight: the packaging and bottle come across as kitschy, a bit silly, almost sensational. Luckily, I didn't let that deter me back then!

When I apply it, it starts with a glassy-golden and citrus explosion that wakes me up, gives me a real freshness kick, almost coaxing me out of my shell in a tropical way, buzzing around me, only to reveal a noble and crystal-clear rose for several hours, which enters into a wonderful symbiosis with my skin, carrying me fresh and gently through the day, wrapping me closely and only perceptible to me and those who are allowed to come near. Every day I am anew enchanted by it; clear and yet warm, it slowly connects with spicy-warm woods that ultimately accompany me late into the evening, calming me and providing a cozy, warm feeling of home.

I have repurchased this fragrance countless times and was almost desperate when it became increasingly difficult to find and I suddenly could only get it through auctions. Now I have managed to snag three bottles as a reserve and am overjoyed to be able to wear it daily.

So far, I haven't found any comparable fragrance that connects so naturally with my own body scent, embraces me without clinging, accompanies me without annoying me, follows me without stalking me."
Eternity for Women Eau Fresh,03/02/2011,Chrisantiss,F,525,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Great Bottle,"Flight of Fancy was an impulse buy when I was feeling frustrated, and now I don't know what to think of it or myself.

Actually, this scent doesn't fit my usual preferences at all, being fruity and floral as it is.
When I bought it, I found it more floral, and indeed very beautiful and sweet.

Now, during the new test, it starts off quite fruity and citrusy. However, you can also smell the lychee, which I like. This makes the scent immediately sweet, and the citrus notes do not overpower.
Not long after, the floral tones finally emerge, and I start to like the scent more.
I also think I can smell a powdery peach nuance.

The scent becomes quite sweet, but a fine woodiness and the amber prevent the sweetness from becoming unpleasant and add a note that sets the fragrance apart from the usual fruity-floral monotony.

Flight of Fancy is not a highlight, but it's also not a bad scent. It feels spring-like and is suitable for all ages.

The bottle is very beautiful, with a cap that depicts an engraved peacock."

I find the bottle enchanting, and the fragrance is just as impressive.

The scent envelops me as lightly and delicately as the swallows that perform their acrobatics outside my window in early summer.
I never tire of watching them.
Moreover, the little birds bring summer with them.
So does the fragrance.

Lemon, lychee, and yuzu are so beautifully sunny, brightening the mood.
Freesia and rose let petals cascade down and draw one out into the greenery.
The cedarwood provides the subtle spice of awakening trees.

A fragrance that reflects a sunlit garden, over which cheerful swallows glide.

Despite my hoarding purchase, both bottles will soon be empty - and I will stock up again."

Normally, I don't like it when a fragrance is too fruity. Here, I enjoy it; paired with the floral notes that gradually come to the forefront, it's not too much. The lemon doesn't smell like dish soap, as can sometimes be the case in fragrances - great, because that's how I love it.
I also think I can smell a hint of peach and something exotic that makes the scent different from other floral-fruity compositions. It must be the lychee and yuzu, although I'm not familiar with yuzu.
I quickly pick up on the rose, which I really like. This adds a certain elegance to the whole scent, in my opinion. But all in all, it's a youthful, modern, and fresh fragrance, great for everyday wear.

Addendum: The longevity leaves much to be desired, so I have to reapply during the day quite often. What a shame.

Second addendum on longevity: it lasts really long on clothing and in hair for such a fresh scent, especially considering it's an EdT.
I perceive it well and feel very comfortable with it when it's warm."

Monoi and frangipani, I personally can't distinguish them anyway... I also perceive a bit of mandarin here. For me, this is not a sunscreen scent, more of a subtle summer companion. It slightly reminds me of Beach Walk (without that weird synthetic note), and I also think there’s a slight resemblance to Lyra * Alain Delon, of course just a fraction mixed with Zara's Blanche Ensoleille. I personally find the H/S of all the Tesoris I've tested so far to be the worst... but it doesn't bother me. I've had Trussardis, Diors, and LV's, which vanished in no time."
Calvin Klein Women,05/04/2024,Eriele,F,322,,4,Jupp's Bright Red Rubber Boat,"As always, I can't resist the fragrance shelves and with a glance, I skimmed over the new arrivals. I found the shower gels from the company to be decent so far, but I struggled with the scents. This was also the case with the new fragrance Karma.

As a teenager in the 70s, the orange color with the oriental pattern immediately caught my eye. Flower Power, flared pants, miniskirts, platform shoes, Abba, and George Baker Selection flashed through my mind in seconds. This fragrance had to be tested. I expected something with patchouli, the trendy scent of the time, but that was a swing and a miss.

The opening was extremely sharp and artificial, and I felt like I was back in those days. Memories of a Saturday in my neighborhood came flooding back. Uncle Jupp set up the bright red rubber boat and the orange steep-wall tent for the nudist vacation in St. Peter-Ording. His wife, Siggi, arrived with her hair all done up and a huge cloud of hairspray behind her, like concrete. Kids Daggi and Rolli had baked waffles but burned them. You could do that as a teenager. Then Grandma Änne showed up. Freshly permed curls tinted purple and smelling of hairspray and hair salon. Son-in-law Kurt rolled up with the bakery on wheels, and the smell of bread mixed in. Everyone examined Uncle Jupp's setup. Then his kids checked the air mattress and the swim rings. Now there was also the smell of plastic toys. Smoking was fashionable back then and not a half crime, and cigarette smoke wafted everywhere.

All this scent mixture is the fragrance Karma. The opening is artificial, then a full blast of flowers where frangipani, tiaré, and ylang-ylang fought over who would dominate the scent. Accordingly, there is a disharmony. Later, the remaining notes also fought, and again, there was no winner. To me, it was a stench. Sorry, but that's how I perceived the fragrance.

Longevity is quite long, and unfortunately, for sensitive people, it's a headache candidate. The bottle visually appealed to me, but unfortunately, the content did not. Luckily, I only tested it."
CK One Summer 2011,11/11/2023,Myrtillajus,F,530,,1,Oh love this combination,"Tsar in Etruscan means ten.
And this is precisely the tenth fragrance of this brand.
10 is obtained from the total of the first four numbers, considered the number of perfection and at the same time of cancellation, it was thought to contain all the fundamental elements of the universe.
This creation, which may seem like yet another repetition of the rose/Oud/saffron combination, appears to my nose (which does not always appreciate these notes) to be really pleasant and well balanced, very wearable without being too opulent: no element prevails, the bergamot gives it freshness and the tonka bean creates a very sensual frame.
And yes, it is one of the few that I like in the genre and I would really like to wear it.
Sexy in its essentiality, truly beautiful.
I see it as ideal for the cooler seasons, or perhaps on summer evenings.
Excellent performance, lasts all day.

Eternity Summer 2012,05/22/2024,Sarinotsorry,F,28,,4,It does smell like newly opened Macbook box,"The other review mentioning that it smells like a newly opened Macbook... is almost spot on. It does smell like when you open a new Macbook/iPad package. That airy, slightly cold metal smell.
However! I think the cloves note here is more prominent. So I guess it smells like if you're unboxing a new Macbook with a bowl of dried cloves next to you.

I actually find the scent to be so comforting and excellent. To be fair though, I do love the smell of cloves and new Macbook.

About its performance: on my skin & clothes, it has strong sillage. On my skin it lasts about 8+ hours before it becomes almost unnoticeable. On my clothes though... that's another story. I once gave 2 sprays on the blanket I use on my sofa, and my whole living room then smelled like this perfume for a whole week. It is beastly!"

Mostly because I don’t find them evocative, narrative, or descriptive. Plus, depending on the molecule, I sometimes can’t even smell them at all. So, 27 87 as a house — with Daniela Andrier behind several of their creations — has everything to put me off. They fully embrace their synthetic identity. Hashtag is no different. Some say it smells like opening a brand-new MacBook. They’re not wrong. There’s something plasticky, fresh — and then a curious incense note, light enough to be worn even in the heat. Musk, maybe.

It all evokes walking into a tech store run by someone cool, who added a faintly zen, chill touch to the decor. A very original perfume — and yet, super wearable and laid-back.

Not my style. And yet, I wear it.

Eternity Summer 2012,06/05/2018,Ergoproxy,M,1130,,4,It took three attempts,"Either it was my husband's persistence, my mood when I first tested the fragrance, or whatever else it was that made me not like the scent at first, but now I really like it and it is now in my collection.

#Hashtag (what a silly name) is a clean, very bright, and slightly metallic-sounding fragrance without much of a scent development.

The defining notes are, besides a soapy-synthetic aldehyde, a glaringly bright incense. Iris subtly powders the scent a bit, without the note really coming to the forefront. The (cedar) wood is somehow present, without being distinctly noticeable. It rather adds a certain dryness to the fragrance.

That the scent supposedly smells like a freshly unpacked notebook cannot be claimed. To me, it smells more like a mix of laundry day and church space.

In my now-deleted statement, I wrote that the idea is not exactly new, and I still stand by that impression. But in the end, that is irrelevant when I like the concept (even if only after the third test) and feel comfortable with the fragrance.
And after all, opinions are sometimes meant to be changed, aren't they?"
Eternity Summer 2012,03/31/2021,Tonishaja,M,7,,5,#Church scent would probably be more fitting,"In the description of the perfume, I imagined something soapy, fresh with a light incense note like Aqua di Gio Profumo.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed, especially since it was a blind buy.

The first time I caught a whiff, I immediately thought of the comment that it is supposed to smell like a newly unpacked MacBook.

At first, I could really only smell something like something newly packaged.

After testing it a few times, I eventually smelled a bit more.
It smelled to me like being in a church with a slight freshness.

I only received one positive compliment that it smells like fresh laundry. Otherwise, most people thought I smelled like a church /:

With ""#Hashtag | 27 87 Perfumes,"" we have a molecular fragrance that imitates the theme of ""freshness"" or possibly ""fresh laundry"" or ""fresh linen,"" all enhanced with a note of frankincense. The frankincense is well noticeable, yet subordinate like a breeze of freshness. I find the composition really successful and finely balanced.

What I particularly appreciate about the scent is truly the idea...
Fragrance lovers and fans of more interesting notes and compositions will particularly enjoy this, in my opinion. Because with Hashtag, you don't get a classic, ordinary freshie, but a fresh linen DNA that provides an interesting twist through the frankincense, thus opening the door for frankincense into the hotter days!

Encounter Fresh,10/27/2018,IamCraving,M,7,,7,A Parisian in America,"The location of this charming rarity could not contrast more with its character. In the desert of Albuquerque, under the absurdly blue sky of New Mexico, stands a small white trailer among flea market stalls, street food vendors, and bargain tables.
Inside, there is not only a curious, versatile, and high-quality collection of fragrances - the storage space resembles Mary Poppins' handbag - but also two delightful young gentlemen who devote themselves ""only"" part-time to their passion for conscious, pleasurable, and curious smelling. I am warmly welcomed right away, subtly advised with knowing smiles, and the suggestions are all an eye-opener, almost all hits. Among a whole range of private Tom Ford fragrances, all of which can be filled in 10ml spray bottles, I am particularly taken by the French scent ""Delice Infini"" from La Bouquetière. I am warned. Not of getting lost in the infinity of indulgence, but of the glittery, shimmering layer that the delicacy brings. It is advised against applying it to textiles, but the velvety shimmer does not cause any discomfort to the skin; on the contrary, it guarantees a longer presence of the bouquet.

So here I am, traveling to the new world, lingering between the old hunting grounds of the Navajos and the new ones of American gun enthusiasts, crumpled by the nonexistent humidity, uplifted by the vastness of the sky and the desert, and then suddenly transported into a Parisian salon, equipped with pompous canapés and simple lily arrangements. The ceilings are high, as are the arched windows, the air is cool, as are the glances of the young French women who sip their Crémant, play Rummy, and scrutinize and dissect the company of Mademoiselle Z. They float upright in their cloud of infantile arrogance, which is reflected in their scent; their distance has something piercing about it, yet it stings so sweetly, a little sour, like the pearls in cold sparkling wine. The longer we linger in the dignified yet lurking atmosphere of the salon, the more sluggish our spirits become. We sink into the too-soft backrest of the canapé, the fragrant aura of the room grows warmer, enveloping us in a hint of youthful patchouli, white flowers, and noble sweat. Outside, it is 20 degrees warmer than in the venerable vault, where lime sorbet and biscuit are now being served. Observing, being observed, in vigilant excitement, aware of one’s own nobility. In another world, people are sweating; one can sense it, one is part of the season, carrying the sticky summer in the heart, the coolness in the head and chest.

Back in Albuquerque, I spend the rest of the day with Delice Infini on my collarbone by the Rio Grande. Even at 35 degrees, this unique storyteller scent works, accentuating and contrasting the heat equally."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,09/24/2013,MRoth,N/A,24,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,The Golden Rule,"Take an old rotting wooden log. Set it to dry near a fireplace. Hollow it out, fill with dry dirt, whole vanilla beans, cinnamon bark and warm spices. Hide the log in the throne room of a sultan, let years of frankincense and sweet myrrh suffuse the wood. Heat the log over a fire and spoon some whipped cream on top.
Now step back and smell it as a complete scent: this is 24 Gold.

It wasn't love at first sniff, however. At first I worried that I'd received a dud batch or perhaps the oud note was not nearly what I expected. But I gave it time, first resigned to a bad blind buy, then cautiously optimistic, then enraptured! Gold is a good name for it, fitting in both hue and value; 24 Gold is one of few fragrances I have considered stocking up on just in case they decide to discontinue it, gold ingots stashed away from prying eyes.

It's not as much of a sillage monster on me as some others have described, I would actually prefer it to be stronger. It fares better sprayed on clothing but I enjoy it more when activated by body heat, so there's a trade-off. I do wish the bottle was a little transparent as due to the weight of it and the opaque metallic coating it is difficult to judge the level of perfume inside.

On a more personal note, I enjoy washing my hair with my coconut and Marrakesh oil conditioner and then liberally applying 24 Gold. Generally I avoid mixing perfumed products but they mesh together well. It encourages confidence and sensuality... I feel warm and mysterious, a desert priestess making libation."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,12/31/2012,Azrayel,M,10,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Harvest for the Gold,"Ok guys, here is my own story, just today 17:10PM with 24 Gold.

15:45 PM - I logged out from work and will head to post office to check on my perfume orders. My male co-worker that is logging out by 16:00pm ask me if I want a lift going home. I said sure then we can meet some place outside office after I checked my p.o. box. Deal! He said.

15:50 PM - I arrived at Post Office, heading to my box then went to the counter to claim. Postman gave me the box, I read the sender, expecting to get the Agent Provocateur or Le Dandy edt &/or edp.
But the seller was from Amazon which means, this is 24 Gold.

I opened the package, and saw the gold and black classy 24 Gold and checked the authenticity, serial no. etc. It all match, an assurance of authentic purchase. Now my last test would be, to spray it. Gold cap was great, easy and tight at the same time. I tried to spray once, no perfume came out, another, still nothing. Then I am solved that this is the real deal.

15:57 - 1 spray to back hand. Oh sweet first smell, reminded me of Paco Rabanne Ultra Red and 1 Million. Very vanilla, creamy top, a little powdery but very pleasant, could be guaiac wood but definitely no oud, yet. Powerful projection.

Three minutes after oud is slowly manifesting, subtle and very pleasing equally combining with jasmine which astonished my nose, making me convinced that this is wonderful indeed. After 10 minutes, its sweetness lessen and oud/floral combo much detected now. Such a beautiful scent that is sensual, well blended, transforming and very oriental but not cloying.

16:10 - The projection outside the post office is outstanding. The cold winds enhanced the fragrance. I was walking to meet my co-worker at the pharmacy, to ride with him and with just a spray on my back hand, the scent is a massive cloak in a winter afternoon.
Just amazing to experience it.

16:15 - I hopped in to his car and whoa, he smelled it already and told me what scent was that? It is strong but it smells very good. So I told him the brand and he wants to see the bottle and he smelled the sprayer and said, it is different from how it smells on me, different but very good aroma. He asked me where I bought it coz it is the first time he heard about this perfume.

So that was it, my actual experience with 24 Gold that ended with an immediate compliment.

My two cents: I felt the presence of oud, floral, balmy, vanilla, woods, some spices and powdery effect. But my over all take is that this a beautiful perfume that will surely earn compliment especially to women. It is really powerful but never cloying. It has the qualities of a well refined, unique, sensual and classy perfume that has some slight resemblance here and there with other known perfumes (Ultrared, 1Million, Tobacco Vanille, Armani Code, Fantasy) but able to hold the oud that pops in and out. This is a hell of a thrill ride that is worth its price. I can say it will have a following even for those who are into niche perfumes. This is a blind buy for me but a successful one, With a luxurious fragrance & a high class bottle & box, my precious..."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,12/12/2014,MasterLi,M,376,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,An instant hit!,"24 Gold by ScentStory is one of those fragrances that proves that in this industry, as far as the consumer is concerned... all that matters is the juice inside! In other words ""never judge a book by it's cover"", and that really sums it all for this one! People thought that ""how could a fragrance inspired by a TV show be any good?"". Wow! How everyone was pleasantly surprised! Again, this really shows how much we value ""brands"" and ""big names""... I mean if this was put in an exclusive flacon and released by a huge French fashion house (or by someone like Tom Ford) then we would be all over it! But instead it comes from a small company from the middle east and inspired by a TV show! Who would've thought it? Again it just shows you how quick all of us are to judge a book by it's cover!

So how does it smell? Well it is primarily an amber based fragrance (and a sweet one at that)! You have a combination between an amber softened by vanilla and musk (and also by the soft & creamy ""woody"" notes here like sandalwood, guaiac wood and oud - the last one in small quantities). I do actually detect the oud, but it's faint, and it doesn't overpower the fragrance in any way as the main notes of amber and vanilla dominate the scent.

Bottom line: This is a perfect scent for so many different occasions! I see it mainly as a cold weather scent, but if you spray very light it could be used for summer nights. It is (well) worth the money, which is very cheap for this level of quality in a fragrance... and it even puts some well established so-called ""designers"" to shame, by offering a borderline niche scent at half the price of a designer perfume! I would recommend this to people who like sweet amber or vanilla perfumes, with a woody background. It can be used casually, but I think this works best when you are out to ""impress"" in a formal setting (like a restaurant or high class bar), or an expensive banquet or something. If you can't test, and you like what I have just described, then don't be afraid to buy it. It is a sweet, woody, almost musky smell. Very warm and sensual. Especially good for winter and colder seasons. If you can't try it, buy it!"
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,08/24/2014,ZeZe,M,2,,4,The Gold Standard...,"Events occur in real time...

The opening is sickly sweet and I assume this is due to the jasmine note which I guess I'm now not a fan of. I get gaiac with aoud faintly lurking in the background but never taking center stage.
Some users have detected a raspberry note, but this wasn't the case for me.
It takes about 20 minutes for the cloying to phase out. Not a fan at all in the opening, but hang in there & you will be rewarded in the dry down just as the case with the original A*Men.

After 20 minutes the fragrance smooths. It's a sweet woody tone, the aoud must be giving off a faint pulse, as I don't find it earthy or dry at all.

The dry down.. Beautiful..

Sure enough, like clock work I struck gold at the 90 minute mark..

It develops into a soft creamy gourmand scent. A solid 3-4 hours I'm left with a creamy vanilla custard scent, some cinnamon with a woody undertone.

It's sweet, but not a synthetic sugary scent 'Rochas Man' has which tends to be linear.
24 Gold definitely isn't linear, it's more refined & presents a luxurious vibe that is inviting but not dominating like '1 Million' is.

The projection up until this point has been very good.
5+hours in, it's approaching the skin scent stage. A gorgeous edible cinnamon scent.

This phase lasted for half a day (12 hours) no joke. I Woke up the following day, and I could still smell the trace on my hand, smelt like luxurious bar of soap.

Ideal scent

Warm, creamy, comforting & inviting in a subtle way.

If you enjoy 'Rochas Man', this is hands down the better choice. It's classier & smells more expensive.

Although '1 Million' has its own place in the night life environment, this is more ideal for a relaxed environment or occasions. Restaurant/movies/home/bedroom..

A lovely UNISEX fragrance which has an affordable price tag, smooth & creamy dry down which could be mistaken for a niche scent.

This unbelievably cheap-looking bottle, both in terms of material, color, and print. This manufacturer's website. And then there's the fact that the scent boasts being licensed from the ""official 24 television series."" All of this screams ""James Bond drugstore scent, but poorly made"" and ""Stay away!!!"" A thousand red alarm lights hang from the ceiling, someone stands in front of me and shoves an oversized ""STOP"" sign in my face. ""Don't do it niiiiiiiiight....."" I hear someone echo behind me with an outstretched arm...

What do I do? I beam at the scent bottle at the end of the dark corridor, which stands like the artifact in Indiana Jones' ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" on a lit pedestal. My eyes sparkle. It is supposed to smell like vanilla. And vanilla. Also vanilla! OMG, yes, I have to have it. After all, I love CH Men, and if the scent isn't sweet, who is? Excuse me, someone down there has already warned another CH Men lover about this scent? Oh well, tastes differ. I WILL love this scent because I love vanilla! And when you think about vanilla, you always have that beautiful natural Bourbon vanilla in mind or rather in your nose. A lovely, milky scoop of vanilla ice cream, bought from the best ice cream shop in the whole city, on a beautiful summer day. Ah, delightful! What am I still talking about, I have to take that bottle off the pedestal and spray it on myself. Excuse me? Oh yes, of course, the payment for the sample first. Here, 5 €, please, now let me finally sniff!!

...

...

OH MY SH
*!!!! What the hell is THAT??

Anyone who loves this scent (and can thus obviously take a sick leave for life) should please stop reading. Because now begins a review of the worst kind. Because this creation from hell deserves nothing else.

Actually, I’m not one for pessimism, I usually refrain from commenting on scents I don’t like. But THIS is not a scent (which is why I will henceforth refuse to call it a scent, out of respect for the feelings of the other 66,000 perfumes here - let’s call this scent RTL, as smell and broadcast program are equally bad). This stuff is vanilla pudding that was left out in the blazing sun in summer 2013 and has been sitting in the same spot ever since. By now, countless insects have crawled in and promptly perished. And while they rot in this spoiled pudding, someone from ScentStory comes along and bottles it up. Of course, opaque, so you can't see the goo inside. Quickly rummaged through the trash and found some golden plastic foil from last carnival. Wrapped it around, traced the ""24"" from a radio alarm clock from the €1 store, and off to the shelves. Oh dear, even perfumeries like Douglas have a reputation to lose and refuse to offer this thing. After a Douglas employee immediately fell into a coma while sniffing the sample and a police report was threatened, the man from ScentStory ran out of the store, pondering. How does he sell this garbage to men/women?

“HA!” *snaps fingers like Vicky* “There’s this YouTuber, Jonas, Jeremias, or whatever his name is. He said several times he would wear crap if women liked it! [Original statement, note from the editor.] I’ll give him this junk, tell him women would go crazy for it, take my grandma and my sister with me to fake a bit of “Ohhhh!” and “Ahhh!” (after they’ve smeared some neutralizing cream from pathology under their noses) and BOOM, he’ll promote it and I’ll get rich, ahahaha, RIIIIICHHH!!”

And indeed, RTL achieves an unbelievable 7.9 in the Parfumo rating. I can only explain it by assuming that the people who have rated this crap so far thought it was a school grading system from 1 to 6, and 6 wasn’t enough for them. It wouldn’t be enough for me either.

Why the hell are there no negative numbers available here?!

Projection and longevity, I can unfortunately confirm without a doubt. For me, a solid 10! I sprayed a mini-squirt on my right arm and immediately an EMT stormed into the office asking where the patient was. Despite washing multiple times, I can’t get RTL off my skin. I now fear that it will still be detectable at my wedding (and I don’t plan to get married in the next ten years). Haha, my wedding! As if I would ever find a woman with this stink bomb... Forever alone, thanks to 24 - that would at least be an honest slogan!

So, for heaven’s sake, please do not buy this scent! You can’t possibly hate yourself so much that you would want to put yourself through this and even pay money for it!

Speaking of hate, this RTL is perfect for misanthropes! Do you want to have your peace? Don’t want to be stupidly approached from the side, like being asked for directions? Put on a gas mask and wear RTL! The whole gym is full again, all machines occupied? Wear RTL and the training area belongs to you! You’re throwing a party and the guests just won’t leave? Wear RTL and go to sleep peacefully ten seconds later. This thing is a better ""bouncer music"" in a club than any slow waltz!

Maybe I’ve just approached this all wrong and considered RTL as a “scent,” while its purpose lies in a completely different field: self-defense! In times when everyone is getting pepper spray and the prices have skyrocketed, like helicopter pilots when they smell RTL on the ground, 24 Gold comes just in time! This thing is better than any CS gas you can buy. A spray of it on the attacker and he will scream and run away. The best part is, you don’t even have to hit him in the face. A spray on his clothes is enough. Or just on the advertising column 20 m away from him. No phone or wallet that he could steal will be worth it to him.

And for the sensitive souls who always avoid satire magazines like “Titanic,” please forgive me this dark sentence, but if several people wore RTL, Cologne wouldn’t have happened. An arm's length distance? Good joke, Ms. Reker! A tiny spray particle of RTL on skin or clothing and the Cathedral Square belongs to you alone!

Therefore, as a scent, it has failed miserably (down to the core of the Earth, shot out the other side, and disappeared somewhere in the vastness of space, where it will be found by aliens who will cause revenge for a new “Independence Day” on Earth), but as an expression of “I hate you all and want you to know it!” it is perfect.

PS: I offer this crap in the souk, but I wouldn’t advise anyone to buy it. Not even for the ex-partners mentioned in the title who cheated on you, then crashed your Porsche, and subsequently emptied your bank account. You can’t hate a person so much that you would gift them this scent."

I had just come home from the afternoon shift and my significant other greeted me with a raised eyebrow and a wrinkled nose, saying, ""You don't usually wear that, do you?

CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,01/30/2015,Unruh,M,97,,14,Hyped Instant Vanilla Pudding,"I wouldn't have thought it possible to encounter this fragrance in the wild, given the apparent production shortages.
Unfortunately, the bottle tends towards a similar tackiness as ""1 Million."" The fact that I’m not presented with a gold bar makes the impression of the bottle only slightly better. I hope the contents are better than the exterior suggests...

The opening of ""24 Gold"" offers, among other things, warm, spicy, resinous sweetness. I smell oud, not necessarily the highest quality, a diffuse, Christmas-like spice note, as well as hints of guaiac wood and floral-fruity tones that I cannot identify, which, however, fade away within the first few minutes. Sounds quite nice at first.
Unfortunately, the main player looms over it all. Sticky-sweet vanilla from start to finish. At the beginning, this sweet interplay of synthetic vanilla, resinous, gnarly oud, and the subtle, balsamic-sweet guaiac wood is overwhelming; I can initially only sense the spices and woods of the heart note.
Fortunately, the vanilla gradually recedes and finds an interesting balance with the spices and woods. I distinctly smell anise and fine sandalwood, with clove, cardamom, and dry cedar lurking beneath. Perhaps also a pinch of cinnamon, but I'm not sure. Together, this creates a light black tea or more aptly chai note with woody accents. Unfortunately, the overly sweet synthetic vanilla is still too present for my nose to warm up to it.
Towards the end, the sweetness of the vanilla finally subsides, and ""24 Gold"" becomes for me an almost wearable, amber-warm, distinctly vanilla cuddle scent.

I almost feared such an outcome with the fragrance pyramid and classification, but at the same time, I’m glad to have tested this scent. I can very well imagine the fragrance on guys in their prime disco age (especially considering the enormous longevity and projection) and also on some women. However, I don’t want to smell like that.
Now I have a craving for homemade vanilla pudding. Off to the kitchen! :)"
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,11/04/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,14,"Golden Secret Tip, Not Just for Oud Fans","I would have never bought this without the YouTube hype surrounding the 24 fragrances here... but it was absolutely worth it, and I can only join in the praise. So much fragrance for so little money, and then also from a series like celebrity scents - you don't expect that, and you are almost shocked and overwhelmed by the niche quality. A very noble, fine powdery oud scent and one of the biggest surprises of the year, definitely a recommendation to also test the remaining 24 fragrances. But that’s something you can hardly do anywhere, so interested parties will probably have to buy it blind. But with the prices, it's bearable, and Gold is a charming, party-appropriate oriental scent that doesn't overwhelm western noses.

It reminds me of Dior Homme Intense or even M7, quite precisely in the middle of the two. But still unique and very pleasing. Woody and powdery, luckily there are only jasmine nuances. Instead, there’s a lot of syrup, vanilla meets raspberry/strawberry. Dreamy, sweet, and bitter at the same time. The floral elements only form the bright frame for the bitter-dark painting. It even has the chocolate/cocoa elements of a DHI or some Montale. Jammy and perfect for rainy autumn days. For me, the sweetness even stays behind the oud and never overdoes it.

Bottle: chic, golden, handy in the 50ml variant. Still, it didn’t have to refer so blatantly to the (very good) series with 24. Among fragrance enthusiasts, that’s somewhat frowned upon. But the scent itself usually convinces even the biggest critics.
Sillage: strong, dark, mysterious, and a sweet vanilla-anise undertone make it suitable for going out. And almost exclusively so. It’s way too strong for the office, too powerful and sweet for leisure activities.
Longevity: 10-12 hours. Another strong point!

Anyone who tests it blind would think more of Amouage, Armani Privee, or Tom Ford - all the more surprising that it’s really a scent from the Fox series. A dream scent that walks the fine line between oud-dark and syrup-sweet. I hope it finds even more fans and is my budget tip for the coming winter!"
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,03/05/2015,Karli,M,27,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,14,"And when you wake up, I'm no longer Manuel Neuer","That's exactly how I imagined it when I had the sample of 24 Gold on my arm and later on my neck: The hope for a 100% gourmand vanilla scent! In the end, however, it was all just a dream.

""If you want, you can have everything!"" says the nice lady next to me on the sofa. Damn it, how does she know what I want? I want cola when I order cola, not Cola Zero! Stuck label - Pah, what a cheater. She can wriggle around on the little bed as playfully as she likes!

I know gourmand scents - I have a whole shelf full of them! And indeed, 24 Gold belongs to this category. However, if you've experienced some of the higher-end fragrances during your perfume journey, then 24 Gold simply lags a bit behind. I find it synthetic and lacking depth and strength.

Or maybe it's the power of habit, because once you're hooked on cola, all other drinks taste strange. I don't know, decide for yourself!

Anyone who likes, admires, enjoys, and wears this scent should do so with pride. I wish you all the best with it. As for me, I don't celebrate with 24 Gold in the stadium, in the locker room, or with a nice girl in pajamas on the sofa. Why? Because it promised me more than it ultimately delivered.

Cheers!"
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,08/05/2016,DieLora,F,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,"Can, but doesn't have to","Negative headlines are known to be the best headlines. This is also the case here. Thanks to some partly grandiose and stylishly formulated comments, I became aware of this fragrance. Due to this perfect negative advertising, my expectations were high. What must this olfactory beast be, what an overwhelming experience? Can I even smell it or will it burn my nose hairs away in an instant? Is ""it"" even allowed on the skin or do I risk severe burns?

I had to get a sample! I couldn't miss this, I was too curious and sensationalist. Sprayed on in anticipation of a vanilla smack, waited... nothing. Huh, where is it? Sprayed again... a slight whiff of plastic vanilla, then nothing. Did I get the wrong sample or did my olfactory cells die at the moment of first contact? Well, lately it often happens that I can hardly perceive a new fragrance on the first test, however, my friend did not run out of the living room gasping for air, did not complain, nor did he turn green after three sprays of 24 Gold on my forearm. Either my skin immediately devours the scent, absorbing all the predicted terrible things from my writers in that instant, or our noses were numbed by the overdose. There was nothing more than a slightly artificial vanilla on a wooden base.

On the second test the following day, 24 Gold reached me, still miles away from being impactful. An unspectacular sweet wood-spice-vanilla, Oud not perceivable on me. Nothing special and similar to scents I've smelled countless times before, some better, some less so. A bit of Kalemat, a bit of Raghba. As someone here has already written, Bouquet Ideal also comes to my mind, which, however, becomes significantly sweeter on me and annoyed me after a short time.

In summary, 24 Gold is average. Not breathtakingly strong, but also not weak. Not particularly loud, not particularly quiet/unobtrusive. Not particularly sticky, but also not unsweet (yet still too cloyingly sweet for me). I didn't fall into a coma, my friend didn't leave me or throw me out of the apartment, my dog didn't leave the room howling, and my skin had no burns. That's just how it is with negative advertising - the expectations for the negatively advertised object are infinitely high, the craving for sensation awakens, and 24 Gold could not satisfy that.

Conclusion: You can wear it. But you don't have to."

CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,10/08/2014,Achilles,F,83,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Oriental Allrounder,"Reformulation of my comment after a year on Parfumo:

24 Gold is for me the absolute crowning achievement of this ScentStory series, the outlier - because the others are, in my opinion, hopelessly unable to keep up. 24 Gold is still rightly
one of THE fragrances that easily surpasses many of my over 800 or more newly tested perfumes. It is still a revelation! 24 Gold is a damn revelation! The absolute fragrance twin of Kalemat, the only downside compared to Kalemat is that it lingers on clothing for days and on skin all day, all night until morning. The 24 says goodbye after a few hours, so you can nicely reapply. There we have the quality difference - but otherwise - Must-Have.

24 Gold is a blend of warm woods, vanilla pudding, oriental pastries, and spices, a souk in the midst of a sandy landscape, a wonderful Arabian oasis that I would love to drink - that is sandalwood and generally such great wood, so fantastically soaked with vanilla, oud, and amber. The fragrance offers an oriental creaminess that is unparalleled. It evokes wonderful fabrics at the bazaar, fragrant hair pomades, garments perfumed with various spices and incense, the scent of the Orient at over 30 degrees, mixed with the smell of sand.

The scent progression is linear for me, the skilled blend of oud, vanilla, and amber is ever-present. Not dirty, not musty, just sweet, creamy oud. This would be a fragrance that comes into the closer selection if one had to ruthlessly determine those that should accompany one longer, 24 Gold will accompany me for a long time. It is an allrounder, perfect for autumn and winter, but casual enough for summer, apart from the fact that I am not so tempted to differentiate there. It certainly does not overwhelm me when it's warm.
The fact that it is now supposed to be discontinued is not entirely clear to me, and anyone who has the opportunity to buy this should not hesitate long."

Here I am again, the slow (internal Swiss joke / note from the author) Bernese. But when it comes to buying perfume, I can be quite quick. 24...oh yes, I loved that series! It did get a bit stale after a few seasons with the same old formula, but that’s how it is with all long-running series. And the scent to go with it? Jack Bauer - full of energy, aggressive, selfless, intelligent. Action-packed! Something adventurous had to come out of this!! So what did the marketing folks and fragrance engineers come up with and launch???

I read reviews about it and watched some videos. Almost everyone is thrilled! And when I read through the pyramid, it looks like I should love the scent. Because: it’s sweet, a lot of vanilla...a lot of powder, a bit of wood. Yum, a winter scent for me? Could this replace my favorite cozy scent CH Men by Carolina Herrera? NO! Clearly!

I had to buy the scent online since it’s nowhere to be found (at least not in our small provincial capital). I assumed it would at least be mediocre, but...

The first spray on my wrist. A cloud hit me...really disgustingly artificial. What did it remind me of? Yes right, there used to be this artificially sweet vanilla pudding LIGHT. Omg, that was dreadful. And the scent now, what can I say to be polite? Artificially overly sweet Light-vanilla-something. But truly a yuck effect for my nose. You know what I mean, everyone has those scents that just smell disgusting to them. Unfortunately, 24 is one of those.

I still give it 40% because after a few hours it wasn’t quite as disgusting, but still definitely too sweet. Lol and I’m saying this, of all people, the one who could bathe in CH Men. Be that as it may. Unfortunately, this was a wrong purchase. At least it wasn’t expensive.

I really like vanilla ice cream, but this is just...artificial-powdery...nope, not at all. Especially not on a man over 25, but that’s just my opinion. It might be least noticeable if you’re baking cookies in winter and a lot of vanilla is floating around the room, then it might still work.

Wishing you a lovely autumn and see you at the next scent."

To me, it only smells of overpowering synthetic vanilla, which makes you feel a bit nauseous. Oud can be detected a little in the background, but it doesn't stand out since the vanilla has already knocked it out in the first round.

The longevity was to be expected, very good; it would have been wise to tone it down a bit.

CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,11/09/2014,Hotscent89,M,18,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Speechless !!,"First of all, I just have to say I'm completely blown away... What a magnificent fragrance !!

My first experience with a unisex fragrance was Meharees, which disappointed me quite a bit and also came off as far too feminine.

I was initially skeptical about 24 Gold and was pretty sure that it would disappoint me as well.

But I was so wrong that it couldn't have been any other way....

If I had to describe the scent briefly, I would say: A magical blend of ""Opium Pour Homme,"" ""Dior Homme Intense,"" and a hint of ""Jubilation XXV Man.""

Many might disagree with me here, but I suppose I shouldn't care.

It has that sweetness that comes from the berries in Opium Pour Homme, along with the delicious and soft vanilla. Then there's the seductive and elegant element of Dior Homme Intense, combined with the nobility and class of Jubilation XXV Man.

I can smell all of these more or less in this fragrance.
At first, the sweetness is really almost a bit too much, and the floral notes in the fragrance make it extremely soft. It would be a bit too feminine for me.

Then, after a while, when the vanilla takes over, the fragrance becomes a dream. Vanilla and amber enchant you, and there's a touch of cinnamon that gives the scent a subtle spiciness.

Jasmine and ylang-ylang skillfully play with the sweetness of the fragrance and meet relatively bright woods that lend a slightly masculine note to the scent.

This fragrance simply blows me away and could become my new favorite next to Dior Homme Intense.

The scent is the perfect blend of sweet, woody, and floral elements. Accompanied by a very dominant vanilla towards the end, a bit of cinnamon, and a slightly smoky amber with a hint of festive anise.

The fragrance fits perfectly with the Christmas season and thus into winter. On relatively cold autumn days, I can still imagine wearing it. But definitely nothing for spring or summer.

24 Gold is, after or maybe even alongside Dior Homme Intense, the most delicious oriental gourmand I have had the pleasure of getting to know.

The fragrance really lasts extremely long, and I can still smell it on myself after many hours. After 5-6 hours, it becomes closer to the skin, but even then, the sillage is still enough to let others partake in this masterpiece. Especially outside on cold days, your fellow humans will be delighted when a light breeze carries this scent to them. The fragrance creates an irresistible warm aura that one cannot escape. Warm, elegant, seductive, and even a bit sensual and erotic, it radiates all of that.

Longevity 9/10
Sillage 9/10
Scent 10/10
Price 100/10

As you can probably see from the points I have given here, the price scores extremely well.

I really can't explain how a fragrance of this class and level can have a price of under €30 for 100ml.
The fragrance is definitely unisex, and I would say it is equally wearable for both genders, but I would actually assign it a little more to men. Thus, it is easier for me to wear it with a good conscience !!

The fragrance was released in 2009 and is therefore a masterpiece of recent perfume history and will most likely one day attain the status of a classic.
For a long time, I searched for a winter fragrance worthy of residing alongside DHI and Midnight in Paris in my fragrance cabinet and settling there permanently.

Now I like it so much that it might even get the presidential suite.
In the end, I can only emphasize again: ""an incredible fragrance""

Everyone should test it and take the opportunity to acquire such a masterpiece for an extremely low price.

For the title of my comment being speechless, I have really found a lot of words, but I couldn't possibly withhold what I think of this fragrance from you.

Deserved 100%, and now the cold winter days can finally come, I am ready !!

So I have to go from 100% to 90%.

It doesn't quite reach my favorites DHI and MIP.

The fragrance is great, but already quite feminine, and the extreme sweetness can become overwhelming after a while. I definitely can't wear it regularly."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,02/08/2013,S3lin,F,40,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,"Sugary Raspberry Syrup on an Oriental Spice Cart, Served with Wood Shavings","Yes, ScentStory is niche. Niche does not always have to mean elegant or particularly high quality, as the past has shown. For example, Yves de Sistelle can also be considered niche: not widely available and hard to find everywhere.
So what should one expect from a company that designs fragrances in series? ScentStory has fragrances not only for 24 but also for Gossip Girl and The Mentalist in its lineup. I have already researched and submitted these carefully, so they should appear here soon. In principle, ScentStory is a company that produces star fragrances. And they have not always been able to convince with originality or quality in the past. (A pleasant exception here is Madonna's Truth or Dare, a wonderful scent!)

Skeptically, I get to work, many thanks to the generous donor without whom I probably would never have been able to test this fragrance.
I press the sprayer and at the same moment I wonder if that was the tester or if I accidentally activated the raspberry scent atom bomb. Everyone in the room has to wrinkle their noses, but at the same time, big eyes are also made. Not bad if we die! That would be a delicious and beautiful death.
A sugary raspberry syrup scent spreads, there is really a great power behind it. I cannot understand how the longevity and sillage are rated so poorly here. The raspberry smells like syrup, but not plasticky-synthetic, rather relatively authentic, ""saturated"" and round. A few seconds later, however, disappointment sets in: the raspberry is overwhelmed by an army of spices and whines softly in the background. But the disappointment does not last long, as this is only the case directly on the skin. A few handbreadths away, or rather the scent trail that you drag behind you, is again dominated by the raspberry. Shrill notes penetrate everything in the fragrance world. Fruity, sugary sweet but very well contrasted with some sharp spices, which in turn is pleasantly rounded off by a creaminess. While the scent on the skin is not at all my thing, I move in a cloud that can completely convince me. If this scent could be made visible, I would probably just about be recognizable in a pink mist. It’s that strong!

Quality and originality get full points. But is the scent suitable for everyday wear? No! Am I interested in that? Somehow less. I am young and a student, I can wear what, where, and when I want. Surely the scent is also not for the European, and yet - one must say - conservative masses. This scent plays in the innovative league of the Middle East, where it comes from, and perhaps also the USA. And for the typical vintage and classic fan of Parfumo, this is also nothing. Good, because this one is for me!"
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,02/04/2015,Nasengourmet,M,54,,7,My Personal Throne Sniffer,"Oh, I somehow understand the people who call 24 Gold cheap swill. It is indeed a very cheeky scent that, in my opinion, aims to polarize intentionally. 24 Gold does not rely on being loved by everyone. The often mentioned synthetic vanilla has something truly special about it. And then it is cheekily mixed with an oud that seems to belong to the sweatier type of oud, making this scent really mega exciting.

The fragrance starts with its special vanillin blend that strongly resembles raspberry. This very sugary vanilla is mixed with delicious woody notes that are not immediately recognizable. But you perceive them from the beginning to the end.

An extremely strong sillage surrounds the wearer for at least 2 hours. Due to the strong caramel vanilla note, I would love to smell it on a woman. I would even argue that this is actually not a unisex fragrance but the perfect women's scent. How I would love to admire it on a beautiful woman and then realize that my brain is totally manipulated by this genius fragrance. The longevity is long and strong. You can perceive this scent on the wearer for about 8 hours without direct skin contact.

For me, 24 Gold is a throne sniffer because it truly overshadows some of my previous discoveries. I didn't expect much from such a cheap fragrance. Also, the fact that it is so hard to get is actually not a good sign. However, you immediately realize that you were mistaken. It has made it into my Top 5, even though I probably prefer it on women rather than on myself. But it is soooo incredibly pleasant. It is like food for the nose.

Maybe you know the feeling that every time you smell it, you are amazed at how wonderful a fragrance can be, and you keep marveling at how good a scent is. I experienced exactly that here. My Body Kouros remains my favorite, but 24 Gold is also a different, sweeter direction. But it manages to rank right behind Kilian's Back to Black for me. Thanks to Jens123 who gave me the tip in the forum. Really, a thousand thanks!"
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,01/24/2015,Vokky,M,6,,7,Extraordinary,"Well, sooner or later you inevitably come across 24Gold if you are interested in fragrances. When I was made aware of it through YouTube, I eventually ended up here at Parfumo to somehow find out how to get my hands on this scent. I’m glad I landed here.

Like my predecessor VD86, it was extremely exciting to unpack the bottle, especially because of all the raving here. But I didn’t let myself be swayed and approached this scent with skepticism so as not to think prejudicially, ""Oh, it must be wonderfully delightful.""
However, the first spray left me astonished; it is simply so beautifully different from everything else.

A noble vanilla sweet and creamy meets wood and is confused by amber and spices. On top of that, just the right drop of naughtiness and wickedness. I have no idea what it is, but you would almost want to lick it off yourself. Sorry for this little digression, but there seems to be something in it that is somehow really sexy.

In my opinion, the vanilla dominates, although this spicy note is also very strong. It’s as if you walk into a tea shop and there... oh, let’s forget about describing that; it’s certainly not possible without slipping into a naughty corner.

I have to agree, the scent is overwhelming but also very feminine. In my eyes, it is the perfect women's fragrance. It doesn’t smell cheap, even though it is. It stands out completely from what I know. Sometimes you smell a fragrance in a perfumery and try to recognize similarities, but here I forget any comparison because it just doesn’t work.

I must say that you can definitely buy this scent without knowing it. If you don’t like it, there will surely be enough buyers who will pay more than the import cost.

Conclusion: It’s a shame that this brilliant scent has such a silly name. I didn’t like the series. A name like ""This is it"" or ""Must Have"" would fit better. It’s a knockout how sexy vanilla is mixed here with spices, wood, and amber to create a perfect composition. Yes, and it somehow makes you addicted to smelling it. From me, 90% because it weakens in longevity after 5 hours. That probably means I won’t be able to avoid buying Kalimat. It’s supposed to be almost the same, just almost endlessly lasting."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,03/05/2025,Basti87,M,1064,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Familiar DNA at a Reasonable Price,"This fragrance from the American brand Scentstory has been on the market for 15 years. For a while, this scent became quite rare and was sold by some shops at significantly higher prices. This usually indicates that production has been discontinued or temporarily halted. Now it is available again in some shops at fair prices. I have known this one for a while, and Jeremy also introduced this fragrance during his informative time. Price-wise, it's already a good catch. If you like sweet-oriental fragrances with gourmand-spicy notes, you are in the right place here.

You can find this fragrance at different price points. I paid a little over €20 for my 100ml, which is absolutely fair for this scent. This golden bottle is really pretty and can be quite enticing. The box is also quite attractive.
In terms of scent, it is one of many with this ""Casamorati - Bouquet Ideale (Eau de Parfum) | XerJoff"" DNA. Fragrances like Oud Save the King EAU DE PARFUM, ""Kalemat | Arabian Oud / العربية للعود"", or ""Raghba / رغبة | Lattafa / لطافة"" (which is in a similar price range) share this DNA. However, in the low-budget segment, this 24 Gold is already my favorite in this style. In my opinion, it doesn't quite reach the level of Casamorati, and the Atkinson is a bit more refined.
What I like about this fragrance is its sweet-oriental DNA with complex woods and warm gourmand notes. You don't really smell Oud prominently, yet this fragrance possesses a wonderful oriental spiciness. The dark Guaiac wood fits quite well with these oriental notes. The combination of sandalwood and cedarwood is also active in the background, providing a great foundation for this oriental sweetness. The vanilla sweetness is really pleasant and not too sticky-sweet. Ylang Ylang also contributes with a wonderful creamy note that rounds everything off nicely. The base is predominantly vanilla-amber with soft woods. However, the DNA from the opening remains consistent throughout, and the progression is rather linear. The fragrance is completely unisex and suitable for almost all occasions, except in summer and during sports activities.
The performance is quite good, lasting about 10 hours. The sillage also holds up well for several hours.

Overall, a great alternative if you like this DNA. I like it a bit better than Raghba as it feels a bit more refined."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,03/18/2015,Hammerhead,M,27,,0,creamy,"Everywhere you turn, you read about this fragrance, everyone wants it, recommends it.
KrZa was kind enough to send me a sample, and everything I read was confirmed: beautiful vanilla, a bit of cedarwood, and amber. It smells incredibly good; you have to hold yourself back from applying too much. Last night, I received three compliments right away.
The scent goes on like oil; I would love to wash my clothes with it or mix a delicious vanilla shake, hahaha.
I’m thrilled, now I just hope that ScentStory releases something new or that I can find a bottle somewhere else..."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,02/04/2015,Biggihi,F,131,,5,Not Bad,"When a fragrance is hyped up like this, I have to test it too. To be honest, I can't fully understand the hype.
Right after spraying, I notice a very nice, delicious vanilla. Great, I think, exactly what I love at the moment. The vanilla stays with me the whole time.
But after about a quarter of an hour, something else comes in. I don't know what I'm smelling. It can't be jasmine or anise, as I quite like those. Sandalwood or cedarwood don't smell that overpowering either. Is it the oud? No idea. In any case, it becomes quite unpleasant for me. A mix of bitter, sweet, artificial, which I just don't like. But I resist the urge to wash it off.
After an hour, I'm rewarded. It becomes really pleasant, amber and vanilla dominate the scent, and I start to really like it again. It lasts like this for almost 8 hours. If it weren't for that one unpleasant hour, I could completely understand the hype and would have given it 100%. But as it is, I have to make significant deductions for myself.
In the first 90 minutes, it has a quite strong sillage, but then it fades away.
For summer, in my opinion, it is too heavy and warm; it fits perfectly for winter. I also definitely don't see it as unisex; for me, this is a clear women's fragrance that I absolutely cannot imagine on men due to its quite strong sweetness."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,05/22/2023,Garnele,M,319,,5,The Oriental Joop Homme,"When I became aware of ""24 Gold | ScentStory,"" the hype around the fragrance was already over. Still, I had to have it to understand why there was once such a huge hype around the scent. Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed because the perfume smells almost identical to a fragrance I once owned and did not like at all. This is ""Raghba | Lattafa / لطافة,"" which,..."
CK In2U Heat for Her 2009,12/26/2012,GoatMilk,M,3,,3,The Sweet Jack Bauer,"At first, I was quite ambivalent about whether I even wanted to go through the ""bizarre"" ordering process to test this perfume.

Ultimately, 24 Gold is a fragrance from the TV show ""24"". Accordingly, I had several prejudices regarding this perfume: how good or high-quality can a scent from a Fox TV show really smell? Wasted time, wasted money.

However, I was proven wrong. 24 Gold is, as the bottle suggests, a heavy, sweet gourmand scent and definitely something for the colder days. Whether the hype surrounding this fragrance, prevalent on many popular US fragrance forums, was justified still had to be seen.

I am not someone who shies away from sweet scents; I have several sweet fragrances in my collection - but initially, I struggled with 24 Gold. 24 Gold is really sweet, very sweet.

Once applied, you are immediately greeted by a berry, possibly raspberry. This fruity, berry note essentially dominates the top notes. After wearing it more often, you also perceive a slight woody note, but as mentioned, it is rather subtle, as the berry note strongly dominates. Oud is listed among the fragrance notes, but I don't smell it at all.

After the sweet, berry, and slightly woody phase, it gradually moves towards the drydown, where amber and vanilla take over the reins. Overall, 24 Gold is dominated by 2 notes: berry (raspberry?!) and amber.

It is a scent that many will not like at first glance - even those who enjoy sweet fragrances. I myself have gradually grown fond of the scent, and I like it more and more. The price-performance ratio is very good for this fragrance, because even if it may be too sweet, etc., the ingredients used seem high-quality to me and border on niche quality, or what one would imagine from niche fragrances. You can get the scent for $55/3.4oz, which is really very good for the quality of the fragrance.

Since the scent is really very ""heavy"", it is advisable to reach for the bottle only on cold days. Even for autumn, 24 Gold would be too much for me.

In conclusion, it can be said that 24 Gold definitely requires time. Many men in my circle of acquaintances find the scent far too feminine and far too sweet, and even though they are not very experienced in the world of fragrances, I can understand the ""criticism"". As mentioned, you can expect raspberry, amber, and vanilla, so you already know in advance where the journey is headed.

My only point of criticism is that 24 Gold is not very versatile. You really limit yourself, as I personally see no use for it except for cold days, and when it comes to occasions, it is not very easy for me to find something suitable."

Eternity Night,07/06/2024,Thequeenbean,F,59,,1,Casual and cute,"The citrusy osmanthus plays really well with the unique notes of powdered sugar and wheat. I find this to be a classic and comfortable fragrance, I often wear this when I am outside for extended amounts of time as it holds up well. I recently tried Narciso Rodriguez for Her EDT and they are strikingly similar, but I actually prefer this as it smells more complex and less animalic"
CK One,10/09/2024,Einfinken,F,74,,1,Generic,"This is a pretty and very feminine scent but nothing about it sticks out as particularly special to me (excluding the absolutely beautiful bottle). I really appreciate how fresh and joyful the peony is in Elysium Pour Femme and I enjoy that note quite a bit here. However, there is something about Elysium Pour Femme that feels akin to hairspray.

Nice scent that I can't imagine anyone being offended by, but I think you can find other similar scents that are similar for better price.

Of the Roja Women's sample pack this sits somewhere in the middle for me. Not my favorite but also not a dislike. It's just sort of fine."
CK One,06/21/2025,Milchmädchen,F,47,,2,Expensive perfume that smells cheap,"Elysium Pour Femme is … okay. It is exactly what people say:
A bright, fruity-floral scent (but with a powdery base) that tends to lean in a shampoo-like direction. It is pleasant and unobtrusive, but surprisingly basic for a Roja fragrance. An aldehydic-sharp freshness that is nice enough, but not particularly memorable.

I’m glad I didn’t blind buy a whole bottle. The 2 ml sample was the right decision - a few wears confirmed to me that Elysium Pour Femme is perfectly fine, but nothing special or something I would prefer over other fragrances in my collection. The long longevity and the charming bottle are positive aspects."
CK One,05/17/2025,AltesMamilei,F,52,,5,Similar to this fragrance,"it smelled on a hot summer day in my grandmother's garden.
This fragrance opens with fruits that harmonize very well together.
Then a multitude of different flowers joins in.
My grandmother had a large garden with fruit trees and bushes, as well as many flower beds, hence the comparison.
The base makes me think of sitting with a vanilla ice cream in hand on one of her old wooden garden chairs.
This fragrance certainly hasn't reinvented the wheel, but it is a truly lovely companion in summer."
CK One,02/29/2024,Maja92,F,15,,7,High Expectations...,"As has been read in many statements, the expectation was high, and the fall therefore deep.

It is not a bad scent in my nose. It starts fruity, slightly citrusy/sparkling, accompanied by a lot of floral notes, and ends sweetish/slightly woody. It is rather light, bright, without much depth. If one were to be unkind, one could label it as ""watery."" On my skin, it has a somewhat melony quality.
A fruity scent that works for me, a light all-rounder, but also nothing new, nothing special, and therefore unfortunately not worth the price for me."
Eternity Summer for Men 2016,08/29/2022,Real3XO,M,19,,19,A Positive Surprise with an Inappropriate Name,"The first Orodion by Justin didn’t really impress me. However, the extremely negative reviews here on Parfumo are still hard to understand. For me, it leaned very much towards the BR540 direction, which should actually appeal to the mass taste. Since I’m not a fan of the ""original"" at all, I only liked the Orodion somewhat. Still, it’s a good fragrance and certainly not one that deserves a 5.5 rating.

With the right mindset, I approached the second release. Probably a very mass-appealing, rather boring fragrance for summer.

However, the notes already hinted that this cannot be a purely summer fragrance. More like autumn or winter. Small spoiler: That’s indeed the case.

First, let’s talk about the bottle and packaging. They are of really high quality and significantly better than many other niche houses. That’s already a plus point.

The plum in the fragrance pyramid particularly stands out. I immediately thought of the wonderful Arabesque, as it also contains plum, but more on that in a moment.

The fragrance indeed starts with a distinct, delicious plum note. This is enveloped by almonds and nutmeg. Sweet fruitiness describes it quite well. In the drydown, there’s soft sandalwood, which makes the fragrance very creamy. Vanilla also comes through a bit at some point, and I personally can’t directly perceive the oud, but it’s probably there and gives the whole thing a certain foundation.
Overall, one can say that with Orodion Blanc, we have a soft, creamy sweet fragrance with good fruitiness from the plum. Nothing here is overly disturbing or stands out negatively. A nice, rounded overall package.

Especially in the drydown, a clear similarity to the Arabesque is noticeable. I don’t find that bad at all, as the Arabesque is a phenomenal fragrance. Orodion Blanc is not a dupe or clone, but it still goes in that direction. So I really like it a lot.

As already suspected, this is a full autumn/winter fragrance for me, or for evenings or a date. In summer, it can be worn but isn’t necessary.

In my opinion, it’s also unisex, although it’s more suitable for mature individuals. Theoretically, due to the sweetness, it could also work for younger people if they really want to. It’s not a Tobacco Oud by Tom Ford, which clashes everywhere, but a mass-appealing yet very beautiful autumn/winter fragrance.

Longevity is completely fine at 8-10 hours. However, the Arabesque lasts longer. The sillage, on the other hand, is really very good with Orodion Blanc. You leave a reasonable but pleasant fragrance cloud behind.

For the quality of the fragrance and bottle as well as the DNA, I find the 100 € completely reasonable. Fairly, I must say that if I had to choose one, I would rather go for the Arabesque. It makes the whole experience slightly better and lasts longer. Unfortunately, there’s only the large 100ml of that, although the price per ml is roughly the same for both.

In summary, it’s a really very solid release that I didn’t expect at all. Also, the name doesn’t hint at this fragrance direction. In autumn and winter, it will definitely be used by me, and I certainly don’t regret the purchase.

I can’t really relate to Justin’s clothing style, and I don’t watch his videos, but I have to tip my hat to the Orodion Blanc. Really well done!"
Eternity Summer for Men 2016,12/30/2023,Gschpusi,F,302,,21,Sandalwood Delight,"Orodion Blanc sounds like a distant planet. Far away from all wars, unrest, environmental disasters, deceit, and trickery. A small star that somehow pulses in the sky when you fixate on it long enough.
A creamy almond dessert, almost like a mousse. Briefly caramelized with almost unripe plums and doused with a splash of cedar sap. In a fireproof bowl, it is stirred smooth. Amber and vanilla brittle are folded in repeatedly until a creamy blend is formed. Now, right now, the bowl is hung over smoldering sandalwood, on chains of nutmeg beads. The steam from the sparkling, dense, and woody sandalwood wafts around this creamy mousse, giving off such a wonderful aroma. It is not a sweet dessert, but a creamy poem that delights your nose.
Sandalwood, just the way I like it. Although I usually approach sandalwood with some distance.
Far away from Arabesque, with which it is compared. It has a completely different scent DNA for me.
Orodion Blanc is extremely pleasant to wear and could even enrich my collection.
Thank you so much, Don, for this fragrant experience!"
Eternity Summer for Men 2016,11/21/2022,Orodion94,M,27,,14,Pleasant Plum in a Woody Vanilla Coat,"The first Orodion fragrance was purchased and found to be good. So on to release No. 2 Orodion Blanc. The scent comes in an elegant white-on-white bottle and feels high-quality. The opening begins with a warm vanilla note accompanied by roasted almond. The plum only comes to the subtle forefront for me after a few minutes and remains perceptible for a long duration, yet never intrusive. After about a quarter of an hour, a coat for the warm plum joins in, like a pleasant vanilla coat for the plum. However, for me, it’s not a summer scent as it is too sweet and too woody/spicy, but it is well-suited for autumn and the soon-to-begin winter, making it a pleasant companion."
Eternity Summer for Men 2016,09/02/2022,Nicooscent,M,1,,6,Quite Okay,"I already bought the first Orodion, but I found it quite unpleasant. Somehow a biting smell that caused headaches. Still, I wanted to give the second fragrance a chance. The first time I sprayed it, I was really blown away! I would love to bite into this sweet oriental plum.
The problem...
Other users described the scent as vanilla with the plum in the background. I must strongly disagree with that. In the first hours, I exclusively perceive this incredibly sweet, creamy plum, and that’s where I have my criticism. I’ve been wearing the fragrance for the 3rd day now and I’ve simply gotten used to this plum bomb. My mood regarding this scent has shifted from “How awesome is this” to “Oh no, not this plum again.”
For me, it’s definitely a fragrance that is wearable. But maybe only every 2 weeks."
Eternity Summer for Men 2016,08/29/2022,Dogan20,M,1,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Big Turnaround,"Recently, it has been quiet around the well-known YouTuber, and I haven’t followed him much lately. I somewhat liked his first fragrance, but I was unfortunately not convinced by the H/S for the price, although the 5.5 rating was also very harsh.
Coincidentally, I saw that he is now releasing his second fragrance, and the bottle convinced me. With the intention that if I don’t like the scent, I would return it, I placed the order. Now the fragrance arrived today, and while unpacking, I noticed again how good the bottle has turned out. The gold fits perfectly with the rest of the bottle and is very harmonious, but is the content as well?
To the much more important part, I must say that the bottle really matches the scent. At first, a very sweet plum comes at you, enveloped in powder and cream. At the beginning, it really punches you in the face; after the drydown, vanilla and sandalwood come into play, and the sweetness projects very well.

I can’t say much about the longevity and sillage yet; I still need to test it thoroughly, and that will be the decisive moment whether this fragrance is really worth the money this time. From the whole presentation and the scent, this is already a good start. Hopefully, the H/S won’t disappoint; otherwise, I will probably have to fulfill the intention I had when ordering.

(Regarding the comparison to Arabesque, I can’t say much since I don’t know the scent, but from the pyramid, it seems to resemble it.)"

CK One Summer 2004,04/18/2025,Smirky,M,483,,2,Bottled Weak Citrus,"Had high hopes for a fume named ""Bold Citrus"". Unfortunately, it's definitely not bold. Bottled Bold Citrus DOES open with a very pleasant, juicy citrus scent. It struck me more orange-y than lemon-y. However, within 5 to 10 minutes, the citrus pulls back significantly as the woody notes appear. They are mixed with, I assume, the elemi resin, giving BBC a creamy woody scent as opposed to a sharp vetiver. As it evolves further over 20 to 30 minutes, the citrus takes a definite minor role to the creamy woody scent. Quite an average scent - the same sort of quick transition numerous other freshie citrus fragrances have.

Longevity was moderate - still got whiffs around the 5 hour mark but the citrus was long gone. Projection was moderate as well. Price, even at discounters, is expensive for what it is."

CK One Summer 2004,06/03/2025,Leimbacher,M,2870,,13,(B)Old Citrus,"One could almost call the name cynical and parodic, as there is nothing bold about this new Boss, and I wouldn't call it a statement either. However, it is a completely solid citrus creamy…

“Boss Bold Citrus” doesn’t reinvent the wheel. Not Boss’s, not the office fragrance’s, not that of the lemon or the cake. Nevertheless, it combines these elements unobtrusively and well, so hardly anyone will say it smells bad. At least not the average consumer. Yet, I can well imagine that this will be too little for most perfume enthusiasts here. Too little power and twist, too little energy and uniqueness, too little shine and excitement. “Bold Citrus” is a very safe and understated blend of classic Boss DNA and lemon cake meets bathroom freshener. The latter should be read with a massive wink - but it does remind one a bit of a duck or the frog in the bathroom… Just office-dimmed. When it gets really sweaty and tight, when it gets serious, when it’s about the sausage and the roll - then “Bold Citrus” is unfortunately not the right scent. It’s enough for all warm-ups, trials, training sessions, and qualifiers. After that, it’s better to let the real men and fragrances take over.

Bottle: green but not particularly bold
Sillage: more delicate than strong
Longevity: 4-5 hours is already significantly below a normal “workday” for which the main clientele uses a “Boss” scent…

Conclusion: a solid and compact lemonizer without real weaknesses or strengths. Craftsmanship from Boss. Minimally elevated mass-produced goods. But only because I always like vetted lemons on me. Even so ordinary and standard."
CK One Summer 2004,03/10/2025,Catchmynose,M,67,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,And yet another one....,"Wow… the new flanker of what is probably the most successful men's perfume line of the last 2000 years has been on the market for about 3 weeks now and there is still no review…?!?!?
It may be because this scent is supposedly limited… limited (at least for now) to the duty-free shops of selected airports…. so they said (?) to the best wife of all when she had to make a stopover in Frankfurt on her business trip in mid-February. Still, it is surprising, as the crowd of influencers had almost unanimously reported on the next Boss chick.
Anyway… I’ll just do it here.
After the great Boss Bottled Absolu (which, however, doesn’t fit into the BB empire at all and would definitely achieve cult status under another name), the brand chief has hit the mark again. Although it probably won’t be celebrated in the future as much as the aforementioned little water, it will still gain many fans (if MEN can actually find it physically somewhere). In my opinion, it is the freshest Bottled variant. This is, of course, to be expected given its name… but we perfume nerds know that what’s on the label doesn’t necessarily reflect what’s inside.
At first, a lush lemon note hits the nose, so there will surely be some complainers who will equate this with a toilet cleaner; if that were the case, then it wouldn’t be so quiet in the restroom for long. At the beginning, it somehow reminds me a bit of Drakkar Noir EAU DE TOILETTE; and since I am a fan of this classic, I quite like this initial boldness. At this point, I hardly perceive the BB DNA. However, that changes after about 20 minutes. Although the subtle apple vibes are missing, patchouli and vetiver make their way forward and I feel ""bottled."" Meanwhile, BC performs herbaceous; but still retains the citrus note (albeit much more subdued). Later, it even becomes quite woody…. A scent journey that not many in this series are fortunate enough to experience.
After about 5 hours, the fun is already over. What a pity…
Do we need ""Bold Citrus""? Hmmmm at least more than many of its siblings. Various houses also deliver woody freshies; the wheel hasn’t been reinvented here. Nevertheless, I enjoy wearing it at the moment, as it doesn’t hurt and refreshes me from morning until lunch break… very nice.."

Yes, I will take the plunge. As I unscrew the lid, a fresh green scent fills my nose. I am overwhelmed; I did not expect this. I take out two slices from the jar and add them to my risotto. It was simply super delicious. When applying this fragrance, you first..."
CK One Summer 2004,06/21/2025,Fabian2710,M,13,,4,Boss Bottled Bold Citrus - a good summer fragrance,"I tested Boss Bottled Bold Citrus last week and I must say, it is really very good. At first, it smells like a lemon iced tea and it becomes softer over time for the nose, but it always retains its citrus note in the foreground.

I think Boss Bottled Bold Citrus is a perfect summer fragrance for everyday wear but also for special occasions.

All in all, I can recommend the scent to anyone who enjoys citrus fragrances."
CK One Summer 2004,05/04/2025,Patrick83HC,M,22,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Surprisingly Good,"I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised because it is really a good scent for summer. You can smell a strong citrus note similar to that of Dior Homme Cologne, which doesn’t mean they smell alike, and there’s also a nice green note. It’s nothing new and it will bore many, but I think it can definitely be worn well in summer for everyday work or leisure.

The longevity is, as is typical for fresh scents, not the best, but considering it’s a citrus fragrance, it’s quite good. The sillage is also not outstanding, but it doesn’t have to be.

You can argue about the price; designer fragrances are always getting more expensive, but I find that Boss is still relatively low-priced, and you can definitely find it cheaper online.

In my opinion, this is at the top of summer designs this year."
CK One Summer 2004,06/03/2025,Floisdufte,M,5,,3,Surprisingly Good,"The new Boss Bottled Bold Citrus really impressed me after the Absolute, another top fragrance from the house.
You get the lemon right at the start along with a woody accord and the classic musk feeling that radiates masculinity. All in all, I find the new Bold Citrus really successful and it will definitely continue the top path that Boss has taken."
CK One Summer 2004,06/24/2025,Haubi93,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,"Wide, yet short fragrance journey","When I first sprayed the fragrance, I was greeted by a sweet yet zesty lemon. Pleasant, but it could definitely be a bit fresher.
I didn't perceive the scent for very long, but after some time I smelled it again and wondered where this very sweet, almost heavy perfume suddenly came from. I started to doubt myself until I used the fragrance a second time and noticed that the lemon had quickly left me and the fragrance journey shifted to a rather sweet and heavy scent.
For me, this would be suitable for a little freshness kick when spraying, knowing that I'm going out in the evening. Then the scent develops appropriately for the event into a date fragrance.
However, for everyday wear, it would be too much for me. I was looking forward to a fresh lemon and unfortunately got the opposite, although only after an hour."
CK One Summer 2004,05/31/2025,Rainmaker,M,111,,3,Boss - Lemon on the Wrong Track.,"Boss Bottled Bold Citrus - briefly BBBC - only lives up to its name in the opening.

A great opening: fresh, juicy, very strong, direct lemon. Really not subtle or extremely high quality, but well done. Fortunately, it’s also not too sweet - relatively neutral and pure. Very quickly, woods come through, and it becomes very dry and woody due to its base DNA. Here, you can recognize resin and vetiver. The lemon remains present throughout - that’s nice.

However, the drydown takes a wrong turn for me and becomes too dry, with the lemon note slipping into a chemical realm - and you unfortunately notice the price segment in which this fragrance will ultimately lie.

The Boss Bottled original DNA is very small - maybe 10 percent. I don’t see at all how many here say it’s just a Boss Bottled “with more lemon.” There’s neither apple nor cinnamon or anything like that in it. It’s a completely unique DNA. If anything, I see a good pinch of Eros with this chemical sweetness + woods and dryness.

Conclusion: 8 out of 10 in the opening, 6 out of 10 in the drydown.
It starts well and declines sharply - or simply goes in a direction that I don’t like.

Sillage and longevity are at normal Boss level.

In the end, it’s just okay, but not for retail, no way."
CK One Summer 2004,04/28/2025,DingoEurope,M,13,,2,"Tasty, but ...","The well-known Boss DNA is clearly in the foreground here as well, you either like it or you don't.

To me, it smells green-fresh with a slight citrus note, appealing for both young and older audiences.

Sillage and longevity are typically improvable for Boss, with the longevity bothering me more than the sillage. With synthetic fragrances, and you can smell that here too, I prefer a more subdued sillage.

So, is everything great?

No, because honestly, it doesn't smell much different from other Hugo Boss fragrances. In a blind test, I would probably not notice a significant difference from Boss Bottled. More apple there, more green here, but overall nothing that you don't already know or have."
CK One Summer 2004,09/12/2025,marcellor,M,10,,1,"If you want at least one Boss Bottled, you can choose this one anytime :-)","The regular Boss Bottled was never my thing. Too sweet and not really my style. I prefer fruity, fresh, and also aquatic scents.

By chance, I tried this one because citrus is always interesting to me.
Well, let's not kid ourselves, the citrus note that hits the nose immediately upon spraying is gone from my skin after a minute. After that, it develops into a slightly sweet, woody-warm scent. Very subtle, pleasant, and thus wearable for many.

The good thing: Ambroxan has been omitted here, so it is pleasant and wearable. (not that metallic coolness that overwhelms some and stings the nose).

I see it more for cooler days, and yes, it stands out less from the crowd, but it fits very well. It does everything right and little wrong.
Since I haven't had a Boss Bottled before, the Bold Citrus is now one that I can enjoy from time to time.
Always good when I don't want to overwhelm my surroundings or come across as too strongly attractive :D - Those who already have Bottled fragrances certainly don't need it."
Eternity Summer 2007,05/19/2024,Tracershy,M,121,,3,I didn't like it right away,"Encouraged by numerous opinions that Nobody Knows is very similar to Ebony Wood and the promotional price at Zara, I decided to check it out and bought this perfume.
Well, let me tell you right away that I feel almost no resemblance to Ebony Wood. Even if there is some slight association with ebony wood in both perfumes, in my opinion the similarity is very distant and only at a later stage, it is certainly not a substitute, especially for a guy.
Ebony Wood is full of spices and strong clove, and leans more towards the masculine side.
In turn, in Nobody Knows there are almost no spices, I can clearly feel the tartness of blackcurrant leaves, slightly peppered and not too strong rose, and only further in the background I can feel the characteristic woody and warm atmosphere of ebony wood, but it is a different scent than Ebony Wood. The scents are a bit closer to each other in the base, but Nobody Knows does not have the expressiveness of Ebony Wood, the base is much more delicate.
Nobody Knows is fruitier, tart, much fresher and greener, although still quite heavy and although it can be considered unisex, it veers definitely towards the feminine side.
As a man, I had great reservations about wearing this fragrance and gave it to my mother. They fit a woman better.
The parameters are very decent, I could feel them clearly for 6-7 hours, the projection was quite good at first, but after an hour it was delicate.
If you're a guy, don't expect Nobody Knows to give you similar vibes to Ebony Wood.
It's a good perfume, but I recommend it mainly to women who like woody, tart, fruity and green scents. Rather for spring and warm autumn.

Edit:
After giving Nobody Knows to my mother and feeling it on her, the resemblance to Ebony Wood is nonetheless striking. I felt this scent a bit differently on myself... but I will probably repeat the tests."
Eternity Summer 2007,01/07/2024,Ressikan,F,12,,3,A charmer who is bad at first impressions,"I had never tried a Zara perfume and don't have a store near me, but kept reading about how some of their many fleeting offerings are quite good. I noticed 100ml Nobody Knows on clearance for $12.99 and was intrigued by the notes and a few reviews stating that it smelled like Gris Charnel. So, I blind bought, thinking it costs less than a burger and fries, so no big risk. The bottle is not much to look at and the atomizer feels alarmingly wobbly and flimsy, but it sprays without dribbling so far. I applied to my wrists to give it a go and the opening was not great. There was a rotten fruit note that jumped up immediately, nestled in with some garden green leaves and black pepper. It is a cacophonous introduction, like someone who has clearly not showered this morning or brushed their hair stumbling into work spilling items out of their bag and smelling of elderberry cough drops. I thought to myself ""oh, no,"" wondering if I'm going to have to scrub this one off. I carried on with a few tasks for about 20 minutes, thankfully only catching slight whiffs now and again. I stopped to sniff again and, lo and behold, she has combed her hair and brushed her teeth! The fruit note is nearly gone, replaced by a creamy, coconutty wood, and cardamom. I sniff and sniff again and, though I wouldn't call it a twin, I can smell the comparison to Gris Charnel. It is softer, less dynamic, and sweeter, but it is there. I would almost call it a cousin of both Gris Charnel and Crystal Noir. I will be curious to see how this one performs in warmer weather. For the price, I think this is a pretty good one. Just be patient in the first few minutes and let her get herself together."
Eternity Summer 2007,09/12/2023,Tauriel,F,109,,12,Zara's Special Ebony Wood,"Since I already own Ebony Wood by Zara and really like it, I was immediately curious when I discovered Nobody Knows at Zara the other day. Because this one is also said to contain ebony. So I tested it right away. And yes, I immediately smelled a similarity to Ebony Wood. The same wood accord that I like so much. Nobody Knows starts off very pleasantly sweet-sour-currant-like, but the wood is already perceptible. The rose is also well recognizable and fits, in my opinion, very well with the other notes. The fragrance smells harmonious and significantly more expensive than it is. Zara releases a lot of generic and boring scents, but they also manage to create great compositions that can definitely compete with niche fragrances. This one is one of them. This special ""Zara ebony note"" is something you either like or you don't. I like it. Nobody Knows has fully developed after at most 30 minutes. The woody, very slightly smoky accord now dominates the EdP, and the pepper adds a nice kick. However, the rose can still be faintly smelled until the end, while the delicious currant has pretty much said goodbye quite quickly. For me, a very successful fragrance that, of course, got to come home with me."
