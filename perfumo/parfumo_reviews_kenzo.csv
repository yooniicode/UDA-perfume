Kenzo Homme,07/28/2025,Byrehoe,F,205,,3,villa suburbana,"A beige aesthetic sandalmusk polished with plastic-toned saffron. I have a type and that type is fake wood!! As a Santal 33 Big Bottle owner, I love this genre. This is the scent of a Lincoln log McMansion, more plywood and laminate than actual tree. It’s sweet, it’s clean, it’s got central heating. Takes me back to the B&BW “Sensual Amber” line of the 2000s (be still my heart). Feels like the sawdust static counterpart to the white noise of Fugazzi’s Angel Dust. Unfortunately didn’t last more than two hours on my skin, but I will go out of my way to spritz whenever I pass through Sephora.

Mental Snapshot: It’s 2005. You’re at your friend’s Tuscan-style house in the bougie subdivision. (They have an island in their kitchen!). Everything’s mahogany, granite, and wrought iron. And a whole lot of biscuit, buff, and beige. They have a home theatre. You sink into a brown pleather sectional. It smells like this.

tl;dr: model home musk"
Kenzo Homme,03/26/2025,Telekinec,F,498,,2,Creamy and spicy saffron with pencil shavings,"Didn’t take a look at the Parfumo page before trying out this fragrance, so I’m happy to see people have immediately picked on the similarities between this one an Memo Paris’ fragrance.

The first 15 minutes are very similar to Cappadocia. It has the same leathery-like saffron with creamy and slightly sweet facets. It’s spicy and just so comforting. I barely get any of the other notes although I do detect a freshness and something less opaque and thick than Memo Paris’ version. Things start to take a different turn when Phlur’s version starts to smell like saffron accompanied by pencil shavings. Sandalwood and cedarwood in the base might have contributed to this. Phlur’s version is also more palatable to those who want something non-obtrusive and wearable. It’s also softer and doesn’t have monstrous projection, which makes it more versatile than Memo Paris’s version. I’d say this one is a lovely, cheaper alternative to its niche version, but since I already have a full bottle of Cappadocia (that I love very much), this one won’t be making it to my collection."
Kenzo Homme,04/02/2025,LavenderSalv,F,40,,2,Wood Panel Walls,"This feels exceptionally 70s; reminds me of a Sauna from my birthplace of Finland that was built then, and you're using it Now. It feels like a station wagon with wood grain in the doors and the console, or perhaps a cabin with a conversation pit and one of those weird circular fireplaces. At no point do you get any sort of natural wood, before it had been processed in some way."
Kenzo Homme,04/30/2025,XyzXyz,N/A,48,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Wood - now in the leading role,"Föst Impreschn: The whimsical name doesn’t reveal that this fragrance immediately comes across as s e r i o u s - understated, yet not shy, stylish, but present.
Fun Fact: This is the first perfume with wood in the leading role that I genuinely like from top to bottom.
Sorry: Liking ""wood perfume"" is so new to me that I’m waiting to rate it until my generously filled sample vial - thanks, @Lutz89 - is all gone.

Background: If you catch a whiff of synthetic here, you probably haven't smelled the truly penetrating scent of freshly cut (various!) woods very often… So. I tend to stick my nose right at the cutting edge whenever I come across usable wood out and about ^^. Some tree cuts smell like something out of an eight-year-old's chemistry set, an eight-year-old who tried to create a wood scent with the strangest ingredients -
Then again, you might smell d e c e n t wood scents, or very sweet, barely noticeable aged ones, sometimes strongly resinous, and: As a crowning achievement, I once found a pure (!) vanilla scent. Without resin and - without wood XD
Since then, I can better understand that vanilla aromas can also be derived from wood - well, anyway!

Scent: As if a supporting character could shine in a leading role ^^
You can actually smell a clean, straightforward mix of various wood scents here, which you might recognize from the great outdoors as described… It overall feels dry, “welcomingly warm,” I would say, instilling trust. (Oh yes, and - Ganymede is somewhat similar to a linden tree from a flying saucer.)
Who: I actually see the scent primarily on male school principals - purely associatively - and on older female-presenting individuals in situations where they want to come across as discreet yet noticeable, serious yet exuding calm and friendliness.
When: Personally, I can’t imagine wearing this scent at any other time than in the autumn months. Except now for testing. Hehe.

Pyramid: I was baffled that there are supposed to be “only” two wood scent directions represented, then I was surprised by lemon and saffron, and I still wonder - What The Geier, cyclamen flowers really smell like n o t h i n g at all - - - - Well, anyway.

Bottle: Let’s keep silent about that

H/S/Animal Ethics: My surprise upon googling to find out that the manufacturers not only created something truly wonderful but also work consistently cruelty-free without any greenwashing was enormous. - I allow myself to quote from the Phlur homepage:

“Yes, Phlur is cruelty-free. They don't test their finished products or ingredients on animals, and neither do their suppliers or any third-parties. It's also verified that their products are not tested on animals anywhere in the world, including mainland China.”

With “Verified Cruelty Free,” there are often more discreet H/S, which are absolutely true here: Sprayed at 4 PM, still a close-to-skin hint detectable at 9 AM.
Nice! - Consequently, I can’t confirm a longevity of 6.5. Regarding sillage:
In contrast to my beautiful but really weak Sticky Popcorn, this is even a two-spray scent. (Unless, of course, someone needs huge clouds to mark their territory. For me personally, a cheeky little cloud is always enough.)

Update: Surroundings confirm - the scent is detectable for hours with two sprays, hehe, even elicited cute MMMMHs XD"
Kenzo Homme,08/22/2024,Le1le,F,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,One of my new favorite fragrances!,"“Somebody Wood” by Phlur is a very pleasant, warm perfume that immediately gave me a sense of comfort when I first smelled it. The main notes of sandalwood and cedarwood come out very well on my skin and provide a gentle and soothing woody note.

The fragrance starts with citrusy top notes that blend nicely with the warm wood notes. In the heart of the perfume, there are subtle spice notes that add an extra depth to the scent without overwhelming it.

Over time, “Somebody Wood” develops into a persistently warm and inviting fragrance that is great for all-day wear. Overall, it’s a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a warm and sensual unisex scent."
Ça Sent Beau,08/15/2024,Anniechannie,F,39,,1,So good!,"This is such a good vanilla buttercream. It is sweet, vanilla heaven. A gourmand dream. I absolutely love this one. It is buttery and rich with sugary frosting. It isn't sickeningly sweet (just know sickeningly sweet to me does not exist- I am a sickeningly sweet fiend. You cannot give me a fragrance that is too sweet or at least, I haven't found one yet.) The longevity is decent for a FFM, and the sillage is average as well. I wish they had this in a full size. Right now, I just have two mini ones. This is a great heading to bed fragrance as well. It's very comforting. You can fall asleep to frosting and wake up and apply something new with no issues. This was a great blind buy."
Ça Sent Beau,08/02/2023,Gourmandgrl,F,307,,3,Underrated gourmand vanilla,"If you're looking for a good ""basic gourmand vanilla"", this is it! So many good vanillas from BBW/VS have other notes that are dominant, like:

- bourbon ( Wild Madagascar Vanilla EAU DE PARFUM )
- cake ( Confetti Cake Pop )
- cookies (the 2022 version of Happy Birthday )
- incense ( Vanilla Lace FRAGRANCE MIST )
- marshmallow ( Vanilla Bean Noel )
- ""metallic"" ( Wrapped in Vanilla )
- musk ( Bare Vanilla )
- ""playdoh"" ( Warm Vanilla Sugar FRAGRANCE MIST )
- powder ( ""Fresh Vanilla | Bath & Body Works"" )
- sandalwood ( Vanilla Noir )
- ""woods"" ( Wicked Vanilla Woods )

Don't get me wrong, I still love plenty of the above. But Vanilla Buttercream doesn't have other notes that dominate, and sometimes that's all you need.

It's an uncomplicated, true vanilla buttercream; rich vanilla, sweetened with a touch of caramel (which just feels like a warmer version of the butter in buttercream).

I wish it projected more, it's fairly soft - but I'm still happy with it, and am impressed with the longevity for it being a ""fluffy vanilla"" profile (lasts several hours on my skin). This will be my go-to for birthdays!"
Kenzo Homme,04/11/2024,Gorin,M,50,,2,The best summer perfume. A masterpiece,"I've tried hundreds
None are as good as this
Aqua de Dora is the closest, at 9.5/10

Forever Love is noticeably better than every single summer perfume I have tried
It's also got by far the best longevity and sillage of any summer perfume (aside from Megamare which doesn't really count because it's unwearable in a lot more situations)

Everything else smells cheap, tacky and boring by comparison.

Pana Dora is my favourite niche, and it probably still would be if this was their only perfume."
Kenzo Homme,05/02/2025,Alire,M,21,,1,Piacevole d'estate,"Pana dora mi piace molto come brand... Be qui c'è un innegabile somiglianza con profumi di Louis vuitton seppur migliorato in prestazioni. Perfetto per l' estate apre agrumato fresco e resta così per tutta l'evoluzione... D' estate è un must have sicuramente.
Bella anche la boccia... Adoro pana dora come brand ottima qualità."
Kenzo Homme,09/27/2024,Enta,M,25,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,22,"I did it, I found it!","It was an exploratory journey that was ultimately very worthwhile.
Dozens of fresh summer scents arrived in the form of samples at my house, I almost felt sorry for the postman.
From the moment I first experienced LV afternoon swim last year, I was on the hunt for a perfume that would do justice to that incredibly good note while still having good longevity. Let’s be honest, all fresh citrus scents fade quickly, it’s in their nature. Sure, the heart and base notes might last all day, but that’s not what makes the fragrances special.

On my discovery journey, I sniffed out many great summer scents and slowly came to terms with the fact that I would never find a ""better LV AS."" I was just about to order Pomelo Sorrento by Gritti (also a great scent), but then I discovered the house of Pana Dora and I am so happy that it happened.

Forever Love is very close to afternoon swim in the top note, to be honest, it still doesn’t manage to offer that incredible zest and freshness that I only know from LV, but it provides more depth and an interesting opening. The citrus notes seem to last twice as long (about 2 hours), but what fundamentally distinguishes the two are the heart and base notes.
One thing I liked less about afternoon swim was the drydown, which for my taste had a somewhat unpleasant synthetic quality, and that’s where Forever Love excels. Even though it is still slightly citrusy, the heart note is a different caliber, a wonderfully warm floral scent that stands on its own and brings joy for hours.

In short, I have finally found my perfect scent for hot summer days, now I just have to wait a long time until I can enjoy it in appropriate weather.

For anyone who loves afternoon swim like I do but expects more for their money, Forever Love is a must-try!"
Kenzo Homme,06/26/2024,Basti87,M,1064,,22,"Direction Afternoon Swim, convinces me more","Just in time for the start of summer, this fantastic summer scent has arrived for me. I've had my eye on this fragrance for a while, but at the full price of €245, it was too expensive for me. In shops that often have discounts, this one was usually sold out. Now I struck at a slight discount, which is still a hefty price. But high-quality summer fragrances should be worth it, especially when it comes to scents for the intense (and humid) heat.
This is my first Pana Dora that I have purchased and tested. I have found a few exciting fragrances in their small range that I will definitely test as well. I will still see if this hype in the community is justified. They definitely seem to be well-received in general. With Sweden, this brand has an exotic country for perfume. Behind this brand is the Syrian immigrant and perfumer Ibrahim Al-Zorbi. He seems to have talent, judging by the reviews, especially for the releases from 2023-2024. It’s worth checking out, especially if you are looking for mass-appeal niche fragrances and like to go with the hype.

I came across this scent because I was looking for an alternative to ""Afternoon Swim | Louis Vuitton."" For me, it has one of the best top notes when it comes to the intense heat and that carefree midsummer feeling. Disadvantage: It absolutely does not last, costs €280, and is only available at LV without any discounts/offers. If you can find it used at a significantly lower price, that would be an alternative. However, I decided on this Forever Love.
The name Forever Love is, of course, beautifully chosen. The fragrance comes in a lovely round orange box. The highlight is, of course, the bottle with the moose head. It should not be confused with the Penhaligon's Portrait series, which has a similar cap. A bottle from this brand visually enhances the collection. Extremely elegantly crafted, especially the cap. The sprayer is also top-notch and dispenses the perfect amount and is buttery smooth. For that, a clear 10/10.
In terms of scent, you definitely get a great alternative to Afternoon Swim, especially in the top note. Full-on good mood through citrusy, juicy, and summery notes. Afternoon Swim might have a bit more of that swimming pool vibe, but this Forever Love does not need to hide. It is thoroughly likable and will not find many enemies. Lemon, orange, mandarin, and bitter grapefruit. You get this in the opening. Citrusy-fruity-juicy and just straight-up good mood. In the heart note, several fruits come through, which is rather rare in the heart note. After 1 hour, it becomes very juicy and soft. Mango and melon, along with a bit of spicy, delicate ginger and some gentle geranium. Delicate flowers also come through, which submit to the citrusy and fruity DNA. In the third part of the fragrance and also during the dry down, woods and sweetness emerge; the fresh notes last about 4-5 hours, which is absolutely great for such freshies.
The longevity is significantly better than the LV. I think the fragrance should last about 8 hours or longer, with the first 2-3 hours performing really well with this fantastic freshness. Overall, this fragrance is worth it when it comes to a good midsummer scent.

Overall, a fantastic citrusy-fruity-juicy fragrance with a woody base. A great alternative for the upcoming summer. Not an Afternoon Swim clone, but a great alternative to it."
Kenzo Homme,01/06/2024,Klartext93,M,5,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,19,Absolute top perfume from Pana Dora!,"What can I say?
If this isn't a summer scent, then I don't know what is..

Actually, I prefer perfumes that lean more towards the woody/spicy/leathery direction (e.g. Tom Ford / Sauvage, etc.).
Basically, perfumes for the colder seasons.

So, as it goes, my wife and I set out to find a fresher, fruitier summer scent.
In a niche perfumery, we expressed our preferences and sought advice.
After some time, we both stumbled upon this perfume.

At first, you encounter the sweet note of the perfume, particularly the orange/lavender component is noticeable. After testing it on my skin and a few minutes later, the citrus note emerges and brings a refreshing feeling with it.

Absolute recommendation for spring and summer! This perfume is neither too citrusy (Malibu - Party in the Bay), nor too sweet (Pana Dora - Aqua de Dora) - the oriental note from the manufacturer is still faintly detectable without overwhelming anyone.
Honestly, my wife loves it and I am also thrilled by it (strangely, it's the first time we both like a perfume so much).

From my perspective, three sprays (left and right side of the neck and at the back) are enough, and the scent lasts 7-8 hours. The sillage is fantastic; you can still smell it from a distance of 4-5 meters without it coming off as intrusive.

Overall:

Scent note: fruity, soft, citrusy, slightly oriental mixture.
Longevity: 3 sprays -> 7-8 hours

For me, it's a scent that can be worn at any time of day during the summer in warm temperatures; a slightly seductive note cannot be denied.

Absolute purchase recommendation from the niche house of Pana Dora!"

Kenzo Homme,06/03/2025,JagHammer5,M,14,,1,Fleeting Red Spiciness,"As an eau de cologne, or so it's stated, (I have a belief that it may have received this concentration based on gendered norms) it does falter after a while in longevity. However, I test all of my fragrances in the overbearing Louisiana heat and humidity, so to continue to smell this fragrance currently, even as it hovers closer to the skin is a testament to it strength. With the notes provided, I can assume the spiciness must be derived from the 'Sequoia' note. Rosemary may provide more of the spice as well.
It is a pleasant 'red' fragrance, not necessarily essential, but it is a good pick up if you're inclined to spicy, woody fragrances. Fortunately for me, it also has enough freshness in it to pull off on a late spring day as this one. I would rather wear this one on the eve of autumn and spring, but in Louisiana, you can wear it in the winter. Avoid in August and September."
Jeu d'Amour L'Élixir,07/18/2015,ColinM,M,516,,4,Plenty of better options for your weekend!,"Crisp green-fruity-citrus scent with no praise or blame – well, more blame than praise, quite on the synthetic/acrid side (a floor detergent, basically – imagine you’re using it to clean the tropical juice you’ve just spilled on the floor, here’s Weekend). Quite cheap overall, especially for the first minutes which are fairly loud and pungent; once it settles a bit on skin and finds its proper tuning, it’s a mildly enjoyable and exceedingly generic green-citrus-musky scent with those annoying metallic-pungent nonsense nuances many brands try to pass as “tropical fruity notes” – although luckily it’s more green-woody and citrus than tropical. Not that acrid anymore if compared to the opening, more metallic and “gassy” after a couple of hours, but still miles away from being something pleasant to wear. Anyway, linearly green and fruity on the lime-tropical side, and that’s all. Personally I’d rate this mediocre, to be generous; but if you’re looking for a summer fragrance and your pretenses are really (really, really) low, then here you go.

Jeu d'Amour L'Élixir,03/14/2021,MirzAsim,M,21,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Weekend is so uplifting and sunny,"This is my all-time favorite scent. Make a list and it is a number 1.

Here's why. I personally buy perfume based on my feelings, not on the scent or how they perform.

When I was young, like very very young, my friend's brother used this one. He is very handsome but his style is free-spirited and fearless/carefree personality.

I adored him so much and this Burberry weekend and D&G Light Blue are always on his vanity. I saw him spraying one or two before going out. He is always smelling so good, and this is the first scent that made me into the world of fragrance.

Every time I wear this, it always brings back to my childhood. A good memory. A loving past.

How many weekend bottles I used? 7 and I still have two 100ml as a backup.

I love Citrusy fragrance so this is the number one, all the time. I don't care about whether the weather is hot or cold. But however, I might have 20 bottles to wear based on the occasions, but if it is the weekend, this is one, there is no other."
Jeu d'Amour L'Élixir,01/05/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Masculine citrus,"It's no secret that my favourite perfume of all time is Weekend for Women, so I was eager to see what the male version was like with the intention of perhaps purchasing it for my significant other.

This cologne is not a floral like its female equivalent, which I consider a good thing, (I like my men to smell masculine). Weekend for men is quite fruity yet pleasantly sour, that makes this scent a fantastic Summer fragrance, as it is sharp and refreshing without being too overpowering.

The lasting strength is not bad, however I'm speaking from a female perspective where many of our fragrances are eau de parfum rather than eau de toilette, so the lasting power might actually be fantastic for some.

Weekend is so light and clean that it could actually be worn by a very daring woman. However, I do believe that this fragrance is very masculine. The only element of this fragrance that mirrors Weekend for Women is the honey note in the drydown, which adds warmth and a little bit of sweetness.

My verdict on this fragrance; I love it yet I don't think this type of fragrance would suit my man, (he's more into dark and woodsy scents). However, I will consider buying this for some of my male friends when it comes time to buy them gifts."
Jeu d'Amour L'Élixir,05/19/2024,Guitar2016,M,232,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Fresh and Citrusy,"It is a nice Fresh Citrusy fragrance, A Unique perfume for Hot weather.

The Ivy note is dominant in this scent, Longevity is good.

Jeu d'Amour L'Élixir,04/05/2025,Brandonxfl,M,14,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Weekend for Men by Burberry,"At first I was pretty ""meh"" about Weekend. I got it for $20 on a whim, and wasn't too impressed after wearing it a couple times. Floral mixed with honey, not my taste at the time.

Fast forward a couple years when I'm going through all my old scents during the summer, and I give it a shot. What was once floral-honey has transformed into freshly cut grass, with a good dose of sweet honey and a hint of citrus peel.

Suddenly this fragrance makes complete sense, and paints a beautiful portrait of a leisurely Saturday during the summer- cutting grass, drinking sweet tea, and eating fruit fresh off the tree.

I wonder how this fragrance would do with a base of Tobacco to complete this picture, however as it is Weekend is a great, low key scent for when you need a pick-me-up or want to smell good while working out on the yard."

Flower Ikebana Indigo by Kenzo,01/04/2012,Ineverwas,F,45,,6,Essay on spirituality and religion,"In my opinion this is one of the best and most interesting L'Occitane fragrance I've tried so far. It's quite unique and I can't think of many perfumes that come close to its smell or style.

Eau d'Iparie is mysterious, spiritual and profound. The myrrh and incense confer a vaguely sacred aura that reminds of religion, churches, saints and the meaning of the divine adoration and yet, this perfume has a markedly dark character, a solemnity that may hide secrets and perhaps occult knowledge. At the borderline between grace and obscurity, this scent gives me quite a spiritual trip.

I think Eau d'Iparie is best suited for cold winter days, late autumn trips to old villages in France, Catholic sermons and why not, funerals. It's thoroughly well done and can really put you in a mystical mood, if you know how to wear it."
Flower Ikebana Indigo by Kenzo,05/27/2014,Platinum1,M,59,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"~ Myrrh, Meadows & Memories ~","~ I am considering placing a one hundred dollar bid on an e-bay half bottle based purely on initial impressions of this L'Occitane it is that good! I was fortunate enough to receive a sample of this as an added bonus from a generous perfumista and I soo thank her! This is a beautiful myrrh the type that you want to be surrounded in and keep it for yourself. To me it is also a very sheer airy dried herbal scent like a breeze in a grassy meadow. I don't know whether the subtle incense actually applies to the skin or just hovers and dances around it like a free spirit? Although not listed I also get a hint of a dried aged rose. The kind that you would keep pressed in your favorite heavy book as a sentimental reminder of a past lover. Is this unisex to my nose perhaps? But it doesn't matter to this man I want what's in this! I may not be able to hold it like a precious memory but just to contain it for a little while in a bottle on my shelf is all I can hope for. ~

After finding myself testing it once and again, I bought it for winter sunny days.

Another one to share with my companion."
Flower Ikebana Indigo by Kenzo,05/03/2011,Turandot,F,839,,10,The spirits I called....,"This morning I stumbled upon CocoLeFay's comment about Eau d`Iparie, and since I have the fragrance sitting in the farthest corner of my collection, I was a bit surprised that she perceives it as delicate. So I tested it again right away. I noticed that while my version is indeed the same bottle, it lacks the obviously embossed smooth area for the label. However, it clearly reads ""Eau d`Iparie"" on the bottom of my bottle. I bought it a long time ago at a L`Occitane outlet in a pharmacy.

On my skin, a dry spicy-resinous note emerges immediately, which - and this is the crux of the matter - can truly be a revelation for myrrh and incense lovers when applied very sparingly. For everyone else, it’s probably sheer horror.

Even though the listed pyramids are not always really complete. Here, it seems that there is really nothing more to it. Therefore, the fragrance comes across as quite one-dimensional to me. I like both nuances, but I lack a bit of imagination; it is for me only intense, but rather flat and blatant. It almost feels like I only have a base note of a once dark, spicy chypre, which is still quite loud. This is not unpleasant, but as I said, somewhat meager.

It’s no coincidence that I mentioned above that I applied Eau l`Iparie in the morning, because even now, about 11 hours later, it is still mercilessly noticeable on the back of my hand. Unfortunately, it does not fit the spring at all, but I have to endure it now.

This fragrance awakens my experimental spirit, and I will layer it with a dark rose or something green; who knows, maybe I will have an aha moment then. I can very well imagine that. Otherwise, it just needs a bit of gold, and the Three Wise Men have their gifts for the journey to Bethlehem. What is a baby supposed to do with that??"

Surprisingly, it's only sweet for just five minutes, when the caramel is featured in the opening.

Wrapping surely is a matter of taste, however I like the cubical flask decorated with a removable Surfer Figure. This Hollister Fragrance is different from all others because it seems to be quite maritime and leads to associations of ocean and breakers and thereby to good mood (works at least for me). Dosed to strong, the top notes might appear a little to penetrative, maybe because of the sage. Lasts at least medium if not long and gives a maritime freshness. I have heard a lot of people drawing comparisons to ""Fierce"" of Abercrombie & Fitch, which I cannot really follow..."
Ciel Magnolia,01/09/2015,Wintersteyn,M,8,,0,Everybody's gone surfin' - Surfin' U.S.A.,"Yes, the Beach Boys once sang this song and this fragrance fits perfectly with it.

A warm summer day, a fine sandy beach, crashing waves, hot chicks, and the hair is on point. All that's missing is the perfect scent for such a hot day. Apply sunscreen and then Break Line. There’s no better feeling than that. Grab the surfboard and off we go into the waves.

As for the scent, it starts off very fresh and sweet, but with too high a dosage, it can become a bit piercing. Then it becomes quite maritime, but warm, not cold. That’s probably the warm sand. There’s also a wooden note added. For me, the fragrance notes fit perfectly with the bottle and the name.

The sillage and longevity are in the average range, but quite good for an EdC. As for the bottle, it is indeed special. The EdC comes in a cubic bottle topped with a surfer statue. However, that doesn’t necessarily have to be there.

For me, Break Line is the better SoCal and lasts much longer. Maybe this should be used in stores this time, because I can’t stand SoCal anymore.

I don’t understand the comparison with ""Fierce,"" because if that were the case, they would probably have chosen ""Break Line"" instead of SoCal."

L'Eau Pure,10/22/2025,Pennantis,F,113,,2,Just another meh Initio,"It didn’t win me over. It kind of reminds me of Lamar (I like it, sometimes.., though) , but in a thicker, more synthetic-feeling version. It hits you right away with a blast of ripe fruits and heavy florals. What throws it off for me is the sweet, sugary amber base — it just feels a bit much.

It’s definitely rich, intense, and super long-lasting, but overall kind of chaotic. If you’re into bold, fruity-gourmand scents that wrap around you like a cloud, this might be your thing — just not mine."
L'Eau Pure,10/22/2025,Alisapopova,F,7,,1,"Imagine rose, caramel, and spice wrapped in confidence — that’s Can’t Get Enough.","It is indulgent, full-bodied, confident. The star here is rose, shaken with pink pepper. I get the Caramel sweetness right away too, the same intensity as rose.

Please don't be fooled by comparisons to Delina Exclusif , Atomic Rose EAU DE PARFUM and especially Impadia - they aren't alike at all! Atomic rose is a dewy and fresh rose, Impadia is rose and orange blossom. All they share is a rose note, and even then, different roses.

At the heart we have the molecule hedione, the kind of thing that gives florals a haunting, addictive feel. I'm a big fan of how Initio use perfumery ingredients in their blends, and this release wasn't an exception. Hedione is a molecule that triggers the pleasure center of the brain. It has a pheromone-like quality. And here Initio may have tricked you into liking their perfumes. Using science ;) In the dry down we are met with vanilla - plush, decadent and warm.

If I were to sum it up: it feels like a bold rose gourmand scent, that’s not too sweet and not too floral. I value fragrance that moves you, that tells a story, that doesn’t simply hide in the background. And Can't Get Enough isn't the quiet type - it announces itself.

If you’re into niche and you’ve loved other Initio drops, or you’re just ready for something that feels indulgent and well-done, this will sit well with you. A perfect scent for fall and winter."
L'Eau Pure,10/05/2025,77LC,F,4,,1,Fruity vanilla sandalwood,"I do not get the notes as listed. Fresh, this has a tart plummy smell. There’s an intriguing creaminess as well that prompted me to skin test. MISTAKE. What I presume is the caramel vanilla smells like sandalwood on me, and that is perhaps my most nauseating scent. I despise sandalwood and it’s so inescapable at the moment. That phase lasts too long. The Final dry down is back to a muted creamy/tart scent that Is pleasant but not worth the ride."
L'Eau Pure,09/25/2025,Rosini,F,16,,8,The Dominatrix Rose,"I love sweet scents, and roses are definitely among my favorites. Therefore, my expectations for “Can't Get Enough” by Initio were quite high. I was particularly curious about Hedione, a molecule said to have an almost irresistible allure. Vanilla-sweet, floral, and additionally enticing? I just had to test it. The fragrance opens with a citrusy, sparkling freshness that slightly reminds me of mandarin. The beginning feels almost like a flirty eye contact and immediately piques curiosity. But then the rose strikes with full force: young, dark, heavy, velvety, feminine, and dominant - yet it is not alone. Coated with a thick, creamy layer of caramel vanilla pudding, it ruthlessly sweeps away all delicate nuances from the stage. This is no longer a subtle flirt. In my opinion, the scent becomes too intense and open-hearted - almost as if someone were holding a plump, perfectly staged décolletage right in front of your face. Sexy? Certainly for some. However, the seduction does not come across as delicately and charmingly as one might wish. Instead, the fragrance has a distinct synthetic note that does not feel natural at all. This may appeal to some, depending on their preferences. The sillage is so overwhelmingly strong that a friend from the upper floor of the maisonette apartment reacted with a horrified “What have you sprayed again?” - a testament to the atomic scent cloud (even though I only sprayed twice), but also an indication that the seductive effect may not be well received by everyone."
L'Eau Pure,10/08/2025,Anika09,F,70,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,The Perfect Rose,"I have never been a big fan of rose scents, but Can't Get Enough has changed my mind.
This fragrance starts with a slightly fresh rose that gradually becomes sweeter over time.
The pepper adds a bit of sparkle.

I didn't buy it, because I have 3 other Yves Rocher perfumes from the Eau fraiche range and they are all extremely weak in intensity on the skin. Too bad for them, because everything from this range smells very nice and very natural! So, I don't think I will buy it anytime soon. The bottle looks like a shower oil rather than a perfume. It's feminine. Rating: 8/10"
7:15 AM in Bali,11/06/2020,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,13,Queen Elisabeth Rose,"Our garden was half planted by us - and the other half by my mom.

To the observer, however, it formed a unity, as we always planted flowers that harmonized with each other.

So my mom planted the Queen Elisabeth Rose in front of my Ceanothus, which matched well with the delicate blue of the American lilac with its silvery pink.

The silver shimmer of the Queen gave it a distinct optical coolness - and its scent was delicate and fresh.

I find the Queen Elisabeth Rose as Eau Fraiche Rose in the bottle from Rocher.
This rose is the ""star"" in this Rocher - but without any star attitudes.

Transparent yet clearly it envelops me - accompanied by delicate sparkle - like fairy dust.
This fairy-tale image is evoked in me by the scent.
I also seem to hear the gentle sky-blue Ceanothus - but that may be allowed by my memory.

This blue-pink composition made many passersby linger dreamily at the garden fence.

Eau fraiche Rose has also allowed me to dream of the past."

I am not impressed with the opening because the coffee just seems to be lacking in authenticity, at least to me.

Other fragrances do a lot better job with coffee, I felt like I had to wait about three hours for this to soften up and allow the sweeter notes to take stage and blend well with the musk.

Not until about the third hour does the harshness of the coffee/wood notes settle down and turn into a great aroma that makes me happy.

I did not notice the peach and currant notes listed until I got this scent in the mail. Those notes had me wondering whether this would end up syrupy and too feminine.

No, not feminine and the peach is not in the forefront, just in case you're wondering.

Maybe spring but I'm not sure about summer.......autumn and winter? Yes.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Homme,02/24/2015,ColinM,M,516,,2,"No coffee, no oud, still nice","I don’t get much coffee in here honestly, but I do appreciate the fact Aoud Cafè is not a sweetish, cloying Starbucks-like artificial coffee bomb like most of (allegedly) coffee-based scents. I smell something vaguely reminiscent of dry, roasted coffee beans, actually a more generic sort of earthy-roasted note quite salty, synthetic and musky, somehow ambery and somehow woody, with a hint of dark and sweet licorice feel (I guess the blackcurrant with something else creates that feeling), and a load of Iso E. Overall, this accord feels like an attempt to build that coffee note: it doesn’t really succeed in my opinion, but it smells nice. The same for oud, which I don’t really get, not even the usual Montale’s “synthetic oud”: just a dry, artificial woody note closer to birch wood. Anyway despite being quite far from its name, I can’t say Aoud Cafè smells bad: oddly enough, and perhaps involuntarily, it shows an unexpected and pleasant sort of “contemporary synthetic blackness”, this meaning a kind of “urban-modern” refinement à la Comme des Garçons Black and that type of scents; the notes are a bit different (more salt here, and also something more flowery), but somehow I thought of that. It has a nice, clean, solid and polished smoky-dark gloominess with a nice hint of colorful grace (the floral note), which is quite pleasant to wear. I bet that re-labeled with some nonsense name under one of those whatever trendy-avantgarde brands (like nu_be’s and that segment of niche) it would be more appreciated.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Homme,02/11/2021,Friesin,F,55,,32,Interruption,"""That's not how it works,"" I hear a male voice next to me. Suddenly, the chair beside me is pulled back, a long drink glass is parked next to my cup, while a good-looking guy slides onto the chair.
""I see you're drinking your mocha without a pastis, I couldn't watch that any longer.""
Annoyed, I raise an eyebrow and immediately hate the fact that his voice sounds rough and seductive. He looks me in the eyes and a smile creeps onto his face.
""I've been watching you for a while, you're tapping away on your tablet while stressfully drinking one coffee after another, take the drink and call me Tom.""
I smile and ask him with sparkling eyes:
""And what kind of universe is it where anis belongs with coffee?""
""That's my world, I invite you to get to know it. You can test it on my lips, or just like this,"" he pushes the pastis under my nose. And because he is crazy, but cheeky and charming, I take a sip.
Heaven! I had completely forgotten how much I love that licorice taste. It settles on my tongue and mixes with the bitterness of the coffee, wonderful! Afternoons in Marseille cafés flash before me. A light breeze from the flower stalls at the market wafts over to our bistro table, which is in the sun. Friends are chattering together, coffee cups are stacked in the middle, and a fogged jug stands next to the pastis glasses... past hours of leisure.
I open my eyes and see directly into Tom's smiling, knowing face. He is so close to me now that I can perceive his scent, sandalwood and musk, mmh.
""Come eat with me,"" his gaze is strong, I can feel his heat on my skin and say ""Yes!"".

""Yes!"" I say especially to 'Aoud Café' by Mancera. A fragrance just to my taste. It is a gourmand, with a clear coffee note. In the opening, there is bergamot with the coffee, which ensures that the citrus keeps boredom at bay. It smells as if you are standing in front of a roastery, malty. So, less agreeable than a freshly brewed coffee.
I don't perceive the stated berries at all.
But very, very clearly, licorice comes to the forefront (sweet wood, anis) and this combo is really nice and provides a kind of break.
However, just before this malt/licorice thing runs amok, musk comes soothingly and warmly around the corner and ensures a long-lasting presence.
The big brother from 'Montale' is more uniform and clearer, while this guy here (from the same father) is more unconventional and lively, really great!

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Homme,02/02/2017,Escentric,M,20,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Different than expected. But beautiful.,"Coffee beans in a licorice coat were my first thoughts. The scent of licorice hit my nose at the beginning. Strange, I thought. It must be the interplay of the individual fragrance notes. However, very pleasant. The licorice impression quickly faded. Then... darkest coffee beans. Beautiful... and yes, it really does smell like coffee, after I was quite disappointed by Kilian's ""Intoxicated."" With that one, there’s no coffee from start to finish. Please don’t imagine a coffee cup with sweetened coffee under AC. It’s really dark beans. The scent itself gives a sweet impression overall and in its progression, but the coffee notes are clearly dark. However, they eventually recede into the background, so the fragrance always appears sweet as a whole. Additionally, I now sense an oud scent rising to my nose. Not a harsh, sharply medicinal oud note. A sweetly embedded oud, it smells wonderfully warm on my arm. At first, I thought it was an overall decent scent, but I certainly didn’t have to have it. However, the longer I sniff my arm, the more I like AC. It has developed very beautifully. Aoud Cafe can no longer be broken down into many individual components. It has become a truly wonderful, softly warm overall composition. It even has something cozy about it. Simply wonderfully fitting for the cold winter season. I would have never expected at the beginning that AC would develop into such a pleasantly warm scent. The only critical point to mention here is that the coffee scent recedes significantly after a while. Nevertheless, I will definitely use the 10ml bottle for myself.

The sillage seems to be good. I think one will certainly be noticed as a wearer without taking over the room. The longevity is very good. It lasts well throughout the day. Still detectable on clothing for days.

UPDATE: The longer I own this scent, the more I have come to love it. Additionally, I receive extraordinarily positive feedback for this fragrance. I must now elevate it again."

First peppery, oriental, spicy. Then comes a beautiful, fruity plum with white blossoms and a cozy balsam with vanilla.
Still, it remains exciting because the notes oscillate and keep reappearing. Tolerably sweet, it could even pass as unisex.
The top notes of the fragrance pyramid seem way too short to me. Hence the additional notes:
Juicy plum
A splash of bergamot
Relaxing neroli
Warm orange blossom
Mystical myrrh
Cinnamon-tinged Peru balsam

P.S. I'm relatively to the fragrance game, so I might be judging this completely wrong. None of my other scents do anything remotely similar to this, so I'm assuming it has to do with the scent. Feedback would be appreciated.

Nuage Cerisier,09/30/2025,Omnipotato,M,388,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Game of Thrones Syndrome,"Part of the ""problem"" at Marc Antoine Barrois is that their first scent in their long partnership with Quentin Bisch, Ganymede EAU DE PARFUM was so revolutionary and became so popular. It's rare that a fragrance so utterly unique can become such a good seller; generally even fragheads need some roots to the past to ground them so they can enjoy the uniqueness in a controlled environment.

Because of the uniqueness and popularity, I think MAB fell into a sort of ""Game of Thrones"" syndrome where they needed to try to do the same thing over and over to try and get the same result. Let me explain: in Game of Thrones, in case you haven't watched it, there are lots of huge plot twists and main characters don't necessarily have plot armor protecting them. For the first five seasons, the twists and deaths were enjoyable, but near the end of the show, they seemingly started killing off characters just to show they could, and introducing twists that weren't properly built up, culminating in probably the worst last season, relative to how good the show used to be, of any show at least I've ever watched.

Now Aldebaran isn't all that bad, actually is not bad at all, but I feel like, similar to Game of Thrones, MAB is trying to re-bottle lightning, just releasing strange and out-there scents to try and capture the magic of Ganymede, instead of just releasing stuff that smells good; i.e. killing off characters and introducing plot twists just for the sake of it, instead of writing an actual compelling story. I could be entirely wrong here and M. Barrois is just a fan of these weird edgy scents and pays Quentin Bisch to keep making them.

Aldebaran actually smells like all the notes in the notes listing. Almost too much like them. Photorealistic tuberose, photorealistic paprika/bell pepper. Smooth, sweet tonka bean. Bitter, grassy maté. Do they work together? Kind of. But it just feels unnatural and unnerving. I think that's why there are votes for ""synthetic."" Each note doesn't smell synthetic at all but the combination is bizarre and like something a robot who's unable to smell would come up with.

None of this is to say it's ""bad,"" per se, just utterly WEIRD. Usually I commend a fragrance for its originality but here it almost works against Aldebaran. I'm giving it a high score because I'm enjoying it for its novelty, but this is definitely not an endorsement for a blind buy. I can very easily see how someone could feel that this is an absolute abomination, and it's like a hair away from that for me. It's one of those that can either be higher than an 8 or lower than a 2 and nothing in between."
Nuage Cerisier,04/07/2025,Borose,F,1,,7,Aldebaran the ancient star that guides to the East,"It’s the exact scent of a 'gajra', the fresh tuberose flowers that are strung by hand on a thread and sold in indian streets in the morning for 20 roupies, they are worn wrapped around wrists, hair or offered to gods during pooja. Beautiful realistic fragrance: it’s Bombay monsoon, the gajra mingles with the humid air, the warm skin, and the rain ; the flowers soaked in scent and weather. It simply captures this moment of wearing a gajra bracelet all day in Bombay. It's devotional, sensual, nostalgic, sacred and roadside tea boiling at the chai-wala corner smell at once.
Bought a bottle today so I can be wrapped again in those memory of delicious rain-drenched days with gajra in India. After all, Aldebaran is the royal star, the one that is the East. And it really does light the way back to my favourite place in the East!"
Nuage Cerisier,04/20/2025,Myrtillajus,F,530,,5,Unique,"To the ancient Egyptians, the star of Aldebaran was connected with the eye of Horus, the sky god and king of Egypt.
Four hundred times brighter than the sun, it is represented as the second star of the floral constellation by Marc Antoine Barrois.
Its color is red, often associated with passion, and what flower more appropriate than the tuberose to represent the ""star of fire"" ?
To describe Aldebaran as a fragrance starring the narcotic flower par excellence would be extremely reductive.
Here we are in front of a creation by Quentin Bisch (and yes, I love him), which strips itself of pleasingness and heads towards an extremely artistic dimension.
A not-so-obvious tuberose, which to its heady notes adds the mate grass (it seems to perceive it in powder form), with nuances that I perceive almost metallic, very particular.
I had to smell it on my skin several times to understand it, because it has a really not obvious construction, and it becomes a real sensory journey.
Go and smell it, it's really particular, it comes out of the box, and you will realize that you will be more and more intrigued by its uniqueness.
Of course in my collection, I wear it when I want to feel indecipherable, unique.
And here I mention the mystique of Egyptian art , which represents it perfectly ."
Nuage Cerisier,04/23/2025,NicheOnly,M,115,,4,Edgy doesn't mean good,"Loudly for the people in the back: being different for the sake of it doesn't make you cool. This feels like a moniker that I should adapt any time a new release comes out from French ""designer niche house"" Marc-Antoine Barrois. Just like with Tilia last year, the product offered isn't that far from what is already available in the market, yet somehow there's enough here to stay in the realm of their brand image.

I've experienced the Aldebaran twice now and the difference is quite pronounced on paper vs. on skin. The scent opens with a very strong green-aromatic floral tonality, flanked by a puzzling smoky-woody touch. I believe this is the listed maté note which I've also experienced in this fashion before in Clive Christian's Matsukita. Shortly thereafter, the notes and accords settle with the scent mostly smelling of creamy tuberose, flanked by a green backbone and light sweetness from the tonka.

The contrast of notes comes off fairly artsy relative to where niche perfumery is nowadays, but quirkiness doesn't mean the product has good quality nor wearability. I'd even argue that in many cases, it just leaves you with an outdated product. Just last year Maison Crivelli had a strong release in the tuberose realm with Tubéreuse Astrale, a fragrance that also features osmanthus and carrot seed, i.e. notes that co-star well with the tuberose. Meanwhile, Aldebaran doesn't have those notes which is a key reason why this scent comes off like a more typical tuberose-neroli fragrance with an added tonka. The strength of the scent is on-par with the house's other products and the blending isn't as rough, i.e. the synthetic nature isn't left as exposed; but the product just doesn't deliver anything besides loud & rarer profile; both of which are categories where the aforementioned Crivelli is superior."
Nuage Cerisier,04/27/2025,Reddawks,M,82,,2,niche vs designer,"Debates around niche vs designer perfumes are everywhere online.
Everyone has their own opinion, their own interpretation.
I once read that since Marc-Antoine Barrois is also a fashion brand, it should be classified as ""designer.""
If your definition of niche leads you to put the house behind Ganymede in the ""designer"" category, then maybe your definition needs a little rethinking.
With Aldebaran, at least, there will be no question: this is pure niche.
A floral composition, touched with paprika or green pepper notes, maté, tonka bean...
Doesn't ring any bells? That's normal.
As often with true niche perfumes, the listed notes only tell part of the story.
Aldebaran is a perfume you must smell to truly understand — a divisive scent, a discreet yet passionate tuberose.
Unique.

You get a rich tuberose here, and I am a fan of tonka bean anyway. Mate as the icing on the cake does a fantastic job here. The listed paprika shouldn't be overemphasized; it's actually only used for balancing, as I learned from the very dedicated fragrance consultant at Beck.
I find the longevity of Aldebaran to be fantastic, and I also rate the sillage highly.
So come on, dear ones, give it another test... for me, this fragrance is moving from the watch list to the wish list for autumn."
Nuage Cerisier,07/31/2025,JEBERLIN,M,9,,2,Wow wow wow,"A really cool scent once again from the house of Barrois. Aldebaran is intensely positive, and definitely a compliment-giver. I don't usually like tuberose that much, but here it fits perfectly into the composition of, for example, mate tea (freshness) and tonka bean (warmth). The ensemble somehow reminds me of the Garden of Eden, just as one imagines it (in this case probably on Aldebaran). The scent is above average present on the skin. Two sprays are enough for the evening, and probably just one for the office. So far, everyone has liked it, and I certainly do too."

But this time, the first encounter was not easy. With the first breath - no love at first sight. Not even with the second. Only on the third try did the fragrance begin to unfold differently. Deeper, warmer, fuller. And then I realized: Aldebaran is not one of those fragrances that enchant immediately. It demands time, attention, and silence. And yes, this scent does not want to please everyone, nor can it.

Its composition is complex, somewhat distant, with its own inner logic and movement. Not a fleeting romance, but a slow infatuation. And now I know for sure - I am not disappointed. It is more about respect. And a growing interest."
Eau de Fleur de Magnolia,08/10/2019,Floyd,M,570,,28,From the Tectonic Quality of Ambered Resins,"I met Thierry Autour, whom some (like himself) describe as a scientist, while others see more of a madman, in a national park in North America at a location that is difficult to access for civilization, the whereabouts of which I promised to keep secret. The texture and temperature of the soil here are ideal for his olfactory experiments, he assured me. Some time ago, he had buried various resins from North and South America, Egypt, and Thailand to examine their, as he said, tectonic qualities. Due to the anomaly of the soil, the resins would never harden and would remain in constant motion, sometimes even merging and separating like in a lava lamp, he described enthusiastically. However, the olfactory experience when uncovering the resins is unique, as the aromas would gradually dissipate after a while, so it is an honor for me, and I should close my eyes, he smiled mischievously as he knelt on the damp ground with a small shovel and a root brush and began to make the first careful digs into the soil. I closed my eyes.
At first, I perceived a warm-spicy earthy scent of patchouli, which seemed to mix with a slightly sharp-green vetiver. Both scents blended quite pleasantly, seeming to excitingly complement each other in their contrast. That is just the smell of the earth and the grass here, Thierry laughed, and I heard him scraping further.
About five minutes later, a slightly smoky, resinous, minimally cinnamon-vanilla aroma took over, which vaguely reminded me of gingerbread, and Thierry assured me that this was the South American Peru and Tolubalsam resins that evoked these notes and liked to merge with each other during their tectonic movement to enhance their aromas.
After another ten minutes, the scent lightened a bit, acquiring a slightly medicinal resinous character, which Thierry attributed to the benzoin resin, now mixing with the smell of the damp meadow. To me, it still smelled of fresh vetiver. This impression now shifted with a distant cumin-like scent that mingled with the cinnamon-vanilla resin and seemed to be glazed with warm honey. This was now the labdanum resin, which elicited this impression from the Peru and Tolubalsam, Thierry indulged, before he gave me a one-hour geological lecture on the peculiarities of resin tectonics, to which I paid no attention due to the spicy-warm enjoyment, into which the scent of balsamic-tobacco-like amber was slowly blending more and more. This amber scent arose from the separation of cis-abienol from the North American balsam fir, Thierry lectured, and came to me with chemical soil processes that I could not follow for the life of me; I focused instead on the increasingly sweet, warm-spicy amber scent that lingered for many hours before slowly fading away.
I could now open my eyes again, Thierry said, trying to be serious, to which I did just that. Laughing to tears, he held out a bottle of Ambre Mystère to me. These perfume junkies believed even the most absurd theories as long as it was about discovering new olfactory compositions, he chuckled, resin tectonics and aroma archaeology, he could hardly contain himself. I could keep the bottle, he finally said, recommending the scent for autumn to spring and noting that the sillage was rather moderate, which I had already noticed myself."
Eau de Fleur de Magnolia,04/26/2014,Alexis66,F,22,,16,"No, dear speaker, no, no...","no!
This perfume is by no means an ordinary amber.

But let's start from the beginning: Thanks to dear KatRedhead, I have the pleasure of owning a sample of this fragrance. I tested it out of curiosity right away. Since a wooow! is rather meager for a comment, here’s a bit more detail:
The first impression is (of course) amber, heavy gray amber. Gray, yes, but not of the extremely meaty kind, rather with golden flecks like fresh, yellow honey. I suspect that it is the labdanum that gives the perfume, despite all its heaviness, a lightness and almost a sense of ease. After a relatively short while, the patchouli joins in, grounding the scent and together with delicious, smoky vanilla, creating a fragrance harmony that could come straight from paradise.

The sillage could be overwhelming, but this honey note keeps the fragrance from being overpowering despite its enveloping presence. As for longevity: It exceeds all expectations! A small spray this morning, and after washing my hands and showering countless times since then, the perfume is still clearly noticeable.

Conclusion: Ambre Mystere has made me a new fan and will definitely find a place in my collection!"
Eau de Fleur de Magnolia,05/20/2013,ParfumAholic,M,257,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,All-purpose Amber,"After ""Poudre d'Iris,"" ""Ambre Mystere"" was to be my second test candidate from ""Autour du Parfum."" True to the motto ""You catch mice with bacon and you catch me with amber,"" I couldn't pass up this scent!

Given the name, I expected a heavy, mystically dark, almost black amber like the one I experienced with Michele Bergman's ""Black Amber.""

That expectations are not always met is part of the nature of things. Unfortunately, this was also the case here: Instead of what I expected, I encountered ""only"" a normal amber scent, one I've come across several times before. A spicy amber representative resting on vanilla and patchouli.

A true scent development doesn't seem to occur for me. I also can't really pick out the individual fragrance components. What is clearly present from the beginning to the end is amber (relatively heavy and expansive), vanilla (slightly smoky), and patchouli (earthy, but not musty).

All in all, a good and solid scent that, however, raises greater expectations with its name than it can ultimately fulfill. Perhaps the name should symbolize that amber has something mystical about it? But it doesn't matter.

What is certain is that AM is a good unisex fragrance that lasts long, can be worn in any season and for any occasion, and also offers a solid price-performance ratio."
Parfum d'Été,02/04/2025,SVT,M,56,,3,A long dense voyage,"All starts from the opening where the two types of tobaccos used (Virginian and Bulgarian) will be perceptible, in combination with saffron, spices and a bit of cocoa to give a chocolatey vibe, which will transition towards the fulcrum of the composition, the oud...

To my nose, the most evident oud profile is the Cambodian variety, which will begin with something ""wild"" like a note of hay for a few minutes, then accentuate on nuances of tobacco first and purple fruits to follow.

The fruity nuance will be somewhat continued by the Thai oud, a sorta of sparring partner, which will veer towards woody territories in the dry down, accompanied by sandalwood.

I do not perceive Filipino oud distinctly, perhaps because of my culture to broaden, although I think it is giving something delicately incensy to the whole.

That said, the result is commendable"
Couleur Kenzo Violet,01/20/2021,BeginswithaJ,M,16,,1,Something for your hair,"A sickeningly sweet synthetic fruit bomb suitable mostly for teenagers. You could wear this all year round, but I prefer you didn't.

A complete failure to me. This fragrance opens heavy and sweet, with lots of candy fruits. There's a sour note from the passion fruit and it fizzes a bit. It's just so, so extremely synthetic that it reminds me of a cheap hairspray, and almost gives me a headache. On clothing the passion fruit is more defined than on skin.

There's some bitterness in the dry down, which leans more to the resinous than zesty side. Ans a little bit of musk peeps around the corner. It shifts a bit from the candy-like sweetness to something containing citrus notes. There's a hidden flower in there that I can't place that makes it all somewhat softer together with the vanilla, but don't expect miracles. throughout the longevity of this scent the hairspray is still a dominant factor.

My gaze immediately landed on a small, simple bottle (by the way, not the one pictured above; the fragrance is also available in a transparent, small, elongated, narrow bottle). Quite appealing in itself with classic charm.
Oh... Was there something? Amber? And then also Black?
My interest was piqued. So I sprayed it directly on my forearm.
I expected something dark, heavy, perhaps in the direction of the Prada Amber fragrances. But I was mistaken...
On my skin, it immediately developed into an artificial sweet fruit bomb.
I could hardly concentrate on my shopping hunt as the plastic fruits were hitting me around the ears!
If we were to consider only the sillage neutrally, I would place it in the middle range.
I couldn't pick out any individual notes. I found the half hour I endured with this fragrance very exhausting and was glad when I could wash it off my arm at the next best opportunity.

For the price, I think you can't go wrong. It continually brings back memories that I associate with The One. In the summer, I really enjoy wearing Black Amber and layering it with fragrances that contain a lot of musk, as I find that it harmonizes really well and is the perfect combination for hot summer days and evenings.

Slightly camphorated notes immerse the fragrance in a unique, dark and magnetic atmosphere, making it a fragrance that went beyond any idea I might have had when reading its name or the olfactory pyramid.
Well-balanced, intense, wonderful.
Like the legendary city of Atlantis underwater, shining despite the depths of the abyss.
If you love intense, original and enveloping fragrances, you will be enchanted."
Madly Kenzo! Oud Collection,12/14/2023,NicheOnly,M,115,,2,"Well, it's definitely not Xerjoff","I welcome the Sospiro brand to Parfumo after years of moderator tomfoolery with a review of their only 2023 release Deep Ocean Amber. Sospiro has another 3 releases coming next year that they teased at both Cannes TFWA and ScentXplore, so be on the look out (one of them is a cherry gourmand fragrance).

Impressions as I go through the wear, without looking at the notes: Warm spicy & floral right off the top. I think that is violet...? I naturally started to think it was a twist on Oud Satin Mood EAU DE PARFUM, sans the prominent sweetness. But then, I began to notice ""Angels' Share | Kilian"". At least in the air, the balsamic amber you have here is the exact same one used in ""Angels' Share | Kilian"", albeit it clearly lacks the prominent sweetness of both OSM & AS. In the deep drydown, the scent has a hint of cinnamon which further showcases vibes of the aforementioned Kilian. But there is something in the back here that smells dry-animalic-woody, I am guessing it's styrax.

After pyramid: I think amber is clearly the #1 accord here, so the benzoin & labdanum are prominent. The name feels like a double entendre, because the ambergris (listed as a base note) I'd say is not as evident. I did some of this testing indoors and some of it outdoors - what I'd say is that the amber here smells like ""Angels' Share | Kilian"" *indoors* with a hint of sweetness (but it's moderate, unlike AS & OSM) and outdoors, the amber smells more like those from Carner Barcelona.

Evolution: Aggregate scent is always led by the amber accord. Up-close it first smelled warm spicy & floral, perhaps mildly boozy (about 5 minutes into the wear). Then the styrax really kicks in at about 10-15 minutes and is noticeable for the rest of it as the initial elemi-amber combo dies down a bit, giving it a mild animalic flair.

Very hard to bring up comparables, but think Oud Satin on 0.5x strength + styrax or Angels' Share - sweetness + styrax. I'd say moderate-to-strong sillage for the first 2-3 hours and then the scent dies down, lasting around 9-10 hours. Overall, a bit too much styrax in the base which takes away from the ""good, but not great"" opening. €330/100ml doesn't capture my attention. I rate it a 6.0/10 - it's the epitome of average product."
Madly Kenzo! Oud Collection,10/27/2025,Dama96,M,58,,3,Warm Sea Air,"I have almost never encountered a fragrance that is so difficult to describe in terms of its scent. This is the case with ""Deep Ocean Amber | Sospiro,"" even though the name is almost self-explanatory and one wouldn't think it could be so multifaceted and diverse.

The scent reminds me a bit of ""40 Knots | Xerjoff,"" but has a much deeper composition. While 40 Knots smells to my nose like a breeze of sea air from the North Sea - spicy-salty cool - Deep Ocean Amber is more reminiscent of a breeze of sea air from the Mediterranean. Carried by the hot midday sun, it sweeps over resinous trees and spices from the neighboring villages, warming the skin.

Deep Ocean Amber starts off resinous dark and slightly smoky, reminiscent of incense. Gradually, the nuances that evoke a spicy wind appear; like spices carried by the wind over long distances, somewhat dissipating but never completely disappearing. Styrax and violet create slightly floral nuances that allow the wearer to dream away; to the sea, into the sun.
After a while, amber and benzoin open up with an incomparable warmth. The spicy wind is warmed and carried further by the hot sun. It penetrates directly to the heart and warms the spirit like the summer sun.

An incredibly wonderful, warm fragrance; multifaceted from smoky-spicy to floral and warming, it offers a lot. I wouldn't recommend blind buying it due to the resinous-smoky notes, but testing it is highly recommended."
Madly Kenzo! Oud Collection,09/27/2025,Anximiguel,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The Depth of the Ocean?,"This fragrance has no review? That pretty much describes why it is so magical for me.

It flies completely under the radar, appears extremely rarely in the ticker, and when I exchange thoughts with my fragrance friends here, it is rarely known.
But is it because it is ""redundant""?
In my opinion, absolutely not.
If you are active in this community, exchanging ideas, sending fragrance samples back and forth, you inevitably find yourself in the lovely situation of being able to test new fragrances of all kinds repeatedly. However, this fragrance was not sent to me as an addition; somehow, I became aware of this scent on my own. I ordered a sample because it sounded totally intriguing, and on the other hand, the brand Sospiro has often convinced me. And so it does again now.

Starting with the extremely beautiful name of the fragrance and the black bottle, which looks simply great in my collection.

The Deep Ocean Amber initially starts off extremely resinous and smoky, and I must admit that I was a bit put off at first sniff. My first thought was, uh, it smells pretty dark down there.
At 6:45 AM, I sprayed it three times, and the Deep Ocean Amber came on with a power I did not expect. Almost a bit too powerful.
I like to smell good and unique, but I prefer not to be overwhelming.
I think 2 sprays might have been better. So, I make my way to work comfortably, and after about a 35-minute drive, I perceive the fragrance quite differently. Sure, it is still smoky and resinous, but it feels much rounder now.
I no longer feel like I am overwhelming my surroundings with this scent.
On the contrary, the longer time passes, the more pleasing this fragrance becomes. After about 2 hours, the amber has asserted itself, and you hardly notice that smoky note that bothered me at first.
A feeling of well-being spreads, which I have only experienced with a few fragrances in this form. Often, fragrances annoy me after a while, but not this one.

The dry down is the truly magical part of this fragrance. An invisible presence that no longer screams but whispers, yet is certainly perceived by everyone around you.
I have only felt a similar majestic presence before with Nefs or ""Enigma pour Homme / Creation-E pour Homme (Parfum) | Roja Parfums."" And those who know these two fragrances understand what I mean.

The longevity of the Deep Ocean Amber is truly astonishing. Applied in the morning, you can easily still perceive this fragrance on yourself in the evening. Easily 8 to 12 hours.

After a conversation in my boss's office, she later approached me again to tell me that this is the best fragrance I have worn so far.
And my boss is certainly accustomed to high-quality fragrances because of me.

I am firmly convinced that this fragrance will soon find great acclaim in the community. Although I wouldn't mind if it stayed just as it is now. ↔
Anyone looking for a secret weapon away from the mainstream will not be disappointed here.

I will never leave the deep sea again."
Ça Sent Beau,07/05/2024,Lidijabern,F,47,,2,You've got me fooled,"Sooo fooled by this one. First impression (the opening) is something bitter and green. Really bitter, as artemisia bitter. I don't know where this comes from, maybe an old sample or a really strong oud? Development brings a touch of pleasant, creamy sweetness and a different olfactory composition, one closer to that one you would imagine just by reading the notes. It's a good quality fragrance, longlasting, but if you expect something sugary sweet, tropical or ""coconut sunscreen vibe"", don't be disappointed when you find none of this here. Maybe a hint of it in the drydown. :-D This is masculine, bitter and serious, but nevertheless beautiful and different. I like it."
Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,07/22/2023,LeSmelleur,M,95,,2,Smell of a hairdresser,"I didn't want to bother with Joop, because I perceive it as a cheap brand and therefore do not expect quality, but I got my hands on a sample, so here goes. The cons listed are mostly on point. The branding is bad, it's a unisex fragrance and there's nothing icy about it. Well, there is a short moment of iciness right after the opening, but that's it. The opening is mostly bubblegum. It quickly settles into a smell of a hairdresser. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's a damp, artificial, cloying smell, here coming probably from the plum and tobacco. If I wanted to find this barber scent, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to, but look - it found me.

Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,05/12/2020,Leimbacher,M,2870,,33,Ice Ice Shady,"With ""Joop! Homme,"" it's back on track! The pink classic was never really gone, but it definitely lost some steam in the 2000s. Now, however, the flankers and offshoots seem to be popping up seemingly bought and (un)asked for - and some of them are even recommendable, like the recent black ""Absolute."" Even if it had hardly anything to do with the original and should have actually been released under a new name. And sure, there are a few misses, like the ""Sport"" belly flop, but overall, this potent king of yesteryear is definitely back on deck and is managing to keep its name. So what does this new ""Ice"" have to offer? A cool guy or a chilling disappointment?

""Joop! Homme Ice"" has again very little to do with the pink (attention-grabber) of back then, maybe in its syrupy base sweetness. Otherwise, it's more of a musty-interesting (and somehow citrusy) tobacco/cardamom scent, where I have almost zero ""icy"" associations, and therefore I find the name not particularly fitting. The scent and I, however, fit together quite a bit better. A rather weird combo of scratchiness and balm, of ashtray and shisha, of gray suit and Hubba Bubba. This will surely make some people really nauseous; you can tear it apart in the air if you want or if you can't come to terms with it. I find it exciting, charming, daring. At least that. At least. Cardamom and orange blossom both make a strong showing, neither wanting to let the other take the lead. Somewhere in the vast no man's land between ""Fleur du Male,"" ""La Nuit de L’Homme,"" and ""Tabarome,"" thoughts of ""Hugo"" or even ""Tabac Original"" come to mind. Just with this thick sugar glaze that contradictorily lifts the otherwise rather herbaceous DNA, rejuvenates it, and almost makes it club-ready. I somehow like it. Maybe it's because I'm a fan of plums, and these also hover above everything. Juicy, dripping, sticky. But never annoying me. A cool scent. Just never even the slightest hint of icy...

Bottle: somewhat boring blue, at least fitting to the theme, usual shape
Sillage: not as loud as the pink one, but louder than some other flankers
Longevity: doesn't disappear too quickly - 6-9 hours

Conclusion: interesting, distinctive, sweet, slightly citrusy, with clear Joop Homme DNA. And yet quite different. Finally something daring. Not everyone will like it. I do. Somehow. Odd hybrid. Attractive or repulsive. Give it a test!"
Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,07/08/2020,Manuel81,M,59,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Sweet? YES.....Bad? NO!!!,"It's not so easy to test a fragrance in the current situation, but this one can be easily smelled even through 3 masks.
I was a bit disturbed when I saw what was happening at Douglas on a completely normal Wednesday at 2 PM.....BUT, of course, a nice lady came up to me right away and asked if she could help me....So I pulled out my phone and showed her 5 screenshots of fragrances that currently interest me.
Besides this one, there was also the WRITER, the AQUAMAN by Davidoff, and 2 from Yves Saint Laurent.
By the way, I was wearing the AVIATOR by Paris Bleu today.....I applied 3 more fragrances to test, but the only one that really stuck in my nose was the Joop Homme ICE.
In my opinion, it's an exceptionally good spring/summer fragrance, but it is definitely UNISEX.
To be honest, I find it quite difficult to describe this fragrance, so I will categorize it instead.
Fresh / Sweet / Fruity / Woody / Aquatic with a hint of powder...that's probably the best way to describe it.
The sillage is STRONG, comparable to UR HOMME, and the longevity also seems to be quite good, as even after showering just now, it is still noticeably present.
However, a direct comparison to the regular HOMME cannot be made here; it's not like you can just throw HOMME and COOL WATER into a pot and come out with HOMME ICE.
TESTING is definitely worth it here!!!
Addendum from 13.07.2020
In direct comparison with the ""normal"" Joop Homme, the sillage is not quite as strong...that's why I changed my rating from 9 to 8...but it is still strong."
Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,06/07/2020,Micha1984,M,36,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Something off about the name but still good!,"As a child of the 80s and 90s, I have known the Joop brand for a long time. My parents wore the pink original in the early 90s and were huge fans of this strong fragrance at the time. I still remember that before my parents went out, they would always spray themselves and left behind a pink cloud of scent after leaving the apartment. This lingered for ages, and as a child, I was already very taken with this fragrance and would always sniff after it. Many years later, when I was old enough and had the corresponding pocket money, there was always a Joop fragrance in the house alongside Dior's Fahrenheit. My first Joop was the green GO! I celebrated it back then. With its wonderful rhubarb note, it was a rather unique scent at the time, with moderate longevity and sillage. I also once had Joop Wild in the form of a sample, but I didn't buy it (I can't remember why). Since then, a lot of time has passed, and I had been less impressed with Joop fragrances as I focused more on other brands. Recently, I was browsing Fragrantica again and discovered the blue brother of the original. Joop Ice in beautiful blue and then also with plum?! It was immediately clear that I had to test it. My expectations were rather restrained, along the lines of, well... it will probably be a typical blue shower gel scent with Joop DNA. So, I took the opportunity when I found it during my last shopping trip in a perfume store and gave it a chance. That was a good decision because Joop is really not bad, and I ended up buying it right away. The opening is characterized by a fruity, slightly sour, and subtly cool accord, which in no way has anything to do with Ice. How Joop came up with the name is a mystery to me. The name Ice would fit the bottle better than the content. Nevertheless, it starts off with a nice fresh kick in the first few minutes. Once the citrus fruits have faded a bit, it becomes slightly sweet in the top note, which personally reminds me immediately of chewing gum. After about an hour, we reach the heart, and the fragrance transitions into a subtle sweetness, still accompanied by a bit of freshness. I don't perceive the stated tobacco here, but I do pick up a bit of cardamom. The base gradually settles in, and sandalwood and cardamom come together. Here, I find that one can definitely draw slight parallels to the original. The longevity for me is 10h+ with 4 sprays, depending on the weather. The sillage is very good, and I received compliments even after 2-3 hours and with 4 sprays on my neck. Speaking of likability, the fragrance itself has been very well received so far. Compliments are definitely in the cards with this Joop. In summary, it can be said that Joop has not reinvented the wheel here but has released a very nice and rounded everyday freshie. I think it will be a good alternative for office and leisure. Definitely give it a try; maybe it will appeal to some just as much as it does to me."
Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,11/03/2020,Rathaloose,M,8,,10,Frozen Summer Dream,"This fragrance belongs to the clean scents and has subtle similarities to Prada l'homme; unlike Prada l'homme, this scent does not remind me of a high-quality soap but rather of a fruity/fresh men's shower gel.

What stands out to me is the plum, probably not least because I absolutely love this note. The orange blossom, which is not as prominent, slightly reminds me of the orange note that also resonates in Joop Homme, even though these two fragrances have no other similarities.
The components that would be classified as aromatic and spicy (tobacco, cardamom, sandalwood) remain very much in the background in this fragrance, and in the case of cardamom, it supports the projecting freshness. The blend of clean freshness and subtle spice makes the scent feel synthetic, but not in a cheap way.

Personally, I see this fragrance as an alternative to Prada l'homme if you are a bit younger or looking for a summery alternative, and I can recommend it without hesitation in those cases."

Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,06/09/2021,Jufax,M,5,,5,Unfortunately just a headache for me,"Joop! Homme Ice opens just as the name promises: cool, fresh, fruity, sweet. I can't pick out any specific fruits here, the plum overshadows everything. Not a bad opening, ideal for spring. Unfortunately, after the drydown, the freshness disappears, and the Ice is gone, it has probably melted. It gets sweeter and sweeter, tobacco and sandalwood join in, and eventually, it’s just a strongly sweet mishmash that unfortunately gives me a headache. Longevity and sillage are quite good, you can still noticeably smell the fragrance after 5-6 hours, washing it off hardly helps.
For me, a blind buy that didn't work out, but it's not a bad scent either; the original Homme DNA can be detected in the background, definitely worth a try for fans of fruity-sweet fragrances.
The bottle is nothing special, fits well in the hand, and as another user noted, it's certainly not the ugliest on the shelf ^^"
Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,08/05/2022,LucaM180,M,19,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,A Plum to Spray,"I came across this fragrance through a YouTube video and immediately bought it blind at my trusted drugstore. I was told that Joop Homme Ice smells like a sweet and simultaneously fresh plum. I can only confirm this statement. The scent really does smell like a super fruity/sweet plum, and the freshness is really well done. The longevity and sillage are average (longevity about 6-7 hours for me). The bottle is relatively basic, the blue glass looks nice but is nothing really special. The price is also absolutely fair for the fragrance; for €30 you get a lovely fresh, sweet, and fruity plum scent. Joop Homme Ice is great for summer days. This perfume is a top everyday scent that fits almost all situations and is not off-putting or too intrusive. It’s simply a great all-rounder."

Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,07/16/2023,ScentExplorer,M,18,,9,TOP flanker from the house of Joop!,"Until recently, I hadn't had this flanker from the house of Joop! on my radar. Summer was just around the corner, and I was looking for an addition to my summer fragrances. Could it be that I had neither tested nor purchased this Joop! Homme Ice so far? This plum scent in the top note piqued my curiosity. I quickly consulted Dr. Google to find the best possible price, and lo and behold... the fragrance was discontinued! Not a single affordable offer available in the depths of the world wide web. But luckily, there is this wonderful place called parfumo.de. After I initiated a search, it didn't take long for a very nice Parfumo member to help me out.

Joop! remains true to its line in terms of bottle design within the Homme series. And that's a good thing - because I've liked this design from the very beginning! The similarity of the flanker Joop! Homme Ice to the classic Joop! Homme EAU DE TOILETTE is unmistakable. However, when you hold the 80ml Joop! Homme Ice in your hands, you will notice that there are some marginal changes in the design. In any case, the bottle feels wonderful in the hand. Quality glass and a very good sprayer round off the first positive impression. Well done!

A wonderful freshness bursts forth from the very good atomizer at the opening, filling the surroundings with a great freshness and a pleasant sweetness, along with a certain fruitiness from the plum. I also think I can smell the muscatel sage. Wow - I think to myself... great top note that I didn't expect! After the first great impression, tobacco and sandalwood join in as the fragrance develops. These two players give the scent more depth and longevity. This combination really harmonizes very, very well. The fragrance suggests to the consumer, through the ""Ice"" in its name, a freshness similar to ""Terre d'Hermès Eau Givrée | Hermès,"" which is definitely not the case. Nevertheless, this freshie from the house of Joop! is a summer fragrance that works practically everywhere. Not at all overpowering and super pleasant for those around.

Regarding longevity, I can report that the scent lasts really long for an EdT. For example, it held up for 6-8 hours yesterday at 34°C. Towards the end, it didn't have great sillage, but every now and then a strong breeze comes through, and you notice... it's still there!

Conclusion: Thumbs up! This flanker is more than successful - a wonderful summer fragrance with a unique selling point! Such a scent combination, not least thanks to the plum, is, in my opinion, not found again on the market. From my perspective, it's truly a shame that this Joop! Homme Ice was taken off the market. It deserved to be tested and worn by even more Parfumo members. Because it would have been a great alternative/change in many collections. Totally underrated!!!"
Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,09/28/2020,Massa,M,1,,2,Joop Homme Ice - unfortunately not the quality of Joop Homme!,"Anyone who thinks, like I do, that because Joop Homme has good longevity and a decent sillage, they can't go wrong with this scent, is mistaken. I will rate the scent itself an 8, but longevity and sillage only deserve a maximum of 5 points each. Really a shame. I briefly tested the scent in our perfumery, was thrilled, and unfortunately bought it immediately. But after the first wear, my disappointment was great - after about 2 hours, I could smell nothing anymore; for a compliment that I occasionally receive for good fragrances, Joop Ice unfortunately did not suffice!"
Couleur Kenzo Jaune-Yellow,10/16/2025,LeBog,M,9,,1,So So,"I bought Homme Ice three years ago because it smelled very interesting when tested - unfortunately, the bottle is still half full today.

Freshly sprayed, Homme Ice really smells nice, cool, fruity-sweet like plum. A very pleasant scent.

Unfortunately, the top notes fade very quickly - within 5 to 10 minutes - and then the perfume develops a rather synthetic character, in my opinion. This must be due to the tobacco, as sandalwood is actually a very natural, pleasant scent.

That doesn't mean I think Ice is really bad; it just loses its initial scent very quickly and leaves you with a fragrance that you can like, but don't have to (what a stretched sentence, actually...) - for my taste, it's a bit too artificial/synthetic and too sweet.

The sillage of the perfume is quite strong, its longevity rather mediocre, which you can also see in the reviews.

By the way, the bottle is well chosen. Solid, I would say typically Joop!."
Flower by Kenzo Red Edition,01/07/2025,Telekinec,F,498,,1,Buttery cinnamon with a candle-like aspect,"I had to wear it twice to figure it out it wasn't me the problem in detecting the notes in this perfume, but rather the fact that the scent is pretty mild and subtle. I was expecting something strong with bold, uncompromising notes, but instead I got something soft, almost delicate, a fragrance I'd prefer in a candle rather than on my skin.

At the beginning, I get a soft, delicate and powdery cocoa with some floral undertones. It doesn't take long before the cinnamon butter comes up which remains the star during a large portion of the perfume's life. Buttery, almost creamy and lactonic with a warm, spicy cinnamon that accompanies it. The butter note has a waxy (synthetic?) facet I often smell in candles. This might be why I associate this scent to a candle rather than a perfume. After the cinnamon butter starts to wane a bit, I start getting some vanilla orchid and some white sandalwood. It's creamy, gourmand and has a warm, comforting aspect. Caramel further enhances the buttery, thick part of the fragrance. As the base starts to come in, vetiver imparts a mild spiciness while amber adds warmth and bourbon vanilla adds that sweetness we've all come to love and recognize in modern gourmand perfumes.

It's defintely a lovely fragrance, but that buttery, synthetic note that reminds me of candles is the main reason why it won't be making it into my collection. I might also not be a fan of butter and lactonic fragrances on my skin. I'm still pretty happy I got to try it out and I do have to say it stands out from gourmands I've smelled recently."
Jeu d'Amour Félin,09/12/2023,Axiomatic,M,149,,29,Airport 2020,"A white seagull in the royal blue sky. Almost half a century under its belt.
Its flight began in 1974 at Shulton Inc. on the East Coast of the USA. However, turbulent air currents were to land the magnificent wings of the bird at the end of a risky flight path near Birmingham in England in 2020, allowing it to find a new nest in the hangar of Three Pears Ltd.

Dear Hapax, stow your carry-on luggage properly in the overhead compartment, sit up straight, and buckle up, because we will soon be taking off for Seattle.
And thanks in advance for the reminder of this classic!
See you later.

Before every flight, the captain goes through several parameters with his crew. And it should be no different with this fragrance.
Components, historical context, fun factor.

TVC15, the perfume of the first hour and builder of supporting walls in the forum, experienced this seagull similarly and commented super humorously. If interested, check here Blue Stratos EAU DE TOILETTE. I would now like to take over the onward flight.
For in-flight entertainment, I’ll borrow a few musical highlights from the time I experienced as a child.

So, after we have received clearance for takeoff…

Oki, let’s turn on the classic “Love’s Theme” by The Love Unlimited Orchestra…

Swoosh!

Boy, it’s getting foggy here. Somehow, the scent pyramid doesn’t make sense, as the musk in the base immediately causes limited visibility, along with a sweet vanilla note. The listed hesperides are dutifully masked but can still be detected.
Well, dear TVC15, I can only agree with you, tastes are different across the Atlantic. Freshness is associated with musk and vanilla, while hesperides tend to end up in dish soap.

Well, a little anecdote from my side. I once got to bathe with Mr. Bubble, that iconic bubble bath with an extremely funny fruity floral scent. A friendly bubble monster smiled amicably from the label of the pink bottle.
Completely different from the Badedas here at home, full of cozy fir and sober bottle design.
So different, kids got to splash around with the squeaky duck.

And what applied to the little ones should be no exception for adults.
While a deep green Bogart EAU DE TOILETTE cleared its way through dense forests in Europe, the white seagull floated above vanilla musk clouds.

But wait, the fragrance has even more to offer!
This heart is marked by a gentle Love&Peace caress, a classic rose-patchouli.
The earthy grass also comes off slightly sweet. No wonder, it has found a best friend in amber.

Only the lavender remains somewhat steadfast, painting the whole thing herbally fresh and giving the fragrance its characteristic hue. Well, the cedar also provides the necessary support so as not to completely disappear in the fog of love.

Strangely enough, there’s a sprinkling of vanilla powder. Quite a dry ingredient and always on the edge of being bearable. The remaining hesperides are bound with the yellow stuff, hence the freshness of the New World.

Nicely lasting and with a subtle sillage, the juice of the beautiful bottle requires repeated spraying.
The bottle is more than successful, simple and perfectly rounded, plus this beautiful blue color!

So, onward in the 747 to the West Coast. The vastness of the Midwest lies behind us, and Air Traffic Control is directing us over Utah.
Let’s leave the entertainment music to the crew, as I have the impression that it’s quite affectionate in the cabin.
“Baby come back” by Player should get the beautiful Halston uniforms for Braniff International moving a bit.

Ah, we glide without turbulence at 10,000 meters, everything so smooth and almost too flattering.

But what would the 1970s be without incidents during the flight…

Bang!

Pressure drop!

The small hairline crack in the cockpit window became noticeably larger and finally caused the pane to shatter!

All hell breaks loose in the cabin, the co-pilot and flight engineer are hit by flying debris and incapacitated.
The pilot is injured, can hardly see, and had to quickly bring the plane down to a height where one can breathe.
Gasping, he switches on the autopilot.

And the Rocky Mountains are getting closer…

The crew is desperately searching for a suitable substitute pilot among the passengers.

Hey Hapax, your chance!

Don’t worry, in the 1970s, at least in the movies, you could always manage, such quick learning by doing.

Off to the cockpit with you!

Easy, my boy, your fragrance will support you.
You will be prepared step by step for landing by Air Traffic Control via headset. It goes without saying that their instructions can be understood and executed by everyone immediately.

Tss, the passengers again. Typical hysteria. Urgent appointments marked in red on the calendar, special offers at Nordstrom and Sears, the crucial game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Seattle Seahawks.
But this rose-patch allows you to stay completely relaxed, excitement is for others.

So, quickly correct the altitude, you’ll handle the crosswinds with ease.
Oops, almost missed the angle, lucky you!

Well, doesn’t the musk vanilla your masterly calm?

Come on, where’s your pilot smile?
Up, up, the Ray Ban gives you the final heroic touch with the randomly available flight jacket!
For what Jonathan the seagull can do is child’s play for you.

Dreamy view, these mighty mountains and in between Salt Lake City with the somewhat hidden airport.

Ah, the runway in sight!
The lavender should now allow you clear visibility, gently now, my boy.
But who am I telling, you remain steadfast like the cedar!

Calculating the descent rate, downdrafts, weight of the aircraft, fuel load, speed, length of the runway, I beg you, one could dismiss that with the fragrance as a second-grade math problem.

“Runway clear, land at your discretion!”

Calm down, Hapax, you’ll manage the last meters. Don’t let the somewhat exaggerated horrified look of the purser with a twisted hand on his forehead and the repeated calling of the creator’s name along with interjections - in high C - from the chief stewardess disturb your calm.

Imagine the asphalt straight as a soft musk trampoline.

Oops, a bit bumpy on the touchdown, don’t forget the thrust reversers!

Well, well, well, where’s the braking power?
The end of the runway is getting closer!

If it weren’t for that vanilla powder, like foam on the runway.

And exactly three centimeters before catastrophe, you brought the plane to a stop!

Come on, now your line.
“I knew we could make it!”

But your personal hell ride is just beginning, because before the hysterically overjoyed crowd dares to make the saving jump over the emergency slides, they will personally thank you.
Each one hugs you, kisses your cheeks sore, and considers you their personal guardian angel.

Okay, you’ve earned the much-needed cruise on the Love Boat towards Fantasy Island.

But that’s another story…"

buon odore di verde fresco, erbaceo e di foresta. un odore verde intenso ma fresco, non dark, che per rendere l'idea potremmo dire che a tratti, ma solo vagamente, potrebbe ricordare anche una foresta vicino all'oceano(ma non ci sono note marine o salate)"
L'Eau par Kenzo Mirror Edition pour Femme,10/21/2023,Annenas,F,25,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Homesickness and Wanderlust,"In Forest Riot, my childhood in the Black Forest meets my favorite vacations in the Scandinavian winter. The scent is exactly what it says on the label: forest. A bit less riot than expected, actually more like softly whispering conifers with a breezy, rustling opening.
Whenever I wear it, my partner always grins around the corner and shouts ""Riotttt!""

Unfortunately, the loud green part only lasts a short while. After that, you get a very photorealistic needle-like skin scent that lasts about two hours. In wool clothing, it is absolutely stunningly beautiful.

I wear it whenever I want to escape the rainy life in Hamburg. And I interpret all the coniferous forests of the world into it.

And I think Forest Riot deserves a review. Because even though it is very fleeting, I find that for €40, it's okay for the (very pretty!) bottle, as it is the only forest scent that captures that very special blend of ethereal perfection and rough nature without any additional scratchy incense.

Plea concluded. I love it very much and the new bottle is already ordered."
L'Eau Kenzo Aquadisiac pour Homme,06/20/2012,Gold,F,726,,1,Low calorie rice-dish,"The fragrance opens with a burst of red apples, but I can also detect some sweet cherry-blossoms, very Japanse, so to speak - and very sweet and verrrry tender. When you think, ""Wow, what a lovely start - how is this gonna go on?"" you are soon breathing in the aroma of steamed thai-rice (not basmati-rice!) and after a couple of minutes, you are already led to the base which is not as soft as you might have expected. On the contrary, the base is harsh and I seem to detect some unpleasant screechy note in it. Thus this scent has a wonderful start, but a disappointing ending - and after 30 min you wonder where it's all gone - you are left with nearly nothing at all, just a faint whisper of some woody base commonly used in male fragrances.
I like my rice-dishes much spicier and more substantial. This ""Dolce Riso"" is not even suitable as a dessert,it's a cute little appetizer which leaves you with an empty stomach."

Sweet rice pudding with grated apple, refined with a hint of lemon and vanilla powdered sugar... and I rummage through the cupboard for diapers and a onesie. One should be appropriately dressed at the table.

The actor Karl Farkas once said to Zarah Leander when he saw her eye-catching and revealing dress:
""A hungry infant would go insane at this sight""
I think, had she also worn Dolce Riso, there would have been no stopping for a hungry infant. He would have jumped at her décolletage like Chucky the killer doll ;-)

Dolce Riso will make gourmand lovers happy who forgo Angel&Co. in favor of their fellow humans during the summer. Despite its sweetness and powderiness, Dolce Riso is unobtrusive and light, and can easily be worn on hot days.

L'Eau Kenzo Aquadisiac pour Homme,09/07/2010,Louce,F,138,,0,"There’s Rice, Baby!","Freshly soaked, white rice. Best when it’s called “fragrant rice.” This rich, substantial, carbohydrate-sweet scent with a pinch of salt that can have such immense clarity and fullness at the same time. Do you know it? I love it. When it comes to eating, I only like rice with flavor, so not plain (e.g., such a delicious Risotto Milanese with lots of saffron, cheese, and bone marrow or an Arabic rice with dates, spices, and nuts, or, or, or...),... but for smelling, I like it plain and white.
However, I was indeed skeptical about a fragrance called “Dolce Riso”... the “Dolce” made me suspect that it would be a version of milk rice scent (preferably with cinnamon sugar). I mentally heard the colorful little hunger shouting “done!” before I even sniffed it and was prepared for anything.
But no... Dolce Riso truly has that rice note that I love! Fantastic! And as a perfume... not the delicate kitchen scent from the pot, but a delicious, sense-activating scent on the skin.
Apicius writes that he can’t really imagine anything under the grain and rice note. Hmmm... I feel quite differently: I find it distinctly recognizable. Apicius... if you still have a milliliter of Dolce Riso, please inhale it deeply over your next cooked white rice for my (and/or Tivellon’s) sake and then compare it with the scent. We do agree very much on the “minimal apple.”
Just like Fran, this super charming lime captivates me at the beginning. I don’t smell the powderiness that strongly. The spices then lead the wonderful rice scent to vanilla, and there the supporting element develops (by the way, incredibly long-lasting for me). The vanilla bed gently and soothingly envelops the non-milky rice, allowing it to spread out and relax for a long time.

In doing so, Dolce Riso doesn’t become completely unsexy, as gourmand fragrances often do... OK, it’s not the boiling lava ecstasy scent... but at least it remains always appealing and tickles sensual associations of not just cozy physicality and warmth."

I haven't done so. Here, I somehow miss the oriental opulence of dessert. No honey, no cardamom, no cinnamon, no caramel. So not gourmand, rather gourmandchenlein, kids there is dessert!!!

Sunday dinner at grandma's or mom's, who has once again outdone herself with a homemade lemon cream.
That's my first impression: a beautiful, pastel yellow citrus cream, slightly sweet, but with a little twist of sour. Absolutely delicious!
I don't notice the rice in the slightest, not even in the slightest hint. And if there is an apple, it's a very green one, flirting with the lemon.

In the middle, a grain porridge flows, made of oats, a bit of barley flakes, maybe there are some rice flakes in there that I don't notice. Again, the fresh fruit is mixed in.
The rest is pudding. Yes, vanilla pudding, homemade, with a secret. It's not just sweet, it's an old family recipe where you don't quite know what all is mixed in.
I must add here that I HATE pudding! But Dolce Riso at least reconciles me with the scent.

This is already delicious, but at the moment it has a bit of a hard time against the formidable Bel Ami on the other arm, but why am I testing two such different scents simultaneously anyway."
L'Eau Kenzo Aquadisiac pour Homme,08/01/2010,Fran,F,253,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Delicate Spicy Pastel Powder,"A perfume that completely does without flowers. A delicate and buoyant gourmand scent, but very light and uncomplicated. Plus, this extraordinary sweet grain note. I like Dolce Riso.

The lime at the beginning comes through very clearly for me and does not disappear immediately. It takes away the apple-like quality from the apple. Therefore, Dolce Riso is not an apple scent for me. It is rather delicately fruity sweet and very lightly spicy. The pepper and the mugwort create a nice contrast to the more citrusy fruits in the opening.

What makes it so special for me is this delicious powderiness that instantly comes out of the bottle after spraying. Not dusty dry or cloying, but fluffy and lovely, as if a yellow-pastel powder cloud is always hovering a few millimeters above the skin. A successful combination of musk, tonka bean, and the rice note, I assume.

The vanilla in the base does not become very sweet for me. The scent develops rather in a very delicate bitter-herb direction. The pepper note lingers for a long time and ensures that Dolce Riso does not end in a boring vanilla sweetness, but remains deliciously dry.

The longevity could be better, but the scent is truly special; I know nothing comparable."
L'Eau Kenzo Aquadisiac pour Homme,01/19/2013,MissPiggy,F,57,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Economic Miracle Dessert and Soul Food Scent for Sweet Tooth Lovers,"Let’s continue with the experimental series Calé, and here is another hit. For me and my nose, for my sentimentality, my childhood memories. Those that gain in value with the passing decades, and possibly also in idealization. So be it.

Dolce Riso - the sweet rice.
I confess here that I am a dyed-in-the-wool rice pudding fanatic. Soul food extraordinaire is lukewarm or cold rice pudding, for me THE comfort food.
And if it should be particularly good: Reis Trautmannsdorf. One of the trendy desserts of the 50s and 60s, when Toast Hawaii was also top class among warm snacks.

It is a vanilla rice pudding, into which whipped cream is folded with a bit of gelatin.
It is flavored with maraschino. There is thickened sour cherry compote with port wine in it, or again maraschino. Oh my goodness, I feel a twitching desire to RUN into the kitchen and start cooking - but I have neither maraschino nor cherries on hand.

This sweet craving is also triggered by “Dolce Riso” - without the cooking compulsion.
Finest sweet, fruity-creamy, and mildly juicy scents open up. For me, it’s an immediate feel-good moment, a scent I would love to spray on myself right after a bath or shower.
Even though the same components nominally form the top note here as in “Assolo,” there is a juiciness and creaminess that thankfully differs significantly from Assolo.

Grains and rice emerge in the middle phase, the tastiest rice pudding, still lukewarm, vanilla-scented, lightly sweetened. Powdery, but not dusty. Sweet, but not “squeaky.”
Tonka bean and vanilla make their presence known, but are still overshadowed by the grain notes. Fresh white bread, little rolls, and the school breakfast standard of early years: porridge, nicely cooked, and then poured over with cold milk. Or quite lavishly: with liquid cream.
This is how Dolce Riso smells - gentle, familiar, nourishing. Comforting, mild, and enveloping. Close to the skin with a tiny sillage that hardly stands out (Who smells like rice pudding?) Not a baby scent, not a powder scent, but a fine, subtle skin caresser in the tradition of “Sensi,” perhaps. By the end of the day, a delicate scent remains on the skin, announcing vanilla, the listed musk is not the seducer, but the storyteller of soothing tales.
Another one for my list, I want to own it to occasionally indulge in a calorie-free Reis Trautmannsdorf or to add a generous splash of “softness” and “cuddling” to my cashmere sweater."
L'Eau Kenzo Aquadisiac pour Homme,09/30/2010,Revolution,F,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,satiated!,"A hint of soft citrus freshness and then - swelling, sweet, heavy… Actually, I don’t like ""sweet"" - and I mean not at all!
And on me, the rice initially spreads out clearly sweet and full, almost a bit sticky.

But here it doesn’t bother me - on the contrary, I feel warm and for this moment, everything is good. I am satiated. I am satiated! Satisfied. Complete.

This has nothing to do with capricious sweet floral notes. Nothing here lures with anything affirmatively-sensual and secretive until the end. Nothing screams: ""Hello, I am here"", ""look at me"", ""I want you to want me""… and ""finally tell me that I exist!"" Here there is no lack from which desire grows. No, here the moment of ""being-with-oneself"" arises, after which approaching others loses its compulsion - freedom means.

After the carbohydrate-rich sweetness that stops where it usually becomes uncomfortable for me, that becomes dull, warm, and enveloping, then comes the spice. The white pepper that tames the vanilla, the nuttiness of the tonka bean. As if the rice were cooked over an open fire and as if it were enough for the entire village.

After hours (and I mean many hours), the musk lingers very faintly, like the body imprint on the sheet after deep sleep.

… and it is by no means unsexy to be satiated, well-rested, warm.

It's more of a woody fragrance with a harsh, aftershave-like undertone. Powdery notes are present, but they don't save the scent. I think the mugwort could have been left out. It likely contributes to this harsh note, which unfortunately lingers in the later scent aura and wafts around your nose.

I hoped to catch the desired rice pudding note (I loooove rice pudding!), but: nothing. Instead, I found something heavy, floral (?), that barely brushed against the headache threshold. Was that all there was? Right after that, the lime sneaked in and kept the ""flowers"" wonderfully in check. I literally breathed a sigh of relief!

So, a citrus scent? No, it changed completely again. I somehow missed the heart note, but what remained was a cotton-soft, delicate-powdery, slightly sweet vanilla cloud that completely enveloped me and - in contrast to my loud ""Vanitas"" - remained very subtle.

I couldn't detect apple, mugwort, or pepper in this 1st test, nor do I explicitly perceive rice and grains. Overall, a lovely feel-good scent.

Edit 1: After the 2nd test, my enthusiasm has waned a bit - I now have the ""counterpart,"" namely Lann-Ael on the other arm, and in direct comparison, Lann-Ael IS AMAZING! Pure vanilla crescent, simply sweet, powdery, soft - in comparison, Dolce Riso unfortunately falls short for me in fascination. But I will continue to test!

Heavy hitting fragrances can become tiring after awhile, and that's when a scent such as this one is highly appreciated. Clean Ultimate has unisex tendencies, with the dominant lavender accord giving this composition a slightly masculine edge.

Lavender has many soothing properties, so it's easy to feel comforted by wearing Clean Ultimate. It's casual, clean and smooth. I find it inoffensive and versatile enough to be worn all year long.

Some may complain about the linear composition, but for something so soapy and delicate, I don't know why you'd want it any other way. I personally believe that the simplicity works a treat.

I do happen to adore the scent of lavender and musk, so Clean Ultimate suits me to a tee. The only disappointing factor, was its lack of lasting strength. It lasted a meagre two hours on my skin.

I'm giving it the thumbs up despite the longevity issue, and I whole-heartedly recommend it, especially if you enjoy the somewhat unique Clean Warm Cotton as well.

Delicate, ethereal, and infinitely feminine, Ultimate truly lives up to its name. For me, the focus of this fragrance is clearly on the lily of the valley, but a very gentle, fragile lily of the valley that is carefully embraced by rose and jasmine. The citrus notes are only subtly perceptible; however, throughout the entire fragrance journey, a wonderfully sweet musk resonates, which never makes the scent powdery and does not take away from its lightness.

Ultimate is in a way simple, but by no means simplistic, if you understand what I mean. Instead, it is a harmonious, wonderfully balanced fragrance composition that is both refreshing and grounding, providing both lightness and protection. A truly wonderful summer scent, albeit with limited longevity and sillage.

L'Eau par Kenzo Love L'Eau pour Homme,12/01/2024,Chado02,M,1,,3,Kyoto in a Bottle,"White Hinoki is a truly successful fragrance that is excellent for everyday wear. The opening is fresh and citrusy, making it immediately pleasant to wear, even on warmer days or in the office. After about 2-3 hours, a sweet-woody note unfolds, which gains a special depth from a subtle whiskey accent.

I specifically searched for a fragrance that captures the sweet-smoky wood character of the Japanese cypress. This fascinated me back in Kyoto, and White Hinoki comes very close to that in the base note. Of course, it’s not a 1:1 match with the scent I experienced there - especially due to the fresh start - but that’s exactly what makes it more suitable for daily wear, as it never becomes too heavy or too sweet.

The longevity is impressive: the fragrance easily lasts 10 hours on the skin and develops beautifully over time. The projection is moderate at first and becomes more subtle later, making it versatile for use, whether for work, leisure, or a relaxed evening.

The bottle is also worth mentioning. The simple, white design looks modern and elegant. Additionally, it feels pleasantly heavy in the hand due to its weight and high-quality craftsmanship - a detail that further emphasizes the value of the perfume.

Overall, it’s a not overly complex fragrance with strong performance at a fair price. The individual notes are all easily perceivable. For some, the fresh accent at the beginning may seem off-putting. However, the woody note comes through with time and then dominates. Especially if you’re looking for an authentic Hinoki vibe, you should definitely try White Hinoki. Clear recommendation!"

I haven't heard or seen anything about this Lancome perfume until now...

~ Bottle ~
What stands out is the exceptionally curved shape. The gradient from a warm orange to a cool blue evokes summery associations. The name ""Calypso"" reminds me of a popsicle (Calippo), further enhancing the summer feeling.

~ Scent ~
Sour bergamot flashes briefly upon spraying, but then gives way to ripe, sweet pears, plums, and a bit of pepper that tingles lightly in the nose. After a short time, floral accords in the form of roses, lily of the valley, jasmine, and slightly more robust freesias join in, preventing the scent from becoming too sweet. Delicious raspberries and vanilla form the base note with a hint of patchouli.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 4-5 hours (a bit longer on hair and clothing).

~ Occasion ~
A pleasant spring and summer perfume for the warmer days of the year.

~ Conclusion ~
I wouldn't have thought this perfume was from Lancome. It's very fruity (pears) and floral (roses), which I don't typically associate with this brand - but I like it :)"
L'Eau Kenzo Glacée pour Femme,10/25/2011,Chanelle,F,752,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Delicious Pear,"It’s possible!
After recently having constant involuntary encounters with pears while testing fragrances from Marc Jacobs, I was on the lookout for a Williams Christ pear scent that I would finally like. And voila - here it is.
Calypso has slipped by me unnoticed until now; apparently, it is no longer available in stores, so it was a great coincidence that I came across a sample of it. (What the name Lollipop is all about, however, escapes me, especially since I thought the divine Miss Carey had claimed that name for herself...)
Calypso starts with a fresh-fruity (who would have thought?) note, with pepper adding the necessary kick.
The heart note is fantastically deliciously pear-like, and not too sweet. Also not too artificial. More freesia-pear-like. But still primarily pear. I unfortunately don’t know where the plum and all the supposed flowers are hanging out, but I don’t really care.
The base is quite nice and wearable with a hint of patchouli and barely noticeable vanilla, even if it doesn’t quite fit the pear impression overall, like with Liberté by Cacharel, where the base also doesn’t fit, otherwise I would like it better.
Overall, a lovely summer scent, not too far from Escadas, but more refined and less sweet."

Splashes, in my amateur opinion, make sense to last no more than an hour and should more or less fade by the time I arrive to my destination, if I am to go out after applying.

One 100ml bottle lasts, on average, 18 months for me. So the value is top-notch. After the morning rituals with Proraso shaving soap or Taylor of Old Bond St. shaving cream, as cliché as it sounds, I really feel at my best slapping some of this classic juice on the face and neck."
L'Eau par Kenzo pour Homme,01/12/2020,Pannacotta,M,4,,9,Healing Ice Breath,"A little more than just eucalyptus and menthol is probably in Proraso ""Linea Verde"" - but it’s really a shame that it evaporates so quickly. The scent lasts hardly longer than the cooling effect of the menthol. However, the healing ice breath of the menthol is indeed the strength of this aftershave. It soothes irritated skin, almost numbing it like an ice spray for sports injuries. It works, it alleviates, it cares for and refreshes - and it doesn’t sting at all, even when you spray the aftershave directly into the opened pores with the atomizer of the large 500ml bottle.

I occasionally consider adding some classic aftershave from men’s grooming to my fragrance arsenal - a Floïd or a Pitralon or one of the many Bay Rum-laurel variants. And then I end up not doing it: Proraso LV simply works too well, by the way, regardless of the season. And since I only shave every three days, the 500ml bottle with the atomizer has now lasted into its fourth year; however, this year a replacement is due."
L'Eau par Kenzo pour Homme,07/23/2017,Bernado77,M,74,,5,"Refreshing, effective, smells good.","Certainly beyond the Alps, one of the best-selling aftershaves and there is a reason for that, I know only a few aftershaves that leave a similarly good and fresh feeling on the skin! Proraso is a top aftershave and still a secret tip, at least in Germany and Austria! I would describe the scent as aquatic with a hint of eucalyptus, surely there are finer waters out there but the skin feel after shaving with this product is top!"
L'Eau par Kenzo pour Homme,01/09/2018,AlfaRomeo,M,2,,2,Longevity is the big downside...,"One expects not only a fragrance from an aftershave but also skin care. This little water does indeed provide some good care and has certainly earned many fans because of this property.

It also smells good. Endless eucalyptus, menthol, which you can feel through its cooling effect. The latter is even so intense that I wash my hands after using it to prevent accidentally touching my eyes.

Now for the big downside: After just about an hour, the scent is gone. And other aftershaves can definitely do better."
L'Eau par Kenzo pour Homme,01/26/2025,Floma,M,6,,5,Men's Thing,"I have dark, thick facial hair. The dream of all beard wearers. The only problem is, I don’t wear a beard. Aside from a goatee during my teenage years, it was never my thing. If I didn’t shave in the morning, by noon I would have a three-day stubble, and by the next morning, my razor would be put to the test. That’s why I’ve had 365 shaving days a year for over 20..."
L'Eau par Kenzo pour Homme,01/21/2025,Ursus,M,18,,2,The Green Thread,"Always a pleasure. Even after years, I enjoy my wet shave
again and again. The entire green line was, is, and will remain wonderful.
Forget the overpriced, snobbish brands (I'm talking about RS & RC now) buy yourself the tube for little money and this lovely, cheap, simple splash. You can really feel how it works on the skin. Since the scent fades after about 1 hour, wearing EDT is no problem. So guys, that's it"
