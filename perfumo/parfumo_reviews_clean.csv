Skin [Reserve Blend],08/31/2024,Myrtillajus,F,530,,3,Wonderful Gourmand,"The Baklava sweet has uncertain origins. The fact is that it is an ancient sweet, claimed by many peoples, each with their own variant.
A dessert that has honey as its main element, in addition to dried fruit.
In Aurum you will feel one of the most real representations of honey there is, honey in honeycomb, made gourmand by dried fruit and a light touch of praline on the base.
It really feels like eating a Baklava, a dessert I love so much.
Realistic, deep, I am not a gourmand lover, but I really liked this fragrance.
Ideal for the cooler seasons.

Skin [Reserve Blend],02/12/2024,Landshark321,M,746,,4,Outstanding honey / baklava scent,"Zaharoff Signature Aurum is the second-to-most recent release of the house, a captivating honey-rich scent that captures the baklava dish with lots of nuance, including notes of honeycomb, cinnamon, mixed nuts, vanilla, and tonka. It’s sweet and rich while not being overly sweet, with a vaguely floral brightness that makes it feel more honeyed that perhaps a baked good, at least to me, and a lot more wearable for those that find gourmands challenging or overbearing. This is a great answer for those, and takes for the form of a unisex fragrance that has great density without being at all overdone in any one aspect, its balance demonstrating the care and patience that went into it. I guess it’s the first gourmand of the Signature line, but I hope it’s not the last, as it’s yet another outstanding expansion of the line into new territory, a further challenge met and exceeded against. I really love this creation, definitely among my favorite honey scents with Zoologist Bee and Hiram Green Slowdive, albeit not as syrupy as Bee and not as spicy as Slowdive, nor as floral as either, fitting for a gourmand. To my nose, it does not evolve a ton, a little sharper at first spray and a little smoother and creamier in the dry down, but that’s to be expected, frankly.

The line’s pricing remains very reasonable for a high-quality, high-performance product, especially at the greater size, at $195/155 for 120/60ml, sold through the house website exclusively in the US, I believe.

Sel Santal,05/16/2012,Abitvintage,F,28,,0,Beautiful spring scent.,"I find this fragrance interesting in that in the very beginning as the scent hits my skin I can barely detect it at all. It develops though, into a wonderfully pure floral where I definitely smell lilac, and the lilac seems to be a dominant note for a while. Lilacs are probably my most favorite spring flower so this is a bonus! It transforms into what my mind envisions, a white bouquet, with a good abundance of dainty little lily of the valley interspersed throughout, (I happen to grow Lily of the Valley in the depths of the cool shade, and their smell is amazing). Elle 25 is not heady or headachy, but a pure uncomplicated scent that smells to me like the cool, crisp spring air that carries the scent of new fresh blossoms. A beautiful change of pace for me and very, very enjoyable."
Sel Santal,01/10/2012,Sophi,F,50,,0,Floral Bouquet,"This is a nice floral bouquet under toned by notes of cedar and musk.
It's so simple but yet so wonderful.I can't separate the floral notes because they are blended all together without one being stronger from the other.
It opens and stays with the floral notes from the beginning to the end.It's not heady or loud but intimate and you feel its sensation.Inoffensive and feminine ,wearable to all occasion and seasons."
Citron Fig,07/19/2024,Raluko111,F,418,,1,Flower shop vibes.,"Essence Rare opens with a green, vegetal smell of freshly cut, wet flower stems, as if you are inside a flower shop. In the background the flowers start to appear on the stage, jasmine, roses, and lilies of the valley. The evolution is pretty linear, a little boring and unpleasant for me, as the lily of the valleys with the oakmoss beginning to take center and dominate. If you like lily of the valley, you might enjoy this. It's just a note that I don't particularly care for.

Essence Rare se deschide cu un miros verde-vegetal de tulpini de flori ude, proaspăt tăiate, ca și cum ai intrat într-o florărie. Pe fundal, apar și florile, iasomia, trandafirii, și lăcrimioarele. Evoluția este foarte liniară, cam plictisitoare și neplăcută pentru că lăcrimioarele încep să domine împreună cu lichenul. Dacă îți plac lăcrimioarele, poate că o să te încânte.

Citron Fig,01/12/2020,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,,18,Habit Rouge for Ladies?,"Hello, you sniffers, and good evening :)
Tonight, I’m introducing a new, old fragrance. Huh, how can that be, you might be asking?! Well, the fragrance Essence Rare is already a classic, first released in 1928, reissued in 1976, and finally revised and re-released in 2018. I know that many of you think that reformulated fragrances always lose quality. That may indeed be true, but I can’t say much about it yet, as I haven’t experienced fragrances over multiple generations, since I’m not as old as all of you (… so much for my New Year’s resolution to be a bit nicer to you ladies here… :DD), but I also think that not all reformulations have to be bad.

Anyway, it seems that the perfumer of this fragrance doesn’t mind reformulations either, especially when given the honor of re-composing a classic fragrance. It’s then about combining tried-and-true elements from the past with something new, at least according to the perfumer.

Well, since I don’t know the 1976 fragrance and especially the 1928 fragrance of this one, as I said, I’m not nearly as old as you (… I really should, REALLY stop referring to you ladies as older… :DD), I can’t write a comparison test, but as always, I’ll share my opinion on this fragrance and try to describe it as accurately as possible :)

The Fragrance:
The fragrance actually starts with quite classic notes, or it smells like a classic French fragrance. At first sniff, it reminds me a lot of Guerlain’s wonderful Habit Rouge, only a bit more floral and feminine. You can smell lily of the valley and jasmine, as well as a creamy-powdery note that could come from notes like violet or even more so, iris. A hint of the stated mandarin is also present, but you have to sniff very closely to detect it. When you sniff directly at the sprayed spot, you can briefly perceive a mandarin, or better said, a mandarin peel, as it comes off slightly bitter.
The classic impression of the fragrance remains later on, which is not surprising due to notes like oak moss. Additionally, the fragrance also appears slightly soapy or clean.
Towards the end, the fragrance continues to smell classic with oak moss and remains creamy-soft due to powdery notes. Of course, the fragrance is also beautifully floral. And this is exactly the kind of floral notes that I like in a ladies' fragrance, as they don’t smell cloying or stuffy, but simply come across as beautifully feminine. I still lean towards lily of the valley and jasmine, although the roses are now also more noticeable. Along with the floral sweetness, there’s another sweetness from the vanilla. Overall, a truly lovely fragrance.

The Sillage and Longevity:
Although the fragrance seems soft, it has a strong sillage, so it can be perceived from a distance for a while. It’s pleasant to smell without being overwhelming. The longevity is also very good, as you can still smell the fragrance well on the skin after ten hours.

The Bottle:
The bottle is round and plump, with thick lines running around the glass that look like veins and seem to divide the glass into many separate chambers. On the front, one of these “chambers” is gilded and represents the label. The neck of the bottle is pink, and a cap designed similarly to the bottle sits on top, only this one is hemispherical and transparent. A very beautiful bottle.

Conclusion:
So, this fragrance really has something about it that is very appealing. I’m not always a fan of old-fashioned fragrances, but there are quite a few that I really, really like, such as Habit Rouge by Guerlain, which I can even wear at my over 30, 32, 34 (… let’s stop here, shall we? :D) years. You see, you’re not the only ones who have gotten much older… I’m just probably a tad younger than all of you, mu ha ha ha. Alright, alright, don’t come at me with pitchforks. Maybe it helps if I say that you ladies can still look absolutely stunning even at an older age?! Well, is there peace again now? :D

Anyway, although I don’t know the previous Essence Rare fragrances by Houbigant, I find this one simply very successful and therefore highly recommendable. It may not be a fragrance for younger people or for those who don’t like that classic touch, but I think it smells very good. It comes across as very elegant, has a slightly soapy-clean component, and just smells nice.

It’s an all-rounder, so in my opinion, it’s a fragrance for every season (except maybe very hot summer days) and can be worn subtly both during the day and especially for the evening and going out. Definitely give it a try sometime; it could be worth it!

That brings me to the end. Please excuse my age jokes (hey, I still find you all very sexy… uh, I meant I love you all :DD) and have a great evening, until next time :)"
Citron Fig,03/09/2019,Seerose,F,775,,0,She Wouldn't Have Liked It,"Over the past decades, I have had to attend so many funerals and memorial services. In doing so, I experienced the most absurd scenes, involuntarily comical and bordering on cabaret-like expressions and actions from mourners, even from those most closely affected.
Not to mention the speeches and life lies presented by the speakers.
As well as boundless grief, behind which not infrequently other sorrows and foreign mourning were unleashed. Funerals where an ""Ave Maria"" was spoken up to 100 times by a female voice over loudspeakers, while the mourners melted away in the sun and heat in black clothing.
Until I landed in Parfumo, the scent of half-wilting or strongly fragrant flowers like lilies and other blooms often played a breathtaking role for me, quite literally. Since then, I have scented myself for such occasions in a way that I can perceive myself and push the others aside.
Because I have experienced and observed so much absurdity at funerals and memorial services, I have considered several times whether I should write a collection of funeral stories. Alone: The new engagement with scents has kept me from doing so.
This would thus be the first published short story about the memorial service I experienced today, where a perfume, namely ""Essence Rare,"" at least played a role for me.
My friend Hildegard did not pass away unexpectedly, but peacefully at the age of 95.
My friend Hildegard had, until the end, bright gold-red dyed hair and always wore black clothing, as she said. And she loved perfume, preferably Jovan Musk Oil and woody scents. So I also dressed entirely in black, even though I did not belong to the close circle of mourners, in her memory. And now the perfume?
I didn't think long: ""Essence Rare""! And after spraying and letting it develop, I immediately thought: That was the wrong choice.
This scent would have never pleased Hildegard. And she would have made that clear to me without beating around the bush, I thought amused.
I had only tested it on my wrists and clearly perceived it as a scent with finely balanced beautiful and subtle white flowers. Immediately, I also smelled and had the scent of dry-powdery iris, which is not listed. - Later, ""Essence Rare"" becomes creamy. Despite the latent opulence, it is a delicate scent. ""Essence Rare"" is, typical of Elléna, an almost minimalist, in a special way dry-sober scent, created this time with white flowers. There is no long progression; within a few minutes, the scent settles, becoming only more delicate, the initially pronounced indole of the white flowers recedes.
But today I also sprayed on my décolletage, and now I smelled ""lilies"" as the main flower.
My husband, meanwhile, thought I smelled very elegant. He likes such scents.
And he also said that I only smelled very subtly and finely.
I could and did not want to change that anymore. In the church, it would not be warm; who knows if anyone else would even notice. And after all, I primarily scented myself for myself.
The church, meanwhile, was not decorated with any typical, strongly scented, and huge floral arrangements. Hildegard loved tulips and cyclamen. She loved the simplicity of the archaic block of stone altar from the Middle Ages with the mysterious five consecration crosses. This stands in contrast to the opulent baldachin and the pyramid pulpit from the Baroque.
When Hildegard and I prepared this altar for services, we looked at the ancient stone slab with the crosses in reverence. I felt ""Shekina"" was there. We never spoke about what we felt and thought about it; we remained silent.
So her place with the urn was only decorated with a cream-white organza cloth, surrounded only by a few upright giant grasses, nothing else. On the altar stood white tulips.
So I sat there, smelling my scent and thought: Oh, now I am contributing just a little bit to the ambiance (Italian: smell, scent, environment) that otherwise prevails at funerals in small churches and mourning halls.
It was a sober and quiet memorial service; not much was said, I smelled ""Essence Rare,"" and I liked it more and more. I remembered that Hildegard was the first person we encountered here in this church.
What coincidences and events made us friends with an immediate understanding. How I often helped her as she became smaller and weaker.
No, ""Essence Rare"" will not become for me the funeral and mourning service scent.
It is also not a scent for other ""great events."" ""Essence Rare,"" so my conclusion, is a sober-quiet yet intimate scent. A scent for contemplative hours, to find peace.
It may be that ""Essence Rare,"" through this farewell, radiates a latent melancholy for me despite the brightness. Perhaps also because the always light indolic hint suggests passing, transience, and decay.
""A Dio, ci verdiamo in paradiso, Hildegard"""
Citron Fig,01/26/2019,Candila,F,27,,21,Multifaceted Cream Flower Scent,"Sleeping flowers, this image goes through my mind with every spray.
“Essence Rare” starts off so calmly, expressing such profound silence and tranquility that I almost want to switch into meditation mode myself.
In the opening, a whisper-thin, mild “chalky” iris powder is sprinkled over fresh and initially only moderately sweet flowers. Not the powdery impression I usually smell in powdery scents, no sugary sweetness and nothing lively “powdery,” but a dry, powdery white layer over still resting flower heads.
Nevertheless, nothing here feels tired or dull; beneath the powdery layer, you can sense the life and energy of the flowers, just waiting for the sunrise to rise up and bloom in all colors.

And that happens within the first hour. Lily of the valley, rose, and jasmine bloom harmoniously next to each other, spreading their enchanting fragrance. A mild citrus breeze from fresh, partly ripe and juicy, partly still green, aromatic mandarins occasionally drifts through the composition, keeping the warm flowers fresh.
As the wearing time increases, the iris develops a subtle lipstick creaminess alongside its powdery facet, making the powder feel a bit more viscous and delicately creamy.

After at most an hour, I finally wear a substantial, airy-creamy, and sunny bouquet of flowers. I stand on a late spring day in front of a flower bed in the garden and breathe in the scent of countless colorful blooms.
It is important for me to emphasize that these are garden flowers growing and blooming in fresh summer air, not cut flowers in a vase. The typically green-stemmed accompanying notes that I smell when entering a flower shop (and in some floral scents) are absent here.

Overall, a clean-floral, sunny, and colorful bouquet of flowers that slowly settles on a fine bed of sandalwood and a few micrograms of vanilla powder. A mix of cream powder, iris powder, and chypre-like fresh elements accompanying the friendly radiant floral symphony that dominates everything from start to finish.

“Essence Rare” feels calm and elegant … and grown-up. So far removed from some garish, loud, flashy girly floral scents, as a fragrance can be.
It is not a “typical,” minimalist Jean-Claude Ellena. I have the impression that he has returned to his roots here, as he created classics like “First” for Van Cleef&Arpels and fragrances for Sisley in the 1970s. This scent is for me classic perfume art. An elegant fragrance that, in contrast to his “First,” does not feel overloaded with flowers, but despite the sea of blooms comes across as carefree and fairy-like light.

To make the scent comparable: The floral mix itself has a striking resemblance to “Jardins de Bagatelle” by Guerlain for my nose, but here it feels fresher and thus “more modern.”
What makes ""Essence Rare"" special for me is the accompaniment of different facets of iris, from white-mealy to lipstick-creamy, which sometimes envelop the bouquet in fine gauze and sometimes gently underlay it with creaminess."
Blonde Rose,04/23/2015,Hofnärrin,F,52,,3,And the golden raspberry goes to....,"The raspberry has bright white teeth and smiles at me challengingly. Overall, she is very dressed up and presents herself as peppery-youthful. When I ask if I might speak to the oud, her smile widens, but nothing happens. I secretly sigh. I have never faced such a vain raspberry before. The fact that she tries to mask her vanity with a deliberately simple vanilla-colored outfit only makes things worse. I decide to wait. Time will tell, oud will come. Or am I mistaken? In any case, a hint of unrefined oud would do this berry good. After about 4 hours, I get fed up and make my exit. She waves goodbye with a vanilla-colored handkerchief, which, I must admit, emits a rather pleasant scent.

Postscript: In the middle of the night, the phone rings. It’s the Not-So-Bad Vanilla. She hurriedly whispers to me that the oud has finally appeared, but must leave again right away; if I hurry, I might have a chance... I growl and hang up. The next morning, I have no idea whether the call was real or just a silly dream. I lean towards the latter. Or has anyone else been called by a vanilla in the middle of the night?"
Blonde Rose,04/15/2015,GreatKate,F,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Déjà-vu,"I fell in love with this fragrance from the very first moment, even though I am not a fan of oud.
Right after the first spray, I am transported back to my childhood; I smell wonderfully ripe, juicy, and zesty berries, raspberries, and strawberries, just like in my parents' garden when I picked them fresh and ripe myself, and of course, more ended up in my mouth than in the bowl. Hmmm, it smells so delicious, and I am 7 years old again, when the world was carefree and unburdened. And that's exactly how it continues after the top note.
The heart note, or rather the base note, doesn't take long to appear; after a short time, I perceive a warm, protective, soothing balsamic scent. It must be the oud and musk, as the vanilla plays only a minor role here. This is the first oud I like, because it is not sweaty and dirty, but soft, protectively warm. You really feel secure and carefree. Nevertheless, it remains light and unburdened; it doesn't overwhelm you but gives you your own space.
For me, a fragrance for small Déjà-vu moments of childlike carefreeness and security. And for anyone who usually doesn't like oud."
Pure Soap,01/20/2023,Mlleghoul,F,458,,1,A secret recipe for black tea flavored fudge,"What an incredibly weird and wonderful fragrance! This is a thick, rich, gooey tea-flavored fudge spiked with citrus and which reveals some evocative earthy elements that emerge as it dries. It’s as if a pot of strong tea was boiled down with a teacup full of brown sugar, a goodly glug of molasses, and slivers of bright yellow lemon peel, and then the mixture was stirred together with an entire box of sweet, nutty, whole wheat graham crackers crumbs and left on a counter to cool and set overnight. Fast forward about twenty years, and rather than the treat itself, this fragrance smells of its dusty, stained magazine clipping recipe card and which was secretly buried in the back garden by your eccentric relative because they didn’t want anyone to have their recipe after they died. This is why we dig it up and make the hell out of it and shout the recipe from the rooftops– because we don’t believe in gatekeeping the good stuff."
Cool Cotton,10/25/2024,Vibrantgirl,F,66,,4,"Pretty, fruity, earthy","I sampled this not expecting to be wowed… MJ isn’t my fave house. But holy cow… I love it. It’s got the balance of sweetness at top and woodiness in the base that I enjoy in Daisy Love but with more fruity zing. Banana flower is a new note for me, and I really enjoy it here. Sandalwood and vetiver in the base remind me of grass in a really fresh way.
I think the Daisy line are all generally inoffensive, sweet, pretty… and this one is actually a standout!

ETA: came back to say I smell this strongly for the first hour, then I go noseblind to it and get a ton of compliments. lol Around hour 5 I start smelling it on myself again, but more intimate projection. A big spring love"
Cool Cotton,04/23/2025,Milichka,F,4,,3,"A Little Sour, Zesty, Breezy, Unforgettable!","I have a lot of perfumes, but this one definitely makes the top 5. What I love most is that little sour twist it gives the scent such a fun, lively kick! It’s fresh, green, and just the right amount of tart to keep things interesting. It reminds me of picking wildflowers on a sunny summer morning, right after the rain, when everything smells clean, green, and a little bit tangy from the damp earth and crisp air. There’s also a playful edge to it, like biting into a green apple or sipping on sparkling lemonade in a garden.
I usually wear it in the summer when its bright, green vibe really comes alive. It lasts around 7 hours on my skin, and the sillage? So good. I always get compliments when I wear it—it leaves a fresh, happy trail that gets noticed in the best way!"
Cool Cotton,04/21/2025,Ursaw,F,166,,1,80s city pop flavored chewing gum,"Synthetic, playful, adorable. Banana-flavored chewing gum; rubbery smell of a bouncy castle; entrance to the beach level in Sonic Adventure DX – with low poly women in swimsuits and incredibly blue water in the pool that somehow feels more real than the real thing.

Artificial banana part took about ~2 hours to evaporate. And perhaps that's nostalgia's fault – but I loved every moment it lasted. Jasmine, while visible, never took centerstage, and faded away soon after.

I was left with what I can only describe as ""sweet sneakers"" scent. It's like your regular clean sneakers, but with powdered sugar on top. Not unpleasant, but not something I'm looking for in a perfume either. My partner said that I smelled ""like freshly washed feet after a long day of walking"", so take that as you will. That scent took ~1,5 hours to settle close to the skin, and in another ~3,5 hours it was gone.

I don't think I'll ever wear it again, but I will remember those first 2 hours fondly."
Cool Cotton,02/23/2025,lucekingg,F,157,,2,Sunscreen (Derogatory),I really wanted to like this because I bought a miniature set from Sephora with this and the original Daisy EAU DE TOILETTE and it smelled intriguing in the bottle. On my skin the banana came out in a way that I didn't like. I don't like bananas or banana flavored things and I am SUPER picky about them in fragrance. I tend to dislike them in my perfumes; there are a VERY few exceptions and this is not one of them. This smells like sunscreen and not the kind of sunscreen that smells good. The set was only $21 and there's a mini Daisy so I'm excited about that so I'm not too torn up about this but I am sad that I didn't like it :(
Cool Cotton,01/27/2025,Kishmish,F,25,,2,not a stand out but wearable,"Marc Jacobs as a fragrance brand never stood out to me - moderately priced, pleasant enough without pushing the limit, with eye-catching bottles that draw me. But as beautiful as Marc Jacobs' bottles always are - Daisy Wild being in my favorite colors, no less - the fragrances miss the mark. I'm a fruity floral lover, there's no denying that, and most lighter, fresher, designer fragrances are nice enough that I wouldn't be holding back negative emotion if someone handed me a bottle as a gift, but I probably wouldn't spend my hard earned cash on them, either. Daisy Wild is in that same boat - fresh, sweet, with a hint of fruitiness, the perfect amount of sillage and depth for everyday, and won't create a sneezefest on the subway/metro/T/tram/bus etc. I enjoyed wearing it and would definitely use the heck out of a bottle, since this is basically gone by hour six, but it's not unique. From the middle to end of wear time is really where the fruity tropical smells come out, and the base is soft, sweet, and subtle. Reminds me a lot of the effect of Donna Born in Roma Coral Fantasy, but I enjoy that one a bit more."
Cool Cotton,03/23/2024,HWatling,F,5,,1,Beautiful inside and out.,"I was testing some new releases at Ulta and I decided to smell this one of course. I do love many of the scents in the Marc Jacobs line. I knew I would invest in this one at some point in time for nothing more then the bottle, which is their most creative and lovely presentation yet. I sprayed it on my skin and clothes. Wow! I’m in love It is a floral, which is..."
Cool Cotton,09/06/2025,Ladymarie,F,50,,1,Sweet and tangy,"It’s sweet, it’s fresh, citrusy and a little tangy, it’s a nice light floral blend. The silage is moderate. The longevity for me seems to be 8 plus hours. I enjoyed wearing it but the crispness of it reminds me of Dolce and Gabbana light blue which is also lovely. I feel like it does tend to maybe lean a little too sweet, but not too much that it’s sickening."
Cool Cotton,04/10/2025,hmrls,F,22,,1,meh and mainstream,"The original Daisy was my signature scent when I was a teen so when I got a sample of this I hoped that it’d be the same soft, fresh, floral scent, but greener.
Unfortunately, this one has such a basic mainstream DNA.
I mean, it’s nice, but it’s just a generic scent.

Good for a younger audience with not a lot of knowledge of perfumes"
Cool Cotton,08/03/2024,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,Get out of my heart...,"... and seek joy, in this beautiful summer time. .. This song goes through my mind as I wandered through the perfume department of Karstadt, where the various summer scents were beautifully displayed. My eyes naturally lingered on the lovely Daisies by Marc Jacobs, which bloomed colorfully at me. I not only like the scents, but the beautiful floral bottles also appeal to me...."
Cool Cotton,07/28/2024,Sequoia,F,137,,5,Short Trip to the Greenhouse,"With a dip into the sample pot, ""Daisy Wild"" has earned its ticket for vacation with me. And it has proven to be wearable, even though it doesn't completely fit my usual preferences: Right after spraying, this fragrance feels exotic-floral, fresh, and a bit sweet. Unfortunately, the combination comes across as artificial. ""Daisy Wild"" doesn't impose itself, remaining..."
Cool Cotton,06/19/2024,Spektrum,F,113,,5,Wilder than expected Jasmine scent,"Colorful plastic flowers as a cap, I was skeptical during the test... But the jasmine works well for me, pushing all thoughts of dull, chaste daisies to the back. It has a green note plus a hint of clean sweat. And then something that reminds me of the smell of a cat's paws. The floral-fresh jasmine and a bit of rainwater aquatic keep everything on the clean side; I find it very wearable and I'm somewhat tempted by this creation.

edit.: Now I've bought it as a late summer scent; I perceive the banana blossom more as a green sweet fruit note in the heat, which I also like very much, I've never smelled anything like it before. In the dry down, a hint of aquatic remains with the other notes in the background, so it stays fresh.
Sillage is rather weak, so not intrusive. The bottle is refillable, which comforts me about the plastic flowers that, unlike green-floral-sweet scents, do not fit my usual preferences."
Cool Cotton,03/03/2025,UnicornCoco,F,374,,2,I am confused,"When I sprayed the fragrance, it smelled so fruity, juicy, and almost real, truly tempting enough to bite into a fruit. I just couldn't quite pinpoint which fruit it was, yet I felt like I was on the verge of figuring it out. Melon? Lychee?
But then, unfortunately, a note emerged that unpleasantly smelled like old floral water.
At home, I was very surprised to see that there is neither a zesty fruit nor a stinky flower in the notes. Banana blossom has never come across my path before, and I would really like to know if this is responsible for the described scent impressions. It must be so, as it is the top note; at the same time, the only flower in it - jasmine - is one I usually like very much.
The ""stinky floral note"" unfortunately lingers for a while, making the fragrance not suitable for me. After over an hour, it finally fades away, and it smells deliciously warm, floral, and sweet, almost reminding me of ""Daisy Love Eau So Sweet"".
From there, the fragrance is and remains pleasant, ending with very soft, almost chocolaty sandalwood and vetiver notes."
Cool Cotton,04/11/2025,Mina4,F,48,,3,The association ruins the scent for me...,"I am really into beautiful bottles, and those from Marc Jacobs have always appealed to me. Today I tested Daisy Wild, and I will first describe the scent itself: I find it really well ""composed"" and extraordinary.

Cool Cotton,04/29/2025,Kerkyra74,F,669,,2,Overripe Baked Banana,"I am disturbed, with a green bottle you expect ...something fresh... let’s be honest.

This one is somehow buttery, creamy, like a Banana Split with double cream, and after 10 minutes it has a burnt plastic note, as if..."
Clean Silk,01/08/2025,Lenny505,M,6,,1,Spicy old vanilla Cigar,"After one second it fulfilled my nose with spicy tobacco notes but i can also strongely smell the pepper and vanilla. This is something i really didnt expected from van cleef. All of there other perfumes are so heaven like standard good smelling scent for everyone but this one is the complete opposite. Strong notes, dirty smell, spicy and strong. The combination of the notes remind me of spicebomb fragrance without the cinnamon notes but i hate them, so i would 100 % choose this. The price is already down and almost reaches the 100$ limit. I think the price is fair for this type of perfumes.After a few minutes the vanilla more and more breaks through the other notes but is still in the backround because the pepper and tobacco are overwhelming. This reminds me of old men who smoke expensive cigars on the evenings and then, when they go back inside their house the smell of the cigar combines with the smell of their old wooden cabinets."
Clean Silk,07/17/2024,Oliban,M,11,,3,Nothing Precious!,"What a disappointment!
This was a blind purchase based solely on the fragrance notes provided by the site.
I'm going to be brutally honest, even if it might offend some!

Upon the first spray, I was hit with a very dense, powerful, and pungent amber note (it smells overwhelmingly of Ambroxan!). It was an assault on my senses! This note was so overpowering that it completely ruined the experience for me.
As for the rest of the scent's evolution? Ugh! Disappointing!
I detected a hyper-concentrated Myrrh resin, which gave off an olfactory impression somewhere between rubber and leather.

There was nothing syrupy or sweet about this fragrance.

There was no hint of Oud wood! But it felt as if it was there! It reminded me of the Oud found in poorly crafted fragrances - chemical and invasive!
The vanilla tobacco was overdone and lacked finesse!
I found it to be irritating and aggressive. It was like an olfactory punch... A bulldozer!

Ameer Al Oudh Intense Oud by Lattafa Perfumes."
Clean Silk,10/17/2024,Avantgardist,M,42,,7,Holy Father Figure on the Motorcycle,"A tension-filled contradiction that simply works too well.

One takes:

- a hardened biker who has left his wild days behind
- a somewhat unconventional pastor
- a kind, caring father

These three types were best friends in childhood. Their lives have developed in completely different ways, and now, after many years, they are finally together again. Drinking, laughing, smoking, telling stories from yesterday, the day before yesterday, and today, and it is just like it is with really good friendships: as if not a day has passed. Sometimes the laughter quiets down, and there is also room for silence. Never uncomfortable. Eloquent silence.

In this circle of trust, closeness, and cozy friendship, one is simply welcomed by Encens Precieux and joins in as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

The opening: immediately strong peppery notes, with a sweet leatheriness. Warm, pleasant - with incense and tobacco as accompanying spicy notes in the background, and amber, myrrh, and vanilla for comfort. Not directly intrusive, but captivating.

Over time, the pepperiness diminishes somewhat, creating more space for the sweetness. The spiciness remains. Only towards the end does Encens Precieux softly exhale sweet-tobacco notes and bids farewell on quiet feet.

It can actually be worn all year round - except in summer. Then it’s better to wear it only late in the evening, otherwise it becomes too much.

Longevity and sillage are somewhat better than what is usually expected from Van Cleef & Arpels and quite decent. Not a bad powerhouse, but certainly not weak either. For me: just right.

The bottle: simple, elegant, timeless. Not an eye-catcher or a showcase of glassblowing.

Price-wise: the RRP is currently (end of 2024) €165, if I remember correctly. To be honest, that wouldn't be too expensive for a soul fragrance like this. Street price: €125. Still not a bargain - and worth every cent.
Conclusion: some fragrances hit you immediately upon spraying. Encens Precieux is not such a companion. Not a loudmouth, not a wallflower. It rests in itself and welcomes you with calm, cozy warmth, without lulling you to sleep. You feel at home right away and experience something better than happiness: contentment."
Clean Silk,05/10/2024,Dennis1104,M,995,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,"Van Cleef & Arpels typically high quality, but the DNA is not for every nose","Encens Précieux is a fragrance that perfectly fits the niche theme, even though the brand Van Cleef & Arpels is strictly speaking a designer house.

Here you get a relatively strong leather, nicely spicy and especially peppery wrapped.
It also has a good portion of incense and myrrh.

Especially in the opening, it even comes across as quite animalistic, and that is not pleasant for every nose.
Presumably, classic designer noses will definitely not like this fragrance, just like people who always want something very pleasing. Encens Précieux certainly knows how to provoke.

The start is, as mentioned, quite animalistic, strong, spicy, peppery, and leathery. After a few minutes, the animalistic side recedes a bit, the leather is still very present, and the pepper becomes more intense.

As the fragrance settles more and more, it becomes gradually a bit ""quieter."" The leather does not seem as strong anymore, the peppery elements are still very present but more pleasing. Additionally, a bit of tobacco comes in, along with some vanilla. The incense also becomes quite pleasant in this phase.

The spicy impression continues, but with the vanilla and amber, it even becomes almost creamy.
In other words, towards the end, a really subtle sweetness comes into play.
Woody elements are also still present.

All in all, a well-made fragrance, as I expect from Van Cleef & Arpels.
Nevertheless, this scent is not for everyone, due to its slightly animalistic traits.
It simply has edges and corners, which also makes it stand out."
Baby Girl,06/21/2015,Sorceress,F,216,,1,"Sweetly Floral, Perfectly Mixed Fruit","This is a well-mixed blend of jammy fruits that are richly blended to give a vintage feel to a perfume that's really not that old. If you didn't know the name or year of this perfume you would swear you were smelling a vintage perfume from decades ago. It's full-bodied, thick and lays on a bed of deep woods.
It's a sticky floral, almost narcotic with its sweetness. Decadence is sensual, old-school and more sophisticated than one would expect for its price. Some might call this a stuffy type of perfume, and that's ok. It's just not their style. It's not for everyone. That's what makes perfumes fun for all of us.
Decadence is long-lasting and strong, better-suited for nights. If you're looking for a strong perfume that brings you back to vintages, this might be one that's affordable. It's like walking down a lush garden path, inhaling every bouquet you can, with an outdoor kitchen not far away.
My bottle and box are marked ""Parfums International"" and look like the Prince Matchabelli bottle, so I'm actually not sure which one I own. I can post my review in both sections until someone can advise."
Baby Girl,04/10/2017,Minigolf,F,2512,,4,Dreamy Chypre by Matchabelli - Art,"I already know two fragrances from the ""Scent Prince"" (and I have them too):
""Wind Song"", a spicy-floral carnation scent, and...
""Cachet"", a thick, heavy 80s oakmoss Chypre ""board"".
And now a third, wonderful fragrance:
""Decadence"", also an 80s Chypre, but one of the spicy-floral kind.
With great longevity and equally impressive sillage.
The scent starts off quite harmlessly with citrus, peach, and a bit of ""leaf green"". Just as if it couldn't ""cloud the waters"" and drifts along completely insignificantly.
BUT THAT IS DECEPTIVE!!!
The little rascal (I have a mini) soon unexpectedly lets a floral garden bloom that truly has depth.
Garden carnations, very spicy, mingle with lily of the valley, where leaves and stems have been included in the distillation.
Roses, still armed with thorns on their branches, battle with ylang-ylang and jasmine for dominance, while iris, dark purple, sprinkles its powder over the squabblers and calls for harmony.
Which eventually does come....
Only much later in the foreground, but long before already latent and subtly present:
Woods, ""earth"", and moss. The ""foundation"" that makes a Chypre. Wonderful sandalwood contributes its own unique touch. Sweet and bitter at the same time, it could be a standalone perfume and enhances the EdP even further.
It's a shame that this ""prince's jewel"" is now almost impossible to find.
Quite different from ""Cachet"" and ""Wind Song"", but with the typical ""Matchabelli"" signature.

CHLOE ROSES dries down to smell like a completely different fragrance than CHLOE. This flanker isn't trying to be her older sister. She's her own woman.

That said, while CHLOE dries down to smell of green melon and water (a la Issey Miyake), CHLOE ROSES dries down to a pale pink cone of cotton candy. So if you like HANAE MORI and the sweet dry down there, you'll also enjoy the light pink air of CHLOE ROSES (which is nothing like Bvlgari Essense of Roses).

it's funny, the bottle I have will always be something special and nostalgic about it. I was rebellious and was trying out shoplifting for the first time, and this was the second thing I ever stole, from a Macy's I believe. so the bottle is a tester bottle that looks a little worse for the wear, but it was like 80% full.

the scent is slightly on the soapy side, but it's a really nice non-committal fragrance for me. great for layering with other fragrances as this is basically a lot of light, airy notes. I like to pair this with Dusita's Oudh Infini for added girlishness and sophistication.

Lush Fleur,12/07/2020,Scentwitch,F,292,,2,A rose is a rose,"Pure rose here. If you are looking for a true rose scent, this one is for you. It opens with tartness, perhaps a citrus, but after only minutes transforms into a blossoming rose. It’s quite lovely and not synthetic smelling.
It does soften over time, but the rose is always right there with you. Decent sillage and longevity.
It’s a far cry better than the Tom Ford Rose Prick I bought last month and a lot less expensive.

And as the evening really begins, the roses bloom. You smell of love and romance. You raise your arms to touch your partner across the table, and roses breathe with your movement.

Roses is a very authentic, slightly sweet rose. I imagine a rose garden full of pink roses, next to an open jar of rose jam. It is fresh, but not unpleasantly fabric softener fresh. That’s how I perceive the original Chloe. It is also very youthful. Not a dusty rose, but a lively, spirited rose.
Fresh, floral scents are not exactly known for their outstanding longevity. This one lasts exceptionally long on me. After 6 hours, I am still surrounded by a slightly sweet, authentic rose. And that’s considering my skin tends to absorb perfume. I don’t want to be without it anymore.

Lush Fleur,04/19/2019,Helena1411,F,107,,7,Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,"This was already recognized over 100 years ago by the American poet Gertrude Stein.

And it describes exactly what this fragrance evokes in me:
I lose myself in roses, red-radiant, pink-floating, yellow-vibrating, white-glowing, orange-warming, and they all scent in harmony in this perfume.
A rose intoxication, enchanting, tender, intense. Like entranced, I get caught up in the fragrance, wanting to sing with Knef in the rain of roses, lie in a bed full of roses as sung by Bon Jovi, compose poetry with Hölderlin “To the Rose”...

And above all, the Damask rose scents, gently supported by the magnolia. A minimalist touch of bergamot brings a bit of freshness to the abundance of floral fragrance, but without minimizing, restricting, or dominating the rose. The rose remains, radiantly central, fragrant.
Amber and musk bring depth and softness, but only to carry the rose within.
All the ingredients of the fragrance pyramid serve only to honor the rose, to roll out the rose-red carpet for her, to place the little crown upon her head.

And I fully agree with Gertrude Stein:
Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."

Close to the horizon, the red embers spread out and creep ever closer. Shimmering Inferno in the style of Labdanum Symphony. In the background, Mozart's Requiem plays softly. One could sink into this fragrance with head and soul.

No hellish aspects. No, rather it is a hot, smoky roll, sprinkled with a dense sweetness. Resinous contrasts spread here, with an immense sweet force that burrows deep into the skin. On the edge, a shallow, spicy scent, at the heart a tonka bean that packs a punch. Cognac and honey lubricate, like oil, the engine of the red sky. Emerging dark clouds bring a bit of smoke, spice with them. The scent is incredibly dense and made for lovers of resinous fragrances. Labdanum Symphony is undisturbed by anything or anyone. It has a calm demeanor. It wants to embrace everyone with its initially wild, yet undeniably passionate nature. Resinous sweetness meets something luscious here. Paired with smoky and spicy aspects. There’s no fussing around, no rushing. The scent is just as it presents itself from the beginning, only it becomes warmer. There are no unpleasant surprises here.

And so the inferno rolls on, like the setting sun on the vast horizon, with an immensely long breath and presents itself in an extremely intimate way.

Beach Vibes,05/17/2022,Leberle,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Honey & Resin,"I received this fragrance for the first time in a generous sample size from my friend, and when I found out that it was being discontinued, I was overwhelmed with concern and bought another 50ml bottle:
Labdanum Symphonie impresses me as a scent for cold days with an incredible richness of heavy resins, although I must admit that I don't detect the cannabis scent as I remember it from my student days. The honey-like sweetness of the labdanum, frankincense, and others is all the more convincing. I have a weakness for this type of resinous, incense-like fragrances. What stands out about this one is its incredible longevity. I know few fragrances in this category that surpass the longevity of, for example, Ambra Aurea by Profumum Roma, but this one belongs to that group: sprayed on in the morning and slipping into bed in the evening, you are still enveloped by the warmth of this scent. It is not something I would wear on warm summer days, but from autumn to spring, it is excellent as a feel-good and cozy fragrance.

In my exploration of incense and resinous scents, it has found a place as one of the fragrances that is less challenging; it doesn’t have that green note like Interlude Man or the slightly smoky quality of Ambra Aurea - and it is not sacred either. And this is my justification for why I had to indulge my FOMO (fear of missing out) once again and am glad to wear this scent symphony on cold days for the next few years."
Beach Vibes,03/18/2021,Favea,F,44,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Magic of the Moment,"Labdanum Symphony - for me, a great love at first sight. It started with a small fragrance sample (before that, I knew nothing of my passion for labdanum), which I sprayed on and was immediately captivated by the sweet darkness of this scent. I had to breathe it in deeply again and again, almost inhaling it, because I found it incredibly fascinating. I would like to illustrate my olfactory impression more vividly with passages from this song by ASP, which reflects the driving, bittersweet melancholy in my perception very well:

From the depths it rose
The flow of melodies
A song like I had never heard before
The music a gentle pull
And I wanted to kneel down

In the depths, in the depths they sang

Listening, I stood at the abyss
And it drew me to the edge
I didn’t know what gave them such great power
This song that commanded me
And left me no choice

In the depths, in the depths they sang

And now I am almost at the goal
A high feeling overtakes me
A strong, never-before-known euphoria
Oh, melody, I am almost there
So close to your origin

In the depths, in the depths they sing

Whoever heard them sing
Knows how
Longing sounds
And I will never forget this melody
I don’t know what is happening to me
Tell me, where are you drawing me
Into the depths, into the depths they sing

Now, away from the emotional level and on to: What is the scent like?

First of all, it is STRONG, right from the first moment. You spray it on, and it captures you with strong resinous arms and wrestles you to the ground with sweet waves of vanilla and tonka. You have to like it, and you can almost only ""surrender."" So caught and held by honey-sweet magic, in your now amber-colored shackles, you experience how the scent reveals its dark, animalistic side in the form of amber and cannabis after about 10 minutes - but just enough of it that you still find this ""dark wickedness"" fascinating and alluring. And then you remain trapped in this wonderful dark amber depth - for this scent takes complete possession of you, for many hours (at least 10), and it is always very present by your side (my surroundings perceive it as an extremely pleasant fragrance - in other words, you stand out with it)

For me, one of the scents to which I would like to give a 10 in every respect - it has completely enchanted me. With it, I love to dive again and again into a dark, warm bittersweet world that fascinates but also triggers tingling shivers of fear."
Beach Vibes,01/16/2021,Floyd,M,570,,45,"Score for Amber, Boat, and Echo Sounder","Bass clef. A lake of balsamic amber, deeper than the Toplitz and arcane as well. Perhaps like a fjord. In slow motion, the waves of bitter honey wander, with driftwood inside, dry as tobacco, the old dark kind that only whales can possess. Lento.
A boat. Transparent and submersible. I can see the dirt swimming beneath the dark brown balsam surface through the wall, it glimmers sweetly and herbaceous. Cannabis leaves might fit in. They glow green with the copal grains, reflecting the waves of the echo sounder back into higher, brighter clouds, while the remaining tones resonate deeper.
Diving. Warm flickering of smoking myrrh in medically brown glowing layers of benzoin. Some earth flows by. Echo sounder deceives with tonka beans and wave-like vanilla surfaces. With the red roasting pearls of swirling incense, the colors dissolve into a wistful harmony. Friction. Tom Waits sings Jesus Blood at the bottom of the lake. It is dark there. Warm. Wonderful.

The sun brightens the sky again, clear raindrops glisten on the lush peony blossoms in the garden, the laundry on the line takes on its lovely-sensual aroma. The lady picks a few blackberries from the hedge, then puts on her simple white linen dress and hops on her bike to ride to the beach. Or maybe to the little town? Her good mood is contagious, she beams with the sun in a competition, and the warm wind plays in her long, flowing hair. Despite the many fruits and flowers, the gently rustling sea behind the dunes accompanies her the whole time.
For me, this scent is like an invitation to go to the idyllic holiday home with blue shutters
and a large romantic garden (but somewhere in the south, not in the north), where one has already spent some relaxed and sunlit holiday days and to which one always likes to return.
Not a scent to wear daily. But gladly, when the longing for the sea, for light, and for a flower garden in the south grips you and you just can't get away."

This perfume has been with me for a very long time. At one point, it was hard to find and somehow disappeared from the scene and my memory,
until I rediscovered it in an inconspicuous shop. It was even a special offer, a real bargain.

Now to the scent.
I don't know why, but every time I wear this fragrance, I feel light and buoyant. In my opinion, it is an absolute spring/summer scent for warm days.

It is not too fresh, slightly floral, not sweet. Like a gentle breeze in summer when you feel too warm.
It is not loud, but also not silent; it sings rather than speaks.

The longevity is good despite the lightness, and the bottle is kept beautifully simple. I would say the perfume is suitable for all age groups; it always fits.

With the musk in the base and jasmine and lily of the valley in the heart, the scent has a certain latent depth, which also makes it suitable for evening wear. Otherwise, it is more suitable for daytime.

A wonderful scent for dreaming."

At the point of application, the scent was simply too strong for my olfactory senses (that's where the Forte comes in). It started to shimmer, and I quickly pulled my nose away. In the aura, however, it was okay. The aura reached several meters. In times of Corona, this is ideal, as you can be perceived from meters away against the wind. Even at the far end of the ballroom, where people now stand two meters apart, or if only two people are allowed per ballroom unless they live together, then they have to dance two meters apart.

The scent itself didn't strike me as particularly special, meaning that it is a woody oriental, and there seem to be as many of those as there is sand on the beach (Parfumo spoils me). There is no oud in this one! That's a plus point.

One of the fragrance notes unfortunately remains almost forever on the clothing wherever it has been touched with a homeopathic amount of Lignum Vitae Forte. Without seeing the pyramid, the base (and the clothing scent) smelled fruity and somewhat like clove oil. I don't know if it's spikenard oil or nagarmotha or both. I had to wash everything today. Not because it smells bad, but because it smells at all. My wrist still smells of Lignum Vitae Forte in the evening because my arm was briefly in the sleeve of the dress I wore yesterday. For other people, the strong sillage and long-lastingness would probably be a reason to rate the perfume higher. The price-performance ratio does increase, but I don't want that much power.

In my opinion, Lignum Vitae Forte is more suitable for the colder season. The scent is rather, but not exclusively, masculine. It is obvious when you can wear Lignum Vitae Forte: when you are in quarantine. In times of plague, cholera, Corona. You can drip it into your pestilential beak, and then you definitely won't smell the terrible odors of the world anymore. Thus, it is also suitable for pathologists. I've already mentioned the lonely ballroom above. You can use it to mark a trail that others are supposed to sniff out. So, for example, in a scavenger hunt (which has nothing to do with schnitzels). If you want to scent a room with it, you can simply rub against the walls or quickly run through the room. Lignum Vitae Forte is definitely useful if you are looking for the exit of a labyrinth or have gotten lost in the woods; where it smells of Lignum Vitae Forte, you must have been there. Maybe the day before or two days ago, but at some point, you were there."
Clean 01.1/SN,12/26/2019,Taurus,M,1164,,10,Random Life Wood,"I met the sympathetic perfumer Sven Pritzkoleit, who taught himself the art of fragrance as an experienced pharmacist, a few years ago at a perfume fair in Düsseldorf. He presented his current creations under his own label SP-Parfums and kindly gave me some samples of his work.

Among them was Lignum Vitae Forte, which I would loosely translate as ""Random Life in Wood"" or ""Chance in the Wood of Life,"" thanks to Google, as a non-Latin speaker. Feel free to correct me on that.

What cannot be corrected is the first impression upon spraying, as Lignum Vitae Forte comes across as extremely animalistic to woody, as if a civet and a beaver had marked their territory on a tree together. This might also be due to the nagarmotha - an essential oil derived from the roots of the Indian nut grass, a type of cypress, which bears a resemblance to agarwood.

A few minutes later, the scent becomes a bit calmer, but it still remains relatively unwieldy or somewhat unrefined and raw. Accordingly, it takes about 30 minutes for it to feel softer and more relaxed. Then you perceive this slightly animalistic leather note, a lot of spikenard oil, and woody to musky notes, overshadowed by a hefty dose of earthy patchouli. And this lasts for a really long time...

Deep within, there are delicate green and soapy hints that seemingly give the creation a kind of corset. Only after a few hours do you get the feeling that the scent has found some semblance of calm and feels more or less somewhat smooth. But even this phase will still be too rough for many - but it won't get any softer.

In Lignum Vitae Forte, there is indeed life in the wood, although it reminds more of woodlice, beetles, and other critters, and less of bees, butterflies, or unicorns. Personally, I find it too rough and too rustic to feel comfortable with it. It has something of: I’m experimenting now, and this is the most wearable attempt.

So, for those who enjoy something provocative and bold that goes against the grain, this life wood is a good fit. Unfortunately, I personally miss a bit of the refined polish or the interesting twist."
Brilliant Peony,05/17/2024,Catchmynose,M,67,,3,The Gummy Bear Alternative,"Touché… The name evokes a nasty pressure in my stomach. Is it something about the scent? No!! I wasn’t outsmarted during fencing or a discussion, and I’m not sitting here - after a direct hit (Touché) - sulking in the corner.
What makes me feel queasy is the thought of a boy band of the same name that wreaked havoc in the early 2000s. Not only did the ""pop titan"" himself produce this musical disaster… but these ""musicians"" are more aptly described as a ""quirk of nature."" Just take a look at the pictures on Google…. or listen to one of their ""songs.""
Due to this association, I obviously don’t agree with the naming. Whether the people at LPDO have ever heard of this group is questionable. However, what this group definitely would have known is a little fragrance from Tiziana Terenzi.
Kirkè EXTRAIT DE PARFUM surely served as a godparent for this creation. But that doesn’t make the scent any worse…. and some even claim that TOUCHÉ is the better Kirke; but I won’t go that far…
The opening is sweet-fruity. A colorful tropical cocktail with all sorts of goodies from the fruit department. I can perceive berries and peach… the rest of the ingredients, however, vanish in a fragrant cloud of sugary vacation vibes. Touché is not a freshie, as it performs too sticky for me. Already in the top note, I notice the biggest difference from Kirke, which continues to linger for a long 8 hours until the finale. Most call it ""synthetic""… I call it ""positively piercing."" OK… Kirke already experiences something like ""hate"" and is often labeled as ""chemical club"" or ""hairspray scent."" Now I could say: ""Just look up the word synthetic on Wikipedia… then you’ll find something about 'Touché' too""… but I won’t say that…. And why not? Because I like ""the thing."" Do you know those plastic twist-and-drink bottles? As a child, I loved that stuff. On every school trip or even on a trip to Hagenbeck, those sugary fruit juices with a delightful formaldehyde aftertaste were always there! And that’s exactly what TOUCHE reminds me of; and that’s POSITIVE! The sillage is also good and gives the surroundings the childish impression of a visit to the Bäderland-Hamburg. I don’t feel this connection with Kirke.
Price: Here the equation applies: 10x Touché = 1x Kirke; and you can certainly notice the extreme price difference as the TT hit feels softer and more mature (WHAT!!!! …the Kirke bashers will now exclaim… “That’s just not possible”).
Conclusion: An inexpensive alternative from Italy with a gummy bear flair. Not for everyone… Still: I LIKE!"
Pink - Fresh & Clean,06/19/2016,Ohdeberlin,M,54,,12,Morning Walk in the Dew-Drenched City Park,"Opening with a refined accord of greenish spicy notes (greenish bitter orange note; musk sage, slightly bitter galbanum, rose geranium) appearing somewhat herbaceous. A kind of mossy note, but without the familiar note of oakmoss, feels like it is drenched in dew, rounding it off.
Soon a greenish aromatic, woody accord (softly aromatic cedarwood and Douglas fir?) joins in, adding weight to the aforementioned ""green."" A warming amber accord serves as the base, corrected with a slight aromatic leathery, slightly herbaceous sharpness (leathery note?).

EdP longevity is good at 7-8 hours, after about 2 hours the good sillage retreats to a strong skin proximity and ends with the base after about 9-10 hours rather mild. Unisex as it is not too rough, not too spicy, not too heavy or darkly woody, and also no moss inferno.

I highly recommend testing it on the skin, as it takes a few minutes of the body's warmth to animate the scent and create the overall fragrance impression."
Flower Fresh,01/20/2023,Mlleghoul,F,458,,1,A secret recipe for black tea flavored fudge,"What an incredibly weird and wonderful fragrance! This is a thick, rich, gooey tea-flavored fudge spiked with citrus and which reveals some evocative earthy elements that emerge as it dries. It’s as if a pot of strong tea was boiled down with a teacup full of brown sugar, a goodly glug of molasses, and slivers of bright yellow lemon peel, and then the mixture was stirred together with an entire box of sweet, nutty, whole wheat graham crackers crumbs and left on a counter to cool and set overnight. Fast forward about twenty years, and rather than the treat itself, this fragrance smells of its dusty, stained magazine clipping recipe card and which was secretly buried in the back garden by your eccentric relative because they didn’t want anyone to have their recipe after they died. This is why we dig it up and make the hell out of it and shout the recipe from the rooftops– because we don’t believe in gatekeeping the good stuff."
Shower Fresh for Men,06/08/2015,Caliope,F,28,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,oh no...,"...it's not that bad after all! This scent has a distinctly berry-like quality to it, reminiscent of Armani's City Glam, somewhat herbal and perhaps a bit of an acquired taste for some noses. In the case of Sex and the City, however, there’s also a gourmand touch of caramel that starts off sugary and then spreads deliciously and slightly creamy, especially in the base. And a dose of almost overripe oranges/tangerines. I have nothing against herbal notes and I prefer the berry aspect much more than the orange one, but the combination of both isn’t really my thing, especially when both elements are so strongly present. I can't perceive ambroxan, and the woods could definitely stand out more for my taste, which would give the scent more edges and character. As it is, it remains quite agreeable.
Sex and the City is not a milestone in the art of perfumery, but it can easily compete with all the Katzenbergers, Playboys, Essences, and whatever else is available in the drugstore, and it makes for a nice companion on moderately warm days."
Shower Fresh for Men,09/09/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Sour-Fruity instead of Sensual-Sexy,"~ Inspiration ~
I received the perfume in a swap. I know the series ""Sex and the City,"" but I was previously unaware of the perfume.

~ Bottle ~
The square shape with rounded edges is in transparent khaki. The name is printed in gold lettering on the front.

~ Scent ~
Sour-fruity.
Upon spraying, it is initially quite zesty with blood oranges, mandarins, passion fruit, and berries. After a few minutes, floral accords emerge in the form of gardenias, orange blossoms, and jasmine. With sandalwood, musk, amber, and a gentle caramel note, it finishes somewhat warm and woody.

~ Longevity ~
Unfortunately, it only lasts about 2-3 hours on my skin (a bit longer on clothing and hair). You can confidently spray it on.

~ Occasion ~
A 0815 everyday scent that can be worn anytime and anywhere.

~ Conclusion ~
Not so bad at all - I just expected a different scent direction based on the name. Additionally, it is a bit too synthetic and sour for me."
Shower Fresh for Men,08/04/2014,Seerose,F,775,,0,Slow-Motion Quickie,"If anyone expects me to elaborate on the topic of sex: no way! I certainly won’t reveal anything about myself! I will never do that, even with the most sensual fragrances.
This scent is conveniently found in the ""Sample on Tour"" travel package, and I randomly fished it out of the collection because the label was so faint that I had to use a magnifying glass and LED light to decipher the name. So I quickly applied it, called it up, and before the scent evaporates again, I’ll describe it quickly.
""Sex sells"" - that is the unmistakable intention behind this perfume name.
Because such an inexpensive little bottle can be afforded by any teenager, allowing them to gain recognition in their peer group, and perhaps provoke a few prudish adults.
But otherwise, this is a perfectly normal boring cheap scent. Harmless!
""SatC"" starts fruity, but not too sweet, quite zesty. Not even with a ""red berry note"" does it provoke me.
Flowers, if they are even perceptible, are muddled by synthetic sandalwood. Unfortunately, there are no animalistic, carrion-like O-flowers or even jasmine clusters that evoke any associations or feelings of desire, of any kind, e.g., the desire to get worked up over such stinky odors. Not happening! No chance.
Gardenia? Pah! You have to knit that yourself if you want to have at least a visual idea of it - or something like that.
For a little while, ""SatC"" is somewhat sharp and spicy, but before it could become interesting, it has already evaporated again. Ambroxan, which contributes to the longevity of fragrances, is already present, though not too strong. There are also fleeting moments with delicious caramel notes. It disappears faster than I can type. And I can type quickly.
Then, in the imagined dull wide city escapes, there remains a stale smell of relatively sour synthetic gummy candy, which, thanks to Ambroxan, will hardly be removable in the shower, according to my experience.
And with that, everything has been said about ""Sex and the City."""
Series 6: Synthetic - Dry Clean,07/21/2025,OllenaK,F,1,,1,"Fresh, Spicy, Uncomplicated","This fragrance is nicely fresh and spicy, with sage and cedarwood - really clear and invigorating, but not in an annoying way. I think it suits both women and men, a true all-rounder.

It doesn't last forever, just a few hours, then it's gone. But for the price, that's totally acceptable. The bottle looks modern and feels good in the hand. Overall, I think you really get your money's worth here if you're looking for something fresh and lively."
Golden Citrus,10/19/2017,Mantus,M,487,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Innocent,"Like A Virgin Limited Edition starts off fresh - floral, but also slightly sweet - creamy.

Our dear perfumer ""Elbchen"" provided me with her sample to test this fragrance, for which I would like to express my sincere thanks.

At first, one can detect a very intense, slightly sweet Moroccan orange blossom with its fresh - floral scent facet.

It is also the case that the orange blossom has slightly creamy attributes and reminds one of a pleasant summer body lotion.

At the same time, the orange blossom has something very refreshing - clear, subtly green, and it reminds me a little of neroli.

Like A Virgin Limited Edition does not have a real progression - it simply evolves over time.

As it develops, a lovely full Bourbon vanilla joins in and blends very pleasantly with the orange blossom, responsible for the beautifully balanced creamy nuance.

In the background, one can perceive something ""matte,"" which I personally would not describe as milky; rather, it intensifies the creamy accent a bit without pushing the orange blossom too far into the background.

Like A Virgin Limited Edition is a fragrance that can be applied at any time of day without hesitation, as it will not disturb anyone, but it also does not stand out, as the scent feels very innocent to me personally.

And that can sometimes be quite pleasant :-)

Overall, the scent can be detected on my skin for 7 hours.

The sillage is designed from the beginning to be perceived at about half an arm's length, and this is maintained for 3 hours before it gradually diminishes until the scent finally fades away completely."
Vanilla Cloud,02/28/2015,Tar,F,261,,3,Piece of a beautiful soul,"Masterpiece from my favourite perfumer – that is ESSENCES INSENSÉES.

Icing sugar peach lilac – the first breath, as your olfactory would be bombarded with shining, happy notes. If you take a deeper breath, it is easy to detect some biting spice, most probably the pepper (what else could be?). The fragrance is strong, confidently fresh, and 100% natural. The best face of niche – written here just to annoy GothicHeart :D

On the ground that I do not know all of the notes for sure, my nose makes easily mistakes, e.g. I feel chamomille. The scent of health. Bravo! This flower withers so fast... Dry and dead chamomille - The scent of sadness and too early farewell from life. If that was the intention, then bravo. If not, then: why the hell do I have to feel such grief at this stage???
...Especially after and before the beautiful springtime of head and base?

Till the end of heart ESSENCES INSENSÉES is the same with different body chemistries. The scent revives on lucky skin, and shows petals floating on clean water. Another drydown path is paved with herbs (mate?), is a bit sour, and shows in the last few hours a pretty, feminine and a bit boring mimosa. Where is the beeswax? In the head. Where is the vanille? In the head. Where is the violet? Mimosa kidnapped her to accompany her in the base.

As you can see, this fragrance involves me emotically very fast and deep, it is wonderful, and I can not keep myself away from the feelings that it makes arise. ESSENCES INSENSÉES is enough possessive to engage my thoughts for hours, nonetheless it is easy to wear. I like it. I love it. I hopelessly want to grab the volatile fineness of it."
Vanilla Cloud,11/15/2016,Gentilhomme,M,120,,6,Nonsensical Essences,"Translating the name 1:1 from French raises the question of why?

Why are fragrances referred to as nonsensical essences... Has the manufacturer already supposedly enough sensible essences on the market and wants to market their formulations that have been languishing in storage under a slightly misleading name? No idea.

In any case, all 3 fragrances launched under this name so far are anything but nonsensical; each one is something special with a specific target audience. In 2014, mimosas were highlighted, in 2015 jasmine, and this year the rose has been put in a special light. The two fragrances from 2015 and 2016 are successful, but not to my taste.

The first formula from 2014 is different. However, one must have a certain preference for the quirky, tingling mimosa scent that runs like a red thread throughout the entire fragrance progression.

The fragrance starts green and slightly metallic; the violet blooms here only very briefly, as it does in nature, most of the time the small violet spring messengers are gone after a sunny day. The pink pepper also listed in the top note may be somewhere present, but is hardly noticeable.

The mimosa is already present in the top note and intensifies in the heart note. Anyone who has ever stood under a blooming mimosa tree in spring by the Mediterranean will immediately have this image in their mind.
The mimosa scent personally always reminds me a bit of blooming linden trees, which is why I would like to compare the fragrance a bit with Tilleul by D'Orsay. The beeswax note in the base further emphasizes this association. Farnesiana by Caron also caters to the same fragrance direction.

For me, the fragrance is the most successful of the ""Nonsensical Essences""; it is subtle and not overwhelming, yet it has good longevity and a pleasant sillage. Essences Insensées 2014 is unisex, which I cannot attribute to the other two fragrances from 2015 and 2016, as they are more suited for women.

Anyone who likes green floral scents, especially mimosas, should definitely test this fragrance; I am not sure, but I believe it is no longer being produced, as it is very rarely found."
Vanilla Cloud,07/06/2015,Skjomi,F,51,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Here comes the Sun,"To start on a positive note, this fragrance smells like summer. Just like in the last few days, very very hot, many people at the outdoor pool lying on the grass and using plenty of sunscreen.

It initially starts very green, like freshly cut grass, the lawn in the morning, still dewy and freshly mowed. I seem to miss the violet and pepper.

But after just a few minutes, the sun rises mercilessly hot, and something sweet joins in, gaining more and more dominance, very sweet-almondy, almost like baking aroma, while being powdery vanilla-like. Spicy not in the classical sense, rather radiating the spicy sweetness of acacia honey. Here I really wondered why I perceive no flowers at all, and did some research. Heliotropin, which is used in perfumery, is described as powdery, vanilla-like, and almond-like; it is said to have a relaxing and comforting effect. That describes it very well, as it is the scent profile that absolutely defines and dominates this fragrance for me. Heliotrope also means: turning towards the sun. I don't know how mimosa smells, but the scent essence from it is derived from a type of acacia, which is said to have honey-like facets. I am a little reconciled with my nose again.

And then...? Unfortunately, nothing more comes. Grass and marzipan continue hand in hand in the height of summer and eventually make themselves comfortable on a blanket. There they stay, turned towards the sun and very relaxed.

I hope more comments will come, as I cannot assess the longevity; as you all know, fragrances that you don't like are very hard to wash off, so I find it quite long-lasting... Anyone who loves sweet gourmand fragrances, vanilla crescents, and especially marzipan should definitely come and sniff this! It is not my scent at all; I am not a heliotrope lover, and the aroma seems a bit overdosed-artificial to me.
I will trade the remaining sample for a second comment! :-)"
Tropical Escape,08/27/2024,Rgc,M,13,,1,TDH with more woods.,"I heard how much this smelled like TDH and I found it for a great price so why not. It indeed does have some close resemblance to TDH, no grapefruit in the opening but a generic citrus blast with some decent pepper to wake you up. This settles into a woody dry down with a very light hint of leather to me.

Truthfully this is a quintessential English Baber Shop scent. If you enjoy shaving, or want to up your game and possibly learnt to enjoy shaving, D.R. Harris has a whole line in the Windsor collection including some of the best shave soap on the market. Great company that goes over looked outside of the wet shaving circles."
Tropical Escape,06/22/2013,Zionist,M,24,,0,A solid Englishman,"The man is a repeat offender.
As a fan of English Scents, it was only a matter of time before creations from D.R. Harris expanded my collection.

The fragrances and the predominantly ""barber-related"" grooming products from D.R. Harris originate from the apothecary house of Daniel Roteley Harris, who opened his business over 200 years ago in one of the most prestigious areas of London on St. James Street.

This unmistakable subtly English style of his high-quality products, combined with an affinity for tradition and his closeness to the English aristocracy, must have been the reason why this family business became the royal supplier to the English royal house just before World War II.

Windsor arrived with DHL in the morning post.
The perfect opportunity to test a new perfume fresh out of the shower.
In great anticipation, and because the first spray completely met my expectations - I did not expect such a strong sillage (lasting until after work at 9 PM) with this fragrance.
On my way to work, I was kindly approached by the baker, then the woman who locked her bike next to mine at the train station, my secretary, and several business contacts could not help but inform me how good and refreshingly clean I smelled.

Windsor begins, as expected, with a distinctly fresh citrus top note featuring sweet orange, lemon, and lime, which appears interwoven with neroli, evoking an incredible Mediterranean freshness for me.
In this opening, the otherwise often omnipresent bergamot is completely omitted, which certainly sets the fragrance apart from many déjà vu experiences.
After this harmonious citrus accord, warming and spicy notes join in, which must be due to the presence of nutmeg, clove, and black pepper, and subsequently complemented by vetiver, geranium, and very subtly leathery notes, which in their entirety are responsible for the already described sillage and long-lastingness, making Windsor not remain as close to the body as I initially experienced subjectively.

This fragrance is wonderfully traditionally English and, despite its age, is anything but a representative of the old man scent genre.
Like with Eau de Colognes, this perfume is conceptually another interpretation of an already known theme.
I simply cannot imagine my repertoire without Windsor anymore."
Tropical Escape,12/04/2017,NotAmused,M,14,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Between Barbershop and New Car,"As a newcomer, I can't yet delve into the olfactory details of scents with precision, so I would like to share the impressions that come to mind as a user of the Windsor series.
I use the shaving soap, the aftershave splash, and the EdT discussed here.
The scent is slightly different in each case, which can certainly be attributed to the various concentrations and base ingredients.

Regarding the shaving soap:
Clean, warm, a bit leathery, a bit woody, slightly citrusy, powdery. It smells exactly like I imagine the scent of an old barbershop. It makes it unmistakably clear that you need to take your time now. It would also be a waste to scrape such rich, fragrant lather off your face just like that.

After the most thorough shave possible comes the moment of truth. Did you handle the razor or safety razor properly, or are you about to go through hell?

The aftershave:
Pepper. A bit of leather. But the pepper. That’s the main event here. You literally pepper your face. It calls out: “Let’s go! Saddle the horse! We want to achieve something great today!”
It’s dry, spicy, invigorating, wonderful.

Now comes the finish with 2 spritzes of the EdT, which presents itself unobtrusively and close to the body like a classic cologne, but is much more long-lasting.
Here, the clean barbershop freshness of the soap merges with the pepper and leather spice of the aftershave, resulting in an urban, herb-fresh scent for men who know what they want. You don’t find this on every corner. Even the base without musk feels wonderfully fresh and outstanding. It pairs perfectly with a dark blue suit, but with black shoes.
If I had to describe this scent in one word, I would say: new car."
Tropical Escape,08/22/2014,1972,M,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,The Rise of a Better World,"Delightfully fresh at the beginning, it's tempting to immerse oneself in this scent. I want to bathe in this fragrance and splash around in the bygone times that Windsor evokes.
Zionist has already described the perceptible nuances precisely, and I can only add: On the Titanic, I would have noticed this scent on every fourth passenger, which is enormous, considering the fragrance was released into reality in the 2000s. This is how the year 1912 smelled beyond the blast furnaces and backyards. In this lies the impetus for the creation of Windsor, which overwhelms my olfactory system. The distance of catastrophic events, the rich, warm distinction, the maiden voyage of a Titanic from a port, in whose hinterland extensive, soot-covered workers' settlements remain, from whose hard labor the massive metal coffin fades into time.
Windsor does not smell of the absent sweat of the workers. Windsor smells soft and beautiful. The dream of a world that rises above misery and drifts in the ether between times."
Tropical Escape,09/21/2017,Parma,M,277,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Three Surprises,"Thanks to a lovely and generous sample of Yatagan, I had the pleasure of experiencing this fragrance. I hadn't read about the scent character beforehand and let myself be surprised.

Scent Development:
My first surprise was the opening: A very fresh, almost piercing citrus start. This aligned perfectly with my preference for fresh, hesperidic scents. Very quickly, a minty, penetratingly fresh note emerged, beautifully balanced with a slightly herbaceous-spicy touch, which I would describe as green/gray, creating a connection that lasted until the end of the fragrance. In between, the spicy notes were occasionally a bit more intense, but never dominant. Throughout the entire, very enduring development, I perceived a fresh-minty, slightly herbaceous-spicy scent.
I was surprised for the second time when I later found no mint in the scent description. I was firmly convinced and had already been pleased that there could be a more subdued version than in what I consider the overly minty “Guerlain homme l’eau.” I see - in a hopefully not too misleading memory of the Guerlain - a similarity between both fragrances and would say that one should try Windsor if the Guerlain is too strictly fresh. This minty impression surely comes from the vetiver-pepper combination. It vaguely reminds me in the fresh and light vetiver note of Tom Ford's “Grey Vetiver” EdT vetiver note, although the one in Windsor is even brighter and lighter. I can't say much about the comparison drawn by some of my predecessors to Terre d'Hermes, as I only remember it very vaguely. However, I believe that Terre seemed significantly sweeter-spicier to me. Before I make any further comparisons that would leave the experts shaking their heads, I better stop here :)

Longevity and Sillage:
Here I was surprised for the third time. I didn't expect it to last so long. I could still perceive it clearly and continuously after 13 hours. It clearly has EdP power for me. As for longevity! Thank goodness (for me personally), the sillage is more restrained. At first, it is slightly perceptible at a distance and gradually draws closer to the body, but is still noticeable to others in the immediate vicinity with movement.

Conclusion:
I was surprised three times, with the first two surprises resulting from previous, intentional lack of information, which naturally makes it not particularly difficult to be surprised :). However, the longevity was truly unexpected.
This fresh-minty, well-measured herbaceous-green-spicy English scent is classically British, straightforward, without frills, natural, and of high quality, leaving no wishes unfulfilled. From my perspective, despite its young year of creation, it feels slightly old-fashioned - I often have this association with vetiver scents - elegant and truly uplifting. Throughout the day, I had this pleasant and finely tuned, entirely unartificial feeling of freshness. Therefore, it is particularly well-suited for summer and also for transitional months. Personally, it is a tad too cold for me, still too strictly fresh to be a purchase option. But it is very close!"
Tropical Escape,02/18/2013,Equestrian,M,3,,4,Forest Walk,"Great new scent from D. R. Harris, launched in 2012 along with the entire relevant line. Initially a bit flashy due to the citrus notes, Windsor quickly transitions into a lush coniferous forest that comes across as very fresh and very clear. The bestselling lines Arlington and Marlborough now have serious competition: I bet Windsor will stay in the lineup just as long (and that’s a long time)!
Admittedly, I don’t wear it in the evening or at the office, for those occasions there are of course other fragrances. But for an uncomplicated country outing, checking on things quickly in the stable, clay pigeon shooting, hunting, etc., Windsor has become a reliable companion for me. I honestly can’t think of an alternative for these occasions!"

Ultimate Beach Night,07/12/2025,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,With Swiss Precision,"Chocolate, cheese and precision watches… then I say Switzerland, the home of Toblerone, Emmental and Rolex. With this reputation one should think, that if the Swiss ever started making perfumes it would have to be a success.
On oLiente’s website you can read that the perfumes “are made with Swiss precision and passion”. And I admit that this first encounter with the Swiss brand is quite promising, actually. Vida is sweet and floral, to the gourmand side. Freshness comes from the lemon which keeps it from getting too cloying. In this, coconut works so well with the praliné. It lasts some five to eight hours which is quite good. Sillage is an arm’s length.
I must say, though, that I find it rather expensive. Almost €200 on the official website… I am not sure if that is worth it. Mostly because it has so many similarities with Juicy Couture’s Viva La Juicy! and I can get 30ml for around €25. I guess I will spend my money on some other fragrances instead. But keep going, Switzerland!

(You can see all my comparisons under my review of Unknown Pleasures) and have just purchased Dulcis in Fundo for summer (which I absolutely love!) Il Colore del Vento might just be the better option for high heat and the summer citrus vanilla I’ve been searching for! I also love the inspiration behind the scent, which made it instantly more appealing.

Il Colore del Vento (the colours of the wind) is a light gourmand. It opens with an airy mix of vanilla, bright citrus, a nice balance of sweetness, and a touch of coriander which gives the scent a cool, slightly limey freshness. As it dries down I get a light, sweet, candied fruit smell with hints of zingy ginger and a little spiciness. It isn’t overpowering or heavy in any way. I get zero coffee and no cardamom (thank god!) but there is a slight effervescent quality to the scent in the mid, which I guess is due to the champagne note. This would work all year round and in high heat. Very well done, very high quality, no nasty base notes and at quite a cheap price. Beautiful 10/10

In my opinion this isn’t similar to Lira, which is cakey, very sugary and a bit heavy. I also don’t find it similar to Akro Bake either, which I find has quite an ambroxan smelling dry down. To me this is closest to Chilli Candy Crush, but still very different and unique. The more I smell this, the more I love it."
Clean Slate,04/28/2025,Mombasa333,M,65,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Perfect Breakfast Buffet,"Young rays of sunshine wake me up. Softly nestled on white linens, I remember the here and now in the hotel and the breakfast booked the day before. With hurried steps, I set off, out the door, press the elevator button, wait, traverse several floors and - Bing - the aluminum doors open and I enter the lobby.

Here begins my fragrance journey with Il Colore del Vento.

I cannot yet see the doors to the restaurant area, but at first, I notice the homemade refined water carafes, which are adorned with ginger and lemon. The impression lasts only briefly, as quickly the coffee notes and the scent of sweet dishes capture my attention.

I enter the room and find everything I had suspected to be true and also discover one or two guests who are already welcoming the day with champagne. The sweet notes continue to prevail and remain persistently present. It is not a single scent that can be perceived, but a constant shift of sweet dishes, warm honey notes, and finally very soft butter. It is like enjoying a warm pancake with maple syrup, but not dominated by sugar, rather in a sweet-buttery balance.

Excellent. Interesting notes with a strong progression. Sweet and yet noble."
Clean Slate,10/28/2025,SunShine1110,F,180,,3,The Perfect Lemon Cake from Trieste,"It was love at first sniff. I discovered Il Colore del Vento for the first time on vacation in Trieste, in a charming little niche perfumery, where the owner smiled while spraying it and said, “This is fun!” And she was so right...!

The fragrance is simply beautiful, from start to finish. Zesty, gourmand, delicious. It fits almost any occasion, radiant in summer, warming in winter, but it's perfect in autumn.

Recently, a colleague asked me in the afternoon what smelled so delicious here. “Did someone bake waffles?” No, it was ""Il Colore del Vento | Nobile 1942,"" which I had sprayed on at 6:15 in the morning.
So we’ve also immediately clarified the question of longevity and sillage. The fragrance lasts quite a long time and has a decent, yet pleasant sillage.

Forget Lira, Devotion & Co.! This is the perfect lemon cake.
At the opening, a juicy lemon shines, accompanied by a fine spiciness from ginger and pepper, a bit of warmth from cardamom, all very subtle and harmonious. Then comes this sparkling champagne effect, followed by a hint of coffee and caramel. Sweet, but never sticky, probably thanks to the fresh bergamot that perfectly balances the fragrance.
In the drydown, it gets really delicious. Butter, caramel, and a soft warmth that reminds you of freshly baked waffles.

The fragrance naturally moved in with me the same day, and I have not regretted it.

Il Colore del Vento is a fragrance that simply makes you happy.

I am in love."
Clean Slate,10/17/2025,Simonski,F,3,,1,from Citronella Candle to Italian Café,"Il Colore del Vento initially reminds one of a citronella candle when first sprayed, but this extreme lemon kick quickly fades, thank goodness, as I find the scent almost unpleasant in the first few minutes; the spritziness of the champagne combined with citronella makes one wrinkle their nose.

Fortunately, I tested it on my skin and it was able to develop..

Relatively quickly, Il Colore del Vento transforms: the citrus freshness settles like a fine veil, and beneath it reveals a creamy-warm depth. Now you find yourself on an autumn afternoon on the terrace of a beautiful, elegant Italian café, the sun shining in your face. Fresh butter pastries, cakes, and a warm crème brûlée pass by, with a hint of coffee wafting in the background - soft, lightly roasted, never dominant, more like a quiet companion, just like the lemon now. A cozy blanket wraps around you, giving you a wonderful feeling of security.

This contrast of lemony clarity and gourmand warmth makes the scent so fascinating for me. It is airy yet deep, bright yet cozy. A fragrance that begins with ease and ends in softness, like a gust of wind transforming into an embrace? Perhaps that's where the color of the wind comes from. But it could also simply be the wind from the Italian café ;-)

For me, an absolute feel-good scent, very pleasing, for gourmand fans. As for the sillage, I can say that I hardly notice the scent on myself after a while, but it is never completely gone. I left my lightly perfumed clothes from the previous day in the dressing room and entered it the next morning, and there it was again, completely present: the delicious Italian café!"
Clean Slate,10/30/2025,Art3miss,F,3,,1,You Are So Close to Me!,"A day has fallen out of time. Everything that is usually so ordinary and familiar carries a delicate, golden-brown shimmer. The moment stretches out, and a hidden space opens up. The wind carries with it a long-forgotten child's laughter. My hands, which have only touched you until now, have finally held you for the first time today. I am enveloped by the ""color of the wind."" It allows me to become the woman I could be. The serene warmth softens the edges of protective strength without compromising it. For a stolen moment, I see the world in a different light. I want to linger there. To surrender, to sink into you, to simply be without words. We will meet again in our dreams."
b.clean Relax Fragrance,09/10/2025,Smellemental,M,74,,1,Phronema’s Cubanola: A wizard’s dessert!,"Conjures images of a blooming, creamy, yellow-white floral that gives off the scent of an otherworldly custard… the ylang and heliotrope are blended about evenly, and combined with the other gourmand items of caramel, vanilla, coffee, clove & benzoin an incredibly rich and dense foundation is made—and then given an herbal-green twist by the oregano, patchouli and violet leaf, also complimented by vetiver in the base.

Really delightful! Ingredients are showcased well while still nicely blended into a pretty novel scent. There are some very pleasant chocolate and banana nuances as well, creating such an interesting nutty, creamy, herbal dessert.

I also applaud the use of oregano here, very deftly added and I feel a great choice of herb for the job. Well complimented by the tang of the patchouli.

Bravo, good sir!"
Clean Musk,07/02/2023,Quarterback,M,22,,2,Caught me by surprise,"Captivated me with its unique blend of freshness and sensuality. From the moment I first experienced its enticing aroma, I knew it was a purchase worth making. This unisex perfume manages to strike a perfect balance, making it a versatile choice for various occasions.

The fragrance opens with a woody and resinous accord, evoking a sense of warmth and depth. It is accompanied by a subtle smokiness that adds an alluring touch to the composition. As the scent develops, sweet and spicy notes emerge, further enhancing its complexity.

While it may not be an everyday fragrance for me, Sexy Garrigue is perfect for seasonal wear, providing a refreshing change of pace. Its versatility shines as it transitions seamlessly from day to night, making it suitable for both daytime and evening occasions.

The perfume’s clean and well-balanced character ensures that it can be worn throughout the day without overpowering the senses. However, it truly shines when worn during evening events, exuding an air of elegance and allure.

Overall, Sexy Garrigue is a captivating fragrance that leaves a lasting impression. Its combination of woody, resinous, smoky, sweet, and spicy accords creates a unique and memorable experience.

Whether you’re seeking a scent for a special occasion or simply want to add a touch of sensuality to your fragrance collection, Sexy Garrigue is a worthy choice."
Clean Musk,03/10/2023,Marquise27,F,232,,1,Honey Bomb,"A very sweet, sticky dripping spice honey. It reminds me a bit of dried fruits lying outside on a table to dry on a hot summer day. The light herb garden fades a bit, but the heavy sweetness of what is surely a very good honey remains and remains and remains. The scent clings to me for a loose 6-8 hours. I wouldn't actually describe it as sexy - it intoxicates the senses and leads my counterpart to think there’s someone who has taken a honey-date-fig-mandarin bath and is exuding from every pore. Many might like that; it is indeed very intense and lingers in the room for a long time. An oriental perfume, it suits women better, or men who enjoy such perfume calories. Price over 200 euros, the bottle looks noble and elegant. After about 3-4 hours, it becomes a bit more subdued, but the scent progression remains unchanged. It smells of honey and dried fruits. I unfortunately have to say this, and I normally never do - it’s not my candidate, but it will surely find its fans."
Warm Cotton & Mandarin,02/09/2024,Landshark321,M,746,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,"Sharp, spicy, leathery tobacco, a bit of a varnish vibe","Sampling Fulton & Roark Sterling, a sharp blend featuring prominent notes of tobacco leaf and amber, almost with a varnish/lacquer/borderline whiskey type of vibe, as well, striking and fairly powerful, though not extremely dense. It’s a non-sweet contrast to Calle Ocho, the boozier sweeter blend. It expectedly dries down to be a little calmer, though its character does not change much, with still a lot of sharpness, borderline metallic, some hours in.

Like the rest of the extrait collection, Sterling is priced at $205 for 50ml, far from cheap, so I’d really only recommend a full bottle if you love it, and while I like it, I don’t love it, but I think it will suit some people very well in the cooler months, especially. My favorites of my sample set of five were ultimately Calle Ocho and Narada.

Air & Coconut Water,02/03/2014,stephaniek,F,44,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Cotton Candy Dry Down,"I already own and love the EDP of Chloe, but my obsession with roses had me at hello with CHLOE ROSES DE CHLOE. I had to see if there were enough differences between the two to warrant a purchase. The verdict:

CHLOE ROSES dries down to smell like a completely different fragrance than CHLOE. This flanker isn't trying to be her older sister. She's her own woman.

That said, while CHLOE dries down to smell of green melon and water (a la Issey Miyake), CHLOE ROSES dries down to a pale pink cone of cotton candy. So if you like HANAE MORI and the sweet dry down there, you'll also enjoy the light pink air of CHLOE ROSES (which is nothing like Bvlgari Essense of Roses).

I won't be purchasing because I don't need another sugar sand rimmed scent."
Air & Coconut Water,07/18/2023,Imfluff,N/A,21,,3,my first independent step into becoming a fraghead...,"my mom was into fragrances, but I would always borrow hers. I had never owned a fragrance myself or chosen it by trial and error. this perfume marks me developing a taste and getting it myself...

it's funny, the bottle I have will always be something special and nostalgic about it. I was rebellious and was trying out shoplifting for the first time, and this was the second thing I ever stole, from a Macy's I believe. so the bottle is a tester bottle that looks a little worse for the wear, but it was like 80% full.

the scent is slightly on the soapy side, but it's a really nice non-committal fragrance for me. great for layering with other fragrances as this is basically a lot of light, airy notes. I like to pair this with Dusita's Oudh Infini for added girlishness and sophistication.

it does tend to fade on skin super quick (almost immediately even), but on fabrics it can last a while."
Air & Coconut Water,12/07/2020,Scentwitch,F,292,,2,A rose is a rose,"Pure rose here. If you are looking for a true rose scent, this one is for you. It opens with tartness, perhaps a citrus, but after only minutes transforms into a blossoming rose. It’s quite lovely and not synthetic smelling.
It does soften over time, but the rose is always right there with you. Decent sillage and longevity.
It’s a far cry better than the Tom Ford Rose Prick I bought last month and a lot less expensive.
Again, if you want real rose, look no further than Roses de Chloe."

The citrus perks you up as your date picks you up and takes you downtown.
And as the evening really begins, the roses bloom. You smell of love and romance. You raise your arms to touch your partner across the table, and roses breathe with your movement.
And finally, towards the end, everything settles down into a comforting rosy musk, and you feel, above all, like a woman in love."

Air & Coconut Water,04/19/2019,Helena1411,F,107,,7,Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,"This was already recognized over 100 years ago by the American poet Gertrude Stein.

And it describes exactly what this fragrance evokes in me:
I lose myself in roses, red-radiant, pink-floating, yellow-vibrating, white-glowing, orange-warming, and they all scent in harmony in this perfume.
A rose intoxication, enchanting, tender, intense. Like entranced, I get caught up in the fragrance, wanting to sing with Knef in the rain of roses, lie in a bed full of roses as sung by Bon Jovi, compose poetry with Hölderlin “To the Rose”...

And above all, the Damask rose scents, gently supported by the magnolia. A minimalist touch of bergamot brings a bit of freshness to the abundance of floral fragrance, but without minimizing, restricting, or dominating the rose. The rose remains, radiantly central, fragrant.
Amber and musk bring depth and softness, but only to carry the rose within.
All the ingredients of the fragrance pyramid serve only to honor the rose, to roll out the rose-red carpet for her, to place the little crown upon her head.

And I fully agree with Gertrude Stein:
Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."

Terra Woods,05/02/2014,Palonera,F,467,,28,the promise,"Friendly it is, the spring of the year 2014, very friendly.
In March already, it flattered our spirits with temperatures in the upper double digits, emerging from this time's not too deep winter slumber, allowing flowers and shrubs to burst their buds ahead of time and making my soul rejoice with joy over warm sun rays on winter-pale skin and the most colorful, vibrant scent veils that divided the air in the gardens and meadows of our settlement.
Each day became a little more colorful, a little greener, a little friendlier, until the first week of April could have made me believe, without looking at the calendar, that I was at the beginning of summer.
Who could believe it was just a coincidence that handed me a vial of ""July"" in anticipation of the month of joy?

And indeed: Already the first spray catapults me into an early, young, dew-damp high summer morning somewhere far down south, in the warm, in the sunny, right in the middle of a densely leafed, light yellow-green and dark orange-green speckled grapefruit and mandarin grove.
The air is delicately cool and silky like a gossamer veil drawn through bubbling spring water, cool-matte patinated fruit skin explodes into millions of tiny, herbaceous, penetrating yet not at all sour, not at all sharp, not at all biting scent molecules, tickling my nose and expanding my lungs, driving the blood faster through my veins and making my eyes wider, brighter, more alert.
No sticky-sweet juice drips from freshly peeled zest - firm and plump, the fruits hang on the tree, nestling freshly picked in my hands, tenderly bitter oil wells around my deeply dug nails into the skin, so pure, so unadulterated, so mouth-watering naturally, that I cannot believe, that I do not want to believe, that this dream-drunk realistic impression is solely due to the fragrant puddle on my wrist.
Hour by hour, this delicately fresh breeze surrounds me, a little leafy, green, a little softer, creamier, becoming even friendlier, deepening over time, woodier, saltier, just a little, very little, and always putting a smile in the corners of my mouth, in the corners of my eyes, holding it, warming and cooling me, encouraging and soothing me, making life feel light and softly whispering: ""Summer is yet to come, summer is yet to come..."""
Terra Woods,09/29/2017,NikEy,M,60,,10,Psssst! Welcome to the Realm of Subtle Scents!,"Knock, knock... excuse me, is anyone there?! Open the door! I can smell that you’re home! This, or something similar, would be the beginning of any mediocre crime film. At least if the perpetrator were a perfume.

Here, the loudest fragrances often receive the best ratings and the most attention. After all, you want to get your money's worth!
This will be my first journey into the world of subtle scents. Those that are meant just for oneself. For all those days ...
~ when you have an occasion that calls for discreet fragrance but still need a protector
~ when you just want to happily immerse yourself in your own scent and draw strength without being immediately noticed
~ when you ...

Where other perfumes can comfort with their enveloping nature, Juli offers a very gentle embrace. It combines excellent self-perception with an almost nonexistent external perception. I have never experienced this to such an extent before. It’s as if it crawls directly from the skin to the nose. Tested on others as well: I hardly notice it as a non-wearer.

Enough now, let’s get to the point: It starts citrusy. A lovely grapefruit opens and soon makes way for plenty of green! And that is what Juli is and wants to be all the time. The light green, likely marked by the fig leaf, is so well integrated with the grapefruit and mint that even critics of the latter will find nothing to complain about here. The rather citrusy start gradually transitions into a green woodiness that never loses its freshness. Vetiver, along with cedar, ensures that the scent becomes a bit darker. The wood is so ethereal and floating that one could almost describe it as a refreshing top note. Exactly this little cloud hits you from time to time... when you’ve held your head down for too long, as if it’s gathering under your chin, just waiting for you to lift it again...
However, one should not forget: It is still a little green thing. Neither highly complex nor an olfactory artistic masterpiece. But beautiful. And all ingredients are easily detectable.

It is unisex simply because it only wants to please the wearer. I find the longevity quite good for a light green scent. Two sprays, definitely applied to the neck, provide a lovely fragrance experience without drowning in it."
Terra Woods,08/16/2014,Doppelkorn,M,22,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Green Surprise,"It’s so green ...
and the grapefruit is fantastically bitter. Here it feels fruity, there it’s more green, and then again wooden. I didn’t want to ask the other day so as not to seem intrusive. Yet my impression that colors play a special role in these compositions is once again reinforced, and I already think I possess something quite personal with these fragrances. Synesthesia is something very personal, if my assumption is correct, and therefore I prefer to be cautious in my description. The matter is understandable, unfortunately not at all comprehensible for me, and commands my utmost respect. Ah, I am still standing in the garden, breathing in the scent of rain-soaked leaves and tasting grapefruit. Cool, fresh, refreshing. Someone has put mint in the cool water. It sparkles on the skin and then comes the first, clear break. Now July becomes more floral and almost caressing. The heart note makes me think of magnolias and jasmine. Rarely do the top, heart, and base notes separate so distinctly; rarely do I perceive the progression of a perfume so clearly and understandably. That back there must be vetiver, and that fabric softener note is definitely the musk. Everything is pleasant, wearable, light as a cool morning in a garden. It’s so beautifully green ..."
Terra Woods,07/28/2017,Serafina,F,479,,7,False First Impression,"Sometimes the very first impression can be misleading - with people, as well as with perfumes! “July” was such a case for me.
In my notes, I had written: “Citrus, a bit green, rather insignificant.” This was apparently after testing a sample. But I must have ignored that when I signed up for a sharing. Luckily!
Without further testing, I assigned the fragrance to the month of July (one might smile at my monthly categorization, but it helps me keep track of my mega collection).

Yesterday, I sprayed “July” for a longer car ride to my card game group - and was pleasantly surprised. A wonderfully fruity-citrusy scent with very little sweetness. This perfume showed no development on my skin; it essentially consisted only of the top note for several hours. So basically grapefruit and mandarin, but no mint, fig leaf, or anything else. However, I found this enduring top note to be very pleasant. It gave me the illusion of a warm sunny summer day, which could hardly be said of the rainy, cool day yesterday.

Terra Woods,08/21/2010,Apicius,M,1328,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,An Ambivalent Impression,"In the store of 1000 & 1 Seifen, you can always purchase a limited fragrance that the owner has developed and produced himself. Currently, it is a vetiver.

And this vetiver belongs to the group that pairs vetiver with cedarwood in the base. I have already posted a detailed overview of this special category:

http://www.parfumo.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=531&highlight=Zedernholz+und+Vetiver

To get straight to the point: The base note consists of nothing other than this special combination. Thus, this perfume is a distinctly purist representative of the cedarwood-vetiver category. In fact, this perfume is said to consist of only seven fragrance notes.

However, I find that the heart and top notes do not quite do justice to this intense combination. They are light and delicate. There are subtle, yet high-quality grapefruit and mandarin. The heart is complemented by fig leaf, but only very subtly. I know it differently and better. One could compare it - if one has it - to the unfortunately now discontinued Salvatore Ferragamo pour Homme. Here, the strong fig leaf serves as an equal partner to the vetiver.

The delicate top note lasts about 10 minutes, while the heart note, which also contains a bit of jasmine, lasts at least half an hour. However, the base note lasts for many hours. I would have wished for a bit more endurance from the top and heart notes, as they are truly very beautiful. After all, a hint of citrus freshness and floral lightness is carried into the drydown.

I think that in the realm of cedarwood-vetiver fragrances, the air is quite thin for perfumers, as there is much good out there. Just think of the successful Terre d'Hermes, which can now be considered a reference fragrance for this direction.

As a men's fragrance, I do not like this vetiver so much. There are more interesting variations of the theme elsewhere, with a more individual expression. The contrast between the base and the delicate heart and top notes could not be greater; it feels torn. And the base is too pure for me; I would prefer a bit more complexity here.

As a women's fragrance, however, I find the perfume successful. Because - let's be honest - vetiver and cedarwood combinations are simply too good to be reserved for just one half of humanity. The delicacy and lightness of the top and heart notes, which do convey a bit into the drydown, make this combination wearable for women. I mean, I have also read on Parfumo the desire from the female side to be able to wear Terre d'Hermès. However, a distinctly feminine fragrance is fig & vetiver by no means."

Silk is wonderful to wear in the summer. Due to the affordable price, you can apply it generously without worry. I find it to be extremely clean-smelling and refreshing.
Moreover, I feel very fresh with the scent for a long time.
This morning I applied it around 8:00 AM, before work, and my husband could still smell it on me at 5:00 PM. I even received a compliment for Silk right away.

Me - Clean,07/08/2021,Serenissima,F,1222,,14,gentle vanilla with resinous spice,"The ""give-aways"" with orders of skincare products from Dr. Pierre Ricaud are always very impressive: often they are valuable skincare products in full size, and often also fragrances from the now quite extensive collection of ID Parfums/Isabel Derroisné.

Last autumn, it was a bottle of the new fragrance ""Cap d'Ambre""; which had, however, been forgotten in a ""cosmetics supply collection box"".
Why actually?
Certainly not because I don't like this brand.
All the fragrances I know are very well crafted and have their own charm.
They are not ""chart-toppers"", but due to their special personality, they are extremely wearable.
Especially on those days when nothing loud, pompous, or demanding should come near.
We all know these occasions; especially when we are testing through our fragrance sample stash and suddenly realize that our senses need a break to reactivate themselves.
But who among us wants to be ""naked and bare"" during this time?

Many of the fragrance creations from ID Parfums/Isabel Derroisné are for me a pleasant pause from fragrance stress in these moments, without having to forgo scent.
Among them is ""Cap d'Ambre"" - a grand name for a delicately vanilla-scented fragrance wrap that does not weigh down or burden; consisting of coarsely knitted scent meshes.
Bergamot and pink pepper (without which it seems one cannot go these days) easily break open these first scent meshes.
A very light, delicate, yet expressive vanilla with its own unique charm takes up this scent thread. By the way, it remains very faithful on the skin for a long time without becoming annoying or musty.
The fine yellowish-white scent hue gains a slightly earthy depth from patchouli's golden brown.
Even now, this scent fabric radiates warmth and harmony.
Noble resins, here myrrh and light, not too heavy incense, add a spicy-smoky note that neither scratches nor becomes too dominant.
On the contrary, a warm vanilla note with a pleasantly smoky spice develops as the finale of this artisanally well-balanced composition; it hums and resonates softly!

These are not passionate vanilla-erotic vibrations that tease the senses with golden brown resins, but a wearable little piece of fragrance art for all day.
To call ""Cap d'Ambre"" a ""daily fragrance"" would be unloving and also wrong.
A charming and quiet elegance accompanies one calmly through the day, leaving a feeling of being protected.
A light fragrance cape that shields against external disturbances and gives the over-saturated senses protective time to regenerate.

Today was certainly not the last day I will reach for ""Cap d'Ambre's"" fine accompaniment.
I do enjoy these quiet tones that pleasantly weave through gray days with golden, softly glowing light."
The Original,09/22/2020,FvSpee,M,323,,45,"Colonial Goods XI: Quite much, and perhaps a little confusing!","This cologne, which I would have classified as rather unknown, yet has 180 owners here, is a bit exhausting. The unknown artist who created it packed five scents into this compact bottle that overlap with each other, and the olfactory impression depends on the respective nasal perspective, much like a moiré pattern.

Fragrance No. 1: A classic Farina cologne. With bergamot, neroli, lemon, and lavender, it has almost everything. Nice and fresh, well done.

Fragrance No. 2: A white-synthetic, freshly-laundered scent in the style of Byredo's Blanche and LM's Chemise Blanche; this impression is the dominant one in the first minutes; responsible here are the thick, fat, plump aldehydes along with geranium and lavender (yes, the lavender is used twice, just like in a moiré pattern).

Fragrance No. 3: A green powerhouse from the 70s/80s (with chest hair); responsible here, of course, is the note that is as characteristic of this type of fragrance as patchouli is for hippies: the clary sage, found in all major men's fragrances of this era (Antaeus, Paco Rabanne, Kouros, Cacharel Homme, Zino, Azzaro pour homme, YSL pour Homme, Aigner Super Fragrance for men) along with predecessors (Aramis, 1964) and modern reinterpretations (Tomo, Honos). And alongside the clary sage, of course, it also holds true here: No moss, no glory.

Fragrance No. 4: A dirty, masculine rose scent (geranium, incense, leather, vetiver, earthy patchouli).

Fragrance No. 5: A conciliatory, moderately sweet, yet still very masculine base note pleaser (after a hard day for men, it’s nice to relax): musk, sweet patchouli, sandalwood.

This is a bit heavy for the wearer to digest (perhaps for the surrounding world as well), but there is (just barely, with a groan and creaking in the beams) a coherent overall picture where the scent does not fall apart. In any case, it gives the fragrance a distinctive character.

I see the same polyvalence in the (strange) name ""G-man."" The following layers of meaning come to mind:

No. 1: The men's scent from G like Gainsboro (as a short form for Gainsborough, the Swiss brand that no longer exists independently but is supposedly attached to Juvena, is said to be named after the British landscape painter).

No. 2: A play on words with G-spot, which I won’t elaborate on here, let your imagination run free.

No. 3: A scent for G- (gentle) men.

No. 4: A scent as tough as a G-man (gangster slang for hard-nosed FBI agents = Government Men).

Edit: No. 5: More for fun and to make it five: A scent for ze G-er-man. Edit end.

For those who want to embark on this roller coaster: Go ahead! I find it a very exciting and highly original fragrance. Whether the enthusiasm with which I (against my usual habit) made an immediate purchase at an online perfumery after testing today was perhaps a bit hasty will show. With about 25 euros, however, the loss would also be bearable."
The Original,02/17/2023,Cestus,M,2,,48,In Honor of a Very Special Man…,"… this is my first review on Parfumo. I specifically chose this fragrance for it.

It was a mild sunny spring morning, sometime in my life at the age of 15. I was at my grandparents' house, where I loved to spend my time. I wandered through the hallway in the apartment to get to the kitchen for breakfast.
The first rays of sunshine streamed through the bathroom window onto the brown tiles of the hallway, fine dust particles floated through the air, and the birds chirped loudly.
In front of the sink, with the door open, stood my grandfather in freshly ironed pleated trousers, house slippers, lowered suspenders, and he wore a fresh pure white ""fine ribbed undershirt."" His silver-white hair was combed back with Seborin. In his hand was his safety razor, looking into the mirror, one could hear the scratching of the stubble as the blade glided over it.

“Moin Obba!” I called and waved my hand. “Mooooin!” he grumbled and continued with his morning routine.

I entered the kitchen, and it smelled wonderful of coffee. My grandma sat freshly dressed and smelling of 4711 in the kitchen. Around her neck was an amber necklace that has burned itself into my frontal lobes. The radio was playing, on the table: the Hanauer Anzeiger and perfectly jam-spread bread. My grandma was an artist at that.

“Moin Omma!” I replied to her with a gentle smile. A short hug and a kiss on the cheek… “Aaaaay mein Bub!” she responded. I sat down on the bench, took a sip of coffee, and started to eat a piece of bread.
A few minutes later, my grandpa joined us at the table. Freshly shaved, suspenders in place, still wearing the bright white fine ribbed shirt. The white curly chest hair slightly peeked out from the wide neckline. He took the newspaper and flipped directly to the sports section.
At that moment, a scent came to me that I will never forget…

It was this very Gainsboro G-Man… So multifaceted… Strong, spicy, fresh, slightly sweet, masculine!

Me: “Wow Obba, what are you wearing!?”
Grandpa: “My scent, the Gainsboro. Do you like it?”
Me: “Absolutely! What is it?”
Grandpa: “Of course! Your mother loves the scent too! Even as a little girl!”

So I jumped up, went to the bathroom, and at the sink stood the dark bottle with its distinctive gold print. I pulled off the cap and smelled the bottle again. “This is it!” *sniff… *sniff… “Absolutely amazing!” I immediately applied two sprays. Seventh heaven.

Over the years, the scent faded from my memory. My grandparents passed away… At some point, I asked my mother what “de Obba” always used as aftershave. She pronounced the name, and immediately it shot through my mind like a lightning bolt. Including flashbacks.

Shortly after, I searched for the scent and found it at Galeria Kaufhof. Even on sale. I immediately took a bottle and also got the shower gel.
By now, I wear this scent very often. So often that I have a bottle in my locker at work.

My interpretation: Floral, spicy, fresh.
The opening is definitely characterized by aldehydes; you can also notice the alcohol content, but that fades within a few minutes, revealing a fresh clean scent that somehow reminds me of a flower meadow, forest, and a slight citrus freshness.
After a certain maturity, it retains its floral character but becomes “spicier,” and a hint of sweetness reveals itself, but only very lightly.

On my skin, it doesn’t last long, maybe 1-2 hours, but that applies to almost all scents on me. On clothes, however, it is still well noticeable even after a hard day’s work. It’s like a good red wine. The riper it gets, the better it becomes. It is a very multifaceted scent that I cannot compare to anything else. It has a distinctive character with recognition.

Not a scent for the boys of today, definitely not. This is a scent for a real gentleman who wears it as a statement.

Like Superman, when his cape flutters in the wind, fists on his hips with bent arms, chest puffed out and extended. The slicked-back hair flutters in front of his forehead. And not to forget: The underwear, over the pants! That is also a statement.

Thank you, Grandpa! Through this scent, you still accompany me.

As the title says: “In Honor of a Very Special Man…”

Thank you for your attention."

Well-measured angelica bridges the gap between heaven and earth.
Wonderfully aromatic with slight citrus sprinkles reminiscent of lemon balm, it brings the earthy patchouli to bloom. The grass lay softly and sleepily and has now been awakened.

Oh, what a main accord!

Incense, angelica, and patchouli finely rounded off.
Green vetiver supports from the second row.
Everything is carried by glazed sandalwood.

Warmth, coolness, heights and depths, all of this the fragrance lovingly captures.

The Original,03/23/2017,Pluto,F,353,,20,Untamed and not watered down...,"Dear Precious recommended G-Man to me, she knows quite well what Mrs. Pluto likes. So I relied on her judgment, bought the fragrance blind, and gifted it. Heaven, what a fine chypre scent, finally a men's fragrance that comes untamed, rugged, and without any softener. And I’m giving it away, tzz, tzz. No worries, I’ve already bought it again - for Mr. Pluto.

The beginning is strong, very fresh, the aldehydes enhance the green bergamot and lemon note, the lavender gets a bit overshadowed. It continues with spicy rose geranium, briefly reminding me of Geranium Bourbon, but this scent was much gentler. I can also sniff out masculine, robust leather, while the incense is rather timid and stays softly in the background. It becomes increasingly soapy, very shaving cream soapy. My association is a small men's barbershop, with dark wooden panels on the walls, tattered newspapers on the shelf by the mirror, with a barber chair that still has a manual height adjustment, an endlessly chatting barber in a shabby apron, a straight razor in one hand, and a cigarette in the other. Along with the soap come a lot of musk and moss, the patchouli spreads the scent of earth, thus initiating the warm-spicy base.

G-Man is truly a rugged, spicy scent that strikes me as dynamic and incredibly attractive. The bottle, well, black, practical, good - just for guys. And a fragrance that is not bound to any season, perhaps just a tad too fresh for winter. The sillage is strong at first, quickly settling into a medium level, the longevity on me is about 5 hours, quite contrary to the rated longevity here - perhaps G-Man is a victim of reformulation or this is due to my cool skin.

Oh yes, I wear it occasionally too - ideal for conferences or meetings where a woman needs to assert herself, there’s no “sweetheart, up to here and no further…”

One more thing, it reminds me a little of Explosive by Aigner - just a tiny little bit..."
The Original,09/22/2016,Taurus,M,1164,,21,G-Point for Men,"Alright, the headline is provocative and it goes without saying that G-Man by Gainsboro is neither extremely stimulating nor euphoric.

Nevertheless, this Eau de Cologne has steadfastly and reliably established itself as an olfactory ""go-to"" for over 45 years.

Even though G-Man may seem relatively complex on paper, in practical life, there are three components that are absolutely characteristic of this fragrance and reveal themselves quite quickly.

On one hand, there is a fresh aldehyde/bergamot combo with a slight sharpness that evokes a bit of an association with a classic aftershave, while also providing the necessary kick.

Almost simultaneously, the geranium appears rather elegantly. It gives G-Man a light gentlemanly touch without drifting too much into the noble. A clever building block within the creation.

As a third layer and thus an interesting counterpoint to the fresh aldehyde/bergamot combo, a wonderfully soft dominant musk base emerges. This ultimately remains, although one wishes for much more endurance from the top note to give this congenial liaison further lift. Unfortunately, you can't have it all.

The comparison to Etienne Aigner No. 2 as a fragrance twin is not far-fetched at all, as both are nearly established musk monsters, although the refreshing prelude of G-Man along with the geranium appears to be quite fascinating.

Another advantage is this sinfully low entry price - especially when I always see those huge shower gel bottles for little money.

However, all the curious should double-check their birth date on their ID and perhaps ask their conscience whether they possess the necessary maturity for this fragrance. Otherwise, enjoy!"

The Original,12/21/2012,Yatagan,M,415,,16,A Bed in the Cornfield,"How does one approach a fragrance about which one of the most renowned German fragrance experts once said it is ""a loner among men's fragrances with its pronounced hay note""? And what might be hidden behind a ""hay note""?

I actually expected anything but to find G-Man among the 100 most popular men's fragrances on this site. G-Man is indeed robust, albeit with a sweet base; he is quirky, full of fragrant contradictions, and demanding. The fact that such a fragrance is ultimately quite popular shows that there must be a strong desire for original men's fragrances that stand out from the monotony of most contemporary compositions. After all, G-Man is from the early 70s and has thus survived all the trends in between: from the musky scents (mid-70s) to powerhouse perfumes (80s), from leather notes (somehow always making a comeback) to the sporty-fresh colognes that have olfactorily pursued us since the 90s.

If the fragrance can be associated with a hay note, it seems to me that it refers less to the grassy, green smell of freshly cut hay, but rather to the scent that hay emits when it is dried, interspersed with many meadow flowers that are preserved under the sun but still exude a hint of fragrance. This comparison has always made sense to me, even in the absence of other compelling associations.

It is hard to guess where the soft notes in the base have gone. Where is the musk, the sandalwood oil, and the leather note? One must give the fragrance a lot of time to decipher the code of this hidden base note. For me, G-Man consists almost entirely of classic top and heart notes, meaning components that are rather fresh, a bit sharp, but also floral in nature.

The fragrance pyramid on this site reveals that, in addition to geranium, frankincense is also included. And that could be the key to understanding this fragrance. In fact, the strong contrast between frankincense, which is usually softly embedded in other fragrances or competes little with other components (see Comme des Garcons Avignon and Kyoto), is likely responsible for the contrasting and tension-filled nature of this cologne.

The fruity, hesperidic notes in the opening remain well recognizable even after a long time: neroli, lavender, bergamot. They dominate the fragrance alongside the frankincense-geranium axis in the heart note.

Anyway: This composition unites fragrance accents that have never been combined in this way in other fragrances. Therefore, it can indeed be said that this cologne is a loner. Certainly, this is not a fragrance for everyone and not one for every occasion. While G-Man is neither strictly for everyday wear nor for the evening, one must be in the right mood to endure the tensions that characterize the fragrance. This presupposes that one is somewhat relaxed, has a desire for an extraordinary scent, and perhaps also wants to stand out just a little bit.

When I smelled the hay note, I immediately thought of Jürgen Drews' overplayed hit ""Ein Bett im Kornfeld"": also from the 70s and not always bearable. However, in the right mood, it can actually be quite amusing."
The Original,10/12/2018,ShaunBaker,M,103,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Vintage Rules,"G-man, a relentlessly masculine scent since time immemorial.
As far back as I can remember, it has been the signature fragrance of one of my uncles; by the way, it was also the only fragrance he owned and still owns today.
It's actually funny that this particular scent has not noticeably been reformulated to this day and stubbornly remains on the market. However, I am not surprised, as G-man simply has its qualities. Whether it's the black-violet bottle with golden lettering that feels good and valuable in hand, or the scent itself, it is a must-have for a man!

Immediately after spraying, an extremely soapy bouquet unfolds, which needs to sort itself out. Shortly thereafter, however, the other notes come to the fore, primarily the dominant geranium that stands out strongly here, yet never seems exaggerated. I would have suspected clove here; I'm surprised that none is listed, perhaps this aroma comes from the interplay of the ingredients...
As the scent develops further, the musk and sandalwood come through well, forming the foundation. Here, G-Man does not change much anymore, but it surprisingly lasts quite long on the skin for a cologne, and the sillage is also not bad for hours.
For me, G-Man is a statement. You feel very well-groomed and comfortable after a shower and shave!

Its scent twin Aigner No.2 unfortunately cannot quite keep up here, even though it is not bad; I still see G-Man at the top.

The Original,06/13/2018,Minigolf,F,2512,,14,Variations in Chypre,"Or: a versatile wandering chypre could be called ""G Man"".
All the fragrance notes seem to revolve around a center: the rose geranium, fresh-rosy and slightly minty. Like planets around the sun. In the ""initial stage"" of the scent, lavender and clary sage form a ""double system"" that approaches the rose geranium and then slowly drifts away again, without staggering ""out of space"".
Thus, frankincense gains a bit of momentum, without really racing by. It approaches leisurely and remains perceptibly at a respectful distance.
Yes, I almost forgot the aldehydes. They enhance the scent structure, make it stable and long-lasting, without gaining the upper hand.
In their ""sphere,"" the ingredients typical of chypres also feel at home.
The moss with its green ""orbit,"" the patchouli that reminds of the ""earthly,"" sandalwood, and vetiver join in the ""carousel game"" and move in waves around the center.
Musk is as important for ""G. Man"" as the moon is for the earth. It maintains the stability of the system and causes
fresh-animal tides.
Birch tar greets from the dark void. The whole thing not only has its own movements circling around a center, it moves as a whole into unknown expanses and depths.

The Original,04/02/2013,Terra,M,646,,0,When Men Were Allowed to Be Men,"Once again, I've made a truly beautiful fragrance discovery here.

I don't think such things are produced anymore today. Nowadays, men shave their chests and sometimes even their legs; if they have a beard, it's often trimmed to millimeter precision like the hedge in a community garden, and instead of aging with dignity, they buy anti-aging creams and tinting shampoos.

I feel like I don't belong to this time or this trend. Three-day stubble, hair on the chest. And I often believe that one becomes more attractive with age.

Perhaps this explains why I feel very comfortable with this fragrance - and why I feel absolutely uncomfortable and out of place with scents like One Million, etc. - and this at just 25.

In the first few seconds, the scent starts off alcoholic/aftershave-like and then develops into what I imagine a typical men's fragrance to be. Herbal but not too heavy; not sweet, but also flattering; spicy but not oriental; fresh but not lemony.
I can't really pick out any of the individual notes here. But I find that absolutely okay. A successful overall work of art - and I wish that nowadays people would dare to create something like this again.

The sillage deceives one into thinking it's subtle. However, with not particularly careful dosing, others can still perceive G-Man from meters away, even when you yourself find it harmless. The longevity is unbelievable for a cologne. From 6 AM to 9 PM, the old Gainsboro was well noticeable until I went to shower. Some EdPs could take a lesson from that. The scent suits a man in a T-shirt and jeans just as well as it does a man in a suit. Just please, no 15-year-old teen.

Whether I'm too young for it... I don't know. But I feel comfortable with it."

The Original,09/18/2012,Jensemann,M,217,HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Stones de Pissoir,"Exactly! Urinal stones! That's what ""G-Man"" by Gainsboro smells like!

Let's rewind time a bit.

I often used ""No.2"" by Aigner as shower gel back then. But only as shower gel. Never as a fragrance, as I didn't feel old enough for that yet. The short burst of freshness in the shower had to suffice.
At some point, I could no longer find ""No.2"". By chance, I then saw the shower gel by Gainsboro, which looked similar to ""No.2"". I smelled the bottle and thought to myself: ""This smells almost like Aigner No.2!""

Almost, but I indulge in memories... nowadays, I believe you can hardly find these urinal stones in porcelain urinals anymore, can you?

At least I need to turn back time. I still remember clearly, back when my dad was in the bowling club, and the ESI guys were rolling a quiet ball again, and took us kids along on the weekends. ESI... a brief explanation: ""Einer Steht Immer""... the name of the bowling club.

So, we had touched the sponge to moisten our hands a few times, rolled the ball between the pins, and ordered another Spezi. Spezi naturally puts pressure on the bladder, so the gentleman also has to go for a little girl and heads to the men's restroom.

Of course, you wanted to use the urinal like the grown-ups... back then it was difficult, but today it's no problem anymore. And now we come to the point... back then, these urinal stones were probably used more often in the urinals.

Why not anymore today?? I always found the scent awesome. Yes, awesome! And I stand by it!

And G-Man smells exactly like those stones, and at today's price of €29.50 for 100ml, I jumped at the chance.

Today, I won't say anything about the fragrance notes, as I can't sniff anything anyway. No... today I'm just indulging in memories... memories of bowling, balls, sponges, and.... urinal stones."

My impression is an extremely unpleasant, sour smell of ""very old man"",
I could hardly wait to get home from work and wash it off.

So due to the excitement, I am editing this again:
Of course, I have read the guidelines, and under ""Style"" it says the following:
""It is completely indifferent whether you want to analyze more objectively or express your personal experiences with the fragrance.""
I have done the latter, and I must correct myself, I find it quite factual and to the point, below it says it smells like toilet stone aroma - but still somehow positive, I thought it smelled like old man, and I found that very unpleasant and if I explain it more precisely now, it won't get any more positive: nursing home, hospital were the things that emotionally came to mind. By the way, I am 48 and felt about 40 years older with this product on.

I should mention that I have succumbed to G-Man by Gainsborough, his charisma and power, and have become a loyal follower for many years. A fragrance composition like I could only imagine in my dreams, perhaps it was conceived and created in them as well. Developed in the noble barrique (bottle), it unfolds its precious bouquet (scent), impressive in the finish (longevity) and glowing red like lava (sillage), you acquire a friend for life.

The Original,05/30/2015,Sniffler,M,51,,9,Powdered Soap of the Old School,"What a soapy scent! Just from that, one can guess from which era G-Man originates.
A fragrance that is certainly not for everyone. Normally, I am not someone who believes that certain scents can only be worn by older gentlemen (I have been wearing Tabac Original for almost 2 years at 22), but G-Man can, may, and should only be worn by older men. Without the appearance of an older gentleman, G-Man simply would not come across as authentic enough.

Now to the scent itself. It is truly astonishing that G-Man is supposed to be ONLY an Eau de Cologne. To me, it is as strong as an Eau de Toilette.
G-Man starts off spicy and leathery. After a while, it begins to turn powdery, but not in the sweet and soft way like Dior Homme. No, no! It is a bitter and old-fashioned powderiness, combined with the soapy note that makes G-Man truly an ""old-schooler""! After a long-lasting presence, the powdery note fades, but the soapiness remains until the end. The moss and leather notes then slowly fade away.

One day I will wear it. G-Man, we will meet."

The composition is so harmonious that I can pick out the individual notes, yet they are excellently intertwined.

G-Man meant nothing to me until a few weeks ago.
I was in a perfume store and the scent was behind me, SALE...
I tried it quickly, just on a paper strip.
It wasn't my thing at all, very herbal.
The matter was settled. (I thought).

User Terra suggested I test Azzaro and G Man, as they should be good in terms of longevity.
Azzaro was okay, but I didn't like it that much, too herbal and somehow it was missing something.

I didn't buy G Man blindly; I tested it on my SKIN first!
I must say, I was thrilled after just a few minutes!
The first encounter with G Man wasn't great, but on my skin, it was a difference between day and night.

The scent.
Herbal yet fresh, I wouldn't say old school but for people with taste. ;-)

The longevity.
For an EdC, top!
I definitely perceive it for 4 hours.

I will buy the scent again and also other products, aftershave, etc.

The Original,01/09/2014,ILTIS,M,22,,1,Ultra-Masculine Classic with a Soap Aroma,"Thanks to a tip from a friend and the rather good yet ambivalent comments, I've been circling around G-Man by Gainsboro for two weeks now and have tested it repeatedly... The perfume initially smells very harsh, dry, and piercing, somewhat like the yellow toilet blocks you might remember from old urinals....

One might think that can't be pleasant, but if you don't smell it directly on the skin, but from a certain distance, the perfume smells completely different.... noble, soapy, masculine, and simply good....

When smelled directly on the skin, I find that the perfume doesn't really register... it smells somewhat chemical, like gunpowder or somewhat metallic... I find that very unfortunate, as the scent from a distance is much more harmonious than the skin scent... this makes it less pleasant for the wearer, or at least for me, almost exhausting. You think, wow, who smells so good when the wind blows from the opposite direction, but when you smell it directly on the skin, you think (or I do...), who or what stinks here?

The scent strikes me as a mix of Aigner No. 2 and Kouros, which also has that toilet block aroma. All very masculine and very successful perfumes, but not so easy to wear in today's times. Among the three, I find Aigner No. 2 the most agreeable, as it becomes softer in the end and the toilet block aroma is hardly noticeable here.

Nevertheless, I find G-Man very interesting and at prices around €19 for 100 ml EDT plus shower gel, I can hardly resist a purchase. It is a true classic, so complex that one can hardly unlock the individual notes. With this different scent effect for the wearer and bystanders, it comes off almost modern.... similar effects can be found in modern fragrances with Iso-E-Super or Ambroxan... they also come across quite differently for the wearer than for those around them...

Longevity and sillage are insane for an old classic and outshine many EDPs by far."

Comfort Scents - Clean Cotton,10/17/2011,KarateArwen,F,14,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Mon Cherie,"This fragrance reminds me of my youth. Back then, we often had Mon Cherie by Ferrero for my mom. Of course, as an 8-year-old, I wasn't allowed to drink alcohol, but I found the pink glittery paper in which the praline was wrapped so beautiful that I had to try the precious drop (hic : ) ) Naturally, I didn't like the cherry flavor. At first, the scent strongly reminds me of this childhood association. Alcohol in which cherries have been drowned (top note). After that, the fragrance develops very elegantly. The vanilla stands out and blends the skin molecules into a delicate skin scent. In the dry down, I still perceive a hint of cocoa that makes the fragrance more lasting. Musk gently caresses the spirit. The scent is very delicate and very refined. Unfortunately, it is no longer available."
Skin & Vanilla,07/14/2015,ColinM,M,516,,11,Dreamy barbershop,"First, the good news: if you want my opinion, I see almost no difference between the “vintage” and the more recent version of Dreamer. I said “almost” so I’m not saying they’re identical – the vintage smells a bit more natural, slightly darker and smoother, without the synthetic harshness of the recent (current?) version you can smell loud and clear at its very opening; but since in a matter of minutes it goes away and the scents perfectly “tunes in”, I think the two versions are 99% equivalent overall – just use a little patience with the more recent one. The drydown is pretty much identical, I surely don’t get any “ruined” juice as I read online about the current version. This said, the scent itself is just an excellent piece of modern perfumery. Almost nondescript for me, and it took me a while to “understand” it: it smells just really beautiful, uplifting and terribly pleasant. I don’t get how did they make it precisely, but all works perfectly. I smell tobacco (cigarette type), lavender, spices (Jaipur Homme’s kind of Oriental, talc-infused sweet spices), a clever touch of something balsamic-green, but most of all I smell overall a fantastic feel of cleanliness, peace, fulfillment with a really peculiar “ambiance” halfway naturally and earthy, and so clean and slightly musky it almost smells futuristic.

I usually can’t stand reviews romanticizing scents and I try to avoid mentioning feelings and suggesting “images”, but this time I can’t help it, as Dreamer has a really strong evocative quality for me – evoking this sense of neat, clean, “natural versus artificial” brightness with a fantastic shade of “barbershop” notes and a touch of Oriental mystery. The way they’re blended makes the difference here, Dreamer is incredibly harmonic and compact, there’s just a perfectly consistent unique smell that smells of, well, “Versace Dreamer” and that’s it. This fragrance has them almost all – it’s elegant, versatile, but at the same time informal and fun, and has a really nice set of shades and a subtle “enigmatic” vein, I guess due to its Oriental notes. An easy-going but fascinating “chiaroscuro”. Plus I think it brilliantly takes inspiration from several families of perfumes – from classic tobacco-floral fragrances like Zino Davidoff, to dandy Oriental gems like Jaipur Homme, both under a decidedly “younger”, more modern light. An outstanding work of synthesis of many diverse inspirations, brilliantly projected into the future. Excellent creativity, excellent skills to give it shape. But above all, it smells just fantastic – the vintage version does it since the very first spray, with the recent one you’ve to wait some 15-20 minutes, but then it works as good as the previous one. Easily the nicest Versace ever for men, together with L’homme from 1984 (which is as good as conventional and a bit outdated for me though, while Dreamer is way more timeless – or more precisely, completely “out of time”).

Skin & Vanilla,08/24/2012,Ysbrand,M,84,,10,A maddening enigma,"There are very good reasons for owning a bottle of Versace´s The Dreamer, starting with the bottle itself. It is stunning, with that acid finished Medusa, the greek gold frieze ornament... from all the perfumes of the brand this one channels the most the spirit of Gianni Versace and the golden age of fashion and supermodels. It is unique and alluring.

It has a very fresh start, aromatic lavender and citrus, astringent and invigorating... i particularly enjoy the election of mandarin in this case over other citrics, because its rusty bitterness doesnt feel soo clean and high pitched. Just sprayed, it has a powerful fougere identity, but very soon comes the twist: a warm sensual wave of tonka bean arises to stay until the very end. The Dreamer gives the wrong impression of hesitating between an honest, butch, down-to-earthyness and a pretty, seductive sensuality, and challenges you to figure out. The dry sharp edges of the lavender end in flowery lily petals. It is and adorned macho. I see this easily as a shared fragance, and ecourage ladies to try it.

The fragance as it evolves, looses the pungent aromatic coolness, but gains in herbaceousness: the geranium leaf takes place, strong and muscular. But in this riddle, the sweet tobacco becomes more apparent turning the fougere into something else, calmly sweet,powdery and enveloping.

I feel i am now watching a skyscape, the clouds slowly shapeshift in front of my eyes and get me in a true dreamy mood... In this mid stage ,along with the make-up type of iris root and the dry sweet tobbaco flower, there is an incredibly cacthy, intoxicating scent, that smells synthetic (to me this is not bad) like vynil or play-doh. This rare artificial accord is bitter and conforting and merges seamlessly in the fragance. Is it tarragon? pistachio? what is this?

Sometimes you smell a clean body after the gym, sometimes you smell lipstick, or gasoline.

In the late drydown it gets woodier and ambery, but the balmy touch stays, like an interrogation mark.

As for the longevity , you will wake up the next morning with a drydown that will still keep the full identity of the fragance. Projects very well. The quality of The Dreamer in terms of ingredients and originality is remarkable.

The Dreamer has a soul that feels inspired by art and antiquity, but , as the starry print of the box implies, looks in the eyes of the future and the unexplored galaxies. He is a seeker of beauty and a nerdy kid...and when he looks up to the night sky, sees both the planets and astronomical object as well as the mythologies of the constellations... The Dreamer is a designer, a model, an adventurer and an astronaut."
Skin & Vanilla,09/09/2018,Elysium,M,898,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Moments of Intense Fear Mixed with Extreme Euphoria,"Dream on! Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, sing with me, if it's just for today, maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away. Dream on! Dream On! - Aerosmith.

I've owned a bottle ever since it debuted in 1996, to replace my previous cologne Solo Soprani. Pretty good segue, considering it was considered a light scent and not too dangerous. To this day, I must have a bottle to go back to and ""remember."" That's why I recently decided to buy it once more when I saw it online for a funny price around 20 something bucks.
The Dreamer depicts the essence of this perfume very nicely because when I wear it, I feel like I'm floating between the dream and the real world. Some notes are pulling me to one side like the clean and light opening, and others like sweet and smoky dry-down to the other. Oh, man! What a beautiful fragrance. It's is one of those fragrances that makes you stop dead in your tracks, in the best possible sense, so unusual, so creative, and just so damn good, in my opinion. I like it when I smell a risky fragrance, one that was not designed to sell to the average consumer, one that is controversial, one that receives complete contradictory reviews. I've concluded that I adore challenging fragrances, and this is no exception if you like Dreamer, another outstanding one to try is L'eau Bleue D'Issey. Man or woman, yes woman, wear this if you want to stand out from the crowd and bask in your uniqueness!

The Dreamer is something of a hybrid between fougère, oriental, and gourmand. It's remarkably light, yet crisp, with hints of sweetness and richness throughout, with that 90's cleanliness keeping it all in check.
The opening is like when you first open a pack of cigarettes, I'm not a smoker, but I always loved the smell of unlit cigarettes, a gorgeous sweet fresh tobacco scent. It is a sheer opening, both warm and refreshing at the same time. which gently enwraps and gives a pleasant sensation of well-being. It is very aromatic, bitter sage and floral lavender blend magically with spicy tarragon, juniper grains, and poisoning artemisia. It's harsh but settles down to a comforting and warm male floral.

The oriental aromatic heart combines notes of waxy and soapy lily and powdery iris that blend in with the amber very smoothly. It's got the fluffy powdery floral note that has a smokey woody masculine undertone. The iris stands out a little more loudly as a member of The Dreamer's heart, with the token geranium and an almost invisible touch of rose rounding it out. It can be cumbersome and in your face in time. Overall, It's got the good, the bad, and the ugly layering all in one. The old formulation was quite powdery. The new one is less powdery and more floral.

The dry down is the most stunning I have smelt in a long time. It has that lovely sweet tobacco smell, with what kind of scents like vanilla and musk, animal musk if you feel it close to your skin. It's that glorious leafy tobacco flanked by tonka and amber, with literally nothing else to get in the way, with maybe cedar aftertouch bringing in some sustain. The tobacco isn't of the already-dried or smoked variety like with some scents, and more of the ""raw leaves and blossoms in the sun"" kind of feel, lending it an outdoorsy vibe that its other ingredients don't suggest. By the time this reduces to the skin, all you smell are tobacco, amber, coumarin, and wisps of those aqueous florals, including the potent iris coming up for encores when the air hits just right.

The more I smell the Dreamer, the more I fall in love with it. It is the rare fragrance that is beautiful and interesting in all of its phases, although I like the dry down the best. It is unusual, ever-changing, and mysterious. I find myself smelling my wrists very often when I'm wearing this. I do this because it offers a moment of serenity, of inner peace, that takes me away from the bustle and stress of everyday life. It has a gorgeous bottle I might add too, with one of the more unique integrated sprayers I've seen, which becomes the cap rather than fits inside the lid like most of this type. The usual Mediterranean business adorns the cap otherwise, and the bottle itself features the classic Versace Medusa head.

Fall and winter are the best times for The Dreamer. Sillage and longevity are average, so it's going to take some reapplication for an entire day's use, but if you keep this to evenings and weekends, it will get you through all right. If you were going to get just one tobacco-themed designer scent and didn't want to break the bank on something from an exclusive line, this would be a pretty strong contender for that pick. In the wise words of Aerosmith: Dream On!

Skin & Vanilla,03/14/2023,Mitchcraft,M,36,,11,Sweet dreams are made of these.,"There is something about this fragrance that makes me feel so comfortable and relaxed. I would have said it was the lavender but it has been reformulated and there is no lavender in it anymore.
Still this fragrance has the ability to make me feel like i am wrapped up in a bed of soft feathers and ready to dream away.

I often spray this at night when i am having trouble sleeping and feeling stressed as i toss and turn trying to get my much needed beauty sleep. It just says to me, soft, comfortable linin and at the same time there is something masculine about it which i think could be the tobacco flower.

Some people called the original the washing machine detergent fragrance because of all the lavender scented detergents out there today and is probably why they changed things up a bit because you don't want that to be the association of the last fragrance that was created by Versace himself before his untimely passing. Even though the lavender is not there anymore there is still a resemblance to that kind of scent which is probably why people get that feeling of relaxation and comfort from it.

The Dreamer has this ability to transform the way your clothing feels. You could be wearing that horrible scratchy wool everyone hates, but with one spray of this it would make it feel like you are suddenly wearing some of the softest materials on Earth. It really is amazing how this fragrance works on more than just the sense of smell by affecting other senses also. I find i feel like my skin is softer when i wear this.

I love the bottle with the frosted medusa head, it looks very classy and the atomizer is one of, if not the best in my collection. Both in the design and the performance from it as it gives out an amazing blast of juice that is well distributed.

The price is amazing, you can always find it on sale at reputable stores from the RRP of roughly £50 for 100ml down to roughly £25 and it is absolutely worth it.

It's not something you will find yourself wearing on a night out because longevity is just not there so unless you have a way to bring it with you and keep respraying you are always going to find something else in your collection for that purpose. No, this is for as i said previously at night, relaxing at home as i often see many other people say they use this every night before they go to bed as it makes them have a good nights sleep and it definitely has a great name for such a thing.

When i first got it i couldn't help keep respraying it i loved it that much but now i like to keep it for those nights where i am feeling anxious about something as it will instantly have that calming affect on me.

If you don't have this in your collection you should go for it because for the price i don't think you will find anything else quite like it. I have a number of fragrances that smell similar in some way to each other, but i can't say the same about The Dreamer."
Skin & Vanilla,12/28/2013,Scentemental,M,29,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Camphorous Tobacco,"The Dreamer was a fragrance that I was not overly fond of when I first tried it. The combination of the aromatic, camphorous accord which results from lavender and juniper and the sweetness seemed to clash with the underlying tobacco note.

I had the same reaction to Bogart pour homme, which is similar in that it is a sweetened tobacco fragrance and it took me a while before I ""got it"". It seems a strange thing to say that I did not understand the fragrance, after all shouldn't it be the case that either I like it or not? To answer this hypothetical question, it must be pointed out that senses can be tricked, there are optical illusions so why not olfactory ones? In fact perfumery relies on them.

The Dreamer is not a straight forward scent: it is complex and takes time to appreciate it. The lavender and other notes which give this a sweet camphorous edge battle with the tobacco and leafy notes at the beginning giving it a bit of a chaotic start, but when they subside slightly the tobacco becomes more obvious and the scent becomes more balanced. The initial sweet notes continue to fade for a long time like the gradual diminishing of the light in summer.

The fragrance lasts very well and has good projection.

I like The Dreamer very much and am glad I persevered with it."

Which is un-apologetically Loud, Crude, and yet Sentimental. A date night scent worthy of a truck-stop diner!

Skin & Vanilla,03/23/2023,Ineed1936,M,44,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Gianni Versace last creation!,"Oh boy, first of all, Versace Dreamer was Gianni Versace last creation, back in 1996, for his own house, Gianni Versace/departament: Versace Profumi.
He would be murdered a year later, in 1997, and the history was written.
This was an bold and very creative creation. An neo/ mid 90s fougere with accent on tobacco flower and original leaves, mixed to perfection with lavender, neroli/petitgrain, some dusty sandalwood or some woods on the back bone and of course something that creates that sophisticated aura thats still original, even after 27 years, now...
I aint know the older bottles, but certanly i know the current 2011 and up formulation.
Its great, but i wish i had an old bottle, older than 2010, to see there are some changes or not.
All in all, a very stilysh fragrances, perfect longevity, beautiful aura sillage and projection, for those who needed.

Skin & Vanilla,11/13/2020,Smellavision,M,205,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A very appropriate name indeed...,"Complex and multifaceted. Florals, pipe tobacco, amber, spices and soapy tonka.
Dreamer opens with a pretty vinagrette-like bittersour chemical blast of... tobacco? Comes on sort of like a smoky wet dog or wool. Passing through the heart you slowly enter the realm that in my (and apparently also others) opinion is the best part, the drydown. It's kinda oriental and in this stage I find it to have some slight similarities to the original D&G pour Homme.

No doubt, this scent is pretty unique and probably was even more so when it was first released. There's no way you can complain about the performance vs. price ratio here, as it's quite cheap to get a hold of most places, but also even in the newer formulation very powerful in regards to both sillage and longevity - sometimes bordering on nuclear, depending on setting and temperatures. No doubt this will be cloying in the summertime, but quite fitting for a winter or fall evening.

Overall, I'd say that I used to like it but since I got Feuilles de Tabac by Miller Harris I feel that FdT is a more contemporary version of Dreamer, without the sort of old-schoolish Versace PH vibe.

Still, this one holds his own."
Skin & Vanilla,10/13/2025,Dieguiniam,M,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Polarizing,"I don’t know anyone who has a neutral opinion on this perfume, it’s either an underrated gem or a stinky mess, no in between. I happen to fall in the former camp.

I’ll give the haters one thing: the opening is not great. There is something muddy, messy and harsh about it that it’s sadly gonna turn must people away. It’s kinda like hot glue mixed with some sort of cleaning product, but if you let it dry down for a couple minutes then the magic starts to happen. The mid of this fragrance is something truly hypnotic, as someone said in a different review, it smells purple, like purple clouds to be exact, it is truly entrancing. The dry down is a bit less interesting but it is still quite good, it just smells sweet and fluffy. The name The Dreamer truly describes what this fragrance smells like.

This is an outsider in the current landscape of fragrances for men. It’s a masculine floral, it smells feminine, and it smells old. In a world dominated by fresh blue fragrances and gourmands this has no place, but that’s what makes it more unique. It takes the right kind of man to pull off The Dreamer in this day and age, but if that sounds like you then you should try it out, it’s super cheap.

I’d be lying if I said I was always in the mood for this, it is not a dumb reach and it needs just the right weather to shine, but when I do wear it it becomes my favorite fragrance during the couple hours it lasts.

Please give it a chance if you can, embrace it, let it transport you. After a while even the stinky opening will become charming."
Skin & Vanilla,06/05/2018,Terente,M,33,,6,Classy gentleman,"The perfume of my youth! I lost it, but I rediscovered it! Wore it in the time when the name wasn't so much for me, but the smell itself.
I always imagined (me as a) Yves Montand, with its cigarette in the corner of the mouth, wearing this gem.
Tobacco note is peerless and the lavender complete it so good! Citrusy, fresh and cool. I can't get why some people said that it's sweet or unisex. Not sweet at all, on the contrary! Manly, yes! Classy and expensive smell, a piece of art from an italian more refined than french creators.
Bravo Versace!"
Skin & Vanilla,05/20/2019,HugoMontez,M,81,,4,The last Samurai.,"The Dreamer is a unique and special fragrance. So unique that even the tobacco is different from what you're used to. It's a tobacco flower based scent. Also, it's the last creation under the direction of Gianni Versace shortly before is assassination.
Another thing that is kinda mysterious is the note breakdown. You'll get a different note breakdown in every website. To me, Dreamer starts out very sour and synthetic, yet addictive! It drys down surprinsingly alluring and mysterious.
I remember the first time I smelled this one, i hated the opening. But after 10min I started to like it. I ended up buying a bottle. After 3 years I can say that I love this. It's definitely unique and dreamy.
Talking about the scent itself: I smell a herbal-aromatic note (juniper and tarragon) at the start. It's kinda harsh but vicious. After 10min the tobacco flower starts to bloom. After 1h the cumarin joins the game and the scent turns more sweet, alluring but still kind of floral.
This stage will be the ending one. The dream is over but not until the 10-12 hour mark. This one has great performance and strong projection in the first 2 hours. Also, it performs greatly on clothes as they will smell like The Dreamer for weeks! At this point, I don't know if this it's still in production but you can find it easily online and on many stores.
My advice? Grab a bottle now. It's very cheap (20-30€/100ml) and it's a fantastic scent. A true masterpiece. And the bottle is probably my favorite of all time!

Skin & Vanilla,01/03/2024,Castortroy,M,11,,4,Maybe my favorite fragrance,"I bought this as a blindbuy many years ago, I was attracted to the luxurious opulent bottle design. I love Versace clothes, furniture and fragrances.

This is by far the best fragrance from Versace I have ever smelled.

The first time I smelled this, there was no youtube, insta or fragrance influencers to already make up my mind on fragrances, I was really excited to smell this.

The scent is perfect. It projects really well from the start, and all I can smell is rich, soapy, creamy opulence. I have never smelled any other fragrance that smells this clean and soapy, Versace really nailed this.

Other fragrances that are supposes to have the same soapy-creamy scent, is nowhere near this masterpiece. They often have too much spices, cinnamon or are not that well blended. This is so smooth, and I have nothing bad to say about it. I wish it could last forever, the performance is pretty good, heavy projection for 3-4 hours and last up to 9 hours on my skin.

I want to wear this everyday, all year."

After i spray it on my skin, it becomes skin-nearly even in 30 minutes. Its not a perfume that people will notice you easily. The scent gives me a feeling of freshness, when I bought it the smell reminded me of the after shave smell when my grandpa left the bathroom when I was a child. About versatility, its very versatile, can be worn all seasons in my opinion. I blind bought it and i dont regret it. The only thing that i miss is that it could be more powerful in sillage longevity and projection as i mentioned above.

Skin & Vanilla,04/28/2021,AlterHerr,M,10,,49,Autumn Ripeness,"Disclaimer: I am an older gentleman in advanced retirement age who has worn fragrances for personal enjoyment throughout his life. I possess neither an analytical nose nor professional background knowledge, nor the urge to remain as objective as possible in reviews, as this seems hardly feasible with fragrances.

When the first days of August have passed, one sometimes sits at the evening garden table, enjoys a glass of Portuguese red wine, and reminisces.
One reflects on the summer, takes stock of whether one has used their brief time on earth wisely and meaningfully in the past weeks, and doesn’t even notice how the gaze is gently drawn to a dark corner of the garden, which, however, does not appear gloomy at all, but rather promising.
There, at the very end, still behind the vegetable beds and herbs, the most delicious blackberries on earth grow on an old fence - probably for over a hundred years.
And then one stands up, walks slowly over there, smells them, and looks forward to the small harvest of the coming weeks.

In my eyes, hardly any fragrance captures the garden theme as wonderfully as Versace's The Dreamer.
Its fruity sweetness has such a delicate charm that it almost creatively intertwines with the herbal aromas. I consciously do not want to pinpoint individual notes in this Eau de Toilette, but rather let the entire garden affect me.

Not one of those dreadful concrete gardens with DIY store potted plants in antique design pots, nor a over-designed show garden with koi ponds and wooden bridges - no, I am talking about a real garden like the ones found at grandparents' homes, where hundreds of colors and scents rain down on a small person, with cherry and apple trees, where cucumbers grow, the brown-yellow leaves of the trees cover the lawn, and old wooden planks rot on the bank of a small village stream.

Perhaps this image is as kitschy as the synthetic nature of this fragrance, perhaps because the present has become too hectic to allow such gardens with all their back-breaking work to survive, perhaps we sometimes react cynically to this form of niceness, and perhaps I love Versace's The Dreamer all the more for this reason.

It should be mentioned that this fragrance also seduces with one of the most tasteful bottles on the market and a very attractive price, without wanting to diminish the beauty of the actual scent in the slightest."
Skin & Vanilla,03/22/2016,Scorpio,M,118,,30,I had a Dream ....,"...and that was almost exactly 20 years ago. My God, where has the time gone? Back in 1996, while flipping through a magazine, I stumbled upon a small article. Versace was releasing a new fragrance. ""The Dreamer,"" what a name. And what a bottle! And what a price :-( Unaffordable for a student like me. I believe it cost almost DM 100.00.

I couldn't test it anywhere. No perfumery near me carried this scent. Very exclusive. So I didn't even know what it smelled like, yet I desperately wanted to own this fragrance. Finally, at Christmas, the moment arrived. Under the Christmas tree lay a small package, and inside... a pair of socks. Just kidding. Of course, it was ""The Dreamer."" A box that looked like a painting! Large, square, black, with blue in the middle (the Milky Way?), and golden stars shining everywhere. A bottle so beautiful that it could be displayed in a museum and a scent that smelled exactly as it was named. Powdery, sweet, very high-quality and sensual. So completely different from anything I had smelled before. I was overjoyed. I used ""The Dreamer"" for many years until I somehow / somewhere / sometime lost track of it. That's just how life is. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say. And sometimes that's for the best. Why? You might guess.

""The Dreamer"" is now produced by EUROITALIA. They only make junk. In other words, primitive slush. They ruined ""Blue Jeans"" too. The COTY of Italy. In the past, the company ""Giver Profumi Milano (Versace Profumi)"" was responsible for the Versace fragrances. But that must have become too expensive for the management. And where do you cut costs? Exactly! It's just a perfume, and the stupid customer won't notice anyway. HAH !!

You can now get ""The Dreamer"" for € 17.99 at Rossmann. A more than clear indication and the reason for this kind of open letter. All fragrances (excluding the teen brands) available at Rossmann are reformulated to the max. Dead scents. Empty shells adorned with the aura of big names. But they are what they are: cheap flirts. It pains my soul that my Dreamer has now become one of them. € 17.99 !! That's street corner.

I strongly assume that most here did not know the original scent, but only tested the shadow of it. Then I can understand the critical comments. The real Dreamer was a true Versace. The last fragrance of the master. Before he too went to the stars.....

Howgh - I have spoken"
Skin & Vanilla,06/03/2014,DuftJunkie,M,31,,26,A Journey Through Space and Time,"France. November 29, 1825. A boy is born in Paris. He is named Jean-Martin. He will one day revolutionize the field of expertise. No, not in perfumery. He will turn the world of conventional medicine upside down one day. We are talking about Jean-Martin Charcot.
In 1882, he becomes the chief physician of his own neurology ward at the Salpêtrière. The first in Europe, in fact. As a professor, he trains other doctors who later achieve great things as well. Georges Gilles de la Tourette (Tourette syndrome) is among his students, as is a certain Sigmund Freud (psychoanalysis). Charcot himself spends most of his time working on the phenomenon of hysteria alongside neurological fundamentals. When it comes to neurological insights, he is very successful and can identify (isolate) diseases such as MS, ALS, HMSN, Charcot's triad I and II, Erb-Charcot disease, and many others. His discoveries also have an impact on other areas of conventional medicine. His work on hysteria even influenced the development or reform of therapeutic approaches in alternative medicine. For in his research on hysteria, he often applied hypnosis. He believed that patients under hypnosis could detach themselves from the ""here and now"" and thus gain better insights into the backgrounds of their suffering. They are able to glide through ""space and time"" and ""dig up"" subconscious thoughts as well as memories from the distant past. We experience something similar when we dream.

""Dreams""; this also serves as a transition to ""Versace - The Dreamer"".
The alternative medicine has already been mentioned. Among other things, it includes the possibility of aromatherapy, which aims to treat physical or emotional disturbances using essences. Through aromas, one can also create trance sessions or guided imagery journeys. This very principle is utilized by The Dreamer. Certain ingredients are meant to put us into a dream state. Unfortunately, the main ingredient is not listed in the above fragrance description. Yet it is responsible for this imaginative journey. It is the clary sage. Clary sage is often used in aromatherapy for séances, where letting go and release are desired. It can also expand consciousness. The optimal condition for dreams or daydreams. On a physical level, it has a relaxing and antispasmodic effect. In Versace's Dreamer, clary sage is enriched with lavender and bergamot. These two essences share a chemical similarity with clary sage: the combination of linalyl acetate and linalool. They make up well over half of the respective oil, sometimes 90% or more. Furthermore, this note is developed into a chord with juniper, sage, and nutmeg. Especially nutmeg also has the ability to influence consciousness and even induce visions up to hallucinations (Hildegard of Bingen - ""Physica""). If various floral notes are added to this chord, it creates something like a base. But only almost. The most important component for forming a base is hidden in the base notes. The amber, presumably enhanced with tobacco, combines with the aforementioned chord to form a base. It is indeed a very harmonious base because clary sage in the fragrance resembles amber due to some molecules present in both aromas. It should also be noted regarding the floral notes that daffodil likely plays a certain role. Daffodil plays a role in aromatherapy, which is very desirable here. It helps to overcome self-imposed barriers and stimulates creativity. Even though I couldn't identify daffodil here, it is possible that it plays at least a minor role alongside geranium and other flowers. Through other ingredients, which cannot all be listed here due to space constraints, the end result is a perfume that lives up to its name.

Contrary to all previous assumptions and conjectures, this scent is more natural than synthetic. It's just that the linalyl acetate/linalool component in clary sage, lavender, and bergamot gives a slightly medicinal impression, which many noses classify as synthetic. However, it can be described as airy, sterile, and pure. Particularly lavender possesses this characteristic. So much so that the plant was named after it. Lavare means nothing other than ""to wash"".

Synthetic or not. Ultimately, The Dreamer is a fresh fougère with an emphasis on clary sage over a floral-spicy heart note. Most of the time, it is quite light and airy, and it fades away so airy thanks to the special amber note. A fragrance that, although composed for men, I believe women can wear just as well. It does remind one a bit of the eternal expanses of the universe. Just like a dream, hidden in the cosmos. So to speak: Behind the moon, just left, a few light-years away, past a black hole, where it is beautiful and full of love. And no fear of the black hole. Thoughts and dreams are not attracted to it.

The whole thing somewhat reminds me of music from the 80s. Neue Deutsche Welle. There was a ""Golden Rider"" over the city. A man saw the ""starry sky"". A woman saw ""99 red balloons"" drifting toward the horizon. Who knows, maybe with the help of ""The Dreamer,"" we can take off one day and be ""Completely Detached"" from the earth. On the way back from the ""Rocket in a Rush,"" we might bring back love. Like the girl from back then, who would later become Germany's most successful musician.

In accordance with the music that I feel reminded of, I hereby give an 80. Maybe more when I find my way back to earth. This refers to the missing earth note. A hint of moss or a bit more vetiver would be perfect. Because even after the sweetest dreams and the most beautiful imaginative journeys, time catches up with us ""somehow."" We usually only remember that we were ""somewhere"" not long ago. We wake up and have to get up ""sometime"" again. Then it would be very advisable to have solid ground under our feet. But this solid ground, the earth, is missing in this composition. But that is just a small drop of bitterness. Nobody is perfect.

In this sense: ""DREAM SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL"""
Skin & Vanilla,12/29/2019,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,17,Sleep-Inducing,"Today I discovered a package at my fragrance dealer with the label ""The Drummer"".

That fits perfectly with my drummer friend, who already has his birthday in January - barely after Christmas.

But the Versace scent reminds me of my dear friend's upcoming birthday celebration.

This Versace will delight my Little Drummer Boy.

As I take the little box in my hand, I decipher ""The Dreamer"".
But I'm also right about that, as my friend is a dreamy nature - a dreaming drummer, so to speak.

Dreaming and calm, a pleasant lavender note greets me - beautifully old school.
Also fitting, as my friend is a gentleman of the ""old school"".
He always brings flowers with him on every visit - quite chivalrous.

Tarragon and juniper appear subtly spicy.
Delicate floral notes mix in - rounded off by soft amber.

An unusual men's fragrance - gentle and masculine at the same time.

The calm that The Dreamer radiates also makes it a good bedtime treat - which will have a sleep-inducing effect.

Perhaps The Dreamer will also bring sweet dreams?"
Skin & Vanilla,11/26/2014,loewenherz,M,916,,19,The Bitter Sweetness of Life,"That was the title of a book and the miniseries based on it in the mid-80s, both extremely successful at the time. The content is of little importance; it was about the life’s work of an ambitious woman, about love, revenge, hatred, intrigues. Pure drama. And that is what Versace's (back then still Gianni, remember?) The Dreamer is all about. Drama. Life. Bitter. Sweet.

Versace was basically suspicious to me back then, and fundamentally, nothing has changed. Loud and nouveau riche, bling-bling, Medusa heads, practically Glööckler in the 90s, the bottle is quite harmless! And yet - The Dreamer was one of the first men’s fragrances that dared to be sweet, really sweet. There’s no comparison to the flood of cheap sweet scents that haunt us today - no, it’s definitely a rounded fragrance that develops - from floral-smoky (Lily! Who else used lily for men back then?) to fragrant-rough (Rose! That too! And tobacco!) to leaden-numbing sweet (Tonka! Amber! Cedar!). That was shocking, that was a surprise twenty years ago!

The Dreamer. It’s provocative, on the verge of vulgarity, no, actually beyond it. High longevity, sillage almost disturbing, synthetic aromas can do a lot when you let them. It lures, heats up, signals availability - 'will fuck on first date' to spray on. Yet it’s so comforting sweet, intimate and - yes, very beautiful - that one forgives it any cheapness. A scent for boys and not for men. Sweet like Bailey's. Porn. Unfortunately awesome.

Conclusion: in the words of Rosenstolz: 'I am now. I am here. I am me.'"
Skin & Vanilla,04/24/2020,Shahmr,M,3,,14,Surprisingly Excellent,"When thinking of the big fragrance houses and popular perfume brands, Versace is rarely mentioned at the beginning.

Like a timeless relic, whose era has long passed, yet seems to endure through all times. A scent that could waft over the fields and plains of Tuscany, as the wind rustles the dry stalks and carries the fine aroma of hay bales into the emerging night sky. The fragrance, which mingles with..."
Skin & Vanilla,05/05/2017,MrSmartGuy,M,6,,10,The Well-Groomed Man with a Cigarette in Hand,"That's exactly who I imagine when I spray the fragrance. Do you have him in mind as well? He sat at the bar with his friends all evening, but didn't talk much. He seems to be the quiet type who occasionally drifts off into his own world. However, he is usually up for a social evening. Beforehand, he shaves, showers, and quickly styles his hair to leave a well-groomed impression on those around him. Because that is important to him. He is around thirty years old. Now he stands up, puts on his leather jacket, and moves towards the door to get some fresh air. Once outside, he leans against the wall and lights a cigarette. It won't be long before he goes back inside.

These are the associations that the fragrance evokes in me, without wanting to drag it out. Dreamer is actually a very inoffensive, light fragrance. It smells a bit soapy to me, like soap flakes, and therefore partly reminds me - really only partly - of Mugler Cologne. But why do I say ""actually""? Because alongside the soapy base, spicy notes stand out, particularly a distinctly noticeable tobacco note for me. These notes make Dreamer what it is. There are days when I can spray this stuff 8 times and still find it very pleasant and light. On some days, however, the piercing tobacco note bothers me (as a non-smoker) so much that I have no desire for the fragrance. It is also due to the tobacco note that I envision this perfume more for going out or leisure time. Except on very warm days, you can actually wear the fragrance in any season. For some reason, I don't like to wear the fragrance when the sun is shining. It has to be either cloudy or already evening. Even on summer evenings, however, the fragrance should still be wearable due to its moderate sillage. The fragrance has been around for 21 years now and has probably been reformulated several times. However, I don't find it diluted. My 2016 batch lasts about 6-7 hours, with up to 4 hours of moderate sillage. After that, it becomes close to the skin.

So if a man simply wants to smell fresh and well-groomed, while also being in the mood for a cool tobacco note, Dreamer is recommended. By now, it is also quite affordable, which is probably due to the fact that it cannot keep up with current trends. To be honest, I have a better alternative for most occasions."
Skin & Vanilla,10/30/2011,Tetsuo,M,14,,16,My Feel-Good Scent,"I was very surprised that The Dreamer is declared as a purely masculine fragrance. In my opinion, it’s almost as unisex as it gets.
Right after spraying it on, I thought to myself that it was a bit too sweet, floral, and generally too feminine for my taste. However, The Dreamer then developed such a pleasant and soft scent that I couldn’t resist and bought it right away.

It is perfect for unwinding, chilling, and diving into a dream world. It has no sharp edges. Depending on one’s perspective, this can be seen as an advantage or a disadvantage.

Of the fragrances I own, this is the one I use the most in my free time. For example, when it’s cold outside and I make myself comfortable on the couch with a good book. I find it very pleasant when this scent dances around my nose as I turn or adjust the blanket.

I would describe the longevity as very good. The mentioned blanket still smells of The Dreamer the next day.
You can also wear it very well in the evening, for example, to go to a café. However, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for the disco. There, it gets overshadowed by Le Mâle...

The Dreamer is definitely not for macho types and wannabes. It’s a scent for daydreamers and gentle night owls. Some may find it too soft, but I love it as a fragrance to unwind, as it can have a very calming effect after a long workday."
Skin & Vanilla,07/24/2022,Ray147,M,17,,15,The Dreamer,"Unique,
The name ""The Dreamer"" symbolically reflects the way the fragrance is perceived. The protagonist of this metaphorical scene is a thinker who dares to dream.
Imagine a warm summer night outside on a rise in the woods.
You can see the lights of the city in the near distance. The time doesn’t matter, you pay no attention to it. The church has already announced midnight some time ago, is it already morning?, you don’t think about it. It doesn’t matter, thoughts are free.

There are four of us here, we know each other from vacation, we spent the evening in one of the cozy little bars in the Italian alleys. We’ve made ourselves comfortable, lying side by side on a blanket, all enjoying the same view. It’s not the lights of the night, rather it’s the lights of the stars that we can clearly see above. With our hands under our heads, we all look up.
Soft melancholic music drifts from one of the small groups towards us. Guitars sound, crickets chirp. But everything fades into the background, we enjoy the break from the hectic city.
We let the evening wind down, starting to think, even to dream under the stars.
I spot the Big Dipper, yet my thoughts are elsewhere, not far from the city, but turned inward.
I dare to dream, even without sleeping. Or am I already asleep?, am I dreaming of sleeping?
These thoughts I do not have, I am in the here and now enjoying the melancholic music, the unique atmosphere underscored by nature and the lights.
Whether I am awake or asleep is of no concern to me, for I can certainly dream here.

The fragrance The Dreamer encompasses a truly exceptionally pleasant warmth of tobacco, it is a rather classic men’s scent that is nonetheless unique.
The notes are well balanced and have a certain creaminess. It is a fragrance that is perfect for relaxed evenings or can serve well as a daily scent.
It is by no means intrusive and does not clash.
A very extraordinary scent that inspires dreaming. For all those who want to wear something that not everyone would wear, even with little money.
Suitable for those who do not want plain restraint through aquatic fresh scents or full attention through sweet sugary explosion of spices in everyday life that polarize.
The Dreamer finds the middle ground and is simple elegance with that attention to the simple question of what fragrance one is wearing.
The bottle, a kind of column, from whose upper part a small fountain could flow. A majestic appearance of a sculpture that could stand high above the clouds, among the Greek gods, encompasses the entire artwork of the perfume.
The fragrance fits very well into the overall picture of Versace and was created under Gianni Versace. If Eros is already the Greek fragrance of love, then this is the fragrance of Nyx, the Greek goddess of the night."

Skin & Vanilla,04/29/2020,Bleudeheiko,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,A positive surprise...,"The fragrance found its way to me because I heard almost only good things about it in some YouTube videos, and the reviews on Parfumo were also positive. I was also surprised by the low price for the bottle, even though a brand like Versace stands behind it.

Therefore, I got the fragrance here as a sample at SOUK and was correspondingly curious.

I can say right away, I was not disappointed.

With the first generous application, I was immediately enveloped by a very pleasant, floral, and slightly sweet scent. It also brings a certain freshness at the beginning that I did not expect.

As the fragrance develops, the initial sweetness subsides a bit, leaving a continued floral impression. But not in a way that it is disturbingly floral. Thank goodness, because I tend to prefer scents that are less so.

In my eyes, the fragrance becomes very ""pure"" when the sweetness fades. It then has a slightly powdery note, which I find quite pleasant over time.

I definitely classify the fragrance as an all-rounder, as it seems to fit almost any occasion and season. In terms of age group, I would place this fragrance more for men around 30 and older; in my opinion, it is less of a ""teenager scent"".

It is definitely suitable for the office; even though it reflects well at first, it is not to a disturbing degree.

I would also rate the sillage and longevity as good, especially considering the price. The fragrance lasts a good 5-6 hours on me. The last hours are more intimate.

Even though the fragrance is a bit older, it is by no means outdated or unsuitable for today's times.
I will definitely continue to wear the fragrance and can only recommend to anyone who feels addressed by the fragrance pyramid to give it a chance."
Skin & Vanilla,01/07/2014,Cappellusman,M,358,,8,The Double Test Reveals the Truth,"Double tests are good. Double tests are important and enlightening...

A ""double test"" for me involves spraying an unknown fragrance (this one, on the RIGHT) on one forearm and spraying a fragrance that I know well and consider ""natural"" (in this case ""Tuscany"" by Aramis) on the LEFT forearm.

This test primarily serves to assess the ""naturalness"" of a fragrance. It is said that stubbornness increases with age. When it comes to perfumes, this is fully true for me. The more fragrances I test, the more important ""naturalness"" becomes to me.

The triple quotation marks in connection with ""natural"" require a brief explanation. By ""natural,"" I mean that I can recognize and distinguish the listed ingredients and perceive a fragrance progression. This is certainly the case with ""Tuscany."" Lavender, lemongrass, etc., all smell unadulterated and authentic.

With ""The Dreamer,"" however, the perfumer has relied on a single ingredient, let's simply call it ""D-500."" This stands for the pathetic attempt to synthetically represent softness. Furthermore, Versace has also used ""D-600"" (spicy-synthetic - in ""Versace pour Homme""), ""D-700"" (fresh-synthetic - in ""Eau Fraiche""), and ""D-800"" (sickly sweet-synthetic - in ""Eros""). Additional formulas (aquatic, leathery, citrus) are still in development.

Seriously, Versace has so far created exactly one very good (""Versace l'Homme"") and one good (""Versus"") men's fragrance. Since ""Versus,"" the concoctions from the ""D"" series have been bottled as needed.

It's a shame, this was not meant to be a rant, but age-related stubbornness demands its toll. This synthetic stuff just annoys me now. I can't list 16 ingredients in the fragrance pyramid, none of which I can pick out. It's incomprehensible. It's astonishing that the fragrance is already 17 years old. Back then, there were other things. In a blind test, I wouldn't have dated it before 2010."
Skin & Vanilla,04/11/2019,Bamb1,M,3,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Nostalgia,"This fragrance was created in 1996 by Jean-Pierre Béthouart. 1996? Gianni Versace was still alive then! 1996 - I wasn't even in this world yet, and yet this scent evokes a certain nostalgia in me. Oh, how I would have loved to admire Versace's fashion creations and experience the launch of this fragrance myself. But unfortunately, I was born in this millennium. Generation ""No Interest"".
The bottle is heavenly. Erotic, simple, yet somehow extravagant and very special. I am particularly taken with the milky Medusa head. Luxurious, but definitely not gaudy. The spray nozzle is also very good, although the cap, into which the nozzle is already integrated, could be a bit more ""sturdy"".
As for the packaging. Dark blue background, a few stars in the distance. In silver, it says Versace - The Dreamer. When you close your eyes, at least I do, you think of a cool summer night, lying on a meadow with your beloved, laughing a lot and admiring the stars. Beautiful and truly dreamy.
But how does this fragrance smell then?
SYNTHETIC. Yes, Versace's The Dreamer smells synthetic, but still beautiful.
At the beginning of the composition, it smells very floral and almost feminine. One has to come to terms with that. Personally, I find it great. The top note becomes a bit more masculine and rounded with slightly spicy notes, which, however, seem to stay in the background.
Then the fragrance becomes a bit ""powdery"". Quite sweet and perfect for a cool summer night. In my opinion, it also becomes a bit spicier here.
Towards the end, many say that The Dreamer resembles Le Male by JPG. Personally, I only find a similarity with a lot of imagination.

The fragrance has apparently been reformulated multiple times, and I would love to smell the original once.

The longevity is quite good. The sillage is initially very strong but then quickly fades. In my opinion, this fits perfectly with the image of this fragrance. First loud, exciting, and then completely sensual and close."

cradling thoughts, dreams,
chewing on a blade of grass,
sneaking a glance into the distance.

The summer sun will soon be gone,
darkening him,
your place.

Time and rhythm are foreign to you,
you always wear,
your old shirt.

You take a relaxed drag from your cigarette,
it glitters through your chest hair,
your golden chain.

Your hair blows in the summer wind,
you make your way to the valley
swiftly.

The city lies already
at your feet,
the girls greet you
cheerfully.
Each one is turned towards you,
you drive them all
out of their minds.
You dream with them through the night,
until you awaken from your sleep.

The meadow blooms, the sun shines,
you quickly realize: I've dreamed again...

(For all daydreamers and fantasy beings, this scent is just right. It invites you to think in other times, slows down everyday life, and reminds you that there once was a time without mobile phones and smartphones and constant availability. When I smell it, I feel like I'm in slow motion. Calmed by the floral notes. It is too slow for our fast-paced time. A dreamer indeed, and that’s exactly what I love about it! Good night)"
Skin & Vanilla,07/24/2021,MarkMarc92,M,5,,7,"Soft Shell, Hard Core","""The Dreamer"" is a fragrance that truly blew me away. While I am a lover of very woody/smoky scents, ""The Dreamer"" is one of my favorites despite its sweetness. In the opening, it smells very sweet, but it quickly develops, within a few minutes, into a very masculine scent. The tobacco notes are clearly recognizable. I also perceive patchouli, even though it doesn't seem to be included. The fragrance fits perfectly with a guy from Miami zooming through the hot streets in a Lambo. But it also works on a bike, as an office worker, in Germany. I even wear it sometimes at the gym and have been approached about it multiple times. For me, a fragrance for eternity!"
Skin & Vanilla,01/08/2015,FabianO,M,1008,,6,Sweet Synthetic Vanilla-Tarragon-Iris-Powder-Cream,"Dark, dark I remember the late 90s when this Versace was still seen relatively often everywhere. In the last 10 years it has practically disappeared and is currently available online in clearance sales.

I thought back then that I found it quite nice in the realm of sweet fragrances, although I was also 15 or 16 at the time, and at that age one tends to naturally find sweet scents like ""Le Mâle"" and the like absolutely fantastic in a pubescent exuberance.

Well, the reference to Gaultier's sweet sailor is not without reason, as my predecessor GoodSmeller already hints.
""The Dreamer,"" stylistically really located in the unisex spectrum, spins quite high-speed in the floral-lovely area and is truly not free from synthetics. Vanilla-infused, with a slightly artificial-spicy touch.

By the way, there is a different ingredient list circulating online, which deviates significantly from the above, so Cappellusman may not be unjustly surprised:

Top: Juniper, Lily of the Valley
Heart: Iris, Linen Essences
Base: Amber, Tobacco, Tarragon

This might hit the nail on the head, although the extremely artificial tarragon note in ""Dreamer"" bothers me just as much as in the ""Dolce & Gabbana pour homme,"" which I don't particularly appreciate.
The overall arrangement feels a bit powdery (Iris?), but rather slightly pasty and bland, lacking the finesse and perfection of a ""Dior Homme.""

What I perceive as vanilla seems to be more attributed to the above tobacco flower, which sometimes comes across as something like artificial vanilla aroma, floral undertones included.

Overall, it's not a horror in perception, as it's not as loud and detectable from 20 meters away in terms of sillage like ""Le Mâle,"" but ultimately a quiet representative of copying it and not particularly pleasing to the nose."

When you spray it on and smell the top note, you might want to put this fragrance away and look for something else.
But as soon as it has settled a bit on the skin and mingled with your own body scent, a very attractive floral yet seductive fragrance emerges.
I have already received many compliments for this scent, which I never would have believed before.

Exactly these 3 main herbs are united here in a fragrance that is both extraordinary and extravagant as well as wonderfully zesty-spicy, possessing a ""blue floral glow"" and powerful woodiness.
Perfume makers have to manage this so well that it smells as dreamy as ""Versace"". A cheerful and down-to-earth romance included. A play of light and shadow in the forest, flower garden, and herb bed. Noble and casual at the same time. Furthermore, nowadays it is worn quite rarely, but for me, it is timeless and something special. Especially ""Versace"", actually an Italian fashion house, often manages to combine the top quality of several ""niche"" fragrances with affordable prices.

Skin & Vanilla,12/04/2023,Schmuel,M,5,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Name is Program,"The Dreamer, what a name! Perhaps the most beautiful name among perfumes.

At just 20 euros for 50 ml, I had to buy it blind… First impression: it smells like a 350 euro niche perfume! And that’s the great thing about it! You get a fragrance that is so unique, almost incomparable to anything else, whether you like it or not.

Upon the first spray, a hefty dose of floral notes hits you, slightly synthetic, but by no means unnatural or bothersome. In the background, a tobacco note slowly but surely unfolds, smelling slightly burnt. The tobacco note increases while the floral aspect diminishes, but it never completely disappears.

It’s hard to describe, as it’s almost incomparable; you just have to smell it yourself.

Fragrance-wise, it’s a 10/10 for me,
but there will certainly be some who can’t relate to it (a friend of mine: “You smell like my grandma’s house”), although I believe most people will like it more than not.

Longevity and sillage are okay, but nothing groundbreaking.

Best worn in the evening when it’s not too hot (e.g., on a cool summer night), but it generally works anytime.

So for under 30 euros, you get a perfume with niche character; there’s nothing comparable in terms of scent, but unfortunately, longevity and sillage are only “okay.”
Still, it’s one of my favorites overall."
Skin & Vanilla,02/02/2023,Jonashbr,M,4,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Dream or Reality,"This question arises when you see the price of the perfume for the first time.

We are in 2021 and the first summer vacation with my new girlfriend was approaching. Slightly nervous because I wanted to make a good impression, I went to the perfume store a few days earlier with the goal of buying a Prada L'homme, as I was sure she would like it.
Well, since Hanae Mori had planted the thought in my mind not to use standard fragrances, I ended up choosing The Dreamer against the advice of the saleswoman.
In her opinion, this scent was too outdated for a 20-year-old due to its old fragrance DNA (as far as I know, it was even the last fragrance by Gianni Versace himself?) and I would be better off with a Dylan Blue or Eros if I wanted to stick with Versace.
But I decided on this fragrance.
Why?
The scent is fresh but in no way citrusy or shower-gel fresh.
No, it is a beautiful sweet herbal blend with a very pleasant tobacco note, which allows the herbs enough space to unfold, along with a slightly floral note that rounds off the fragrance.

And what can I say, the vacation took us to the small Croatian town of Rovinj. And there, the fragrance felt very much at home!

A small finca, evening sun, a light breeze, a few fruit trees, two glasses of white wine, a light linen shirt, and a beautiful woman. In the midst of it all, “The Dreamer” subtly but perceptible, sweet but not cloying, fresh but far from shower gel.
In a club, this fragrance would go completely unnoticed, but that is not its aim at all; evenings or days like the one described above are its purpose. There, its restrained sillage is just right, as the scent should not overshadow the moment.

My girlfriend still loves the fragrance, and it cannot be missing on our joint vacations.
Who knows, maybe this fragrance laid the foundation for a happy relationship during this vacation because of such evenings."

Skin & Vanilla,08/18/2021,ChristianKtt,M,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Good Fabric Softener,"This scent seems somewhat difficult to grasp descriptively, and its perception appears to be heavily dependent on the individual sniffer. This can be easily seen in the contributions here, as the range of opinions on ""Dreamer"" is, in my view, above average.

And indeed, even for myself and the same bottle, the impression is not always the same. During my very first test (on the forearm), I thought, ""Hmm, it's actually just lavender."" On the second (scent cloud in front of my face): ""Ugh, ashtray!"" After the third attempt, I smelled marzipan.
I don't know how that happened. I hope those weren't all strokes. ;)

After longer use, however, my nose and the scent have synchronized, so I can give the following overall assessment:
The herbs listed in the notes play only an absolute supporting role. In contrast, the initially strong tobacco quickly loses presence in the drydown and then helps to tame the sweeter and floral notes of the fragrance in the background - to which the herbs likely also contribute.

Clearly dominant in ""Dreamer"" throughout the entire scent journey is a very soft, soapy aura - referring here to that of freshly fabric softener-laundered laundry. The scent gives me an almost tactile feeling of fluffiness - with a slight sweetness of marzipan (wherever that comes from, probably a result of the amber mixed with some of the herbal notes).
The ""Dreamer"" is truly a cuddly scent - however, it's more suited for one person; it's too innocent for more.

I will repurchase it, although it is actually very nice, but probably not. The scent is a bit too floral for a man, too fluffy for summer, too light for winter, and the tobacco might stand out too much on a lady. Finding the right occasion to wear it, aside from a cozy evening at home, is really not easy, and I think that might even be the main reason why it doesn't gain more popularity. Because, to conclude, the ""Dreamer"" is truly not bad. It just might be too much in between all the chairs."
Skin & Vanilla,01/22/2024,Rabenhorst,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,12,And I Whisper: Thank You!,"There is a little angel.
He is so beautiful and delicate and intricate. And he plays a note on his golden harp, the shape of which reminds me of a pear.
I need not worry about this angel, even though I find him very vulnerable, for he is protected by a cream-colored cloud.
If I keep my distance, I hear a clear note that I have never heard before. As soon as I try to approach the heavenly being, the cloud is there and gently blocks my way.
I am initially astonished, for the note, despite its strangeness, conveys to me a feeling of trust. Trusting that there is a world where there is a place for me.
And I am grateful to be a witness to this moment.

For me, The Dreamer by Versace is a pure hit, although I have a slight feeling that the fragrance has come to me: the packaging, the name, the bottle, the affordable price of €20 for 50ml. Everything fits. I couldn't help but buy it without having smelled it before. And I must emphasize that this Eau de Toilette has a magical effect on me. Its scent cloud is the entrance to a new world. When I wear it, I am ""grounded"" in this new world. For me, The Dreamer radiates the great happiness of having found a home. All the money in the world is worth nothing when you let yourself fall backward with closed eyes and are caught by this fragrance.

If it is true that this was Versace's last fragrance creation in our world, then it feels all the more like a heavenly hint to me. A transcendence without any bombast.
As far as I am concerned, The Dreamer has come to stay.
But angels come and go, and I whisper: Thank you!

Why this name?

I think I understand why.

It invites you to dream.
It gives me that all-around carefree feeling that helps me get through the cold season without any problems.
When it gets colder and more uncomfortable outside, when the fog creeps under the sweater and stepping out the door takes some courage, this fragrance gives me a good feeling - and it lasts all day long. Even in the evening, still noticeable under the blanket...

The scent starts off harsh and angular - like a cold ashtray. And yet somehow floral. A bouquet of flowers next to an ashtray...
Fascinating.
It immediately captivated me.
The angularity quickly gives way to an aromatic, woody, and soft warmth - and here it begins to show its true strength.
This power and expressiveness easily lasts over the next 6 to 8 hours.

For me, a masterpiece and a jewel in my collection!

Perfumes must evoke feelings for me - and The Dreamer does that.
A scent that makes me happy, drives away the cold - and despite its strength, it doesn't stand out negatively in the surroundings.

Compliments? Not really. I wear it for myself and my well-being.

For me personally, it is THE everyday scent, and I have developed a little tradition of always buying this perfume at the Duty Free shop in London Heathrow. Either as a souvenir or for myself when my bottle is empty again.
I don’t even know why London and why Dreamer, but somehow I keep doing it, even if it’s not necessarily cheaper than online or elsewhere.

But why has this particular scent become my everyday choice?
It is noticeable but unobtrusive. Elegant but not showy. Timeless but not outdated.
Fresh and floral, this men's perfume tends a bit towards the unisex area and is perceived positively with only very few exceptions.

What the Dreamer definitely is NOT, is a flashy party scent. Especially when you are in an environment where a lot of perfume is worn, you will fade into the background with the Versace classic.

This special spiciness at the beginning, which quickly becomes more floral, powdery, sweeter, and softer.
This calming and relaxing nature...

The little perfume box, which is designed a bit old-fashioned and dreamily, already triggers a special feeling in me...
the bottle, which radiates something magical...
this scent profile and the realistic childhood memory...
me, sitting half awake/half asleep in my chair just after midnight...
this name ""The Dreamer""...
15€ for 50ml...
Everything seemed very surreal...

I immediately fell in love with this perfume...
The entire presentation, combined with this special situation I was in when I first tested the scent, was like a little film.

I really enjoy wearing this scent.
It works best when the weather seems a bit strange...a little overcast and gray, but not cold or warm....on a day when nothing is particularly pressing.

A very peculiar perfume...
It almost seems as if the scent itself has a personality...

The scent has been on the market for so long, and yet, I became aware of it very late.
No one in my circle has ever worn the scent...
no one has ever talked about this scent...
no marketing, no TV commercials...
nowhere displayed in stores...
an absolute phantom...

Just the way it seemed to suddenly appear out of nowhere a few years ago was already very strange.

Now it is in my collection and I am very glad that it found its way there."
Skin & Vanilla,06/28/2021,LucasV895,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,"The Dreamer - For me, the All-Year-Rounder","My first review on Parfumo simply has to be for this fragrance. When the fragrance was released in 1996, I was just one year old.

For me, this scent is something truly special. In my opinion, only a few fragrances (especially not in this price range) can compete with this extraordinary composition.

Upon the first spray, a floral note is perceived, rounded off by a masculine tobacco. Longevity and sillage are good.

Why would I call this fragrance an all-year-rounder? Because, in my opinion, it can be worn in any season and there are few occasions where this scent wouldn't be appropriate.

I reach for Versace The Dreamer when I can't decide on a fragrance, and I immediately feel uplifted as soon as I catch a whiff of it after the first spray."
Skin & Vanilla,04/28/2018,Mörfi,M,8,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,It's magic :),"The scent reminds me of a time when you are outside on warm summer nights, looking at the stars. In the distance, you can hear the crickets chirping - a gentle breeze sweeps over fields and meadows, and a seductive fragrance wafts in. Many may not like it (I personally don't care), because it might not be anything special or new, and it is also a reformulation. However, the current version is extremely pleasant for me, and I will wear it in spring and summer, when it's not too hot, especially in the evenings, for example, during a nice walk. Powdery, a fougère, slightly synthetic - but never intrusive. When it's in the air - a dream! It definitely has something mystical about it."
Skin & Vanilla,02/02/2021,ScentyXXdude,M,12,,9,"Outside great, inside just as great!!","I have always wanted this fragrance, even if it didn't smell good, I would still place it in my perfume cabinet because it simply looks elegant.
At first, the scent reminds me of Sculpture Homme (but not as extremely penetrating), and as it develops, a perfectly measured amount of the Le Male DNA comes in, which smells very good with the tobacco blossom. However, this also takes away a bit of its uniqueness.
Overall, it is a masterpiece by Gianni Versace that hopefully won't be forgotten anytime soon."
Skin & Vanilla,01/15/2021,Wasauchimmer,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,White Linen Shirt in Summer,"So, as a long-time visitor of this site, I’m finally writing my first comment and not without reason about this fragrance.
I stumbled upon it through a video by the good Jeremy. The fragrance was not only one of my very first scents (I believe my third) but also my first blind buy (you can let me know if you've ever smelled it in any store. I certainly haven't seen it anywhere).
When the fragrance was delivered at the beginning of summer, it smelled quite indefinable to my untrained nose. However, it didn’t take much longer than an afternoon in summer with friends, iced tea, and canoes on the nearest river for it to become MY summer scent.
""A powdery, floral tobacco scent"" describes it best. While I see that many classify The Dreamer as an all-rounder, I personally prefer it in the summer during the warmest temperatures and even then mostly for leisure activities or freshly showered after an evening jog.
I would have categorized the longevity and sillage as not particularly above average, like most light, fresh summer fragrances, but when I recently showed it to a friend, he said he had smelled it on me before. And since that could only have been during the aforementioned canoe trip, despite sunscreen, sweat, and hours of swimming in river water, it really surprised me.
So if you want a blind buy for summer, top quality from a legendary brand for little money, then you must not miss The Dreamer."

Skin & Vanilla,10/15/2019,ElDiabloBZ,M,21,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,"Something is there, but what ...","I bought the ""Dreamer"" blindly after the almost universally positive reviews. The price was too tempting.

What can be said in advance is that the scent is very loud and contains demanding sage-like fragrance oils. The sage note is long-lasting and present until the end.

You have to like sage; if you do, then you are in the right place. I don't find it disturbing, but from my perspective, a bit of restraint wouldn't hurt. It would make the scent rounder. It would evoke a Christmas feeling.

The longevity is very good, as is the sillage. As for the scent, see above; if you like it, it's a 9. If you are more of a quieter type, then I would stay away from this one.

The bottle is appealing and has an oriental feel.

In conclusion, I fully endorse the ""Dreamer""; it comes across as authentic and self-assured (is a dreamer self-assured???) I don't regret the purchase; I just have to figure out whether I like sage. Sage as a scent ;)

Update: You can scold me for this line of thought, but somehow I draw parallels to Amouage ""Reflection Man."" I don't know if it's the scent progression or the - yes - far-fetched ""similar"" fragrance note ... I can't say. I just know that immediately the thought crossed my mind, ""there's something you know."" Amouage - to be honest - comes across much more pleasing and is absolutely rounded! The Dreamer hits hard; one should act according to the motto ""less is more"" when applying, and even then, you might expect a slight headache. That's what happened to me."
Skin & Vanilla,10/23/2023,Sirbennyone,M,499,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Memories... / The Perfect Introduction / A Little Masterpiece! / For Very Little Money!,"Hello everyone,

I would like to talk about a rather special and somehow unique fragrance in a price range where you probably won't find a second one under 30€, The Dreamer EAU DE TOILETTE! (Except for clones)

I’ll say it right away, a truly massive plus point is its low price, which ranges from 17€ to 30€ depending on the offer and bottle size, and I find that absolutely fantastic! There are fragrances from niche houses that cost ten times as much just for the basic scent direction, just to mention that!

Back then, fragrance notes were combined that had not been combined (in the designer sector) until then, such as floral notes with tobacco. I found this combination very exciting back then, and it still is today = timeless!

Even with the aspect that one is somewhat knowledgeable about fragrances, it is one of those scents that always brings a certain smile to my face!

It works always, fits always, is well received, and costs little! It doesn’t always have to be a fragrance from PDM, LV, Xerjoff, Chanel, or, for example, MFK.

A brief note on performance (S/I), it is good. It was good back then and still is today. Back then it was a bit sharper and not as pleasing as it is today, but in my opinion, you can't go wrong at this price. This is one you should know ;) .

If I really weren’t convinced, I wouldn’t recommend it to you!

And now, have a nice day/evening or whenever you read this review, best regards, Benny

Skin & Vanilla,12/14/2020,Reagenz,M,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Floral but wonderfully different,"Here it was,... fresh in my hands, I opened the appealing packaging and was very taken with the bottle. This slightly angular shape and a Medusa head framed in relief, the well-known trademark of Versace. So far so good, the exterior matched.
The first spray already impressed me with its fragrance intensity. I first smell a decent amount of tarragon, paired with intense juniper, which is gently enveloped shortly after by the iris, creating a very calming effect. Subsequently, it becomes powdery-floral with an interesting tobacco note. Suitable for everyday wear and office-friendly. Never brutally loud or intrusive, but always present. A fragrance that has its ""right to exist"" in the perfume world. !!! Classic !!!
Longevity is a good 6 hours, sillage is above average."
Skin & Vanilla,05/25/2022,Diordorant,M,12,,11,Sickbed sweet sickbed,"For me, The Dreamer is a unique medicinal sweetness that seduces in a very pleasing way. You are sickly, weak, perhaps even feverishly daydreaming in your sickbed, cared for by a gentle and empathetic person who administers you a sweet medicinal syrup, changes the bed linens, airs out the room, waters the flowers on the windowsill, and strokes your forehead with a warm, gentle hand before placing a cool, damp cloth on it.

This sweetness wraps around the senses like a soft blanket, the floral and green notes are like fresh bed linens and cool air flowing in through the window, while the tobacco and the faintly alcoholic amber lull you into a warm drift into sleep and dreams, the spirit escapes through that very open window, becoming weightless, surrendering to the sweet frailty of being ill and slipping into equally sweet daydreams, probably about flying, and into the embrace of the caring person.

Dreamer is a scent that I actually only wear at home, under a blanket in the armchair while reading or right in bed. Cozy soft and light, but also with a seductive sweet heaviness that feels a bit intoxicating, like a slight buzz from alcoholic cough syrup or something. But I have a tip if you want to wear it outside: if you combine it with something distinctly woody or oudy, it takes on very everyday, palatable forms. Vetiver is particularly suitable here. For example, it surprisingly pairs well with the Encre Noires.

Longevity, sillage, and presentation are all convincing, and at that price, probably more than that. Everything is very coherent, just like the scent itself. I'm glad it's still on the market."
Skin & Vanilla,08/07/2011,Chanelle,F,752,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,I have a dream...,"In loose succession, I take a closer look at the fragrances of my friend, which I sometimes use myself when the devil rides me, and write what I think of them. This one is a ""men's fragrance that women like."" In fact, it is so floral that it could have been designed as a women's fragrance.
Versace hasn't released a men's fragrance since the first women's fragrance that I would have bought for myself. But this one is a nice one.
The top note already shows the direction: floral freshness with a slight oriental touch.
The heart note then becomes almost powdery and at times resembles - don't hit me now, or send me threatening letters - Habit Rouge. Okay, they stand next to each other in our bathroom, but I believe my master had something in mind. And I think so too.
Of course, this slight hint of HR doesn't last long, as the dreamer then takes big, adult steps into the oriental. Unfortunately, I don't smell tobacco, which I think I would have liked very much.
In the drydown, I still sense a light, sweet spiciness that lingers for a long time."
Skin & Vanilla,12/30/2020,Achillez,M,2,,10,Mhmmm...,"Well, actually a very nice perfume...
At first, there's something herbal that reminds me a lot of cold medicine, sage/mint cream, you know what I mean :)
The scent is very similar to JPG Le Male (the regular one) or goes in that direction and stays that way the whole time, so I personally feel like I'm wearing JPG Le Male when I spray it... you notice it a lot in the first hour, so it has great projection, but then it settles down. In between, you can still smell it, but you have to be a bit close to catch it. All in all, a very nice perfume even if you've smelled something similar before. The longevity on my skin was about 5-6 hours, and on clothes, you could smell it for a good 8 hours until it really faded away.
I haven't generated any compliments yet... thanks to the lockdown... well, that's about it... Versace - The Dreamer"
Skin & Vanilla,09/26/2023,Croque,M,23,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,The Waystation,"Warm light streams through the half-open window onto white sheets, a hint of herbs clings to it. Soft birdsong, bees buzzing, and from afar, the church bell calls to mass. I blink, lift the corners of my mouth, turn around once more, and doze off again. Today is Sunday - the world can stay outside today.

What makes this scent particularly special for me is its ""Laissez-Faire"" attitude. It does not impose itself but unfolds gently and subtly on the skin. I sense soft notes of lavender, sage, and iris. This combination conveys a light, airy elegance and sophistication that is far too rare in the world of ""Pour Homme"" fragrances. It is refreshing to experience a scent that does not try to impress with overwhelming masculinity through loud tones and aggressive aromas. Instead, it radiates a natural allure based on the inner calm and serenity of its wearer.

The Dreamer has once again convinced me that it is a completely wrong approach to choose a fragrance based on the notes listed in the fragrance pyramid and then to interpret something into it that is not there, or to convince myself that I should like the scent because ingredient XY is included. Or, more importantly, to not like it because this and that ingredient is present. Tarragon and juniper, that actually screams bitter, dry, and dusty, the unloved siblings of the great culinary herbs - that does not appeal to me. But: It is the combination, the complexity, that defines the scent.

For me, it is a summer fragrance - not really for the brightest sun or at the beach, but more for the morning and evening.

The bottle is simple and elegant by today’s standards - the only thing that bothers me is the matte gold-colored plastic cap in the shape of a gemstone - a failed attempt to appear noble and exclusive. The fragrance does not need that.

This is it, the unexpected waystation on the fragrance journey. I didn’t actually want to get off here, but now I no longer feel that I need to get back on and continue my journey. A fragrance that gives me a calm aura of Sunday every day - that is more than I ever hoped for."

Synthetic, a LeMale offshoot but consistently good reviews. I then bought it because I thought the price of €20 was reasonable for this fragrance.

Yes, it reminds me of LeMale, but this LeMale experience is overshadowed by iris and tarragon, offering a rounded cut, if I may say so. I also tested Versace L'homme as a counterpoint, but although many praise it, it was too powerful, penetrating, and far too masculine for me. Almost like a masculine No 5. I can't wear something like that. I prefer something synthetic in which I feel comfortable. I also find the name ""The Dreamer"" very fitting for the fragrance experience and can get on board with it, but I wouldn't have spent more than €20 on it."
Skin & Vanilla,04/09/2023,Tryvou,M,4,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,My Sleep Ritual for a Restful Night,"As someone who often struggles to fall asleep, I can say that Versace The Dreamer has become an essential part of my sleep ritual. This fragrance is so calming and relaxing that I apply it every evening to help me enter a deeper state of tranquility.
The Dreamer is a subtle and gentle scent that soothes the senses and calms the mind. The top notes create a soothing atmosphere, while the heart notes add a subtle sweetness and a certain kind of floral bouquet. The base note of tobacco gives the fragrance a warm and cozy touch, making it perfect for the evening and night.
I love how the scent evolves over time. It lingers on the skin long enough to provide me with a pleasant ambiance as I fall asleep, yet it is not so strong that it overwhelms my senses or influences my dreams."
Skin & Vanilla,02/16/2023,KoljaK,M,5,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Great Everyday Scent.,"The dreamer is great and exceptional for this price range. It smells of tobacco and a slightly sweet rose.

Definitely a recommendation for an extraordinary, affordable everyday scent."
Skin & Vanilla,05/05/2014,Moriarty,M,150,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,A Dream in the Herb Garden,"Sometimes the scent and title symbolize each other immediately. Versace's Dreamer shows the way. A path into the sun-drenched herb garden. The intensity of the heat slowly diminishes, the warmth is bearable and manageable. In the garden, there is plenty of tarragon and lavender. Both are more noticeable than the rest of the herbs. The bathroom window is open. Someone has showered. Apparently with classic soap and previously a smooth aura was sprayed. Vanilla? No, the brother. The tonka bean. On the windowsill lie fermented tobacco leaves, warmed by the sun. Everything combines into a sensually dreamy harmony and yet it is real.

That is ""The Dreamer""! If there were a beauty award for bottles and packaging, Versace would probably be the king of all designers. Unfortunately, the scents often do not hold up to that. However, here they do, which is why the Italian dreamer is no longer a secret tip. Uncharacteristically, without synthetic influences, the herbs come forth, especially tarragon and lavender, very beautifully natural. This also has something distinctive. On paper more than on the skin.

It does indeed remind one a bit of ""Le Mâle"". The light soap-lavender combination in conjunction with a powdery base (here tonka bean) makes it so. In this respect, I do not quite understand the polarization. The dreamer is neither too cloyingly sweet (especially not with the current trend), nor does it have too herbal a sting on the skin. Tarragon, in particular, polarizes, but interacts harmoniously with the other ingredients on the skin.

The connections from all the fragrance components indeed create a very beautiful, sensual scent that, despite the slight similarities to the blue sailor, feels unique - positively individual. Not a playful, hopeless idealist, but a realist with ideals. ""The Dreamer"" is masculine, distinctive, and yet also smooth and flexible to use, as long as one does not overdo it with the sprays. One of the best Versace scents, where one does not just want the chic bottle."

Skin & Vanilla,05/27/2021,Bigloeffel,M,10,,5,Dreamed Out!,"The Dreamer! Even the name sounds seductive. But already at a glance at the fragrance pyramid, I had some slight doubts. Iris sounded good at first, as this note is primarily responsible for scents like Dior Homme, Prada L'Homme, Valentino Uomo Intense, or Givenchy Gentleman. So, quite to my taste. However, mixed with juniper and tarragon? Hmmm… whatever, blind buy and done…

Well, unfortunately, it was nothing! You can definitely tell that the fragrance comes from a good house, that much can be said upfront. However, I constantly get a spicy cinnamon note in the opening and throughout the fragrance progression, even though it is not listed in the fragrance pyramid. I have a similar experience with Joop Ice, even though cinnamon is also obviously not a component there. This scent perception in The Dreamer may also result from the mix of iris and juniper. Anyway, this spicy note somehow doesn’t fit with the sweet-powdery iris and unfortunately ruins the otherwise quite beautiful composition for me. This spicy undertone dominates the entire fragrance progression, which is why I cannot really understand the often-cited resemblance to Prada L'Homme. I rather see a similarity to the aforementioned Joop Ice.

In principle, The Dreamer remains a beautiful fragrance. It just has to fit scent-wise. The bottle is elegant, the scent is high-quality, the sillage is subtle but good, the longevity is also noticeable, and the price is affordable. Unfortunately, my expectations for the fragrance were not met, even though it could have fit quite well according to the many previous scent descriptions. However, this spicy-cinnamon undertone is disturbingly prominent, as if something just doesn’t want to fit together. For me, once again, it’s proof that you shouldn’t rely on other fragrance descriptions, but rather test for yourself…"

No ego, no alpha, no macho
The man of a young, in-love couple, or a loving father.

The fragrance radiates a calm, truly dreamy, and soft character without leaning into the feminine.

Not suitable for the midday sun in my opinion, more for the evening hours in summer.
Otherwise, wearable at any time.

The longevity is good, it actually lasts all day, however, the sillage significantly decreases after 2-3 hours and you can only perceive the scent up close, but still very distinctly, while many fragrances leave only a few notes lingering.

Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no! …”

This is how one of Supertramp's most successful songs begins, which I think of every time I have “The Dreamer” by Versace in sight or in nose.

The song from the 70s by Supertramp is now an absolute classic, which unfortunately cannot yet be said about the fragrance. Why not? Just the bottle has strong classic features that clearly indicate that we are dealing with an exquisite and noble content. And this can be smelled:

“The Dreamer” comes sweetly with a slightly spicy minty note. The latter I would possibly attribute to the clary sage as well as the tarragon. Therefore, the fragrance has for me a somewhat Christmassy quality, but that is a rather subjective feeling.

However, this spicy, minty note is a bit too dominant for my taste. While it makes the fragrance unmistakable, it also makes it polarizing.

Accordingly, I stayed away from it back then and still can't really get excited about it today.

Nevertheless, “The Dreamer” is a great scent that has its place. The longevity is excellent, and even after many years, my miniature bottle has lost none of its intensity. This speaks for a high quality that at least other fragrances can only dream of …"

I know that many might perceive it differently, but for me personally, it reminds me of a mix between Le Male and Prada L'Homme.

To be honest, I wasn't very satisfied with the opening of the fragrance at first. I thought it might not have been a good idea to buy it blind. But then came the drydown, and it really convinced me. The scent becomes clean, floral, and sweet, and the powderiness is more present in the background.

What I really love about this fragrance is that you can't go wrong with it. It is such a versatile scent that can be worn both during the day and in the evening. It suits any occasion and any outfit. I have already received many compliments for it, and I just feel good when I wear it.

All in all, I can really recommend Versace - The Dreamer. It is a fragrance that has exceeded my expectations and has become one of my favorites. If you are looking for a scent that is clean, floral, and sweet, then this one is definitely worth a try. Give it a go and let yourself be enchanted!"

The Dreamer is a scent of the lighter kind, ideal for those days when you really don't feel like wearing a perfume. This fragrance can be worn almost year-round, perhaps not in the deepest winter, but nearly all year long, and is an absolutely solid companion.
The spray nozzle is indeed a complete disaster, but the unbeatable price easily makes up for it.
The Dreamer is not a performance monster, but that wouldn't suit it either. It is relatively close to the skin, yet lasts a solid 6-8 hours.
The scent starts with green notes and then becomes more floral with iris and lily as it develops. In the base note, you can clearly recognize the tobacco flower.

The longevity could be better, but it carries you through about 6 hours well.

The bottle, on the other hand, is one of the most beautiful in my opinion. It looks really classy with the embossed Medusa.

Partly available for under €20 - you can't complain about that."
Skin & Vanilla,12/09/2021,NiceSmell,M,241,,2,Dreamed Out,"The Versace the Dreamer, what can I say? I use it as a high-quality room freshener and occasionally on myself. As you can gather from my review, it’s pretty average for me. Not a scent you necessarily remember. A decently solid fresh laundry scent with its iris. And a slight sweetness. A softie, really. Pleasant and surely popular with women, I perceive it as unisex and think women can wear it just as well as men. Longevity and sillage could be improved. Good value for money."
Skin & Vanilla,07/06/2022,Flyxxer,M,4,,4,The Clean Freak,"The scent starts with a very pronounced slightly alcoholic juniper note, which is accompanied from the very beginning by a sweetness (I suspect it’s coumarin).

With The Dreamer, I float away on fluffy clouds into cotton-soft dreamland. The Dreamer by Versace is very delicate and soft. It is sweet, but not sugary-sweet or vanilla-sweet, rather vetiver-sweet, tobacco-sweet, floral-sweet, and powdery-sweet. This ethereal sweetness is just one facet, as..."
Skin & Vanilla,04/13/2022,Harrock,M,78,,4,A Gentle Breeze,"The Dreamer by Versace is basically like waking up from a dream but barely remembering it... The scent is very transparent and light, and therefore not really present in the nose. It is a beautiful sweet floral fragrance with a tobacco note. Very unique but very light in the air. To me, it smells a bit like cotton candy or caramelized desserts in general, with a hint of pipe tobacco in the background...

Longevity and sillage are rather mediocre... Sillage in the first few minutes is quite pronounced, but as mentioned before, not much remains; it fades relatively quickly... 4-6 hours absolute maximum!

If you have the money to spare, you can definitely use it for sleeping or watching series on the couch; it works really well for that.

It is a unique scent that is personally too sweet for me and ultimately not worth the money. There are plenty of other cheapies that perform significantly better... you can try it out for sleeping; it has a calming effect, but otherwise, just a gentle breeze."
Skin & Vanilla,09/27/2025,E36,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A Masterpiece from the House of Versace!,"I am relatively new to the world of perfume, and Dreamer was the second fragrance I bought (blind). I had no idea what an incredible scent was coming my way. After the first spray, I was immediately in love! The very prominent floral notes and the light tobacco in the background leave an impression, an impression of a well-groomed, very elegant man who knows how to present himself. My only criticism is the sillage and longevity, which, as expected for an EDT, are not too intense. On the other hand, I think it's fantastic that this DNA comes from the 90s and that you can still enjoy these beautiful notes today. Just like the bottle, it feels very high-quality, and the Versace Medusa as well as the capless spray head feel great. Considering that you can get this perfume for 25/30€, I believe you can't miss out on this masterpiece (as a man)!"

This is exactly how the Versace smells. A bit old school, green, floral, fresh, and somehow different from all other fragrances. Does the blooming fauna in the heart of Italy smell like this? What always captivates me is its unmistakable character. This is certainly not a fragrance that influencers today would commonly refer to as a compliment-getter. Rather, the Dreamer is exactly what its name suggests. A dream of a memory from a beautiful late summer."

But now, unfortunately, I only smell old, albeit noble, soap. At least it projects quite well for about 4-5 hours and can still be perceived nicely on the skin afterwards. I can't imagine who would wear it and on what occasion. I could even see it more on a woman...

The fragrance is clean, fresh, deep, floral.
Sometimes I notice a distant similarity to Le Malé, sometimes I do not. I would describe The Dreamer as a very approachable, easy-to-like scent. The juniper comes through very well with the tobacco. I find it has a certain depth, a warm note, but in no way is it dominating.

A great perfume, unbeatable value for money. Timeless."

For me, The Dreamer is the perfect scent for a white T-shirt and brown pants at the end of spring. The fresh juniper holds up well and it’s easy to reapply for the price. It’s not the most common combination of notes - personally, it reminds me a bit of the pages of a book - but it’s also an interesting and solid purchase for beginners."

Skin & Vanilla,01/30/2023,Frischzisch,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Old but Gold,"Even users of certain deodorants have to painstakingly overcome the closure or cap of their spray cans as a barrier to their freshness experience. With ""The Dreamer,"" this effort is spared - dreamy! It's a pity that it doesn't spray itself.

As for the scent itself: A rather fresh, yet classically smelling fragrance. Very pleasing, not just for those who enjoy the scent of unburned tobacco (but quite sweet). It also has a floral aspect, so the experts of the fragrance pyramid seem to be right :)

Can I recommend a blind purchase? Yes, if you enjoy sniffing that tobacco.
But that's just my opinion. And even if it doesn't turn out to be love at first sight, take your time. Once you should part with it, you will miss it.

Then it remains just a dream, the Dreamer."

Clean, but with a herbal component that makes it exciting without being too jarring. Good balance of a comforting scent and a stylish statement. Later, the soft, floral notes emerge, also a wonderful moment in the fragrance's progression - a soft, inviting powdery bed. A scent like the REM sleep phase, just before waking up. You're not quite there yet, escaping life for a few moments and remaining in your own world. Only criticism: smells a bit dated, the fragrance feels like it's from the 90s and gives me extreme 90s vibes. H/S totally okay."
Skin & Vanilla,02/09/2023,Casanico,M,1,,1,Genie in a Bottle,"Since this is my first review on Parfumo, I naturally dedicated it to a perfume that deserves to be the first review.

Well, what can I say...?
The last perfume by Gianni Versace himself is an absolute delight for the nose. Fresh, floral, and heavenly dreamy indeed.
I have rarely smelled a perfume that was so aptly named.
It evokes true feelings of happiness in me, especially in the top notes - of course, there’s also a certain nostalgia involved, as I already own the third bottle.

To all the amateur philosophers who also want to smell good in spring or summer, I can only warmly recommend this fragrance."
Skin & Vanilla,02/10/2024,Newsy,M,1,,3,Spring Days,"For me, it is a pleasant feel-good scent. The name matches the fragrance. Very dreamy and reminiscent of sunny, mild spring days.

Skin & Vanilla,07/25/2024,Dustinos,M,6,,1,Love-Hate,"It's a difficult topic...
It was a blind buy. To be honest, I initially tried to convince myself that I was buying a nice citrus tobacco scent. Essentially, it is that, but someone once described the fragrance as a ""fresh ashtray,"" and I must admit, that haunts me a bit.
It will be a summer scent, but in the summer, the scent of the ""fresh ashtray"" was somewhat piercing. That bothered me to some extent. However, I don't see it for winter, as it is very citrusy fresh.
On the other hand, Versace The Dreamer is a vintage scent, which doesn't necessarily have to capture the spirit of the times. It is definitely vintage in terms of smell and somewhat older; those who appreciate that could definitely find pleasure in this fragrance.

In summary, it can be said:
The scent is very unique, but quite fitting for the time it was released.
Even though I have been quite harsh on it in my review, I associate many beautiful memories with it."

I smell spicy woods, herbs, but also flowers, so really interesting.
I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a blind buy to anyone, but it's definitely something different to try out.

The Purple Label - Clean Cashmere,08/25/2012,Meteron,M,3,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,rosy news,"During my trip to Thailand, I was forced to change planes at Abu Dhabi Airport. I had to wait over 2 hours for my next flight. Abu Dhabi Airport is small and ugly, nothing really to see except for the wooden camel that everyone sits on to take photos. My wife, not really a fan of perfume, I had to beg to go with me to the Duty Free Shop. The perfume shop is small and only a few niche perfumes have made it in here. Amouage, Ajmal, Swiss Arabia. Just a few wonderful perfume manufacturers from the Arab League.

Incredibly cheap there. I know everyone will curse me now for not packing Amouage for you. Quite simply, I don't like it. I'm more interested in scents that haven't been overexposed yet.

Shadha by Arabian Swiss was a candidate for me, as it convinced me during testing with its freshness and intensity.

Shadha starts with fresh rose, not as strong as Rose Petals but rather mild and fresh. Lightly spiced with sandalwood. Patchouli is present only in small amounts. Oud can be sniffed in the dry down.

I find the longevity to be extremely good. The sillage smells voluminous yet elegant.

So I find the perfume oil very fresh and also good for men to wear. The rose is the main component of this perfume. The scent is spicy, and the oud is always present in the background.

The perfume is simple but very elegant. I like it because it doesn't come on as strong as other rose perfumes."

This House Is Clean,02/09/2024,Landshark321,M,746,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,"Sharp, spicy, leathery tobacco, a bit of a varnish vibe","Sampling Fulton & Roark Sterling, a sharp blend featuring prominent notes of tobacco leaf and amber, almost with a varnish/lacquer/borderline whiskey type of vibe, as well, striking and fairly powerful, though not extremely dense. It’s a non-sweet contrast to Calle Ocho, the boozier sweeter blend. It expectedly dries down to be a little calmer, though its character does not change much, with still a lot of sharpness, borderline metallic, some hours in.

Like the rest of the extrait collection, Sterling is priced at $205 for 50ml, far from cheap, so I’d really only recommend a full bottle if you love it, and while I like it, I don’t love it, but I think it will suit some people very well in the cooler months, especially. My favorites of my sample set of five were ultimately Calle Ocho and Narada.

Rain [Reserve Blend] Limited Edition,10/19/2025,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,"And it smells good, by the way","Kenzo has a great sense of humour, if you ask me. And if I translate the name of this fragrance correctly: Ça sent Beau meaning This smells good. What a great name for a perfume! But apart from being quite fun, there is a truth to it, that I shall have to comment on. Since with this astounding product I do sometimes consider the smell secondary. Perhaps that needs an explanation. Let us look at in what order this unfolds itself.
It starts with the wrapping: stunning. The EdP comes in a beautiful light green box with a beautiful black (hand) writing stating Kenzo. Next to this is a red seal like decoration, a Japanese ‘hanko’. The box has structures of leaves pressed into the cardboard. Inside, the bottle is wrapped in crisp peach coloured tissue paper, almost nesting in it. Oh yes please! Now, that is what I call decent wrapping. The whole act of unwrapping makes my nervous system go bonkers. So much, that I tend to forget what it is all about - the fragrance.
But then there is the bottle. I have the deodorant, the miniature EdT and the ‘real thing’ - the EdP. All are in the stunning category. The EdP, however, takes the price. It has a stopper shaped like two flowers, and the neck and bottle reminds me of the now again popular activity of stacking rocks on top of each other. Even though the top is plastic, the whole picture is a balanced, beautiful and bold design, that leaves me with a luxurious feeling. So much that I tend to forget what it is all about - the fragrance.
Well, the fragrance is out of this world and should be in the Top100 - despite its high ranking, it is not in Parfumo’s Women’s Top100, which surprises me. It is creamy, floral and soapy at the same time. When it warms up it has a floral expression that makes me want it to stay like that forever. Actually, I think it is timeless. Such a shame that it is discontinued. But then again, I get to enjoy it, because it is in my collection.

Rain [Reserve Blend] Limited Edition,09/03/2023,Lauser93,M,1199,,2,Fruits and Flowers (EDIT: 23.02.2024),"Today, I wanted to compare the Ça Sent Beau EAU DE TOILETTE on the right and left arms with the ""Ça Sent Beau / Kenzo (Eau de Parfum) | Kenzo."" To my surprise, the perfume lasts only 3-4 hours on my skin with a rather weak sillage. The Eau de Toilette comes across as much more concentrated, likely due to its age - both fragrances come from collection dissolutions and are in older miniature bottles. I find the DNA of the scent not too bad but also a bit old school. It smells very floral and fruity.

The top note starts fruity with peach but also floral-sweet with orange and jasmine blossoms. The heart note remains distinctly floral. I detect rose water, geraniums, tuberose, gardenias, iris, violets, and lily of the valley - what a sea of flowers! The base reminds me a bit of soap and fabric softener. Additionally, I recognize a green-earthy patchouli aroma. It also has a slightly vanillic and balsamic scent.

All in all, this is a fairly successful fragrance, but I wouldn't necessarily associate it with my ""dream woman,"" as I find it a bit outdated.

EDIT 23.02.2024: Now I have tested another miniature. Here, the longevity was significantly better at around 12 hours. In the top note, I also detected bergamot and a jam-like quality. As it develops further, it also smells quite oriental, festive, and of cinnamon."
Clean,06/04/2023,KathrynA66,F,46,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Nice Trip on the Ferry,"On me, Kingston Ferry opens woody and green with a bit of sharpness that settles down very quickly into a soft woody, green floral. There is something here- an almost undetectable gasoline/fuel ""note."" It isn't unpleasant at all, and you sense it more than you really smell it (I swear that really does make sense, I think). It's not unpleasant at all and is, with the seagrass, evocative of a ferry.

I don't get any ""fish"" smell at all, just driftwood and sea grass, with their hints of salt, but I really like it. The saltiness, on me, is bringing bit of a fresh, briny accord into the woody, green florals.

On me, this saltiness fades within a couple of hours, and the drydown is a creamy, aromatic woody scent, which is very pretty and rather unique I think.

IMO Dr. Covey really hit the mark with this fragrance. It's quite good, although not something I would want to wear everyday. It's a unisex, adult fragrance, which lasts about 6-7 hours on me; sillage is moderate through most of that time. Great for warm weather, casual events."
Clean,04/01/2023,Hartsy3,F,99,,1,Not for me,"Let me start by saying that, while I have the utmost respect for Dr. Ellen Covey as an artist, I am clearly not the target demographic for this fragrance.

Here's an excerpt from my review of night flyer:

""What makes Dr. Ellen Covey a true artist, is how she breaks those expectations by creating very literal and unconventional fragrances. Dr. Covey doesn't just give you an ocean scene filled with coconuts, she brings you to the ocean ""warts and all"" and lets you breath the briny, salty air. This is great, transportive art. But not necessarily how a person wants to smell.""

In the case of Kingston Ferry, you have a gorgeous forest smell. Very similar to her other fragrance, Olympic Rainforest (a beautiful fragrance). But here we have added a repulsive, briny, salty undertone.

As someone who can't even stand to eat seafood, this is one of the most disgusting combinations I can imagine. It smells like fish and algea. I usually try a fragrance on my skin at least once before I write my reviews, but with this one, I can hardly even stand to be in the same room as the sample."
Clean,05/17/2025,kittea,F,65,,1,The importance of preserving estuarine habitats...,"This occupies a weird sort of niche in the realm of aquatic fragrances. Usually they can be divided pretty evenly into three distinct groups: the ""beachy"" aquatics, with their lemon and coconut and warm sand; the ""swimming pool"" aquatics, conjuring images of clean towels and shower gel; and the ""marine"" aquatics, aiming for the cold and dark nature of the ocean, of which Squid reigns supreme. Kingston Ferry is none of these, and is what I would term an ""estuarine"" aquatic.

I know this is inspired by the Pacific Northwest, but to me (having never been to that side of the U.S.) this reminds me of the temperate salt marshes in southern Australia. The color palette is not blue, it's brown and green, pale and looking dried out even when it's not. Grasses and scrubs. But if you eat a leaf from one of them, you'll taste the salt drawn up through the soil, through the roots of plants that have been fed on seawater rather than rain.

Basically, it smells like what I imagined Wood Sage & Sea Salt COLOGNE would have smelled like based on the name. Except it also lasts longer than a slight breeze."
Clean,07/18/2025,Notomys,F,5,,1,Jagerbombs on the Dock,"This is another fragrance from Olympic Orchids that I'm refraining from giving a numeric rating to because the scent itself isn't bad, it just isn't too my tastes. It's relatively unisex with a slightly modern, masculine edge. It has an informal feeling and doesn't really invoke association with a specific season.

It opens with a blast of harsh liquorice and tarragon. I don't know what notes are responsible for the fuel accord, but it's not subtle. If you're one of those folks who like the smell of gasoline, Kingston Ferry might be right up your alley. There is a lot of salt here at well. I grew up in a coastal fishing town, and this fragrance definitely invokes maritime memories -- but picture more 'riding a barely seaworthy lil' motorboat and drinking jagerbombs with the boys' kind of memories. It's kind of wild.

I don't get any of the fish or organic notes some other folks are describing, just salt, solvents and dried herbs. It mellows out a little bit and the herbal notes become a little bit more green and 'fresh shower-y' upon dry down. It's one of the more unorthodox aquatics I've smelled, but not for me"
Clean,05/22/2014,Palonera,F,467,,20,"gray sky, rough sea","Ellen Covey and I have already undertaken the most diverse journeys together.
She has taken me to the mountains and onto the stage, shown me grain fields and rainforests, let me see the stars and her very own Salamanca - and now, it seems, she also wanted to show me the sea.
Not the turquoise blue with white frothy crests gently lapping at powdery beaches, not the salty wind sweeping over rugged cliffs, nor the elegant snow-white yacht on the open sea - one should not expect such clichés from Ellen Covey, no matter how beautiful they may be.
Her fragrances tend to be a bit rougher, a bit more natural, stubborn, and often rather austere.
That she does not appeal to everyone and sometimes even clashes strongly with tastes is something she accepts - yet even though I find this trait immensely sympathetic, I approached the test with quite mixed feelings, especially after Ergoproxy's comment.

""Kingston Ferry"" opens herbaceous, gray-green-brown, and very strict, making it clear from the very first seconds that I need not prepare for a leisurely cruise.
Gray sky and wild sea, rubber boots and a raincoat come to mind.
It quickly turns dark, damp-woody-spicy nuances carry the scent of the not-so-distant, coniferous mainland over, mixing with the smell of smoke, machine oil, hot rubber, and a hint of tar.
Surprisingly authentic, it feels - I am catapulted back years and placed on the decks of ferries to Sweden, to England, right into the sharp smells of the massive ships.
Hot metal somewhere deep beneath my feet, black soot particles in the air - in the wind shadow beside me, a man rolls a cigarette, spicy warm tobacco aroma weaves golden-brown threads through the dark gray conglomerate of hard, gloomy, labor-intensive scent nuances.
For moments, I also feel transported back to ""Salamanca,"" smelling the dark, hot, soft tar - yet ""Kingston Ferry"" feels less harsh, less resolute in its darkness, which is prevented by persistently ethereal top notes and the Coveyade present here, though less spicy.

""Kingston Ferry"" is a remarkable fragrance - very authentic, very powerful, very masculine.
I can easily imagine it on big, broad-shouldered, well-built, dark-haired, go-getter guys, taciturn and seemingly full of energy - and perhaps it was exactly this image of a man that inspired Ellen Covey to create this fragrance.

Clean,07/05/2014,Seerose,F,775,HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Souvenir?,"Sometimes I wonder what such ingredient lists like the one above are supposed to achieve. Could it be that there are translation errors involved, or a lack of knowledge in botany?
Cedar leaf? What is that supposed to be? The cedar is a conifer, calling the needles ""leaves"" in German is at least strange. In English, tree needles are referred to as ""needle shaped leaves,"" at least in the ""Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English.""
Strawberry tree and heather lead to strange expectations. However, strawberry trees belong to the heather family. Heather only has a very intense scent in heather honey.
I just brought in a young green sprig of heather from outside, with almost bloomed flowers, and crushed it. It is a scent very familiar to me from northern Germany, in mixed forests and areas with heather: Herb, green, slightly bitter, very specific and nostalgic for me.
But you can really only recognize that if you know the smell of heather well and individually.
""Kingston Ferry Fragrance"" does not smell like that at all!
Rhododendron? It hardly has a scent, not even the flowers, but they also belong to the heather family. OK, when you crush leaves and flowers of plants, they at least emit indifferent green leaf scents. And firewood can smell like any wood. Driftwood smells dry and somewhat special, maybe a bit like the sea, somewhat aquatic. Garden and wildflowers are simply arbitrary; anyone can choose what they perceive from it, it is always correct.
So what do I smell?
At first, something delicate that transforms into a green scent, somewhat herbal, spicy. I can also smell something herbal and resinous.
Not a very expressive scent, but still pleasant at first. I can also perceive light woody notes.
Then the scent becomes milder, unfortunately a bit sweet and then also smelling of aquatic Ambroxan.
I have to keep my nose close to the skin because the scent of the crushed heather ""Kingston Ferry Fragrance"" overpowers it.
I find the real heather scent much more beautiful and interesting.
So I have to concentrate. But now ""Kingston Ferry Fragrance"" has almost faded after 2 hours, there is still a little remnant of an indifferent scent left.
I have a suggestion: ""Kingston Ferry Fragrance"" was created as a perfume to sell to travelers as a souvenir during the crossing.
Then it doesn't matter what it smells like and how it smells.
That's why it's also a unisex scent. And with the light sillage, it's not an intrusive keepsake."
Lush Fleur Limited Edition,10/29/2023,Florblanca,F,1168,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Fragrant Poison,"The advertising created for this fragrance at the time said:

Someone beautiful just passed by, someone wearing Intoxication!

Intoxication - the poisoning, the intoxication - a scent that is hard to find today. The Eau de Toilette comes in the same ""pleated"" Lalique bottle as the Extrait de Parfum, but unfortunately, the EdT has a plastic cap above the metal cap that serves as a screw closure, which has the same pleating as the bottle.

And this is also the only flaw of the EdT: the cap is made of plastic, not glass, and has become brittle and fragile over time, which somewhat reduces the value of the Lalique bottle. The D'Orsay crest is clearly visible on top of the cap, which does not enhance the brittle cap either.

The Eau de Toilette is not quite identical to the perfume, which is noticeably softer than the EdT.
Here, nothing of the initial softness can be felt anymore. On the contrary, the scent reaches a dry, almost creaky floral quality, which only jasmine, gardenia, violet, lily of the valley, and similar candidates can achieve. The dryness of the heart note is not powdery but rather herb-dry, without being bitter, as the floral sweetness is clearly present.

In projection, the whole is less creaky but quite loud, very perceptible, and with a hint of the initial softness.

The base smells only slightly woody, more mossy, herb-dark with a distinctly resinous accord. If there are animalic notes here, they are only cautiously dosed. I cannot perceive them at all.

In any case, the EdT is significantly louder than the Extrait de Parfum, which is rather defined by softness. In contrast, the EdT is a huge floral accord with dark background notes. It lasts extremely long.

As so often, I was surprised by the difference between Extrait de Parfum and Eau de Toilette. They are largely similar but still different in their effect. Soft and gourmand (perfume) against distinctly loud and slightly creaky (EdT).

Both are, however, beautiful fragrances, even today."
Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,06/19/2018,Darkbeat,M,386,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,A cool colony too expensive for what it offers.,"Today I am testing this Pure Colony of Acqua Di Parma, thanks to a sample, and that's it, a cool colony with an inflated price.

The output I love, it is a floral citrus aroma, quite pleasant, cheerful, fresh and sparkling, perfect for the heat of today, but, with how good the output is, in a matter of 20 minutes, it has given me a turn, that It has left me with a shrunken stomach, highlighting a pungent note of musky narcissus, which has stirred my guts, and it's a shame, because the start is fantastic, a pretty jovial and fresh aroma, incredibly nice to cool next summer, but its development, from the start, is deadly to my nose.

The perfume feels quality, but its performance is very loose, staying on my skin between 5 or 6 hours, with a moderate low projection, and although it sticks to the skin almost from the beginning, the narcissus got into my nose , and I was dizzy, smelled continuously, but only me, because I told my family members to smell me, and they told me that it smelled soft, but very well, in short, things of each other's chemistry.

It is a perfume of warm and temperate climates, and for day use, for casual outings and morning walks is a good candidate.

Being honest is a perfume that smells good, but I would not recommend it, especially due to its high cost and poor performance. It is one of those perfumes that I highly recommend a test before buying, to avoid disappointment, and once tested, if you like it, you yourself will know if it is worth the disbursement or not.

Sorry for my bad english."
Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,03/27/2024,Smeriglio,M,72,,1,Forced ventilation,"Bergamot and orange with an aldehyde edge kick off this fragrance. The aldehyde note remains and forms an aura that persists throughout the development of the perfume. At the center of the pyramid, narcissus and jasmine flowers contrast with the spicy note of coriander and quickly leave the scene to make room for a blend kept fresh by aldehydes, composed of cedar wood, patchouli and white musk.
A composition that makes use of good raw materials, but which is too focused on aldehydes."
Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,10/10/2025,joelajackson,M,4,,1,Modern take on classic 4711 profile,"I went on a mission this summer to try neroli-forward traditional colognes. I hoped to find something fresh that fits a casual T-shirt vibe for Westside LA. I grabbed 5 ml decants of Neroli Portofino, Mandarino di Amalfi, Colonia Essenza, and Colonia Pura and wore them throughout the heat. Pura ended up my favorite of the bunch. The twist is that the whole “neroli cologne” lane ended up reading formal to me. Pura is less formal, which leaves it in a tricky spot. When I want a dressy cologne, I would reach for Mandarino di Amalfi, and for truly casual, I would go outside the lane. I’m sure I’ll finish off the decant next summer, but won’t re-buy.

TL;DR: Easier-going Essenza energy with an ozonic, airy opening, then a smoother floral-citrus where orange shows more than expected, finishing in a clean woody-musk that sits close. Clean, modern, polite. Casual feel in a traditionally formal genre. It does evolve from opening to heart to drydown; not wildly, but enough to feel like a journey. Probably a good wardrobe piece for someone who likes this scent profile, less so for me.

Rating:

Opening: 3.1/5
Drydown: 2.8/5
Overall: 5.9/10

Opening
Early ozonic hit. Petitgrain pushes a clear soapiness on my skin, stronger than I prefer. I had hoped that skipping neroli would avoid that effect, but petitgrain plus white musks and airy florals creates the same “Cheap McDonalds Soap Dispenser” vibe (how my nose reads heavy neroli). It feels like a softer, friendlier Essenza that stays in the classic cologne mold, just airier. As the soapiness settles inside the first half hour, a gentle orange facet unexpectedly comes forward.

Heart
From about 60 to 120 minutes, it is an easier floral-citrus that is smooth and tidy, with a light herbal thread. The coriander note blends with the florals and reads greener than Essenza. It is pleasant and feels purposefully “traditional cologne” while clearly offering a unique take.

Drydown
By hour 5, you are in a clean woody-musk of cedar, soft patchouli, and white musks. It does not project much, but it has more presence than the airy opening suggests. Quietly masculine and easy to carry into evening. The core trace lingers to about 7 hours, mostly at skin level.

Performance on me
Polite, but strong for the genre. About 1.5 to 2 hours of aura, then close to skin. Roughly 5 to 7 hours total, with the last stretch as a subtle skin scent. I’d catch scents of it through the day if I applied it to my wrists if I was hand talking.

Versatility
High in theory and trickier in practice. The DNA says formal, but it wears casual on me. I would use it for a T-shirt-and-shorts creative meeting, although I still prefer other summer picks for that slot.

Use cases
Office days, client coffees, brunch where you want the first hug to smell clean. School events and travel days, anywhere conservative etiquette helps.

Vibe
White tee, good jeans, fresh haircut. It’s clean and modern, but not “too cool”. This is the well dressed guy who's wearing a white t-shirt tucked into jeans with a crew cut. He looks good, smells good, but doesn't have too much main character energy. The cooler dude with messy hair who may be stealing your girl is probably wearing Neroli Portofino.

Blind-buy safe?
No. I think this whole genre requires testing. Won’t perform well enough for some. Florals won’t land for others. Too mature for yet others. Give it a decant if you want a clean, modern feeling cologne that replaces some of the “Floral!” with ozone and aldehydes.

Comparisons
Colonia Essenza: Sharper, dressier, more neroli-forward snap and more obvious soapiness. Pura is softer and airier, a modernized take.
Tom Ford Neroli Portofino: Louder orange-blossom soap. Next to NP, Pura reads less soapy and more airy and orange-clean. Less floral, more white-musk and ozonic.
Tom Ford Mandarino di Amalfi: Juicier mandarin and grapefruit with *mint, basil, and thyme. More sparkly and aromatic in the heart; less overtly soapy than *Pura. Dries down to light citrus-aromatic over musks and woods, while Pura turns cleaner and more white-musk polished.
Dior Homme Cologne (2020): Brighter “iced-lemonade” citrus and better early projection. Pura trades fizz for tidiness.
Le Labo Bergamote 22: Greener, grapefruit-tinged bergamot with a diffusive *musky-woody* halo and a clearer vetiver and cedar second act. B22 radiates more, while Pura stays closer and cleaner. It still has a three-phase evolution, just subtler.

Conclusion

Colonia Pura threads the needle between classic Italian cologne polish and modern, low-key cleanliness. It was my favorite of the group, yet it is the least “me,” because it lives between dressy and casual. If you want that perfect just-showered aura without orange-blossom drama, this nails it. If you want sparkle, volume, or a signature flourish, reach for Bergamote 22, Dior Homme Cologne, or Mandarino di Amalfi. For hot days when you want to look put together without trying, Pura delivers exactly what it promises.

Context for review: Multiple wears from a 5 ml decant, warm weather, moisturized skin, mostly indoors with brief outdoor breaks."
Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,03/15/2018,loewenherz,M,916,,33,Chnuddelchatz,"Once a week, I have a regular meeting in a completely different, unfamiliar hallway. And because I like a colleague who is also a fixed part of this group, and her office is on the way to this meeting, I occasionally pick her up on the way there. Recently, she was still sitting briefly with her boss and signaled to me that she would be finished soon - and that I should wait for her for a moment. So there I stood among unfamiliar desks, and on one of them sat - still in its original packaging - a bottle of Acqua di Parma's Colonia Pura. And suddenly it dawned on me: that's for Chnuddelchatz!

That colleague - a rather prosaic and sober, but by no means misanthropic person - has been telling me for months about a colleague in her team who calls her partner twice every single day - once in the morning and once in the afternoon. She doesn’t address him by his name and doesn’t simply call him 'Schatz', but 'Schnuddelschatz'. And she talks to him in baby talk, where the 'sch' is pronounced like 'ch' in 'ich', so: 'Chnuddelchatz'. And my colleague never knows whether to quietly break down in her bag or go around the table and give the cooing lovebird a gentle headbutt.

Chnuddelchatz will soon be fifty, as the whole hallway has known for weeks. And as a very special gift, they are going for a long Chnuddel weekend at a totally romantic Chnuddel hotel, probably to snuggle from Friday to Sunday evening. But since just the Chnuddel card with the voucher looks a bit meager - and Chnuddelchatz could also use a new Chnuddeldüftchen - she has now considered that she could buy him such a Chnuddeldüftchen. It has turned out to be Colonia Pura. Nice that I’m finally up to date!

I don’t know Chnuddelchatz personally, but I’m sure he will like Colonia Pura. Almost everyone should like Colonia Pura - okay, FabianO not so much, I just noticed - it is harmless enough not to displease anyone. A really nice, zesty, hesperidic top note, a playful, sweet Chnuddel heart, and a warm woody musk base. It has worked countless times, and it will work again. For a house like Acqua di Parma, which has a true classic in its portfolio with Colonia, it actually offers a bit too little. As a cash cow for spring/summer 2018, it will still suffice.

Conclusion: a Chnuddel scent for Chnuddelchatz. And now I’m going to wash my mouth out with soap."
Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,08/06/2017,DaveGahan101,M,535,,17,Like a wine tasting..,"...one should ideally test perfumes in the early morning/forenoon, as palate, nose, and tongue are still unburdened. Said..done! Yesterday at Breuninger, I was quite surprised to encounter Pura, as I had been told two weeks prior that it would only be released in September. It wasn't even prominently displayed on a special presentation tray, but rather inconspicuously next to the cash register. The joy was even greater that it was already available for purchase and not just for testing purposes. Sprayed a little, took a city tour, bought it:-)!
I have done 3 test rounds so far, and today's test deviates a bit from the others.
But let's go in order...
Colonia Pura starts extremely fresh and zesty, freshly squeezed lemon with a splash of orange. It's fresher and more citrusy than all the Colonias combined. Wow.. I wouldn't have necessarily expected that from the listed notes. You immediately know you have THE Colonia - the original - under your nose, fresh, tart, and typically masculine. This is exactly the difference for me compared to many Atelier Cologne scents, which are ""only"" the world champions of top notes; a contrast, a (masculine) counterpart is often missing, they are often one-dimensional (still often smell good!). The original Colonia is immediately ""there,"" and yet the scent feels new, fresh, modern, and somehow clean.. maybe that's what ""Pura"" is meant to convey!? Clean not in the sense of dirty, but tidy, slim, transparent, and each individual note can be clearly detected, except for coriander. Green stuff from the herb kitchen, yes, but coriander.. no idea, doesn't matter.
In the extremely muggy 30 degrees yesterday, only the citrus notes came to the fore during the first two tests, along with the slightly soapy-creamy musk base. This morning, for the first time, I picked up the flowers and a hint of sweetness. Mainly, I could recognize the enchanting jasmine, which is often difficult in men's fragrances because it takes on a feminine direction, but not here. Even the Hermes-worthy Narcisse can't change that. Well dosed and still thoroughly a men's fragrance, but certainly wearable by women, although it will probably still be too tart for many.
The fragrance passes through the individual phases at a gallop; after 30 minutes, you've experienced everything. The highlights for me are clearly the top note and the even more beautiful floral heart note, as the scent has a certain depth in this phase. The patchouli in the base can be neglected; it's more of a hint than something that gives the fragrance a base or foundation.
Even though Pura isn't extremely different (except for the mono-club), I like it best with the original and it can still be wonderfully worn for the next 4-6 weeks; I find it a bit too refined for autumn and winter. It is the same yet so different from its brothers. Those who own the others probably don't need to have this one. If Colonia was too old-school for you, you might find joy in this one.
Longevity and sillage are Colonia-like. I do not regret the purchase; however, the fragrance came to market 2-3 months too late, like Cedro di Taormina back then, as it is a perfect spring and summer scent.

A beautiful, fresh variant and facet from the original classic theme, which is absolutely successful.
Not a must-have, but a very good fragrance!"

Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,04/05/2020,Basti87,M,1064,,19,Timeless classic modernized with bright flowers,"Another fragrance from Acqua di Parma has found its way into my collection last month. I haven't had a strong desire for heavier scents this year, also due to extremely mild temperatures and a lack of winter feeling. This way, one can start buying summer fragrances a bit earlier. Especially since Flaconi had a 30% discount. So I bought the 180ml for under 90 euros. For the size and the upscale AdP prices, it's a great bargain. A good size as well, since it's a wonderful cologne that can be worn for many occasions.
Acqua di Parma is a brand I really like. It simply stands for elegance with Italian flair. A lot of classic, especially through this Colonia line, which started with the classic over 100 years ago. Many modern and new releases have also followed, including the Blu Mediterraneo line, of which I also own 3 fragrances. Perhaps one or two more will follow from this brand.

I really like the bottles from this brand. Great glass in a round bottle, along with a stylish logo, kept simple and elegant. The Blu line is even more beautiful with blue glass, but here the bottle simply conveys the content: style and elegance.
I will keep the fragrance description brief. The original from 1916 is listed as a twin. The resemblance is clearly detectable. Especially the opening with lemon and bergamot is quite similar. In my opinion, Colonia Pura smells more modern and contemporary throughout its entire duration. This is likely due to fresh bright flowers and a lot of petitgrain, which refresh the scent in a modern way. The original is 100% timeless, but one must like these classic vintage DNAs, and they must fit one's style. In this case, one can say: It always works. A wonderful blend of fresh-citrusy DNA paired with bright flowers and herbaceous-green notes. The base fades out with slightly woody notes. Overall, it's a well-rounded experience from start to finish. The big highlights are absent, which is not unusual for this cologne concept. Always wearable in warm to hot temperatures, especially in everyday life. It might not be suitable for work if you don't want to reapply frequently. It lasts 3-4 hours with good sillage, possibly even longer close to the skin. But in summer, I enjoy a great refreshment for a few hours. This is wearable from young to old, by both women and men. In terms of scent type, it goes in a similar direction as Artisan Pure by John Varvatos, which is a tad better and performs significantly better.

Conclusion: For me, a great modernization of an absolute classic. It works well at temperatures above 20 degrees. A fragrance I can recommend, but only if you can get it on sale or have a discount code.

Let's hope for a wonderful summer with many opportunities to wear great summer fragrances under the given circumstances. Stay healthy."

Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,05/12/2018,MisterShaver,M,16,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Once upon a time in Cologne ...,"... and one wondered, how can we make our original Cologne scent, which has existed for a long time and rightly so, different without betraying it?

That’s how Pura might have come to be. It also starts with a citrus scent, but only orange is included. Okay, that’s enough. Because in the overall composition, the original Cologne is present, but somehow more modern. Pura doesn’t start as loudly as the original Cologne, and the development remains at that level. The beginning is fresh, and then it becomes something that you don’t quite know from the original father. It develops with a slight understatement into a truly elegant fragrance. It fits with a fine suit, leather shoes, and a loosely tied tie with the top button of the shirt open. However, it is less conspicuous to the environment; the scent remains close to the body. It’s like a fine watch that was a bit more expensive, but doesn’t come off as too flashy (my recommendation here would be the Junghans brand with the Meister series).
And is all of this bad in the direction of ISO-E-Super? Not for me. It might be an approach to a different audience segment that has previously been more dedicated to the modern and trendy fragrance area. If that were even necessary. If yes, then it’s the opportunity to bridge these worlds. But it is by no means an attempt to pander through copying the synthetic fragrance world. Not at all! Pura stays on its side, so to speak. It never slips into that sticky candy world or clings heavily to the top note. It is simply more noble, but it could pass as modern. Whoever wears Pura still appears fine, balanced, and indeed more elegant. When you hang up your clothes in the evening, there’s something else there. A very light hint of fresh laundry... does that come from Pura, or was it really the detergent? The mere fact that I consider it possible that it could come from Pura makes this fragrance something special.
I find it wonderful!

By Heinz Erhardt

What else is there to say about this fragrance? I’ll try to describe it like music.
The piece starts very citrusy fresh, almost sour. After a short while, the petitgrain joins in. However, I can’t make out any oranges; there are probably just pauses in the score.
Over time, the flowers also join the symphony and gradually take the lead. The lemons become quieter as the flowers get louder, but they never completely disappear.
The musk adds a light, transparent quality to the composition.
The cedar and patchouli have only very soft notes on the sheet music. They are probably playing along, but I can’t... uh, smell... them out individually. However, if they weren’t there, they would be missed.

As beautiful as the symphony of composer Demachy may be, it is unfortunately very short: after 3 hours, the last notes have faded away. The volume is well-suited for all places where the surroundings should hear a bit, but not be overwhelmed.

Personally, I have found a very special place for Mr. Demachy’s work: I like to wear the fragrance while sleeping, as it has a cooling and relaxing quality and is not too strong."

Pink - Bubbly Fresh & Clean,03/04/2024,LeopGra,M,31,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,"Orange - However, harvested too early","After this variant of the Colonia has come into my collection as a small sample, I tested it today and have a few words to say about it.

First of all, I do not find Colonia Pura bad or unpleasant at all; it just seems a bit immature and not as harmoniously combined as the original. There are a few notes that throw the fragrance slightly out of balance, which is why it receives a somewhat lower rating.

About the scent:

It starts classically with a modified DNA of the original ""Colonia (Eau de Cologne) | Acqua di Parma."" However, I find it consistently less citrusy and also less fresh from the beginning, which may be due to the missing lemon. Additionally, there is a herbal coriander in the top note with a slightly balsamic spiciness that I find somewhat distracting. It simply diverts attention too much and partially covers the floral notes of jasmine and daffodil, which only appear later. This slightly medicinal and clean vibe is supported by the petitgrain and white flowers, which emphasize a green fragrance direction. The top and heart notes are coherent in themselves, if it weren't for a coriander that has gotten out of control. However, I am quite sure that some people who smell the fragrance will really enjoy the green, slightly fresh coriander notes and will cling to them.

In the base, there is primarily musk, which is by no means animalic, but rather beautifully creamy, giving Colonia Pura a great texture. The dry down is also slightly earthy and woody, coming from the patchouli and cedar. In my opinion, the base is very coherent and offers a smooth transition to the end of the fragrance.

Longevity and sillage are not particularly convincing due to it being a fresh EdC, as the scent disappears after about 5-6 hours. However, since this is not unusual for summer fragrances, I find this not too tragic.

In conclusion, I can say that Colonia Pura is an average good summer fragrance that will be a good catch for many. Since it also smells somewhat like older ladies to me, I think it is a bit outdated and obsolete for this time and by far not as good as the original. As a sample, I think it is certainly a good catch."

Never intrusive, rather subtle and not at all piercing. In my opinion, it is more of a classic, fresh scent compared to the Blu Mediterraneo line, which feels more distinctive.
A few hours later, I had already bought the bottle, mind you at a good price/performance ratio.

The end product is a scent that is both invigorating and soft, a fragrant journey through a sunlit meadow, while a gentle breeze whispers through leaves, enhancing your earthy and grounding experience, Its balance and natural-smelling profile means that it is versatile and elegant."
Pink - Fresh & Clean Frosted,08/01/2021,Nasenmann,M,5,,6,Summer Rain in the Castle Garden,"At the outset and deep into the heart, unsweetened, very sour, almost bitter citrus aromas (more unripe lemon than mandarin) dominate, combined with aromatic notes (lavender, mint) and earthy-mineral notes (notably mastic, perhaps a bit of geosmin, and from deep in the base, the patchouli+vetiver combo). The official scent pyramid seems relatively truthful to me.

In my mind's eye, deep green, slightly floral, and cool-wet associations arise - to be precise, I think of a castle park with well-kept lawns and rose hedges and/or gardenias, from which water beads shortly after a summer thunderstorm, while the sky has not yet cleared. With the rain, the temperature has also dropped; it has become a bit too cool for short-sleeved clothing.

I am still not one hundred percent sure which other fragrances this reminds me of, but there are definitely candidates. Perhaps Floris' Elite, which, when testing, reminded me of a distinctly more aristocratic (Gucci) Nobile. The base vaguely leans towards late 70s men's fragrances, without me being able to name anything specific. However, I generally think more of Aramis than Quorum, which the creator himself mentioned in his fragrance description.

For this turn towards classic men's perfumery, I respect this scent very much, but I wouldn't want to wear it frequently. The slightly gloomy and very classic aura is too alien to my nature or not what a fragrance should radiate for me.

In this respect, I find it quite fitting that the naming references classical music. Is it Beethoven's 6th Symphony? Probably not. If anything, only the less cheerful movements. Perhaps more Mozart or Schubert than Beethoven. But what do I know, I’m not really well-versed in that.

If the fragrance had more cheerfulness before and after the rather gloomy main part, it would indeed be comparable to a symphony and somehow genius. As it stands, Harmonie Pastorale gets a thumbs up from me but no purchase."
Skin [Reserve Blend],01/10/2014,VegaOcean,M,155,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Never has coffee smelled so noble...,"During my travels through China, I got stuck in the IT Store in December 2012. Not for clothes, no, but for the fragrances by Herve Domar from Paris. The IT Store sells all the clothing brands that are fine and expensive. Classics like Givenchy, D&G, and Versace as well as newcomers like Alexander Wang, etc.

I didn’t care. I sniffed my way through Domar’s fine bottle creations priced at around €80. All contain one to two gemstones. He names his fragrances after them. Not particularly original, but Emeraude (Emerald) blew me away. Those who know Montale Intense Cafe and find it too sweet and feminine will be happy with Emeraude. It is much nobler and more mature. Unfortunately, it seems to be completely unavailable in Germany. After my sample, I must buy it now. Absolutely.

About the scent: It starts like a mix of amaretto coffee and vanilla syrup. Not very fresh yet so powerful right away. One-dimensional but noble and inevitable like a Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford. This amber that flashes through repeatedly is wonderful. People around me immediately noticed the scent, and it lasted a whole day or rather a 12-hour flight. That’s what you want from a fragrance. I sense little patchouli, but the sandalwood comes out perfectly and softly in the dry down. Has a bit of Black Afgano by Nasomatto perhaps hidden itself in the Emeraude scent? It’s always a pleasure to smell myself with this fragrance. Great for winter or elegant evenings.

Hands down Mr. Herve Domar. I am your fan. Whoever finds it, buy it! Please leave me the address :)

Solar Bloom,10/17/2012,Sherapop,F,1240,,2,Red Jam Fruity Floral,"After reading several rave reviews of Brecourt L'AMOUREUSE, I came dangerously close to buying a bottle blind. Fortunately, rationality prevailed, and I ordered the sample set instead. I say ""fortunately"" because this turns out to be another jammy floral very similar in style and quality to many designer perfumes on the market today.

I think that I was expecting a different quality level of perfume, although it is true that this self-proclaimed niche line is quite modestly priced. Seems like a case where you get what you pay for. In this case, L'AMOUREUSE offers a sort of compote of red jam berries and flowers, including rose. But I myself would not categorize this as a rose perfume.

This perfume might be a good choice for people attempting to transition from designer to haute niche, but it's much closer to the former than the latter, at least according to my nose."
Solar Bloom,07/05/2025,Ganii,F,132,,2,Not what I thought it would be,"Huge no for me, the perfume was not as good and fruity as expected...

Solar Bloom,08/21/2014,Palonera,F,467,,24,And if they are not divorced...,"Maybe you just have to be in love.
In love and young and carefree.
You have to live in that state where the flowers are brighter, the fruits sweeter, where the whole world seems to be coated in a sugar crust and you float around in pop-art-colored soap bubbles.
To be in love, perhaps for the very first time.
Not yet knowing, not wanting to know, that this feeling is a state of exception, artificially induced in the brain's own chemistry lab, not unlike a drug high and equally time-limited.
Which is a blessing, by the way, because who would want to, who could live in a state of permanent euphoria - not to mention: insanity?!

Maybe you have to be in love to love ""L'Amoureuse,"" to find yourself in it and nod in understanding.
Perhaps this is simply my problem: that I love, for a long time now, but am no longer in love, no longer suffering from racing heartbeats, from sweating, insomnia, and obsessive thoughts about the object of my desire.
Fortunately not - I would hardly have survived eight years of uninterrupted ecstasy unscathed.
On the other hand, it is precisely this non-state that prevents me from giving ""L'Amoureuse"" the respect it surely deserves, from enjoying the sweet fruits and the technicolor flowers that dance around me in a breathtaking whirl, from which only now and then a raspberry and a candied violet peek out.
Sweet and colorful and a bit exhausting, it's a little like being at a fair, where one carousel ride chases the next until I no longer know where my head is.
And it is quite similar with being in love.

If all goes well, infatuation eventually turns into love, the exuberance subsides and flows into calmer, more contemplative, but also deeper waters.
From the all-encompassing rosy hue, individual colors crystallize out, blood pressure and breathing slow down, and thoughts that do not revolve around the beloved return to the mind, and perhaps one is quite glad to use the night for sleeping, with the lights off, eyes closed, and bed socks on the feet.
The high tension gives way to the compatibility tester of everyday life, and ""L'Amoureuse"" also takes its foot off the gas, dims the sweetness, and sprays a little hairspray over the flowers, which now resemble a dried bridal bouquet more.
That is livable - and if they are not divorced, then they still love each other today.

I perceive ""L'Amoureuse"" as a young, especially playful fragrance in the first hours, and certainly one that needs to be dosed with caution, which sometimes reminds me of the first version of ""Eden,"" without revealing its primal force.
Where ""Eden"" boasts powerful sweetness from the first to the last second, ""L'Amoureuse"" becomes quieter, more mature over time, and for me personally, also more bearable.
But to fall in love, to love at all, it takes just a little more..."
Solar Bloom,01/08/2014,KleineHexe,F,78,,26,Scenes from a Marriage - Today: Conversation at the Breakfast Table,"My entire family slept poorly last night. We were all somewhat restless and kept waking up. No idea what such phenomena are related to: weather fronts, earth rays, comet constellations? The look in the mirror this morning showed me a totally crumpled and tired being.

""When everything seems perfect and we feel the breath of eternal youth, the spirit is enthusiastic and the body is free - a euphoric moment."" - the advertisement from ALzD for ""L'Amoureuse"" promised the suitable antidote for this state.

The ugly, black, bulky bottle does not fit my idea of love at all. Anyway, I have no intention of hanging this thing around my neck. It's all about the content!

Freshly dabbed with the perfume, I enter the kitchen and sit down at the laid breakfast table. I haven't perceived much of the perfume so far. It started off fresh and then became floral, fruity, sweet, and only barely perceptible to me. Individual scent notes do not stand out.

During breakfast, I sniff at my arm. Hardly anything to smell. Since testing a fragrance creation by Mr. Schön, I have become cautious. With that one, I also hardly smelled anything, but my surroundings were overwhelmed by the surrounding scent cloud. Maybe this is the new modern art of perfumery: you hardly smell anything yourself, just lightly and only as a single scent note, and the people around you fall to the ground?

I sniff at my arm again. My husband starts to grin.

HE: ""I'm not going to say anything about that.""

ME: ""I promised Hasi I would write a comment. So how do I smell?""

HE: ""I smell nothing!""

I get up, walk over to him, and hold my arm under his nose.

ME: ""Do you smell anything now?""

HE: ""Wait a moment... slightly sweet like fruit. Is that YOU?! I thought it was coming from our trash can. But now that you're standing next to me, I can smell it quite clearly. Yes, it's only since you've been in the kitchen that it smells like this.""

ME: ""Thanks, that's enough. I don't need any more impressions from you.""

HE: ""You don't want to write that in your comment, do you?!""

Yes, that's exactly what I'm doing here. I can't think of a better description for L’Amoureuse."
Solar Bloom,02/19/2011,Fran,F,253,,0,"Room Spray ""Apple - Orange""","Well, the Brecourts. I haven't tried them all yet, but here is yet another fragrance in the ""Yawn"" category, and unfortunately, also in the subcategory ""Wanted but Not Achieved."" While other boring, pardon, unspectacular scents from this house are at least somewhat well-made, L'Amoureuse unfortunately also shows qualitative weaknesses.

The perfume starts off quite promising. The opening is crisp, zesty, and I look forward to a possible chypre development; the citrusy-bitter orange peel with a skillfully dark-sweet contrast piques my curiosity and puts me in a favorable mood for this creation.

And then it happens very quickly. Suddenly, another note slithers in and ruins everything. Plastic. Very synthetic, unfortunately. I think this was supposed to be an apple note. But alas, from now on it smells like an air freshener from the drugstore, scent direction ""Apple - Orange."" Fruity and artificial.

As with some other Brecourts, all the ingredients here have been so minimized and homogenized that only a single scent note has come out of it, and that is once again very boring. There is no multidimensionality, no depth, no development. It’s a bit like mixing all the colors of the watercolor set endlessly until a dull gray comes out at the end. This is especially true for the base, which is simply floral-fruity-sweet, but unfortunately also with the plastic note.

Clean Sphynx,09/30/2024,SVT,M,56,,1,A good discovery,"This attar immediately opens with fruity notes, specifically first pear and shortly after Raspberry, which are then muted by citrus, giving a touch of sparkle, thus avoiding creating a fruit salad effect.
In small steps the scent enters the heart and here it becomes an ode to the rose, first with green, dry nuances, then emerges a then lemony not too disturbing and a little powdery, leading all the way to the dry down where the woody notes, which play a role on the side, emerge

The way this rose develop is similar to Fueguia's ""Aguila de Ambar"", however deprived of the sweet amber part that not everyone might like.

Still, this is a good blend that can have everyday use."
Clean Sphynx,10/16/2024,Dgiuli,N/A,4,,3,the royal temple of the orient,"and once again we (the perfumer of these amazing scents and I) spent our lunch break together in our favorite cigar lounge, enjoying a great Cuban cigar during a relaxed discussion. We gladly used the time for our shared passion for ""amazing scents."" Here, I had the luck to get my hands on a fantastic fragrance from ""Nebiru."" It was String Theory EXTRAIT as a perfume spray. For me, this was a special honor, as it is sold out and I was able to learn the story behind it. So I was very curious about what awaited me.

I sprayed this scent directly onto my skin. With such natural fragrances, this is truly the best thing you can do. What can I say, ""bäääähhhhmmm, what is this!?"" Just wow. I absolutely did not expect that. Until now, I was not familiar with the individual fragrance notes. So it was time to let the scent unfold and let my thoughts wander.

On the first sniff, I get something incredibly fruity, dense, and absolutely natural. Sweet, yes, but really very natural and not too sweet. Until now, I only knew overly sweet or rather artificial ""oriental"" scents. This one has truly shown me a new kind of sweetness. Fantastic. The scent is so rounded and dense that it creates such a harmonious composition. I am always very cautious with rose and iris, as they often become too much, too old, too kitschy, or something else for me. But here, simply wonderfully intertwined and in no way too much or intense. The roses and the blue lotus are wonderful and provide a light floral touch without being really floral. The ouds are beautifully combined and woven together. There is absolutely no sign of barnyard oud. Just a wonderful woodiness that you can enjoy. Hyrax, musk, civet, all animalic notes. But even here, so finely and beautifully intertwined that this animalic aspect rather rounds it off and embraces you, connecting with you to form a veil.

What lingers in my nose the whole time is an animal, somehow something dark and leathery. Not the usual animalic scent, no, an animal, but without being really recognizably animalic. It is wonderful and quite extraordinary. Here too, I learned how this ""animalic"" aspect comes about.

I must say that the perfume spray is brighter, more open, and radiates more. The animalic aspect comes through more as well. Whether attar or spray is ultimately a matter of taste. I find both wonderful. Currently, I own the ""String Theory (Attar) | Nebiru Parfvms."" The longevity is again from another planet. The quality is, of course, outstanding here as well.

Many thanks to Frederic for the experience."
Fresh n Clean,12/18/2024,Swissprecise,M,1,,1,An Urban Fragrance for the Modern Gentleman,"Brooklyn by the Brooklyn Soap Company has captivated me from the very beginning. It is a modern, uncomplicated Eau de Parfum that conveys urban chic while also providing a pleasant lightness.

The Fragrance:
Immediately after application, a fresh and citrusy top note unfolds, radiating clarity and vitality. However, the perfume does not stop at freshness: over time, aromatic herbs and a gently spicy note blend in, giving the fragrance more depth and character. Particularly pleasant is that Brooklyn never feels too heavy or intrusive. It remains elegant and wearable, ideal for everyday use or special occasions.

Performance:
The longevity pleasantly surprised me. Despite its light freshness, the fragrance lasts solidly for several hours on the skin and unfolds beautifully. The sillage is subtle, never coming across as unpleasant - just right for those who prefer not to be too intense.

Conclusion:
Brooklyn is an ideal companion for men who value a well-groomed, modern appearance. The fragrance feels high-quality without being overwhelming, and it is definitely versatile. Those in search of an urban, timeless, and understated scent will find it here.

Overall, a clear recommendation for anyone looking for a stylish addition to their fragrance collection."
Fresh n Clean,12/29/2023,Remos,M,5,,1,Wear me at work where I am going to wear off!,"The title is very fitting in my opinion.
This fragrance is a great everyday companion for work (but certainly also for the gym or leisure in general).

This is subjectively due to the fact that the scent is very quiet and probably won't even be noticed. Only in close proximity. That means the fragrance is very close to the skin and quite subtle after 1-2 hours. The nice thing for me is that I still perceive it again and again. But what exactly do I perceive?

For me, the scent starts off spicy-citrusy and quickly transitions into a creamy citrus fragrance. If you spray too much at once, it comes off a bit soapy. Probably due to lavender notes.

The mentioned creaminess combined with the freshness of lemon really smells very pleasant and comforting. The scent is very linear and does not develop further. The reason for my purchase was that I really liked the beard oil with the same scent direction. However, the beard oil is, in my opinion, a bit more citrusy and less 'creamy-soapy'.

Conclusion: If you are looking for a fresh-creamy-lemony clean man scent, you will find it here. Due to the very weak longevity and sillage, just take the bottle with you and reapply as often as you like. Otherwise, the title is the program. For the price, I think it's a nice pleasure."
Fresh n Clean,05/05/2023,Soaringscent,M,4,,4,A fragrance with more than one surprise:,"Thanks to a nice comment from a perfumer, I found the motivation and am now writing my first fragrance review.

Brooklyn is undoubtedly a fragrance that is highly fascinating and uniquely combines freshness and citrus notes with green tones and spiciness in equal measure. What makes it unique is a certain lightness that is noticeable in every fragrance note, without losing depth. This scent caught my attention more than once during our first encounter, and I wondered how it manages to evoke such fascination.
Here is my attempt at an explanation:
""From nothing to something"", American Dream, New York City, Gin and Tonics. These associations are triggered by the fragrance, and I recognize them.

As soon as I spray the fragrance, I immediately notice the cypress and juniper, which remind me of a Gin Tonic. But just a few seconds later, the lime becomes increasingly prominent, adding a citrus-fresh note that creates a clear contrast to the green-bitter base note. This shift between the different notes constitutes the first surprise.

The second surprise occurs in the drydown: The Gin Tonic transforms into a Gin Fizz, with the juniper and lime remaining while mint joins in. The mint is distinctly noticeable and stays present for quite a while before it is gradually replaced by a modern interpretation of a fougère. This interpretation is extremely well done and fascinating in its development.

Finally, the fragrance reaches its surprising conclusion, characterized by incense and cedar. This gives the fragrance an unexpected but elegant note.

Unfortunately, the fragrance dissipates a bit too quickly, although with a longevity of about 6 hours, it is still reasonable considering the freshness and the price. However, I expected a bit more due to the green notes. The sillage is good and perceptible for a long time, but not extraordinary.
I find the bottle simple, but fitting.
In summary, Brooklyn, you are not only a great neighborhood but also a great fragrance. For me, it is the perfect choice for a spring feel-good scent that is suitable for all occasions."
Clean Laundry,12/21/2024,Minigolf,F,2512,,4,"An ""incredible"" vintage chypre of the highest class!","Discovered on the ""discard list"" (thanks Markus!), ordered blindly for a swap and hit the mark - or rather, the green one. A fragrance that, by reading its page, excites my expectations even more. Now it will be described in detail and enjoyment, just as I perceive it.
At the beginning, very ""potent"" citrus fruits await in natural aromas for the further ingredients, which can already be sensed before they are truly smelled. Then, shortly after, the greenest galbanum emerges, accompanied by a primal birch-tar leather note, inky, rough, and soft at the same time. The lemony and orangey scents follow closely behind. Then it becomes woody. Sandalwood - like in the past - probably still real! delights all the senses. Spiked with mosses and a delicate vanilla glaze. Earthy notes also leave nothing to be desired. There’s herbaceous-grassy-rooty vetiver paired with a good portion of patchouli. The citrus fruits are still present! And the sandalwood-moss accords reach their peak. Galbanum greets green and bright all around. Fortunately, the birch-tar leather does not want to give way! A true vintage world unfolds before my nose. More modern niche fragrances in this direction cannot do it better! Also in terms of longevity, Sterling plays in the top league, the sillage, powerful, yet never exaggerated, has everything that the green chypre heart desires!
Truly a dream fragrance! Dream?? It stands before me and I revel in its odor! :-))"
Clean Laundry,09/10/2022,Stephan73,M,70,,2,Fresh and leathery,"I used to enjoy wearing John Sterling back in the late 90s, as I am really into leathery scents. It's just a shame that this fragrance is currently so hard to find, either through online shops in the USA or on eBay; unfortunately, it is no longer available in regular perfumeries here. It is truly a wonderful scent that can preferably be worn in summer or autumn. The top note is clearly dominated by the delicious fresh clementine, which skillfully transitions into the leathery heart, while patchouli and musk form the base, perfectly balanced. A refined fragrance. Always modern and just right as a daily scent for the office."
Clean Laundry,02/28/2015,Cappellusman,M,358,,1,A Gentleman FROM Italy?,"Because that's where I got my OF from, and at a quite reasonable price. ""John Sterling""? Neither Fragrantica nor Basenotes provide any information about the manufacturer or what the name might refer to. Wikipedia knows of a Scottish author by that name as well as, among others, a fairly well-known football commentator.

Is this the only fragrance from this ""brand""? If it is even a brand at all. On the bay, you can find it at what I consider reasonable prices as ""Forester John Sterling."" All quite confusing, almost mysterious...

About the scent: Clearly 1984, it could easily be older due to its character. The association made by the esteemed colleague Fiddleworth with classic English colognes does not resonate with me. Was the name perhaps the father of the thought? Damn, where does this scent come from?

For me, it is clearly a representative of the classic spicy men's fragrances, as we know and appreciate them from the 60s and 70s. Right after a very brief citrus appearance in the top note, it introduces leather accords that shape this fragrance throughout its entire development. Among other things, I also smell an accord that reminds me of my signature scent, the divine ""Mark Cross."" If a fragrance can achieve that, it immediately earns a place in my heart.

So why only 80%? Well, this beautiful scent is ultimately too subtle for me; for its class, it could use a bit more punch and longevity, and if a decent dose of oakmoss had been added in the base, it could have been a done deal for me. As it stands, it leaves an extremely positive impression. Old-schoolers should definitely give it a try."
Clean Laundry,02/20/2014,Fittleworth,M,89,,9,A Gentleman in Italy,"John Sterling comes in noble attire.
Just as befits a gentleman on his travels.

A simple blue bottle adorned with a silver-framed leather crest, packaged in a midnight blue box with silver lettering ... and for those who prefer something particularly elegant, the bottle has also been wrapped in a brown synthetic leather case.
This way, it is excellent for transport and quickly accessible while traveling.

A fresh, slightly sharp citrus note opens this fragrance, immediately accompanied by a gradually intensifying leather accord that soon makes its presence felt quite dominantly.
This accord, which inevitably reminds me of large, handcrafted travel bags made from the finest leather, is flanked by a multi-layered, profound wood note that quickly takes on a green hue.

A light, somewhat soapy undertone adds the image of a barbershop, pleasantly understated and rounded off by a faint, sweet, very discreet hint of vanilla.
The sillage is good; it lasts on my skin for at least 8 hours.
No, John Sterling is not a great fragrance.
While it has a distinct recognition effect, in my opinion, it cannot measure up to the traditional English scents it is clearly inspired by.
It is a pleasant, albeit somewhat curious blend of Trumper's ""Eau de Quinine"" and Taylor's ""Sandalwood Cologne,"" whose nobility it unfortunately never reaches.

I would still like to recommend it to all those who are enthusiastic about barbershop fragrances, were it not for the strange pricing - I still remember well that the prices now quoted in euros were not even asked for in Deutsche Marks several years ago."
Freshest Cleanest,09/23/2025,ScoopyScoop,F,101,,1,A slightly fruity bubble bath,"Clean & comforting. Vegetal yet fruity. This a lovely easy reach perfume that’s inoffensive, (slightly) soapy and quietly inviting. This could easily be a fresh bedtime scent or a work-friendly skin scent.

As a skincare girly, I immediately get the centella asiatica note: it’s gentle, green and fresh. The peach note is subtle. The green plums here are tart in a subdued way. It’s less sweet & fruity than I expected. I think this could pair well several hyacinth-forward soapy skin scents. For instance, I think this would be truly a delight layered with Posies’ “Heartless.”

The packaging is BEYOND cute"
Love All Clean Green,07/25/2015,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Fragrance with Bubbles,"Ginger Ale, many love it, but many do not, yet it is one of the most consumed non-alcoholic and slightly bitter soft drinks. It has a distinctive and refreshing scent that has been very well captured here.

The fragrance:
Wow, what a rendition. You immediately smell the typical and citrusy Ginger Ale scent, as if you had poured yourself a glass of this herbal lemonade.
But now comes the truly special something about this fragrance. You actually feel as if you could taste or inhale the sparkling bubbles of the carbonation in the drink. It almost makes your mouth water, so much so that you would like to drink the scent, which you probably shouldn’t do… even if it says Cologne on the label.

The longevity is terrible. At first, you enjoy the pleasant scent, and in the next moment, you wonder if you had merely imagined it. It lasts barely 30 minutes before it completely disappears.
The sillage is weak; it could be compared to 4711 Eau de Cologne fragrances. It is not meant to project the scent into the surroundings, but rather to refresh oneself temporarily.

The bottle is weak, as always. But it is sufficient, as always.
The label is weak, as before. It has a lot of stuff written on it, as usual.

This fragrance has been very authentically realized, and I also found it great that it could even convey that sparkling sensation.

Aside from that, it is one of the rarer Demeter fragrances that I actually find wearable, as it has a certain similarity to Eau de Cologne and similar citrusy refreshing scents. However, you can only enjoy it very briefly, as it unfortunately (oh no, I say unfortunately for a Demeter fragrance!) vanishes in the next moment. But I think it is a good alternative to 4711 if you want a quick freshness kick, although 4711 probably lasts more than twice as long.

So, feel free to test it. If you ever see it or get your hands on it…

Blub blubber blub…"
