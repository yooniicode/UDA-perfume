Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"TWO

Not a go-to for me; this is a report after finishing a 2 ml decant. I picked it up to compare with my all-time summer favorite (Dior Homme Cologne) and a shoulder-season staple (Bergamote 22).

BdC smells great, especially if you like citrus (I do). It is less “iced lemonade” than Dior Homme Cologne and more like the whole fruit.

TL;DR: A photoreal take on an Italian citrus most of us have not smelled in person. Bright citrus-green opening that settles into a light woody-musky hush. Polite, easy, pleasant, but likely to underwhelm on performance, especially projection.

Rating:
Opening: 4.1/5
Drydown: 2.8/5
Overall: 3.5/5

Opening
Fresh-cut bergamot on a board. Knife through peel and pith, oils mist up with a green-bitter spritz. The interior is ripe enough to read a touch sweet. Sweet, acidic, and green at once. The blend is seamless; I do not see edges between the citrus, ginger, and bergamot. Together they paint a convincing bergamot portrait.

The issue: despite smelling fantastic, it lies flat on my skin. Detectable at about two feet, but it does not seem to want to be smelled. Where Dior Homme Cologne leaps off my skin, this is reticent and almost apologetic.

Heart
No distinct heart notes on me; it stays linear. At about 90 minutes I am still getting that beautiful bergamot, just closer to skin.

For a fresh scent, it is oddly dense, like the aroma is bound up in the fruit’s oil and cannot quite escape.

Drydown
The opening thins to skin level around 3-4 hours. By about 4.5 hours it is a soft, slightly creamy (benzoin?) skin-musk.

A faint musk trace sticks around 6-8 hours, but only with your nose on skin. Nice to wake up to, but no one else will notice.

Performance on me
This gets dunked on online for atrocious longevity. On me it is not atrocious, just not great. About 60-90 minutes of a modest aura, then close to skin. 3-4 hours of practical wear on skin. It is a liberal respray fragrance, and because the musky base is light, you can reapply a few times a day without issue.

Versatility
Wearable anywhere because it is so understated. That same understatement means I will not reach for it often, and it will not justify a full bottle. Too flat, too little projection.

Use cases
Patio brunch where you want to smell nice on the first hug. Business meetings where you want to be pleasant but not noticed as the cologne person. Around home when you want a quiet scent for yourself.

Vibe
Crisp white tee, rolled-sleeve linen, top down on a windy coastal road in a posh red roadster. Polished, sunny, approachable.

Blind-buy safe?
If you like citrus, yes. If you crave projection, no. This is about scent quality, not horsepower.

Comparisons
- **Dior Homme Cologne (2020):** More acidic up top, the famous iced lemonade vibe. BdC smells more like an actual fruit. DHC projects better in the first hour; BdC sits closer but can linger longer as a skin trace.
- **Bergamote 22:** Similar green-bergamot aura, but B22 is brighter from grapefruit and offers a proper second chapter with its vetiver-forward drydown.

Overall take
Bergamotto di Calabria smells wonderful up front, juicy citrus that reads like the whole fruit: bitter skin and sweet juice. It is sheer, not a statement. You will smell pleasant; people around you may not notice. The rub is not just longevity, which is average for a citrus, but the flat projection while it is there.

I like the scent, but with Bergamote 22 and Dior Homme Cologne on my shelf, it is redundant. I would love a cheaper replacement for B22, given it begs liberal resprays.

Context: Four sprays on a warm day (two wrists). Indoors in a warm room, likely less projection and a slightly longer tail. Sprayed on moisturized skin.",09/11/25 13:13,joelajackson
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,Divine lemon opening. More floral and unisex drydown but still beautiful scent. Longevity and projection are not notoriously bad as some people say but the truth is you have to overspray which is not a very big problem as you can get a big bottle relatively cheap. The only downside is that you can get some whiffs of synthetic cleaning product smell from time to time but it is not offensive. Other than that quality is great. My first aqua di Parma and given that is not the most popular i can’t wait to try more. 8/10 easy !,08/11/25 05:43,Ikg90
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Can AdP make a mediocre scent? I think not. So far Mandorlo di Sicilia is the least liked AdP I have smelled, and that is a pretty nice scent. Coming to this scent, bergamot is such a common note yet there's a lot different smelling notes. Anyway, BdC (Bergamotto di Calabria in this review, not Bleu de Chanel) is a scent I really liked. It is quite similar to Mancera Lemon Line, which too I like. The big difference is that Mancera lists lemon but no bergamot, yet smells suspiciously similar initially. The Mancera lasts longer, but the BdC smells nicer, more natual.

Now there's a host of products from insect repellents/bug sprays to floor disinfectants to room freshers that have a similar smelling perfume component so many might be put off by those less ""luxury"" oriented products having similar odor - but if you're willing to see, or smell, past that, this BdC is a beautiful scent.

Longevity is okayish being an EDT concentration scent. Projects well initially, but seems like a skin scent in 2 hrs or less, nothing unusual as that's the case with most EDTs/EDPs from the past 20 years or so.",07/27/25 09:32,Icyspicy
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Today, I'm diving into the final sample I possess from Acqua di Parma's Blu Mediterraneo collection: Bergamotto di Calabria. Based purely on its name, I'm anticipating that bergamot will be the undeniable star of this olfactory journey. While I certainly appreciate bergamot—it's a widely utilized note for very good reason—it's not typically a note I actively seek out in fragrances I ultimately acquire. However, with it poised as the focal point here, I'm hoping for a truly exceptional representation of the note. Will this offering surpass my experience with yesterday's Arancia di Capri? Let's get into it and find out.


Opening:
The opening is a luminous burst of radiant citrus, crisp spiciness, and invigorating freshness. The primary notes that immediately greet my senses are bergamot, citron, ginger, and musk. Bergamot and citron are the undeniable protagonists. The bergamot, as one might instinctively imagine, is the commanding presence in this initial accord. It delivers a citrus vibrancy, underscored by that hallmark aromatic spiciness one expects from a bergamot note, though perhaps not quite as pronounced as some other iterations I've encountered. Following closely is the citron, which amplifies the citrus with a distinctly brighter and zestier character, also carrying with it a subtle hint of rindiness. Next, ginger and musk join the composition. The ginger presents itself as a fresh and invigorating spicy accord, artfully counterbalancing the abundance of citrus-forward notes. Lastly, a whisper of musk lingers in the background, offering a fresh, almost fuzzy tonality, reminiscent of that clean ""fresh laundry"" essence musk can sometimes possess.


Dry Down:
The dry down continues the journey, evolving into a composition that is still predominantly citrusy, distinctly aromatic, and gently woody. The primary notes I discern are bergamot, citron, vetiver, and musk. Bergamot and citron remain the highlights in the dry down. The bergamot still commands attention, retaining its core citrusy accord, but it has become noticeably more aromatic and spicy than it was in the opening. The citron continues its supportive role to the bergamot, offering the same bright and zesty citrus quality, though it now feels rounder and smoother than in its initial presentation. This enduring citrus heart is then joined by vetiver and musk. The vetiver subtly emerges in the dry down, providing a delicate woodiness, beautifully accentuated by a hint of that ""fresh grass"" accord that vetiver notes sometimes carry. Lastly, the musk continues to provide a touch of clean freshness in the background, echoing its presence from the opening.


Performance:
The initial projection is moderate to strong, extending its aura approximately three to four feet. Sillage mirrors this, leaving a scent trail that is certainly noticeable but never overpowering. However, by the three-hour mark, the fragrance had largely receded to a mere whisper on the skin. There was a faint, almost ethereal projection and scent trail, but not enough to truly register.


When to Wear:
Bergamotto di Calabria, as its character suggests, is undeniably a spring and summer fragrance, ideally suited for daytime wear. It possesses an effortless, easy-going vibe, making it a perfect companion for casual outings, any activity enjoyed under the sun, or even a refreshing choice for the gym. Due to that casual nature, I wouldn't consider it appropriate for anything formal or for typical office wear, where a more refined presence might be desired.


Blind Buy:
If you are a devoted admirer of bergamot or simply appreciate bright and invigorating fresh fragrances in general, Bergamotto di Calabria would certainly be worth exploring. Just bear in mind that its fleeting nature means you'll likely need to reapply it if you wish to enjoy its charms throughout the day.


Final Verdict:
What can I truly say about Bergamotto di Calabria? It was, without a doubt, a fresh and vibrant fragrance, with an emphasis on its namesake note. As I've expressed before, bergamot isn't a note that consistently sends me into raptures, and I honestly don't feel that the bergamot in this particular fragrance did anything radically different or groundbreaking compared to other iterations I've encountered. It smells undeniably pleasant, yet it offers nothing particularly special or memorable. My significant disappointment, however, stems from the fact that this fragrance suffers from the exact same Achilles' heel that plagued Arancia di Capri: its performance is notably lackluster. By the time I truly settled in to appreciate the nuances of its dry down, it had already receded to a mere whisper on the skin, making it challenging to discern the individual notes. At least Arancia di Capri, despite its brevity, left me with a truly captivating opening. Needless to say, this is not a fragrance I will be considering for a full bottle purchase. Next on my agenda is the celebrated Colonia line from Acqua Di Parma. It's a collection that enjoys considerable recognition and discussion, and I am earnestly hoping it leaves a more impactful and lasting impression than my experiences with the Blu Mediterraneo line have.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I absolutely love the opening as it is an incredibly well done citrus/bergomot opening. If it could just stay that way it would be phenominal. As it starts drying down, those wonderful notes give way to a flowery bouquet and ginger and gets incredibly weaker fast. I don't know if my skin hates this or what but all but disappears within an hour or two.",04/28/25 22:56,Killsocket
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"One of the best smelling fragrances and best bergamot scent ever. There is always a trade off with natural smelling notes and performance. Being the best smelling scent in its category will have the obvious trade off of non-beast performance.

That said I believe most people go nose blind to fragrances early on, it doesnt last ""30 minutes"". I get 6 hours of a soft projecting heavenly scent.

Generally speaking natural notes have weak performance, it has to be enhanced by synthetics which will change the scent so its a compromising battle between the 2.

I own many ADP frags (more than any other house) and I do so for their scents (which I think is the best smell to cost ratio)",04/04/25 04:44,arsenal01

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"10 minutes of heavenly citrus experience which somehow I find to be zingy, fizzy, almost boozy tonic-like! Which is surprisingly pleasant... only to fade rather quick and turn to become more fresh-spicy, ginger-focused average cologne, that is somewhat uninspiring.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,This is my go-to summer scent! It's so fresh and bright thanks to the bergamot and citron. The ginger adds a subtle kick that makes it really interesting.,12/19/24 12:22,Riya2
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I have such an ambivalent feeling about this one it's even hard to explain. Lemon and bergamot are in my top 5 notes as I simply love citrus smell, with this one in the opening you get a Mike Tyson KO, jaw-breaking punch of both, it's beautiful.

It starts to dry down and that's where it disappoints a little, the citrus is barely there, flowers kick in with a hint of cedar and ginger. It goes from mascilune/unisex to unisex/female fragrance at this point.

My problem is, you put a bergamot in a name of the fragrance and you get a minute of it, I think the more fitting name would be 'Fiori di Calabresi'. The second thing I noticed, at one point between citrus punch turning into flowery base it smelled like lemon diswashing gel, I think this is why people say it smells 'generic' and 'chemical', it's just a brief moment but you notice it.

It's weak with intimate sillage, it's overpriced, I could get better ones for less value...



...but somehow, I still like it!",11/03/24 04:27,kaju23
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Nice, but underwhelming. I’m surprised at how simplistic this is, given the complexity of Fico di Almalfi. I was expecting the same sort of brilliance in blending.

Opening is a bright citrus with a touch of ginger; it reminds me of this lemongrass soap I have. Very pleasant, but as a personal fragrance, kind of “meh.” The citrus disappears quickly, and I’m left with a fresh, woody floral. Again, lovely, but nothing really unique to set it apart from similar fragrances. Eventually the fragrance dries down to a skin scent.

Performance is abysmal. Stays very close to the skin, and lasts no more than a couple of hours.

This is something I’d gladly wear if I received it as a gift, but definitely wouldn’t spend money on an FB myself.",10/05/24 00:12,Jadelynn
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Perfect vacay scent, love the smell and the ginger note is the star of the show imo (makes it “spritzy”). People are complaining about the longevity, but I couldn’t be boterhed less, the perfect blend between green fresh and sweet fresh and it reminds of the vacays on Sardinia (Italy). This is the best from the blue line imo because it’s actually a freshie and not to sweet like fico di Amalfi and the orange one (forgot the name).",09/17/24 03:22,gustavseng
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"the whole house does italian citrus style like no other. the bergamot here is so lovely.

i agree with the longevity however this is misunderstood as pointed out. stop calling things ''generic''. just a dumb lazy buzz word at this point. like what exactly is generic about it? its a citrus scent, we know. but after you go thru 100 fragrances you might just end up with 3 to 4 with a take on bergamot exactly like this. the note was always a top note. but you are able to enjoy that top note for longer than you usually would albeit it doesn't have any complexity or longevity. it does what it does in the name. try to look past that. fragrances like this have a place in the world. they're meant to give this feeling of refreshment that heavier compositions cannot offer you. even if it was slightly based out more. it wouldn't give you that ultra fresh feeling. these southern italian's know their climate.

it's for when the sun is trying to burn you alive. it cools you down. the heat will give a scent bubble that will come to life and soothe you like angels flapping their wings on you!

but no i 100% get it. it's not worth the money just for that. the blu line are perfect gym scents tho. because of the poor longevity and scent profile. it will make you stand out in that environment like nothing else. and it'll be so comfortable to wear for you and those around during your 1-2 hour work out. the right tool for the job!",09/02/24 11:07,fragrantlyenhanced

If you've smelled other scents in the Blu Mediterraneo line, it might feel familiar. There’s some cedarwood, vetiver, and musk for warmth, but it sticks to the usual citrus vibe.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"After having this on my wishlist for a VERY long time, I finally bought this but unfortunately am somewhat disappointed.
First off, I got a 30ml bottle and I hate it. Instead if having the proportions of the larger bottle, it is kindof tall and narrow and abit disappointing. Even the small samples in the discovery kit are the same kindof wider proportion so I don't get it. Anyway, not that important if the fragrance actually performed.
So the fragrance is really nice, I mostly get the bergamot and ginger notes on my skin. It is PERFECT for summer, so refreshing, I tested it out on a hot day in Sicily. However, the performance is where this falls short. It has near to zero projection, pretty much turns into a skin scent after 10 minutes, and I cannot smell it any more after pretty much 1 hour. How they charge such extortionate prices for such disappointing performance is beyond me. It's a pity as I really really REALLY think that if this has more sillage and better lasting power, it would be my go to summer scent. Worth the money? No, I don't think so.
I currently have Mirto di Panarea from the same collection as a tester and will be testing it out soon as apparently it has better staying power, will have to see, but for now I am surely done buying from this range. My next freshie to try shall be Pomelo Riviera from Atelier des Ors.

EDIT: I am trying this again on a hot day (I believe it's like 30degC) and I OVERSPRAYED a little. I am about 1 hour in and I still smell it on me and do not feel the need to reapply. If this can do at least 3 hours I will be much happier, I am ok with reapplying especially since citrus fragrances in general do not last.",05/24/24 03:43,martinaazz

This combination gives the fresheness and the zest with a slight sweetness required from happily starting your day for 20-30 minutes- i really hoped if it can stay more longer than this on clothes- then it becomes a skin scent due to Musk and disappering.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"We are in the midst of a heatwave here in Ireland, so I sprayed this at a department store on a hot day. There is a wide range in the Blu Mediterraneo collection, and I suspect that they are all freshies of some description. I picked this one up at random. Bergamotto di Calabria is a straightforward citrus cologne with a woody-spicy base. It is simple and traditional in structure, perfectly unisex and serves its purpose well - it is very refreshing. However, it is also very fleeting.

BMBdC opens with a radiant citrus accord, zesty and fresh. It is aptly named - bergamot is the dominant note, but there is a hint of lemon. I get a hint of spice, and a soft woodiness emerges as it fades. It develops and fades to nothing extremely quickly though - it is one of the most ephemeral scents I've come across. Sillage is intimate and longevity is very weak.

Pleasant but pretty generic, this is let down by its abysmal performance, and is overpriced for what it is despite not being too expensive. Just buy a big bottle of 4711 EDC instead and be done with it. 2/5.",09/07/23 12:58,Enrium

Fleeting, ephemeral, evanescent, fugitive, momentary, transient, transitory, passing so quickly as to make apprehending it difficult. Translation: The performance totally sucks. Seriously. It won't last long enough for you to tie your tie. I've long since learned reviewers on here really tend to overrate the fragrances. Everyone who gave this lemon water a higher rating than 2.00 would probably give five stars to a bottle of BODman. Are you kidding me? The performance here is ""Yachtman"" bad, but at least with those scents you're only out like $5.95. I have now tried every AdP ""Blu Mediterraneo"" scent and I'll save you time. ""Blu Mediterraneo Mandorlo Di Sicilia"" isn't a complete waste of money. But you can go on Gift Express, sort on price, buy any scent that's under $10, I guarantee the performance will be as good or better than this Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto. Adidas, Jaguar, Cuba Paris.

Can't detect florals or the cedar. Surprisingly, I get wafts of it during the day and in the gym, but it is as faint as it gets. Safe to overspray as it is so light and borderline undetectable, but in the end it settles for a nice lemon-candy-esque smell. I also get whiffs of lime every now and then.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I own, if not all, then almost all, the Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo line of fragrances and this one has become my favorite of the bunch. Reasonable projection (sillage) for a citrus, especially in the first 30-60 minutes––at least this seems to be the case for me in warm weather, as summer is the only season I've had the opportunity to wear it in so far. An invigorating citrus, though subtly, artfully tweaked by just the right balance of just the right selection of secondary, underlying scents (e.g., ginger, cedar, floral). To my mind, this arguably makes it something of a minor masterpiece. One way I enjoy it is applying it in the last couple hours of my late night work shift on top of almost anything I put on earlier that day, which, by that point, is pretty far into the drydown stage.

[Side note: When it comes to longevity, citrus scents are typically weak, and often very weak. It just comes with the territory. If you're buying a citrus fragrance––any citrus fragrance––don't do so for longevity. The easy solution, however, is just reapply every couple hours and enjoy that just-like-the-first-time application all over again.]",08/16/22 21:36,MidwesternGothic

You have to spray around 5 times though, and have an undamaged sense of smell to get to enjoy this lovely smell for a long while.

I have read quite a lot of reviews of perfumes I own myself where people complain that it's gone in an hour when my experience is quite different, which makes me wonder; could it be that some people are so used to strong and in-your-face synthetic scents (like for example Invictus, the smell of that literally makes me sick) that their noses get damaged to the point where they simply can't smell softer and - in my view - lovelier scents like this one.

I own and have smelled lots of citrus fragrances, and this is one of the best and most natural I've ever smelled.

The only way this makes sense is if you get a BIG bottle and you get it for cheap. I paid 50$ for 5 ounces. You will need an atomizer to carry in your pocket or purse.

I think of this like an Italian Sports car.
It's not practical, it's got no room for groceries, it gets terrible gas mileage, and it breaks all the time.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"My absolute favorite ADP. This one is all about the beautiful lemony, musky, powdery, soapy dry down that is so warm and clean. Although I wouldn't describe it as gourmand it does very much remind me of a creamy lemon sherbet. It’s the kind of smell that just feels soft and comfortable. Everyone complains about longevity but I find a few extra sprays gets the job done nicely. But yes, it's certainly not the best performance and I do wish it was stronger.",07/14/21 20:19,PapaTLooch
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I live in Atlanta, and this is perfect for the VERY humid and sticky summer here. It does EXACTLY what I want, and while many others criticize it, what they find to be vices, I consider to be virtues.

I have moved almost exclusively to niche fragrances, and to my nose, this doesn't smell like ANY of the designer fragrances out there. It has the best, most NATURAL citrus scent I have EVER smelled (and I am 60 yrs old). Here in Atlanta in the summertime, the morning may start out cool to warm, but by afternoon the weather has changed to humid and hot. When the air itself feels like an extra layer of clothing, I want zero scent, it's just not needed. So with this, I spray on my neck and back of my head, then when I get dressed I spray more on my shirt (upper chest, shoulders), and yes it does move to a skin scent within a few hours, which is what I wanted as the day gets warmer, and what remains on my shirt hangs around and informs the rest of the day. So while others don't like the way it performs, I love it. The smell is very fresh and light, perfect for humid days.

If you're hesitant, get a sample, but honestly, this is a really great citrus scent for morning, office or casual environments.",06/24/21 13:42,Gabriél_de_ATL

the opening as expected is citrusy bergamot with notes of woodiness and slightly herbaceous. If you like Aesop Tacit, you might like this for some days when you want something more breezy and easygoing. Wears well in hot climate, doesn't turn acidic on my skin. It's a no-brainer inoffensive fragrance, so I usually pack this for my business trips.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Squeezed bergamot

This is not just the oil from inside of a bergamot. It's the whole fruit plus it's leaves and even the tree itself. The sourness and bitterness from the green leaves and bergamot is obvious.
After an hour flowers, musk and cedar goes hand in hand to fill the place of bergamot and citron and make the perfume a bit sweet and deep.
Unfortunately (for me) it has a soapy cleanness which I think was not necessary and because of this feature I think there is an unnecessary pumped up sweetness to this fragrance which could be more toned down and it could lead to a more natural scented fragrance.

It's suitable for every and each occasion in summer and spring. It doesnt last long but it is enough and the sillage is normal and acceptable for such a fragrance.

A nice zing from the bergamot and citron with the ginger and woody notes peeking through. This is favorite type of citrus fragrance. However, like everyone else has stated, the last power is pretty abysmal. It lasts about an hour on me and that is with multiple sprays (six or seven). I was willing to pay $105 for the 50ml bottle but even that was a stretch since the fragrance is so short-lived. Well, the fragrance has apparently gone up $15 since I bought it two summers ago. No way in heck am I paying $120 for a fragrance that lasts one hour, no matter how awesome it smells. ADP needs to get their heads out of their rears.

The opening was so good that I decided to give it a second try. This time it was warmer outside. I got only slightly better performance - again less than an hour!

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Took this perfume with me on my holiday to the south of France as my only scent for 2 weeks.
Absolutely the most beautiful bergamot fragrance I've ever smelled. Such a shame that it doesn't last at all!

It does have some projection the first 15-30 minutes but after that, it gets really close to the skin.
You will have to overspray this before anyone else with notice you got anything on. Sprayed 10 times one day before a road trip and it didn't clog up the whole cabin. Actually had my family in the car and for any other fragrance they would have kicked me out for having to much on, but this time they didn't even say anything about it. And that should tell you more about the poor performance than the smell.

Won't be buying a new bottle after my 30ml runs out... and it will soon, as I need to use so goddamn many sprays every time, just for it to perform a little.

EDIT: Finished the bottle as we had some warm days here in the late spring. I can not stress enough how good I think the smell is. It also performs a little better when it's not super hot outside... But it still sits very close to the skin.",08/15/19 14:14,SebastianSmellsGreat

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Nice bergamot, realistic. As for the smell, this one is very unisex, round. Unfortunately I confirm it has poor performance, unacceptable for the price it retails. (a simple summer days eau de cologne shouldn't cost more than $50 for 100ml at online discounters)

For these reasons, I cannot recommend this one, and for a more masculine take on bergamot and a big step-up in terms of quality and performance, I would suggest to go for Zegna Italian Bergamot (the new EDP, not the discontinued EDT). Obviously, it's also a step up in terms of pricing, but with a bit of patience, it will show up in 1-2 years at discounters.

If you don't have patience, I would suggest to go for Zegna Acqua di Bergamotto or Guerlain AA Bergamote Calabria instead, which both do the same job (with similar poor performance) and both currently retails around $30-40 for a large bottle online.

For a more feminine take on Bergamot, I cannot recommend enough Atelier Cologne Bergamote Soleil.

In summary, AdP Bergamotto di Calabria: good, but overpriced compared to the competition given what it delivers. A pass for me.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Treat this like an eau de cologne and you may not be as disappointed as you otherwise would have been. It is bright, happy and juicy. Quality is there but you have to weigh the pros and cons.

Pro: As a lover of bergamot it hits the spot. It's the only citrus scent I crave more of and want to repurchase a bottle of, nothing else delivers on the promise of fresh, happy, bright citrus like this.

Con: The bottle goes very fast as a result of poor projection and longevity. I used up a full 75 ml bottle in under a year, which is unheard of seeing as most of its play was seen during summer. It needs to be sprayed at least 6 times per use to be worth while. Reapplication is necessary throughout the day.

Pro: Quality ingredients and natural scent, it is such a pleasure to wear. It's not piercing or synthetic like other citruses can be. It's light enough and perfect for high heat. Love the bottles too.

I adore this fragrance. I wish it stuck around longer, but I trust Acqua Di Parma know what they're doing. Compared to other brands who push edc's for roughly the same price, Acqua Di Parma is winning in my books. They're a classy brand who don't rely on bells and whistles to sell their products, they just make good perfume on the basis of quality and simplicity. I'm a big fan.",03/22/19 16:37,Swedelish

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"This is a citrus bomb on my skin with a hint of ginger but no other notes. It lasts in cold weather (50 degrees) at least 6 hours on my extremely dry skin and has a nice scent trail for several hours. I live in the Arizona desert so it is hot most of the year here. I’m unsure how this fragrance does above 90 degrees but I bought it in November when we were still in 90s and it lasted about 4 hours as strong skin scent. I love it! I plan to buy the lotion and shower gel to increase time it lasts. Not sure why other reviewers had bad luck with it.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria is a citrus aromatic. It projects with a stingy zesty citrus accord, between bergamot and citron. It's awakening, invigorating, and has a touch of candy-like sweetness to it. Not sure what the concentration here is, but the aroma dies down hard after the opening, and shortly after is very hard to pick up (unless presumably you have a virgin nose).

I think this one had so much more potential for greatness, but possibly Acqua di Parma is playing hard ball here, and doesn't wish to cater to the underlying problems of people. Instead, they might be taking a page out of Ralph Lauren's book, and are seeking to force people into finding a more effective solution for their problems (in the sense of some olfactory rejuvenation therapy). Although the formula here is a bit simple and linear, the fragrance is so good that it would probably be well worth the effort. That's just the classic style of Italian cologne.

You could always bathe in it I guess, but not sure how popular that's going to make you with all those sensitive noses out there amongst the crowd. I really enjoy this one for its style and flare, and would suggest just wearing it on the skin, so that you can freshen up regularly without it becoming overbearing to anyone.",12/10/18 00:28,ReapThaWhirlwind
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Citrus fizzle. Looks like it's unanimous then - I smelled this without reading any of the reviews here and had exactly the same experience.

Puts a smile on your face and makes you think of clear blue skies. Perfectly unisex, utterly charming. And this after I've had a string of failures with other AdPs which looked great on paper but turned too cheap / butch / aftershave-y to work on my female skin.

Drawback: lasts for an hour, at most. Aaaargh! Che fiasco! In a perfect universe maybe I'd buy a one-litre bucket of this and spritz myself with it hourly. In this one, AdP have scored an own goal making Bergamotto di Calabria, because it's persuaded me I really need a bergamot perfume for summer 2019 and I want to explore the note further, but I know for sure I won't be paying out for AdP's take on it.",11/01/18 16:40,trabuquera

Absurd, and I was so expensive. I am really pissed off for wasting my birthday money on this . If I was the perfumerer who creates this , I'd be embarrassed . Seriously, not even worth $20, as for what I paid for it is simply obscene . $156 Ripoff. I am never buying another Blue Mediterraneo Edt, Never.
That being said, the smell, when you can actually smell it, it's the most natural lime and bergamotte you could dream of. I have a bottle of essential bergamotte oil next to me, they are very similar. Except that the oil was one tenth of the price of the perfume. So I guess I'll need to mix this edt with some essential oil and hope it becomes strong .... what a pity. It could have been the perfect summer fragrance . And keep in mind that I usually prefer not so strong fragrances.
My recommendation ? Don't buy . I did and I regret it. Swap anyone ? 150 ml bottle, with box, booklet, everything .",05/27/17 06:35,Happyme2009

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamot üzerine konumlanmış bir parfümün Türkiye de işi zor. Bizler limon kolonyası ile büyümüş bir nesiliz.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"If only this (and many others from this house) worked on my skin, I'd be a very happy man.
I get very little from this beautiful fragrance. Very little at all. Spray, sniff - gone!

It's a recurring annoyance for me with the house of Acqua di Parma. Classy and wonderful as most of them that I've tried are, I am always left feeling somewhat disappointed.
I love the smells but the strength is wasted on me.

I have tried all the Blu Mediterraneo collection and (most of the) Colonia collection too and none of them last more than an hour on my skin giving me practically no projection / sillage. I mean, like nothing.

Sure, I get the amazing smells and adorable flavours they permit but they are nothing more than a skin scent on me. Maybe it's my DNA, although I have seen other similar comments.

It's for those reasons that I find them far too expensive and over-priced for what they offer you as a buyer. I've spent a small fortune buying some of these fragrances but sadly, I simply can't afford to justify making the same mistake again.

Yes, I know many people will strongly disagree with me and mention that we shouldn't expect all fragrances to be powerhouses, sending passers-by into an olfactory frenzy; but I definitely want something more to show for my money than what Acqua di Parma have offered me to date.

Yes the performance is certainly not the best, but this is one of those rare moments for me when the overall effect of the fragrance makes up for it's performance woes IMO.

It does remind me slightly of Sel de Vetiver but only briefly. It also reminds me of Dior Homme Cologne to some extent, but it is better to my nose than the Dior. It reminds me of many fragrances in part, however none capture the magic that this possesses for me.

This is what I might have imagined Grace Kelly to waft of in ""To Catch a Thief"", though I realize the movie was in Nice.

I realize there are a million versions of this type of fragrance, but this for me is very, very special. It is the best of summer in a bottle.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria has a pleasant citrusy opening that rapidly adds a spicy soapy component. The dry down, which develops quickly, is all about the ginger, bolstered by hints of cedar, musk, and benzoin. If you like ginger this fragrance might be for you, but be advised you're going to have to reapply it a lot: the longevity is very short. Very. I wanted to like BdC--I generally like all the notes that go into its formulation--but, at least on my skin, it really doesn't work.

Sitting on the beach, with a fruity drink in super hot weather is the picture this gives me. This definitely leans towards the masculine side.

The staying power is horrendous, which i am assuming is due to the bright opening which never really goes away. I'm not sure how anyone can justify paying the price of this fragrance for such lame longevity.

I will say if it lasted longer and has better performance, I would have to give in and buy it.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria is a very pleasant citron scent with some bergamot and lime which sits next to the skin. As the lemony notes mostly fade away after an hour or two, it becomes a very gentle woody musk. It's very delicate but it does last quite a long time, around 6 or 7 hours before it starts to vanish properly off the skin.

Bergamotto di Calabria is the nicest of the Blu Med range by far. It's flexible in that it works day or night and any time of year and for any occasion. I like the bottle and the packaging too. However, I do think it is overpriced. The Blu Med range feels more like a marketing gimmick by AdP to get the cash registers ringing. The revivification of the company in the last twenty years has led to lots of new lines but very little of genuine top class merit for the money. BdC is a genuine unisex perfume and you could use it straight out the shower, getting back from work, going to bed, just about anything you want that relies on subtlety and discretion. If you want to make an impression or just smell your perfume after an hour, then it's not the one.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria is a straightforward lemon and bergamot fragrance on me. The citrus is aromatic and gently sweetened. The presence of cedar renders the scent a powdery woody texture, while the ginger brings a subtle cool, crystalline feeling to the citrus.

The sillage is soft and the longevity is around 6 hours.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Amazing..!! The Acqua di Parma line is incredible and a “best kept secret” for fragrance perfumers…

I was reminded this morning of the clean and fresh feeling of wearing Acqua di Parma’s, Bergamotto di Calabria. This juice is good..!! Out of the bottle, you get the initial blast of bergamot notes followed by the dry-down into an extraordinary blend of citrus, ginger, green, and a whisper of vetiver notes. Somehow, I have managed to accumulate nine (9) of the Acqua Di Parma fragrances – each unique and amazing in their own identity, but all share a common citrus DNA. While Bergamotto di Calabria (BdC) is geared toward Spring and Summer wear, it does offer great flexibility during this timeframe – from casual outings to more formal events. I find that BdC lingers close to the body and unfortunately, last only about four (4) hours on me and clothing. But during that 4 hour window – whoa, this juice is good stuff.. Given the brevity and low sillage of the fragrance, I would suggest that BdC is “office safe” and will add that based on the note composition, BdC is totally unisex.

My final tally for Bergamotto di Calabria is 4.0 stars out of 5.0 stars. It is classy, refined, and will leave the wearer feeling clean and fresh. If this fragrance only had greater staying power, definitely a Top 5 fragrance. Based on my increased confidence level while wearing today, BdC comes with a solid recommendation to add to your collection and is a definite “love” in the fragrance community…

Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…",06/22/15 15:05,OCNBreeze7
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria embraces the semi-bitterness of the eponymous bergamot note, which stands out above all else and is mainly paired with a musk base.

I haven't tried many fragrances that rely solely on bergamot, not coupling it with another citrus or top note, but this is almost a refreshlingy bitter take on a citrus-heavy fragrance. Its opening only is slightly saltier and more acidic than its dry down. Longevity and projection are on par with most other ADP fragrances, good but not great.

Most reviews cite similarities to Dior Homme so I'd have to try that to compare, but as it stands, this is a pleasant warm weather day fragrance. Still debatable if it merits the Acqua di Parma price, cheaper designer options notwithstanding, but something that I imagine most men and some women could pull off in the summer especially. I probably wouldn't opt to buy this as I get a similar-enough experience from the cheap, grapefruit-based Elixir White by C.O. Bigelow, but some may find ADP BdC more compelling.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"A somewhat one note fragrance, this hesperidic offering from Acqua di Parma is definitely bright and cheerful. Intense citrus facets of bergamot are further amplified by citron, beautifully capturing both the sour and bitter notes found in the freshly peeled rind and pith of each. Unfortunately, this is all that one can appreciate, as the accompanying notes are so far relegated to the background as to be nonexistent. I am only able to note subtle nuances of ginger far into the dry down, which does pair nicely with the intense citrus. Rose and cedar are lost on me. Lastly, barely perceptible vetiver (here capturing its lemony and woody facets) is noted several minutes after applying. Like most other citrus based fragrances, its tenacity and sillage are weak. I prefer Creed's Neroli Sauvage over this. (147)",07/17/14 19:47,jhitt793

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I'm not sure if this is a summer scent or a balmy fall scent. Why not both, I suppose. It sort of lacks the cooling effect one would want during the summer to balm the skin and soul of oppressive heat, but it is still very fresh and invigorating. Monsieur Duchaufour has done a masterful job of creating a cypress accord that lasts quite a long time, throughout most of the life of the fragrance - a tricky feat for sure since cypress and pine notes have a tendency to disappear quite quickly. He accomplishes this by showing the different facets of cypress through each evolutionary step of the perfume. In the opening notes there is a beautiful mélange of herbs - notably rosemary, basil, and sage - combined with grapefruit that together delivers the very green herbal and also somewhat astringent and sulfuric qualities of cypress. After these dry down, which happens quite quickly, we're onto a more floral and spicy heart of jasmine and white florals, lavender, and coriander and cardamom, which together deliver the softer and drier side of cypress; the indolic jasmine and white florals give a smooth and fragrant feel, the lavender an aromatic and herbaceous lift, and the coriander and cardamom the spicy and resinous qualities. Just superb. By the time you are able to pick out what is going on in the heart, the base ingredients pick up their instruments and begin playing their notes of real cypress and pine oils, spicy cedar, and bright and earthy patchouli, oakmoss, and vetiver - the real deals in what would and should be a cypress/pine-forward perfume. High quality materials in the deft hands of a technical master is very nearly always a sure thing for a great perfume, and CdT is no exception. It gives this tremendous and evocative feeling that I've spent an entire day in a Tuscan cypress forest condensed to a matter of a few hours. The beautiful, cool, and dew-soaked morning when the sun first starts to evaporate the water from the cypress trees and the air, the wet herbs and earth taking their last big drink of the day, and the light begins coaxing the trees to life; the warm afternoon when the growing heat of the day encourages the cypress trees and wildflowers to begin releasing their oils; and finally the beginning of the evening, after the heat has been its most oppressive, the aromatics of the hot trees and the warmed earth have given all that they have to give and all start winding down to the cool evening preparing to do it all again tomorrow. Maybe I'm aggrandizing this perfume a bit; I've always had a big soft spot for green perfumes centering around cypress, pine or the like - so a beautifully executed perfume like CdT is going to be an easy win for me. I can live with my bias, and I can certainly live the rest of my days with this perfume.",06/06/25 10:09,Nathan86
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"The Acqua di Parma line is new to me, having only recently sampled some of the cologne and EDT/EDP offerings, and overall it does feel like the ingredients are natural and high quality. Cipresso di Toscana is probably my favorite in the AdP lineup (I've still to sample the entire range). I liked Mirto di Panarea as well, which was my top choice from this house until today when I sampled CdT. CdT to my nose, has a dark/smoky tinge probably from the pine or cypress (not sure which, some other pine scents don't have the same smokiness) that reminds me of Mon Vetiver by Essential Parfums.
Overall, the scent is a 9/10, but the longevity and projection do fall short, which being an EDC, might not surprise anyone but I do kind of expect better performance if the prices are more like EDTs and EDPs.",05/31/25 08:58,Icyspicy

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Described in one word: Crispy. I'm a big fan of fresh, summer ready fragrances that achieve light, invigorating profiles without relying heavily on the usual notes. Think citrus, colone, ambroxan, aquatic notes etc.

Cipresso di Toscana achieves freshness using tricks from the past, while managing to stay current enough. Freshness in the classical sense. Herbs, conifers, flowers, a freshness that is inspired by nature. I think this almost certainly features aromachemicals, but the overall feel and impression is a natural one. Seems like Acqua di Parma pulls this off pretty well across their line.

While it opens up with a piercing barbershop sharpness similar to Cerruti 1881, it quickly settles into a crispy green and invigorating heart that smooths out quickly. The cypress is there along with some other snappy green nuances, a little spice, and very blended floral lightness that exists without my nose picking up any obvious jasmine, lavender, or lily of the valley that's listed. If you despise flowers in your fragrance, the floral notes here shouldn't be a problem. I think they just provide a little lift and give an impression of ""fresh air through the trees"".

As it further dries down Cipresso reveals some of the slightly warmer base notes which maintain the natural theme. It does have a very slight hint of shaving cream, barbershop vibe in the base as well, but nothing like Azzaro PH or Drakkar. Also much sharper, and lighter in feeling than something like Z-14, which I like but reminds me of wood panel office parks in the 70s/80s. My gripe with some of older classic is they can feel muddy or dark brown in color, but Cipresso maintains a uplifting green presence. It doesn't scream 80's or Dad's aftershave to me, but then again I am a dad to-be in my 30s. So, take that with a grain of salt.

The base is very long lasting and warms up and darkens slightly, and sticks around as a closer to skin scent for a good 12 hours. The heart notes stick around too if you get some on fabric or your shirt collar. I think performance gripes here are a bit overstated, if you can make peace with the low to medium projecting scent. This is one of those weird ones that seems to wax and wane throughout the day, and almost gain strength as it sits on skin. I'll lose the scent sitting in place, but catch whiffs as I move through spaces or get active. I think any addition of fixatives would change this scent, and I'd much rather have this light and crisp profile than to have it end up a chemical mess on dry down.

In summary, I highly recommend this for fans of classic men's fragrances with a more natural and (slightly) updated feel. Cipresso is a bit more sober and serious. Yet the coniferous, gently spicy, and green notes give it a casual side that lends to evening and weekend wear as well. More versatile than some purely summer fragrances for these notes and the warmer/darker base notes that mix in. I'll be mixing this one into rotation throughout the year for when I want something mature and crisp, but not too conservative.

Did I mention it's crisp?",08/19/24 09:13,MaxMellows
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Discontinued for a good reason. This is a much ""lesser"" interpretation of the Italian cypress, compared to Tom Ford's Italian Cypress. The approach is similar yet the notes here are much less smoothly blended, a rough mix of pine needles and bitter herbs on a soapy base.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Cipresso di Parma by Acqua Di Parma was a fragrance I had to give a chance as I am a huge fan of the Blu Mediterraneo line and a discontinued fragrance from this collection piqued my interest. However, I feel like this fragrance while an odd one out from the line doesn't really smell as great as the others and I can understand why this fragrance was discontinued. This smells like walking through a forest and passing by different types of leaves and trees which some people may like but again I wouldn't prefer it to the others in the line. The lavender from this fragrance is what makes this fragrance stand out and is what makes this smell good overall but I feel as if the other notes feel artificial so it can be a 50/50 for some people when smelling it. You could also say that when you smell this fragrance it may smell like a grassy and empty field that reminds you of memories from visiting the park or garden from the instant combination of different greenery in this fragrance. Just like the other Blu Mediterraneo fragrance the price is pretty modest for a niche fragrance as I was able to get this for around $150 so it's a good intro to unique fragrances.

The longevity is a bit surprising as a summer EDT fragrance which usually doesn't last long however this fragrance lasts around 5 hours on my clothes and skin which is way more than what I expected from the start. The sillage is however very weak and I can only really smell this fragrance at a very close distance so nothing really surprising for its sillage. Overall this is an average fragrance with a hint of uniqueness with strong green notes and is a great introduction to new fragrance enthusiasts.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I recently discovered this lovely gem.

It reminds me of scents like Halston Z-14 and Ralph Lauren Polo (Green). To me, there's something very nostalgic about it. I guess, the men around me when I was a child, back in the early 80's, smelled similar. Thus, this is my perception of what a real man is supposed to smell like and I love it. I feel, I gravitate more and more towards these old school type of fragrances.

I don't understand the criticism about the longevity. I've worn it a couple of times now and it lasts, especially on clothes. I sprayed it around 19 hours ago now and I can still smell it prominently on my shirt. The other day I sprayed it on my arm and also got a good 8 hours of a nice whiff now and again.

Such a shame that it's discontinued. You can still find it, but it's going and soon it'll just be another memory of how men used to smell...",06/21/24 00:53,Tyler2004durden

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I remember when I first started collecting. I always liked cypress and pine as favorite notes. This was discontinued. Glad it's back!
It was a blind buy. I heard it had a lot of anise, which is often too sharp and bitter for my taste. I was glad at first impression, I got the anise, but it's perfectly blended with the citrus. It felt a bit peppery, like the Blenheim Bouquet structure of citrus, pepper, lavender, conifer.
A lot of cheepos have poor synthetic cypress. But the cypress and pine are quite good and recognizable. The cypress took some time to be really noticable, around the mid.
It's fresh and spicy in an Italian way perhaps.
Love the conifer base.
Will be best in Summer, but has good enough projection to be enjoyable in Winter.

Just a side note: Clive Christian Cypress, is the best quality, realistic cypress I have found.

PS: Just put it as my signature for Summer. It takes 15 minutes to settle to a harmonious fragrance of spicy, green, conifer fougere.
Fresh yet has warm spicy touches.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Cipresso di Toscana is an aromatic fougère, masculine and barbershop-like, but underwhelming. The green woody goodness I was expecting fades fast, leaving in its wake a generic, soapy aftershave.

CdT has a promising green opening, with a realistic pine accord and a strong lavender note - so far, so fougère. It is quite herbal here, and as it develops, a peppery undertone becomes evident, complementing the greenness and keeping things aromatic. Woody notes follow, a natural progression from the green opening.

However, this all happens very quickly, and after about half an hour, it fades to a musky, soapy, barely-there skin scent that isn't even that pleasant. Sillage is intimate and longevity is weak.

An aromatic, masculine-leaning freshie for hot weather, CdT shows promise initially but ultimately falls flat. Disappointing and definitely overpriced. 2/5.",09/08/23 11:17,Enrium

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I have tested Acqua di Parma Cipresso di Toscana for a second time on paper, yesterday.
At the same time I tested Chanel Paris-Edimbourg, another Cipress based fragrance.

Curious thing: If I smell first Cipresso di Toscana and then Paris- Edimbourg, I am not able to smell the Chanel. If I smell
Paris- Edimbourg first, I still can smell the Acqua di Parma, which is stronger to my nose.
I have been on the fence with Cipresso di Toscana simply because the ratings on Fragrantica are lower but on paper it does pretty well. It's stronger than the Chanel and I also enjoy the scent more.
Furhermore the price for the Chanel has been increased this year from 83€ to 98€ for 50 ML.

The opening is sharp, piney, and VERY aftershavey; the dry down is more mellow oakmoss. The barbershop comparisons are apt; although ""barbershop"" can mean different things to different people.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is a bit of a departure from most of the other ADP Blue offerings (almost all of which I have really enjoyed). I've worn it several times now and every time I spray it I have an initial blast of piney loveliness followed by a perfectly pleasant but very familiar lasting aromatic, sweet, woody smell which gives me strong flashbacks to teenage changing rooms in the '90s. To me this smells very similar indeed to a Lynx (or Axe for those outside the UK/Oz/NZ) body spray, it's been too long for me to put my finger on precisely which one, possibly Java? Tempest? Nevada? Mirage? Maybe Apollo? it's 100% one those old ones from the '90s. I searched to see if anyone else has made this connection but it seems to just be me so take all of this with a pinch of salt but I swear it's very similar.

This is not really a criticism, the smell is nice, especially after a few hours when it's settled down but the familiarity for me is so strong that it feels positively retro whenever I wear it and I worry that if I ran into an old school-friend they'd think I'd been hoarding discontinued Lynx products all these years.",07/11/22 07:05,MagicBez

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Cipress di Toscana has a very sharp and penetrating opening with a strong initial sillage. The opening gives you pine, cypress, petitgrain, a hint of lavender, a greenish tinge that feels close to sage, and something a little spicier as well as a hint of citrus that feels half way between orange and lemon and grapefruit. The petitgrain and pine combination can be a little headachy for me, but then petitgrain and I tend not to get on very well together. The licorice note (star anise) gradually comes through very gently but with increasing presence in the first hour. There's a sort of thin lemon incense feel in the first hour which I presume is the elemi in the background. In the opening hour Cipresso di Toscana feels like a much sharper, much more aggressive version of Tom Ford's Italian Cypress.

Two hours in and Cipresso di Toscana has settled down into a nicer blend, softer, more subtle, and with a correspondingly reduced sillage. There's not a massive development from this point onwards. By five and a half hours in the petitgrain headaches have gone and the scent is a little softer again but it feels more of an okay than a like to me. It's perfectly fine in that there's nothing wrong with it but it's just not good enough to dislodge the likes of similar perfumes (Tom Ford's Italian Cypress, Floris 1962, Acqua di Parma's Chinotto di Liguria) from my preferences among aromatic scents, especially those with leading themes of cypress or pine. By this stage it's just a skin scent but it really sticks to my shirt sleeves.

Six and half hours in the perfume has become a little sweeter. The lavender is more prominent and there's something else green and something a touch sweeter. The fading process is well underway but it really hangs in there - I get about twelve hours from it so if you want durability you certainly get it here by the bucket load!

I think Cipresso di Toscana is one of those perfumes that works at any time of the year but I'd favour it during the early autumn and spring with the cool morning air that warms up. Despite my disagreement with the petitgrain I can appreciate it's an elegant scent. But I think there are one or two which do the cypress - pine - aromatic better.",09/15/21 16:45,mutatismutandis

Its good, buuuuuut, it's not going to garner you any compliments in 2020, it smells like an older gents skin DNA, you know when a guy wears a cologne for decades and it just melds with his natural body scent (like my dad...lol may he rip). It gives off a light yet rich barbershop/soapy scent + a lil dry small florals in the mid notes.

I think you'd need to be in the right situation to wear this, im thinking while on vacation in Italy, driving a convertible from town to town with your sunglasses on and the wind blowing through your hair vibe. It's dated, yet, kindly beautiful. I'd recommend 'Sedley' from PDM as a superior frag in this genre.

Cipresso Di Toscana was one of the first I tried and it was not an immediate love. The first time I sprayed it on it was on a very hot day and the scent simply didn't stick well with my skin. The next time it was a totally different story. While I couldn't smell much of the citrus, the cypress was obvious from the get-go.

But after wearing it couple of times, I'm kinda disappointed. It's somehow very weak on my skin. I feel heavy liquid on the skin, the smell is there, but it's somehow subdued, faint.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Blind-bought a 30ml bottle after everything i've heard about it. It's a safe blind buy for men. It smells simple and green. Doesn't smell like a fragrance. Just green cypress plain and simple that doesn't develope at all. Is the type that you you don't need to like, but it's impossible to dislike it. Quite boring, but that's what i was after. Have a scent in Your Collection that is completely safe and just smells refreshing like the smell of a forrest breeze where you can smell the moss and leaves from the trees. That is exactly what this is. The refreshing, yet the dry, slightly powdery nature of the forrest.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I've had a bottle of the post-relaunch perfume for about 2 weeks now, and I'm very satisfied. It's still the same Cipresso di Toscana, and it's beautiful. Some friends of mine describe it as a barbershop fragrance, and there are certainly people who think it's nothing special; yes, it's an aromatic fougere and it smells like the 1980s. However, it's everything people wished they had back then. I think Bertrand Duchaufour took an old style and created something that would have been the envy of his colleagues back in 1985. When I smell Cool Water, it's dull, but Cipresso di Toscana is happiness. It has elements of the sea and the pines lining the coast. It's inspired by Italy, but it reminds me of the beaches of Virginia, where I'd go every summer as a boy. Pines grow on the barrier islands, so pine naturally goes with marine notes to create a seashore complex. This fragrance transports me back to that time in my life.",05/18/19 01:02,drkool_phd
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"They must have released this again. I have a cool little sample (1.2ml/0.04oz).

An intense and aromatic scent. Fresh notes of sage and rosemary embrace the lively scents of star anise and petit-grain, together with a balsamic cypress and pine base.",05/02/19 16:31,KooKills

A balance of every scent, Citrus-Flower-spice and woods.

What site is this on, as of 5/2019???

Straight masculine to my nose, not unisex. I remember where I first sprayed this scent on at Neiman Marcus back in the early 2000s, I then walk in Macys and Dillards an ask the sales women to sniff my arm. They look they had on there face was priceless. "" Whoa What is that, we definately dont sale that kind of fragrance here""???!! The perfumer Bertand D was in a category of his on with this one.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"To me, as a women, Cipresso di Toscana feels like an olfactory equivalent of boyfriend jeans (which are no favorite of mine, but that's not the point I want to make).
This is unisex and has notes that are typically used in male fragrances. But they're blended into something smooth, light and slightly sweet that would never feel like I've doused myself in my boyfriend's cologne. It feels soothing and natural. So, it's easy to wear even for women who don't usually like masculine scents, but I could imagine that it also smells very nice on men.

This has nice aromatic notes. A coniferous opening, lavender, fresh herbs and spices. Later in the drydown it's a bit woody. I'm kind of surprised there is not a single sweeter note listed, maybe it's just my skin, but on me the base definitely smells a bit vanillic and warm besides the refreshing and herbal notes.",06/01/18 15:40,SailorV

I like the green tone of it, feels natural to me and with a good balance of those green notes, which are of my liking.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I've tried the majority of the Blu Mediterraneo line by now, and so far there hasn't been a single one I didn't at least like. Cipresso di Toscana is no exception: it's great, very natural-smellig, more aromatic and herbal than woody, even a bit spicy as it dries down. Actually quite succesful in evoking a hot summer's day in a coniferous forest full of herbs!

There's only one problem, which isn't really a problem since it's been discontinued, more like a relief: it's not quite unisex enough for my taste. Of course there's no gender to smells, and I only really dislike uber-masculine fragrances with their macho in-your-face vibe, which this one definitely isn't guilty of: it's rather subtle, and very nice. But it is does lean more towards the clasically masculine, which means I think I'd appreciate this more on somebody else than on myself.",01/22/15 23:25,dsty

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I recall this being very weak, but I wanted to give it a fair shake again. Initially, I'm getting a lot of coniferous notes, but it's been sweetened and tamed by the addition of fruity notes that seem all too reminiscent of men's designer fruit fragrances. Even a bit of the old dreaded melon is here, and our old friend the Curve ass-leather note, all over synthetic woods. This is very disappointing, and to me seems very uncharacteristic of a respected niche line like AdP (not that any of their others have impressed me very much!). As the base approaches, I'm presented with the same cheap cherry/wood scent as the new version of Dunhill, which to me just feels like an easy cop-out. The sweetness isn't strong, but it's too full of fruits and honey, and ends up being no better than what you'd find in a run-of-the-mill designer scent. It has a bit of the ""moneyed"" vibe that their Colonia Intensa has, and that helps a bit, but overall I just don't find it to be worth the niche price or the niche brand. Geir does it better, and stronger. Looks like I better move on to their Fig one!",09/25/14 17:28,Redbeard
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Having sprayed it first, it really smells masculine, but in a beautiful fresh just-out-of shower way. I detect pine, citrus and rosemary, and yes, perhaps the very first impression is shaving foam.H However, after just a few minutes it transforms into a cloud that can be described as aromatic awesomeness of herbs and salty seawater with a bit of a barber vibe.

Although pine and cypress are still there, they form the canvas instead of dominating. I detect lavender and rosemary, sage, perhaps a little coriander, but no cardamom or flowers. CdT is on the juicy side, I wouldn't say its a dry pine scent. and it is very aromatic, warm and smooth, hides under your skin and blends with your natural skin scent.

When its settles further, i detect more cypress as well as vetiver and patchouli base, so it does tick all the boxes for me. At the same time I admit, CdT leans more masculine. Stays close to the skin, but staying power is good for summer EdT,4 h aromatic bliss.",08/07/14 10:12,katariina9

I consider it a very nice and natural smelling perfume. The longevity is so and so according to others but i'm not in a position to determine this now. Definitely, a perfume for summer first and all year round for those who do not like heavy artilery perfumes.
I cant see a woman wearing this as the odour of cypress is more or less, masculine...and this is it! it is a masculine perfume for men that reminds pino sylvestre somehow but CDT is much more quality fragrance.

It smells just like cypress trees, and if you really inhale deeply into your skin, you should be able to smell some soft florals and aromatics, but they are disguised so well that this easily passes as a unisex fragrance.

It evolves right away into a very clean and tonic summer/day fragrance with basil, musc and pine. I live in Tuscany where we have Cypress as our regional Tree and I can say TC evocates perfectly the countryside landscapes of my region. I agree with some other reviewers who says it gets a bit ""perfumery"" in the drydown, but nothing disturbing or changing the idea I have about TC.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"When in search of a Summer scent, the contents of these sea-blue bottles seem to be just what you've been looking for.

I almost wrote off Cipresso di Toscana based upon the opening, which to my nose was a typical citrusy lemon and grapefruit fragrance with not much depth. However once settled, this fragrance transformed into something in which its beauty is difficult to describe.

The scent is warm, somewhat herbaceous, sweet, soothing and woodsy. The citruses vanish in a matter of seconds when applied to the skin, making way for a beautiful blend of lavender, pine, jasmine, cypress and patchouli.

Cipresso di Toscana is distinctively unisex, there is enough versatility for this to wear well on both men and women. Some say that this fragrance reminds them of nature and the Mediterranean. I've personally never ventured there, however I do feel as if this fragrance transports me to a picturesque island covered in pine trees, exotic flora and surrounded by clear, sparkling blue seas.

I find this fragrance to be very complex, hence the reason why I enjoy it so much. The absence of harsh citrus and strong fruity accords, places this fragrance in a unique category for a Summer scent.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Sea water..the first sensation at very first sprinkle is of sea water! I love how Acuqa di Parma has such natural tendencies ( in the only 2 that I have tested). Another enjoyeable facet of this perfume is that the florals are just enough, never too forward or sweet, and there are so many individually distinguishable notes-and so many perfectly blended and meshed combinations of scents here. I do love unisex perfumes, this one leans towards masculine. I think it is the lavender, sage, petit grain, all combining together, and then, the added zing of pine and sometimes cypress, that makes it so manly. However, the cardamon here is not so strong, neither the patchouli. The sillage is medium to high, the lasting power is long and excellent. (The spicy notes last forever during the dry down).

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I like the opening (10-15 minutes). From the very beginning to the end finest ingredients, that are far from synthetics, are obvious. Big up to that.

And the end is not near! More than 12 hours of longevity on this one. Fortunately no Tonka bean. Just a hint of lavender in the middle phase, and sandalwood in the base. But again this is all about CARDAMOM. I am not a fan of it. And I wish the lavender and sandalwood is more upfront.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Very luxurious. Has a warm, creamy, barbershop, sandalwood opener that dries down with the creaminess dampening and the sandalwood becoming quite lush. The kind of perfume I imagine would be worn after a long day skiing, after sitting in the woody sauna and shower getting squeaky clean, and then putting this on, ready for some apres ski with scotch in hand, warm knitwear on for dinner or bathrobe on in the lodge, fire crackling, ready for action with your partner. If worn in warmer weather, I imagine would easily be quite cloying if not lightly sprayed.

The opener is like a warm version of Creed's Himalaya. The Creed is more reserved, controlled, and changes into more of an airy, fruity note with some sandalwood lingering.

The counterpoint comparison would be Armaf's Sillage (SMW knock-off), which starts on a peppery, ginger, chemical note with some woodiness and sandalwood characteristics, so is an edgier, lower quality sandalwood alternative.

Starts with the signature colonia citrus, I am very happy with this part. But it's only 1 minute or less.
The cardamom kicks in early and slightly strong to my like.
But as the lavender slowly comes to the surface its beautiful, my favourite part. I wish this opening would last longer. Still the cardamom won't weaken. And this citrusy, floral, spicey start reminds me of aftershaves with either menthol or mint in them (a grapefruit mint mix for me).
So, after this 20min show, there's a creamy sandalwood, nice. But the cardamom still disturbing me, and the whole thing just goes away too quick.

On clothes it's a completely different story:
The opening not obvious colonia citrus, not that bright. Perhaps it's already a mix with the lavender, that spice is there again, but not overhelming. This time it let the lavender win the show. Favourite part this is, everything going much slower, more bold. And the cardamom support the whole, nice. I am not only start tolerate cardamom, but I am in love how it's lift my beloved lavender.
The next twist after the summer night walk by the lavender field is that barbershop vibe. Yes here it is, but nothing of this sort on my skin, never happened. 😭 Someone mentioned PR PH the green bottle earlier, and I have to say: yes I am get that. But don't expect that strong similarity, just it makes some of us surely to remember one or two old school barbershop scents. But AdP style...
So much going on, what a game, and everything so smooth, well planned blend. Once, I think its going to turn to the creamy sandalwood scent on my jumper as well, but not yet. Little powdery at the moment, and the citruses almost fully disappeared. Like a nice full bodied red wine as you decant and once what it was harsh (citrus in this case) now turns into a fantastic creamy juice.
I am waited a good 40mins. I am expected the tonka going to tame the wood but the amber came along instead, and the cardamom toned back up a little again but not for long. At the end when you can't separate any of the notes, its a nice, light woody finish. (a very little like honey and tobacco/wood for me at the very end, must be the amber's trick)
A not too hot summer night for me, the wind brings some lavender from a little distance and I am watching the stars until I fall into a quality deep sleep.

I hope this grows on me once, because it is fantastic from start to finish.

Last/final sniff on my skin: Almost nothing, maybe faux leather, little reminds me of the green bottled jaguar.

The usual AdP longevity and silage, not much better -for me- than the colonia or blu M line.",01/19/21 12:48,cpower
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion. I own around 150 fragrances and this is my favorite, period. I've tried or own all of the 'brown bottle' line of Acqua di parma fragrances and, for me this is the best and most underrated of all. Oud is also a masterpiece and Ebano and Ambre are very good (leather is far too animalic and not to my taste) but this is the best.

The fragrance opens very citrus and aromatic, with bergamot, lemon and lavender dominating. This phase lasts about 20 mins.

The mid looses the citrus and focuses more on the lavendar, cardomom and the sandalwood coming through. The aromatics are quite spicy but very sophisticated. The Sandalwood gives the fragrance a woody back bone but does not smell like your typical 'creamy' sandalwood you get in Lebo Santal 33, Creed original Santal or even YSL La Nuit D'lomme EDP. I think the creaminess is hidden behind the lavender, but the overall impression is very sophisticated and alluring. This phase lasts for 3-4 hours

In the far dry down you are left with the lavender and sandalwood. I don't pick up any tonka really.

Performance from my bottles (I have 100ml bottle and a 180ml bottle, yes I like it that much) is excellent. Projects for around 2-3 hours with a lovely silliage before sitting close for a total of 6-8 hours (which is great for my skin which really sucks up fragrances). I think this is a more mature fragrance, I always get a lot of compliments from this one (I'm in my 30s). It's complex and sophisticated but still approachable and easy to wear. It's also very versatile and suitable for all seasons and occasions. I personally like to wear it for spring/summer/autumn 'dressed up' evening occasions.

If you want a sophisticated citrus/woody/aromatic fragrance with great performance and that will set you apart from everyone else wearing mainstream designers around you, this is an absolute gem.",01/13/21 06:34,nt277i
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Sandalo for me is all year around fragrance it opens with fresh side Bergamot, Lemon and Orange then start to get some Cardamon & Lavender the dry down id Sandalwood, Tonka bean, Amber

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"A very likeable masculine sandalwood and lavender. Soft, clean, pleasant.

This reminds me a lot of aftershaves that your grandfather might have worn. It has a classic appeal, while still being likable for most people.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Yes i think this is one of the better perfumes that hits the theme of Sandal. Its opens fresh and in that way it is really a Italian kind of perfume. The citric note is there and typical for Aqua di parma that Lavender note .
Petit grain and Sandal come in the end.
I still prefer Serge Lutens on Sandal but this one is second best.
It is a sophisticated perfume and nicely balanced.
The woody so typical for Sandal comes in the end.",01/08/20 08:04,osiris5
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Got this one for Christmas and I really like it!
I like to use it after my morning shave personally as, to my nose it has a sort of classy ""barbershop"" vibe with a refreshing opening.

Though not the same, it's reminiscent of YSL Rive Gauche pour Homme. Like an expensive men's grooming product scent. Clean, fresh, creamy, and smooth.

Feels like it could also be a versatile performer..in the workplace, for dinner out, summer or winter ect.

Has the citruses in the opening and then I get the lavender and sandalwood coming through, really well blended.Very nice indeed.",01/05/20 09:16,Ticktock
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is beautiful. The sandalwood is prominent here, though you can definitely detect a nice bergamot note on the opening, which gradually fades in about an hour. That's when the creaminess of the sandalwood comes out.
It's a very relaxing scent: brings my memory back to a time I was happy and stress-free. I personally like to wear this for myself rather than for compliments. This is what I'd normally call a ""zen fragrance"".
Overall, it's very reminiscent of Indian scents.
This can be easily worn in summer months, though I feel this is more of a fall scent.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,It’s a good blend. Nothing ground breaking or something you should go out and buy. It’s just spice and sandalwood.,05/26/19 18:08,clintjr82
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Tested it on paper: A nice take on sandalwood. Very vanillic and creamy, with a hint of spice, but kept on the masculine side.

That said it's not groundbreaking imo, and since it hasn't hit discounters yet, there are better scent around for the price it currently retails for (i.e. Dyptique Tam Dao EDP, which costs half the price online: a little more unisex than AdP Sandalo, but still, it's my favourite sandalwood as of today).

Will definitely reconsider it when it will be on sale at online discounters/ebay.

Spring/Fall days, 30+


Edit: tested it on skin.
On skin it is less round, much fresher and sharper. I have to be honest: I am not sure the cardamom/lavender/sandalwood trio works well here. Fact is that this fragrance is centered on cardamom, with strong lavender support - the sandalwood note only shows up in the base and doesn;t smell very natural (is it? or is there no sandalwood at all, but only creamy vanilla, sold as sandalwood? who knows).
It is so sharp, that in the drydown, it seems that there is a some ambergris, and results being similar to Guerlain Encens Mythique (an aldehydic ambergris centered fragrance) that I am testing simultaneously on the other arm. Projection is moderate (good in the opening).

At the point, I can say that Colonia Sandalo should have been marketed unisex. (I would even say that results in being the unisex version of Colonia Ambra, despite the listed notes are very different). The comparison with Aesop Marrakech Intense and Floris Santal are spot on, since both of these are cardamom-centric, not sandalwood-centric. No similarities whatsoever with the great LV Sandalo.
Will do the job for who looks for a modern barbershop fragrance, even if a bit boring and unoriginal to my nose, and the name 'Sandalo' is definitely misleading. A pass for me, and should I decide to get a clean/fresh sandalwood fragrance, I will go with Tam Dao EDP (that despite the cedar, is rounder than Colonia Sandalo). For great sandalwood notes though, I will go directly with LV Sandalo, MPG Santal Noble and Profvmvm Santalum.",04/17/19 16:45,Andy the Frenchy
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Sandalo is another solid entry from the darker bottle line, formerly known as Colonia Intensas. It follows in the tradition of Colonia Oud and Colonia Leather before it as being an interesting albeit not too divsive entry, a blend of the ""eau de cologne"" concept mastered via the now-antique original Colonia as well as a mix of various other notes.

In the case of Sandalo, the blend is overall a bit lighter and fresh than in Oud or Leather, just based on the nature of the signature of note. The fragrance consists of the predictable ensemble of citruses, paired with spunky additives like lavender, cardamom, and petitgrain, with a predictable base of sandalwood and amber (and allegedly tonka bean, though I don't get much of this, myself).

The fragrance is refreshing and invigorating without being too loud, and somehow comforting without being too boring. It's palpably versatile, wearable day or night, winter or summer.

It's a decent performer but probably not quite as good as Leather or Oud, but still satisfactory. Like the others, retail pricing ($260 for 100ml at Neiman Marcus) feels like a tough sell for a relatively safe offering, but it'll no doubt become cheaper on the secondary market (i.e. FragranceNet) with time.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma’s Sandalo is very nice indeed with deliciously smooth and almost ‘sweet’ sandalwood notes - reminiscent of Comme des Garçons ‘Concrete’ - given a fresh relève by the citrus accord then warmth by a touch of aromatics.

I sprayed a tester on the back of my hand and on the walk home all I could smell was this fragrance - excellent performance and even 9 hours later and several hand washes it smells as if I applied half an hour ago but just without the projection. After the 11 hour mark Sandalo begins to fade and after 12 hours I can smell a faint remnant but the real performance is probably a good 10 hours.

AdP’s Sandalo holds up well in bitter Winter weather but the aromatics would really sing in Springtime.

Well done, Acqua Di Parma... well done.",01/29/19 13:40,monkey500
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is very special. If I have two sprays in the morning, I'm able to smell it for the whole day, after I take a shower and on my sleeping T-shirt afterwards. The longevity is amazing. As to the silage, I think it is just the right one - the fragrance is creamy and very warm, manly and yet not aggressive. Sandalwood, lavender and bergamot is an extraordinary combination - simple, subtle and yet quite strong especially when the ingredients are of the highest quality. The price is indeed quite high but I prefer to give my money for this fragrance than for one of the terrible overpriced fragrances by Creed or Kilian.",01/28/19 06:12,danielbankov
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I’ve been testing this fragrance for the past week and was surprised because it’s not your normal sandalwood perfume. It’s intriguing, one of the most non-linear scents I’ve ever tried. The first three-minute blast is an alcohol bergamot/lemon explosion that took me back to my high school days when I’d liberally shake Old Spice Lime over my neck and shoulders after showering, making muscles and admiring my imagined animal magnetism in the mirror afterwards (yes, there was no Axe in my time). Then, Sandalo’s heart turns into a honeyed citrus essence (probably the citrus, lavender, and amber notes) with a powdery background (the sandalwood?). This slowly decays over about three hours into a cardamom/lavender that reminds me of Perfums de Marly’s Layton. Sillage is not enormous and turns into a skin scent that lasts 6-9 hours. This is a great scent for wandering about, for business, for informal social gatherings. It’s fresh and clean and won’t draw undue attention, while at the same time being bright and eye-opening, though it won’t replace the morning coffee. It’s a fall, winter, and spring scent easily, and probably summer capable.

I’m on the fence over buying this. I don’t have anything in my current collection that’s similar to the opening or the creamy heart. The dry-down, however, is redundant with Layton. I layered it with Serge Lutens’ Santal Majuscule to enhance the sandalwood and liked the dry down better that way. If I didn’t own Layton, it would be a no brainer—I like the overall non-linearity and progression of Sandalo better than the comparatively boring Layton.

Edit: After trying it many more times, I bought it.",01/26/19 11:16,IpodHappy
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is not a sandalwood dominant scent. It is a clean, spicy, soapy fragrance with sandalwood nuances. In fact so clean, it immediately reminded me of the original Paco Rabanne pour Homme (green bottle). An oakmossy barbershop opening, followed by a spicy oudy sandalwood. Finally it dries down to a chergui like type of scent. Performance could be better, but its ok.

Seriously this is awesome stuff! Smells very classic and very masculine but you are paying a premium for it. I’d feared, with a name like Sandalo that it would be a very slight, sandalwood but it’s more of a classic, I detect oak moss and patchouli, and a dirty lavender with a kind of eathiness reminding me of Tom Ford for men maybe or RL Safari, VC&A Tsar or classic eighties fragrances with sandalwood. It’s an aromatic Fougere type scent, citrus top notes, herbal and woody, the soft, clean woods left at the end are like a oud and sandalwood combo. I think it’s fantastic and another classic masculine idea in the same way Quercia from this line was too. I hope it’s not wildly expensive because I want it.",08/12/18 15:44,Houdini4

Much better than Oud. This Sandalo finally brings back meaning into perfumery, the lost art. This is special, and takes some time to delve the layers.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"When I first got it about four years ago, it was mostly just a dry, dusty myrhh with mediocre performance. Abandoned old wooden houses must have smelled like that, I thought.

It had a somewhat bright and promising resinous opening that quickly faded and turned dry and dusty within an hour; it stayed linear and soft, almost like a whisper that way throughout its remaining lifespan of about four hours.

It took a bit of imagination to perceive that lingering chalkiness as cocoa powder, but even that would be kind of a stretch.

Fast forward a few years to the present—it has likely undergone maceration and has become a rich, moderately sweet resinous amber fragrance with clear gourmet warm tones of vanilla and rich, dusty cocoa powder.

Its projection has improved to almost an arm length, while its longevity has stretched to about ten hours.

From a meh fragrance almost designated to becoming a layering fragrance for its base notes—evolved into nearly a powerhouse!

I guess I got lucky!",10/07/25 21:23,Digfigs
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Honestly love this stuff. ADParma very hit or miss for me. This, Essenza & Futura are great.

This is just smooth and a great cooler weather fragrance. I love Myrrh as a note and this is in my top 3 for sure, it's basic and a little linear but just right. For an ADC it lastly a decent while 4-7hrs, it's soft and has a nice bubble which I'd describe as fuzzy warm cookie dough(ish) ambery feel.
I'd imagine the sillage is very nice too.

I'm picking up another 180ml this week. I would love an EDP of this... a little deeper and bolder! Come on ADP!

Seriously on a cold morning few sprays behind the ears and BOOM! In my own Cosy bubble.

For me 10/10 for what it is. It's not an all rounder, somewhat versatile and nowhere near a beast. But! That's exactly why I love it. Simple, smooth, warm, gorgeous. Apparently discontinued, what a shame I will definitely get another bottle for a back up.",06/07/25 23:13,Crusader Smitty

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Mirra is a sophisticated and versatile fragrance from the Italian house’s Colonia line, blending the brand’s signature citrusy freshness with warm, resinous, and spicy notes. Launched as part of their Ingredient Collection, it centers around the rich, balsamic aroma of myrrh, elevated by complementary notes that create a smooth and calming experience.

Scent Profile:

Colonia Mirra opens with a subtle citrus burst, characteristic of Acqua di Parma’s Colonia DNA, likely featuring bergamot or orange blossom, which gives it a bright and approachable start. As it settles, the heart reveals a delicate spice accord with noticeable hints of nutmeg, adding a warm, slightly sweet, and earthy dimension. The star of the show, myrrh, anchors the base with its resinous, amber-like depth, creating a soothing and elegant finish. The fragrance strikes a balance between freshness and warmth, making it a refined take on an amber fragrance.

Performance:

Projection: Light to moderate. Colonia Mirra projects softly, creating an intimate scent bubble that feels personal rather than overpowering. It’s ideal for those who prefer understated elegance.

Longevity: Fairly good, lasting around 6-8 hours on the skin, which is impressive for an Acqua di Parma fragrance, given the brand’s lighter, eau de cologne-inspired roots. Reapplication may be needed for all-day wear in some cases.

Vibe and Versatility:

This fragrance exudes a calming, sophisticated aura, making it suitable for nearly any occasion—work, casual outings, or evening events. Its darker, resinous undertones, driven by myrrh, give it a slightly moody character that might feel heavy for hot summer days but shines in cooler seasons like spring, fall, or even mild winter days. It evokes a sense of timeless luxury, reminiscent of the discontinued Armani Privé Myrrhe Impériale, though Colonia Mirra leans lighter and fresher.

Comparison and Uniqueness:

Fans of amber-heavy fragrances will appreciate Colonia Mirra’s refined take on the genre. The nutmeg and citrus accents set it apart from denser amber scents, giving it a brighter, more wearable edge. Its similarity to Armani Privé Myrrhe Impériale suggests a luxurious, resinous warmth but with Acqua di Parma’s signature Italian finesse.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I wish they'd do an EDP for this one... ADP has been a hit or miss house for me. I appreciate there perfumes but some just ain't for me.

This, Essenza & Futura are my favorites...

Considering this is an EDC it lasts quite awhile... I would love a pumped up version of this. However, this is absolutely beautiful. When I first tried it i thought bleh, nothing special but it's not meant to be... this is just smooth warm cozy and that's exactly what it's made to be and it's excellent. This will not make your jaw drop but once you wear it a few times it becomes addictive.

Come on ADP do an EDP!!! Don't know if this is discontinued or what but I have a couple of back up bottles and it's available in New Zealand.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Bought as sample 5 years ago. I wondered at the time, if my sample was stale. I didn't find citric top notes, or pachouli base note. It opened with a smell like stale iris and lavender, with a powdery quality that stayed the same all day.
I'm giving it another try today. It hasn't improved or worsened in 5 years. After a few hours, it's stinging my eyes a bit, with a cloying, spicy sweetness.
I found it 'meh' at first, and kind of boring. Hours later, annoying.
I'm obviously no expert. I don't know what myrrh is meant to even smell like. I don't know if my chemistry is incompatible with this fragrance or, like I suggested, it's stale.",02/01/25 08:27,Jim_Smith
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just got this, my initial thoughts.

Myrrh is one of my favorite notes, so I've wanted to get my hands on this. They don't smell completely alike, but as someone who loves Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense, this reminds me of a much less sexy, more casual, less soapy version of the Prada. If the Prada is for date nights in sleek, upscale bars and restaurants when you want to inflect a certain understated air of elevated but nonchalant ""cool"", then Colonia Mirra is for the following easygoing day, waking up, heading out to get a late breakfast and then a walk in the park. Overall, the blend here doesn't feel as ""special"" or ""interesting"" as the Prada. This is a lot more straightforward, but I wouldn't go as far as using the word ""linear."" This still has enough depth so that it doesn't get boring.

So far, this is a strong like for me, but again I'm a sucker for myrrh and oriental fragrances, so this fits right into my wheelhouse. I can actually see myself using this much more than my discontinued bottles of Amber Pour Homme Intense to conserve those. Will edit with a full review later.

Edit: The amber in this leans towards that synthetic kind of amber accord one often finds in modern day male perfumery (you know the aura I'm talking about, usually accompanied by ambroxan, though, thankfully, there's no ambroxan in this), and overall slightly ""cheapens"" the overall feel of this. It's surprising as my experience with other Acqua di Parma fragrances has been noting how natural they smell. I'm not saying Colonia Mirra smells ""cheap"", but it's just not as ""elevated"" as I initially thought off the first couple of wears. I do still like this though! Downgrading my rating from an 8 to a 7.5

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This is a real head-turner! Colonia Mirra is warm, spicy and definitely masculine. The initial citrus burst fades quickly into this rich amber and myrrh scent that lasts all day. It's sophisticated and perfect for evening events.",12/17/24 14:33,Steve198
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just a superb fragrance that many have overlooked but, this is a magnificent blending of citrus and smooth amber, myrhh goodness. A semi dark Oriental with an Italian twist that combines freshness up top with a spicy, semi-sweet near gourmand drydown and a near perfect mix of amber & Patchouli in the mid to end to give it a nice, well rounded light woods & earthy mix. Close to Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense but, none of the soapy like accord that Prada is known for nor a pronounced woods that Prada has with the Sandalwood & Vetiver. Just an Italian take on a spicy oriental that creates a magic from fall to early spring. This feels slightly more casual and laid back compared to Prada's version yet, can be worn just as easily as the latter in a work or professional setting. I just prefer Prada for that particular environment or scenario. But, for friends & family gatherings or that date night occasion in cooler to cold weather, this is simply stellar. Performance is quite good as well as I get 6-8 hours of duration with half a dozen sprays. For me I rank the brown bottled colonia line in this order; Colonia Oud Intensa, Colonia Sandalo Concentree and then this gem right here Mirra but, they are all super close for me. No losers in this bunch at all.

An underrated creation that exudes quality from the first spray and on. There are still some tester bottles and 180ml. bottles available for excellent prices. If spice & everything nice is your calling, this is your gateway to that occasion.",12/03/24 07:51,Apocalypse6vs8
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"The leaves are falling, autumn is here, it's time to break out this fantastic warm amber-spicy fragrance. For me, I find four sprays is enough, where I typically do six, and I find it lasts. I was fortunate in that someone gave me a full-size tester bottle of this... it's great to have friends with connections like that!",10/28/24 07:30,LandNoise
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful scent of myrrh and amber, fresh with its light touch of patchouli and citrus. It has a slight subtle sweetness, I am not sure if it comes from the orange flower notes. This is really gorgeous and probably unisex. I think I need a bottle of this. Wonderful scent! this is an underrated gem! don't go buying expensive Tom Ford Myrrh scents without sampling this first!",07/05/24 07:29,aspirina
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Smells like a less intense and more rounded version amouage crimson rocks. A warm spicy, powdery, amber frangrance. Quite resinous in the dry down. Insane sillage and longevity. Could be cousins with Tom Ford Noir.",06/09/24 06:21,Tunzz
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"A great day wearing Mirra. The trick is to apply with weight, confidence, and persistence. Then do it again.

Within 30 mins, the perfume has relaxed and settled into a lovely warm woody, resinous, soft patchouli fog that projects enough so that you can pick it up easily, wallow in it even. And yet it doesn’t overpower those around. Lasts all day and is enjoyable even after 12 hours. One of my favourite Aqua di Parma perfumes.",03/12/24 11:59,jwc001
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Lightly powdery and nutty amber dominant scent accented with fresh citrus. Very clean, but warm and cozy and perfect for the cold weather.
Not a big projector, have to lean to get a nice whiff, but does last for hours on skin and more on clothes.",01/04/24 10:38,Ferra_Verto
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Top notes are a bit hard to decipher, but there is at least some floral and citric notes. They are very pleasant, but not very distinct and they evaporate in less than 30 minutes, transforming into saponin notes.
In the mid, nutmeg is prominent but the myrrh and other, warmer spices fills out the picture.
Base is solid, and nice with amber and discreet woodiness.

The AdP signature of citrus and soap is quite obvious although the profile has more to do with Eau Sauvage EDP – citric with a spicy and resinous base – than with the classic colonias. There is, however, not sufficient citrus notes to say that this is a ""hespéridé"" – leaning on citrus essential oils – and the top notes are not an important part of the overall experience in general. There is more spice and resinous notes and less soapiness compared to other colonia bottles from this house.

All in all I think that if this was a stronger concentration, I would consider replacing my Eau Sauvage EDP (2017) with Colonia Mirra. Autumn-winter-early spring office scent, but does not have sufficient performance to defend the price. Although I like discretion, even the skin scent phase is too weak after 3 hours on me. Edit: Funny how the opening reminds me of the way Fahrenheit smells on you past lunchtime, but this really lasts only 15 minutes.",12/01/23 23:48,Opato

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,This is a wonderful fragrance. Lots of spice with very dark smoothness about it. It's not the run of the mill fragrance .,06/15/23 13:00,Tonymast1984
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"My first review on here, LONG time lurker..
Looking at some of the reviews below makes me question my own findings., but I found Mirra to be massively disappointing. It opens well, fresh whilst intoxicatingly reassuring and classic ADP, and the initial drydown is lovely. For the price I paid for it £65 - I thought I was on a complete win.
However - 20/30 minutes later and it's a skin scent on me. An hour or two and it's all but gone. So disappointing that I boxed it straight back up for a exchange, thinking that something had to be amiss. The second bottle was identical, so that went back too. Now I have ADP Oud, Leather and Ebano - all of which have good to great performance, so I'm not sure whether it is just my skin? The readily available, relative 'bargain bin' pricing does suggest that I may not be the only one being less than impressed though..",01/27/23 07:22,Vape

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just looked at my bottle and only have about 10ml left. This is a gem, definitely one of my favorite Myyrh fragrances.

I will be getting another bottle this year, possibly another for a back up.

9/10 loses a point because it's not a year round nor most versatile fragrance.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Masculine, solid, linear (not a criticism - an observation of this range of single note emphasis colognes). Straightforward, brown/amber (if you find scents resemble colours, as I do). Easily wearable I can daytime/work situations, as evening ones.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Since i made my first review I want to add one.
I love this one in the first place.
The more i use this fragrance I feel it is a one you can put into the realm of the ones who relate to the Arabian notes used in Oud and those very expensive ones you can find here.
The notes, as I said previous, are very distinct in their consistence and combination.

Wow this is so good and powerful and yet it is balanced and so sophisticated.
It does remind me indeed of the spice shop or market in India or the middle East but it has also that mystical smell typical for mire.
It has a long-lasting power for eau de cologne and makes you feel dressed-up for a nice diner or just for a good evening party on a sunny day outside.
What ever occasion, this is gorgeous and well balanced to wear.",08/21/22 01:17,osiris5
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Gorgeous fragrance from Acqua Di Parma!

I love this! Only just purchased a few days ago and it’s stunning! This seems to be a rather underrated not so well known fragrance from Acqua di Parma which surprises me!

Like a walk through a pine forest on a sunny winters day!

Versatile and office safe.",02/15/22 12:45,scottgiles86
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I learned to love Myrrh from Dior Eau Sauvage Parfum 2012 and Jo Malone Myrrh Tonka, but I'm just ok with this one. I'm not sure what to make of this one. Dark, warm, cozy, dry myrrh and other dark notes I can't pick out. It's nice enough but nothing pops out and grabs me.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I'm a big fan of Acqua di Parma line up and Colonia Mirra is no exception to this. This Eau de Cologne Concentrée, despite lacking a bit in longevity, really pays off with a luscious, deep and layered olfactory experience. It echoes the seriousness of the original Acqua di Parma but with a completely different set of notes, though it plays in the same arena in terms of elegance.

The opening is quite dark, bittersweet (almost medicinal) and reminds me of dark cocoa powder; there are sweeter orange blossom nuances that bright it up enough to avoid it feeling stuffy and gothic. As the initial citrus sparkles fade, it becomes drier and almost powdery in a very pleasant way, like if you were smelling in a wooden cupboard where resins and nutmeg have been left for months. Myrrh provides the luscious bittersweet background that becomes more prominent 30 mins in, while nutmeg is more prominent at the beginning and adds a note of spiciness.

As soon as the base notes hit your nose, the warm ambery base makes the bittersweet smell of myrrh more akin to burnt brown sugar - this is no gourmand at all, but just really gives the idea of sugar taken off the stove right before it burns. At points it gives me the idea of being sucked into a black hole and, as much as it sounds like a negative comment, it is not in reality as it removes your focus from anything else surrounding it.

Colonia Mirra has such a dark, mysterious and alluring scent profile I can't stop smelling my wrist. This is a dressed up fragrance, good for your own enjoyment and amazing when you need to smell refined and opulent. Due to its low contration, longevity is not amazing - 3 to 4 hours, give it or take it, and that is expected; it effuses convincingly but not aggressively for the first hour before becoming a sking scent. Great for fall and winter, both day and night, rainy days and formal situation. Classic Acqua di Parma bottle (batch code 0260337), in dark brown glass similar to those of the discontinued Ingredients collection; a number of fragrances in the line have been moved under the Signatures of Sun line and became EdP concentration, but alas not Colonia Mirra although this one is still widely available at discounters.",12/08/21 12:56,skaccomatto
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I am a young woman, however I thoroughly enjoy wearing this fragrance all year and weather long. I see as a very complex, but easily wearable fragrance. For me it is a very cozy smell, therefore I tend to wear it on cooler days, however I see how it could be pulled of in a nice summery, flowy dress, sipping double espresso on ice.
The fragrance opens up to this strong medicinal smell, I get just a little bit citruses, more like sweeter orange peel/ blossom citruses (probably the orange blossom). However the myrhh, amber and patchouli is amazing. After 15 minutes on my skin, it starts to sweeten and then I get just a bit of that nutmeg. But it is not sweet as in candy sweet, it is a natural sweetness. It is somehow fresh, but warm and spicy at the same time. After a hour it becomes fresh for me. It is so mysterious, but familiar at the same time. I love it when my boyfriend wears it, I love it to wear it myself.
When it dries, it becomes quite sweet and aromatic, reminds me of dialed down Black Phantom By Kilian.
I got a 180ml bottle of this fragrance at TKMaxx for a fraction of the original price. I believe I paid 68 euros. I don't think I would pay the original price for this fragrance. It is not my favorite fragrance, but I appreciate it.",09/19/21 05:59,Todobien

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Quite medicinal in the early spray. But changing to more pleasant after a while when it starts to polarize gradually. I think this is more masculine than unisex. Smells classy but performance is moderate. The myrrh is dominant here, and of the same nuance with JM Myrrh and Tonka. Expensive but worth the biggest size resides on my shelf.",07/24/21 07:01,klix27
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Wow. Just wow.... I'm in love with it, it's definitely got that brite, fresh citrus opening that after a half hour or longer absolutely settles down into this yummy, warm, creamy, delicious, nutmeg/myrrh/amber thing that gives it a sweet, brown sugary, gourmand vibe... of course the star is that creamy, smooth, warm, nutmeg/amber/myrrh combo. My god.. A woman with whom I had a romantic date with a few weekends ago was stuck to me like a magnet, afterwards later texting me about how delicious I smelled to her. I have Colonia Mirra to thank for such a nice compliment from her.... Now the downsides... It is only a cologne concentrate, which is so disappointing. This NEEDS to be an EDP or at least an EDT... But other than so-so performance and so-so longevity, this stuff is soooo beautiful and delicious. I absolutely LOVE citrus/amber/myrrh/olibanum fragrances.

It's not to say the others were bad, they were nice but not bottle worthy for me. Mirra is back up bottle worthy for me, I just wish it lasted abit longer. This smells rich, deep and opulent. Reminds me of the Myyrh in Zaharoff.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This starts off as a Pow to the senses then calms down to this nice mixture of amber ( and myrrh ) with other elements of the fall time ( although I wore this in the winter, it still fits perfectly )

I don't personally know or have smelled what Myrrh is but, whatever it is, this fragrance works and works well.

It's nothing explosively amazing to me, but just beautifully done and enjoyable.

A woman could likely pull this off but... it's not so obvious either way to be just for men or women to me.

The box I received was in a plastic case but not sealed/stickered.
I like the fragrance itself but would be annoyed if I had paid full price for it!",01/03/21 18:51,jman316
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This is going to be complicated and I may even contradict myself on a couple of points.

I got this just after Christmas from a UK retailer who I think had made a mistake in pricing on their Euro site, it was a fraction of what they were charging in GBP and for what I paid it’s a fantastic bargain.

Putting the above aside I’ve got to say I like it but I don’t love it. I have Colonia at present, I’ve had a few other ADP fragrances in the past and have always been wowed by them, this doesn’t quite hit the spot.

The initial hit I get is of high cocoa content dark Swiss Chocolate, which immediately calms down into mirhh and amber. It’s got that ADP mark of quality all over it, but at the same time there’s just something missing to take it to another level where I couldn’t live without it.

I don’t get the longevity or projection I was expecting either. It arrived a few day’s ago and I sprayed it before bed on two nights and there was no hint of it in the morning, today has been the first time I’ve worn it during the day and after 6 hours I’m having to really search for any hint of it.

I think I paid around 1/4 of RRP so I can’t complain at that price but I would have been disappointed if I hadn’t got it heavily discounted.

It’s obviously quality and it’s nice but it doesn’t really stand out as anything special.",01/02/21 09:10,Nick68

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"At first wearing I quite liked this fragrance. A brighter, bit more light myrrh than usual, while still carrying the same dryness it's known for.
Something kept bugging me though and I never felt I really liked the scent. After smelling it a while I think I've realized what it is: a scratchy and strong synthetic woody amber, perhaps the old pal Amber Xtreme popping up again. This causes the fragrance to have a scent reminiscent of a more generic cheap masculine and, as my girlfriend describes it, causes it to ""go up the nose"" really much and hurts a little if you smell it too close. I would guess this is a way to boost the sillage of the scent, which unfortunately completely ruined it too.

It was launched in 2017 but is already discontinued as of 2020, so maybe other people agreed with me. If you like myrrh, there are just so many other scents around that I would recommend over this.",11/24/20 14:55,Borzoi

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,i don't know what it is but this scent like many of the other Acqua di Parma scents smells cheap. Just everything about this radiates synthetics. I've tried a dozen or so of their scents after liking one of their Blu Meditteraneo scents and reading all of these positive reviews. I love resins and myrrh but this just doesn't sit right with me. It smells unbalanced with a largely vacant top note register.,08/31/20 07:59,patrick.herron
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"The top notes last relatively little, only a few minutes. Immediately appears the main note of MIR, and from now on the myrrh is the main player who will feel throughout the period of wearing.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Tested it on skin: a little disappointed after the high hopes that the paper test gave me.

I thought I had found the Holy Graal of Myrrh, but no.
Don't misunderstand me: it's a good round myrrh centred frag, but my previous impression in regard to the lack of AdP's signature citrusy opening and the drydown, that reveals to be even more vanillic than it appeared on paper, makes it lean very feminine imo. Projection is moderate at best, and the fragrance is short lived on my skin (disappeared after just 3 hours).

I think it may be interesting on a woman, but quite boring on a man. That said, today I also tested Guerlain Bois Mysterieux: THIS is the holy grail of masculine myrrh. Given the price tag similarity between the 2 frags, it's a no-brainer for me for my myrrh frag quest: AdP is out, Guerlain for the win!

Edit: Guerlain Bois Mysterieux is a masterpiece imo, but should you look for a frag totally myrrh-centered, I can't recommend enough Goutal Ambre Fetiche and Armani Myrrhe Imperiale. Really, imperial!",04/17/19 16:57,Andy the Frenchy
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I beautiful take on myrrh. It's indeed pretty warm and round, and the typical AdP citric opening is a little less fresh than other frags of the same line. Myrrh is noticeable in the heart. Then it morphs to an ambery (resin/vanilla) drydown - for sure a little less interesting than its big brother, AdP Note di Colonia III. Colonia Mirra is overall sweeter and a little less refined than the latter, but also 2 to 3 times cheaper.

A win from AdP, but try on skin before you buy!

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma is such a classy brand.

From the moment you open the box you can feel the quality and the luxury. Colonia mirra delivers exactly what its name says. From the very start you are greeted with an ambery, sweet but steady myrrh note. This is for the elegant, dark haired gentleman over 30. Longevity is good but not excellent. If you genuinely like myrrh, give it a try. However, my myrrh obsession is already fulfilled by the 2012 version of Eau sauvage Parfum which has a bit more brightness IMO and better performance.",06/23/18 12:03,Leopold
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Spiritual, meditative, sensual, deep, elegant, masculine.

Perfectly matches its name as it's VERY resinous, which I find lovely.

However, the more it drys down the sweeter it gets and becomes a bit cloying. It's also not very easy to wear so although I fell in love with the scent at the beginning I won't be buying a bottle, I can't spend so much on something that's not 100% satisfactory.",06/22/18 04:57,torom
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma, my new favorite brand and a true master of blends.
All their perfumes are made of high quality ingredients and this one is no exception.

This perfume says: I enjoy being a man!

This creature is extraordinary, utterly admirable. Everything about this perfume is as it should be. Everything is in its place. Everything is balanced.
The notes come in, play their role in the light of a resinous myrrh and amber accord and slowly fade away with a goodbye kiss on your senses.

The opening is a little bit powerful, but just enough to grab your attention. Then the myrrh comes in and the beautiful, sweet, and boozy amber starts to play in the background. This is the main theme of the perfume and it will be like this until you can't smell the perfume anymore.
I've applied it 12 hours ago and I can still smell it on my arm. I actually sniffed my arm more than 100 times today.

Myrrh and amber are two of my beloved notes in perfumes and they always will be. So I have to say, this is one of the top 5 perfumes I've ever smelled in my life, maybe even the best.

Overall, a sweet lovely perfume, made of high quality ingredients, suitable for colder months with a not-so-casual vibe.

Thank you for making this gem!

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Mirra is the third one I have tried from the ADP Ingredient line after Oud and Leather and like those two, I love this one as well. This is a beautiful, powdery spice n Myrhh fragrance.

Top notes are a fleeting dash of citrus and the sharp spicy note of the nutmeg. This spicy nutmeg is joined by a very beautiful myrhh note. This heart phase is just lovely and then turns powdery when the patchouli comes into focus. The dry down is a blend of the myrhh, and powdery patchouli with hints of amber notes. All in all, very clean smelling for want of a better word. longevity is pretty decent, around the 6-7 hour range on me although projection dies down after the first hour into what I would call the ""hugging"" range. I get whiffs of it all through it's scent life so it does last.

In conclusion, I would say if you are a fan of the Myrhh note or of powdery frags in general, this is a good entry with the usual fantastic ADP quality in ingredients and blend. I would say this is Masculine mostly although a woman could easily pull this off too if she does not mind the spice.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"After investigation, the originality of this frag is probably due to a component which is not stated in the parfume pyramid above, myrrh oil, which gives rise to some confusion or questions in the reviews here (honey? creamy? amber? ...).
Myrrh is present here in two forms: myrrh resin (a middle note) and myrrh oil (a base note along with a discrete patchouli).
It's this oily base note which is really dominant and long lasting in this frag.
I should have read the small booklet which is included in the 150 ml box I bought ! It tells it all: no amber as erroneously stated in the pyramid above, just myrrh oil.",08/02/17 09:01,orpailleur
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Applause, what a well balanced and interesting perfume.
I didn't expect otherwise by this house of course.
How to describe this perfume is not easy. It is a compilation of different notes that are not natural easy partners to combine. This perfume is distinctive and also adepts to everyone who wears it.
The opening is a typical Italian based perfume with the the fusion of citric notes. But they are not overwhelming.
The aromatic raisins and nutmeg keep it in balance.
Happily the patchouli is of a good quality so it stays in the background, but gives also balance by its light sweet freshness to the strong fusion of the balsamic amber and spicy nutmeg notes.
This is really a nice perfume for a man who is distinctive but also modest.
When to wear? I guess its a four season perfume:)
Every note reacts different according the season you wear it.
This is a really modern perfume for one who likes class and style in a modest way. It represents in some way the Italian way of life like the Blue mediterraneo series really do.",07/22/17 05:57,osiris5

Mhyrr is a quite complicated scent and ADP is right to give it a try IMHO.
I agree that something is lacking in the parfume pyramid ... could be honey, or also a special tuberose-evocative amber I smell only on some of the parts of my skin after an hour.
I'll try to investigate !
A great frag nevertheless.",05/25/17 03:32,orpailleur
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma masters the blending of aromatic scents, and here they've done it again! In Mirra we have the fragrant and sweet myrrh mixed with aromatic nutmeg and neroli on a pleasant amber base. The myrrh notes came out relatively quickly after the initial citrus blast, and gradually became sweeter over the course of the dry down. Just like any other ADP scents all notes are harmoniously blended. No harsh edges.

The performance is at least 7 hours, however the projection can be a bit shy on cooler days.

I like it a lot, and would say this is a good summer myrrh perfume, which is not that easy to come by!",04/22/17 13:28,pepperoniann
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"A very noticeable bay leaf note is what characterises this leather perfume. And the official list of notes does not even mention it.
It's complex, smokey, mature, elegant, but unique as well. Most people will not be smelling of smoked spices with leather, and this will definitely invite curiosity with its unusual and mysterious projection.
Though it is prominent, it is not aggressive. This is because of its mature, base note heavy presence.
I love it, and find it to be best for cool/cold evenings.
Nothing skanky but not citrusy either.
Smokey, spicy, and a touch of sweetness....",10/31/25 10:37,Katusatya

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is born like stories woven from the threads of time: the first breaths from a luxurious Italian leather bag, exuding the scent of the ancient craftsman pouring his soul into every thread and stitch.
It is not just a leather scent, but a sensual poem that begins with light and completes in shadow.
From the first spray, the Mediterranean Sea breeze rushes through a wave of Sicilian lemon and Brazilian orange, illuminated by red raspberry as a playful smile at the start of the journey.
The freshness here is not superficial; it is a quick light that gleams before the colors shift toward a warmer and more mysterious depth.
At the heart, a hidden garden blooms: soft rose, wavering honeysuckle, and green bitter orange shining like morning dew, while the sound of red thyme rises like oriental spices whispering warmth.
Here, leather appears for the first time, neither harsh nor loud, but warm and soft like the page of an old notebook wrapped in a leather strap, blended with flowers and herbs in a harmony that amazes.
As for the base, it is the climax of the story: a rich, luxurious note, deep and evocative, blended with smoky guaiacwood and the steadfast Atlas cedar.
It's as if you are wearing a new leather jacket that smells of the remnants of a distant winter's fireplace smoke, or as if you open the door to an old library holding leather-bound books pulsating with memories.
It is a fragrance that combines frankness and softness, featuring luxurious leather that harmoniously blends masculinity and femininity.
Performance: long-lasting for many hours, with moderate to strong projection, making your presence felt even after you leave.
Mood: evokes a sense of quiet strength and dignity mixed with elegance, like someone wearing a dark suit and carrying an Italian leather bag on a refined winter evening.
And if Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather is loud and rebellious, then Acqua di Parma's Leather is the polished, aristocratic, quiet voice that doesn't need to shout to assert its presence.
This perfume is the companion of cold evenings and formal nights, where its deep, leathery features shine most splendidly.
Ideal for high-level business meetings, a luxurious dinner at an elegant restaurant, or as a finishing touch for a man who knows how to balance strength and refinement.
In summer or hot weather, just a few sprays are enough to give it space to breathe without overpowering.
Leather is not just a scent to be smelled, but an experience to be told.
It is a statement of luxury, a personal signature written with leather, citrus, and flowers, leaving an indelible mark.
It teaches you that true luxury does not come with noise, but with a deep calm that remains in memory.

So far, only Ford has done this well with Ombre; the rest of the good ones are primarily proper compositions, not leather lollipops like, I guess, Leather Patchouli or Guerlain’s leather take, etc. As I understand, this is some EDP version of a scent already known in the ADP?",07/18/25 05:37,korngoldo

What it does smell like is a rich leather couch ina gentleman's smoking room.....there is a beautiful smokiness like an expensive cigar or cigarettes, mixed with a bouquet of spices such as black cardamom.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The bottle is beautiful, AdP is renowned, and I honestly bought this fragrance because not only am I currently into leathery/smoky/spicy scents, but because this particular perfume has been discontinued, I figure it'd be a sought-after collector's item one day. Unfortunately, as a fragrance, it's not tops on my list in this genre. The opening is rough and unappealing -- it's a mix of leather, used cigarette butts and a little bit of burnt rubber. The mid is a bit more mellowed out and yet still rough because of the over-prominence of the leather note. At that point, it smells sort of in the vicinity of Maison Crivelli Oud Maracuja, but not as smooth, fruity (not that I consider OM to be that fruity in the first place) or strong in performance. The dry down comes much faster with AdP Leather than with OM, which is the longest-lasting cologne I have ever used. When this fragrance finally smells at its best, it's too late -- by then, it's almost a skin scent. It would have helped if AdP had added a vanilla accord, not to make it gourmand but to tamper down the leather / cigarette ash smell a little. AdP Leather isn't bad per se; it's just not that great as a scent, and its arc doesn't properly align with its lifespan.",02/03/25 06:45,UGAMark
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Another masterpeice by François Demachy who gave us the most elegant leather of all time; Dior Homme Parfum. ✨👑 (and like the beloved DHP, AdP Leather is also discontinued 🙄)

AdP Leather is a smokey primal brooding dark leather where the Paraguayan Guaiac wood takes center stage and gives you that dark smokey aspect of a leather accord. 🌫️ 🖤 🌫️ 🖤

It's a true leather fragrance where the leather is always present throughout the fragrance's journey with you. The famous AdP citrus is also here to give it that elegant freshness, preparing you for a dark descent into the primal dark journey of the rugged bold leather accord. This is such a well-blended formulation! The cedar gives it that alpha masculine sharpness. 😎

This smells like you had to do some hard decisions in your head. It is a very serious fragrance, which is why it's leaning very formal. 🤵

Regardless of the listed notes, I get immediate leather and essentially nothing else in the opening. The far dry down has a little woody scent appearing in addition to the leather. This is strictly a clean leather. Not a hint of band aid smell and does not come across as strongly animalic. Overall leather scent is smooth, clean and classy. Seems pretty versatile; would work for formal or casual wear, any time of day, and day of the year outside of very hot days. I have not tested any of the Tom Ford leathers, but will be doing so soon. Should be interesting to compare. Longevity good - about 8 hours for me with decent sillage and projection the first hour, becoming a closer scent bubble after that.",10/27/24 14:46,Smirky

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I own both this and Tuscan Leather.
While Tuscan Leather is the new, designer made leather jacket, Colonia Leather is the jacket that went through a few motorcycle crashes with cigars in its inner pocket.

Imagine this: You are at the Italian coast, starting the aperitivo. The girls order an aperol spritz and the boys a negroni. One guy doesn't want either, and orders a whisky and lights up a small cigar. Everyone looks at him weird. He doesn't care and does what he wants.

THIS is how he smells. As you could probably tell from the length of this review, I am very passionate about this fragrance (and Acqua di Parma as a whole). Perhaps I am biased because I am Italian, but there is nothing quite like ADP available. How they go about their perfumery is pure art, and modern designers could learn a lot from them.

To start: I don't think this smells like Tuscan Leather at all, in the same way that a retro leather jacket is very different from a modern one. This one is more masculine, more rough. It's the perfect combo between that classy Acqua di Parma citrus and the animalic notes from the leather, woods and smoke. Like a man riding a sports bike in a suit :)

I'm not saying that this is 'a better fragrance' than Tuscan Leather, but damn, there is just nothing like this on the market. Tuscan Leather has a few alternatives like Godolphin and that one from Rasasi (they are all worse than TL though), but there is not a single fragrance that captures that Italian masculinity like this one. Besides, it is not redundant to own them both. I reach more for Tuscan Leather when the setting is outside/colder and more for Colonia Leather in warmer settings.

Moreover, I do detect a slight difference between the old Colonia Leather and the new black bottle (I have a decant of the new stuff). The new version has a slightly more prominent raspberry note, but I only noticed the difference when I smelled them side by side, and it would be impossible to detect the difference in the air. I am sure it is caused by the fact my old, brown bottle is from 2018 so it has aged a bit, while the decant is from the newest bottle. It is not worth hunting old bottles, unless you connect sentimental values to it.

Lastly, the fact that people think this is ""hard to wear"" and ""too smokey"" makes me even love it more. This stuff is Italian confidence in a bottle. 10/10.",09/10/24 07:48,sweetymasculine
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Yes, it is in the Tuscan leather lineage but on the lighter and slightly brighter side with a prominent citrus note
Highly wearable and classy",07/06/24 16:30,Vitriol08
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The leather note is incredible right from the start; it is probably the strongest and most natural leather note I've ever encountered (even more pronounced than in the Leather Colonia). This note is very animalic in its naturalism but not ""dirty,"" reminding me more of sun-tanned, rustic, and bronzed leather tools than the smell of a sweaty animal and other bodily odors, as in Kouros.

Edit: It seems this version and the Leather Colonia are exactly the same fragrance. I haven't compared them side by side, but one really reminded me of the other, with strong impressions right from the opening.

From the start, there is a quite smoky oud that brings similarities to the house's Oud & Spice and really solidifies for me that, contrary to what I previously thought, Acqua di Parma is not just about fresher, naturalistic, and minimalist (or barber-shop) fragrances but also has some of the best dark and ""niche"" fragrances on the market.",06/05/24 10:09,danilodeathayde

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The opening felt challenging where every note seems to fight and scream against each other but the dry down is where the magic starts to happen. ADP Leather calms down and starts to exude a slightly sweet, Chinese herbal smelling leather. For me, this herbal quality can also be interpreted as medicinal and also smoky.

This perfume is actually more similar to Gucci Guilty Absolute / Kilian Dark Lord in its presentation compared to Tom Ford’s OM/TL. GGA/Dark Lord also has this herbal/medicine note, but they are less sweet and go for a smokier, dryer and even more herbal route. As a result, GGA/Dark Lord can smell flatter with less depth compared to ADP Leather which has more of a body due to the more balanced sweet + herbal.

Personally, I don’t correlate GGA, Dark Lord or ADP Leather to be a “leather” scent. I feel that TF Leathers are more leather-like to my nose.

Regardless, ADP Leather is a good alternative to GGA/Dark Lord with its more balanced profile. Make no mistake - this leather is still not mass pleasing but it is certainly less harsh and aggressive compared to GGA/Dark Lord. If you want mass pleasing, this perfume is not for you.

This perfume is good value as it can be found for good prices at discounters. It’s certainly an acquired taste which I think GGA/Dark Lord enjoyers can appreciate.

Longevity is similar, if not slightly behind GGA and Dark Lord. ADP leather is a long lasting fragrance. It feels like it sits close to your skin but actually the projection and silage performs well.",01/17/24 04:05,Torky
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"***Blind Buy Review*
Well, after reading all these reviews, and ADP being my favourite brand, I had to blind buy this, it was on sale and felt like missing out on the deal would be a crime.

When i first sprayed this onto myself, i felt that its different, but i did not really liked it.
It is deeper then what I usually use in cold:
darker, more agressive, far from my safe (most of the time synthetic) sweet choices

This feels like taking a long walk somewhere on the countryside on an autumn or winter dawn, it’s dark outside and really frosty, the wind is feeezing cold, people are burning wood to keep themselves warm in their houses, you can smell it in the air.

You get home after your mind has been cleared on the “fresh air”.You became calmer and ice cold inside and out, the leather jacket which suits you so well wasnt warm enough for the occasion, you take it off and while you are trying to put it onto the hanger with your frozen hands.

You Catch a smell…….
Fumy and Rigid smelling shiny black leather, smells like you’ve made some hard choices in your head outside, it is okay, thats the reason why you feel sharper and more pleased with yourself, dont worry you deserved this already.

Unique and natural smelling leather at the same time.
Wear it for harder days, or for a special occasion, maybe when it is windy and cold outside.
10/10 scent with great Longevity and an okay sillage, which could be better but you would probably choke someone out.
I recommend it, but dont blind buy if you expect something uplifting.🙂",01/12/24 14:18,Filepp

What i get is a linear, animalic, sweet leather with a touch of citrus and raspberry...great performer too!",11/27/23 15:34,Andre_p
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is a great fragrance, but I have trouble actually discerning the leather. Everyone says it’s an amazing, realistic leather fragrance, but on my skin, it’s so well blended in with the other notes that I struggle to discern an actual leather note. On the other end, however, I have no trouble sniffing out the rose, raspberry, petit grain, and citrus, as well as some of the thyme towards the back end, and that smack in the face of smoky Guaiac wood which prevails for the first couple hours. Because of how it sits on my skin, I only get about 5 hours of good projection, and it isn’t full bodied enough for it to be a go-to for winter in cold climates, but it’s great above 45*f and under 90*f for me, which makes it pretty versatile. Once you’re safely in the dry down and out of the smoke, I’d say this is office friendly and would definitely distinguish you from your colleagues. It’s mature, sophisticated, and yet still current - it exudes confidence and intellect and it’s just as good on a night out as it is at the mall, in the office, or on a drive through the mountains, so long as you don’t intend to go clubbing

On a side note, this is definitely not a sporty fragrance, I wouldn’t suggest you wear this to the gym, hiking, biking, or even golfing, this is definitely a more dressed up fragrance which requires a well dressed man for it to be at its best

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Leather Eau de Parfum (EDP) by Acqua di Parma is a leathery, floral and woody fragrance.

Unlike the opening of the Leather Cologne Concentree (CC) where the citrus shines and gives it an air of a classic leather cologne, in the EDP version we have a more intense opening in something that seemed to me like a chocolate truffle with one or several fruity notes and leathery tone, almost like shoe polish cream. As time goes by, the rose note increases and comes to the foreground, leaving the leathery aroma as its companion. After more than an hour, a wood base remains with a touch of animalic musk, while the rose and leather remain present.

Leather Eau de Parfum is elegant and formal, perfect for events or special situations and preferably for use between autumn and winter.

Its longevity was good for me, a little more than 8 hours, although the sillage was average.

There are some differences between the EDP and CC versions, mainly in the presence of citrus, which is almost absent in the black bottle version. They are both very good fragrances, but I think I like the Cologne version a little more because it is a little more versatile.",09/23/23 09:08,caifan

When I noticed that the bottles had changed to black, I tried it to make sure it hadn't changed, but unfortunately this is not the Leather I'm used to...

The opening note honestly smells like fish. I've tried it in several different stores in 3 different countries to confirm that it wasn't just a bad batch. Nope. It smells like a fishmonger's leather apron.

Whatever ingredient they've changed, they need to reverse their decision as soon as possible. Once the fishy smell has faded, it does start smelling like the original fragrance - but I'm not sure why anyone would subject themselves to the initial smell.",02/19/23 09:47,zpgnbg
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Heaviest of the batch, oily, fruity faint floral flowing above some brown-ish ‘leather’ as a starter, not animalic at first.

Then you can tell there’s a strong core that’s yet fully exposed. Roses step down and only embraces the leather from afar, the lather note, here a thick dense raw leather is projecting even bigger and louder!

The leather accord is similar to that of la yuqawam, but the raspberry note is less prominent, making it less sweet.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Just because fragrances have the same notes doesn't mean they smell similar or the same. This doesn't smell anything like Tuscan Leather.

This is a smokey dark rough leather fragrance that some might find hard to wear, especially with the opening. However, to me, this is a rich elegant fragrance.

In the opening, you will get a strong but classy smokey dark rough leather with a toned-down raspberry note that doesn't smell sweet or sugary. People that aren't used to rough or strong leather might think the opening smells a bit animalic, but I agree with people that say this smells like a well-conditioned leather seat in a classic sports car.

The scent stays a predominantly leather fragrance through its lifespan but it's tamed down as it develops. To me, you don't get a recognizable rose note but you get the feel of a rose petal. Giving this leather a silky feel, the same as feeling a silky rose pedal.

With the mid and base notes of honeysuckle and cedar along with lingering citrus top notes, this scent dries down to a tame semi-fresh woody leather.",12/02/22 07:53,...Pleasehold
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is fire 🔥 I love this fragrance. If you haven't tried it, get a sample first. It lasts at least 6 hours and the leather and fruitiness lingers. This for me is, 10/10!",11/29/22 17:04,LeeHill
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I thought I was done with this brand after trying almost 10 fragrances which is my usual bar that sets if the brand is good enough to invest in
But here emerges one of the best made fragrances from this house that I rarely hear about
The statement I have about this scent is that it’s one of the best depictions of rugged dirty dark leather you could ever get your nose on
It’s not the best by a long shot but you can definitely align it with other greats such as Tuscan leather and ombre leather
This is what you call leather
I still can’t understand the old fragrances that supposedly are leather dominant and when you smell them all you get is orange or citrus (looking at you bel ami )
Performance is perfect if you have any appreciation for dark leather it’s a choice you shouldn’t ignore",11/22/22 10:19,Fragaddict123
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Leather EDP is a scent that definitely makes its presence felt! The leather announces itself immediately - a dry, dark, slightly dirty leather that crackles with an undercurrent of smoke. I definitely get some BBQ vibes in the vein of Patchouli 24 which gives it a savoury edge. Not quite animalic to my nose but a little rough round the edges, something that may take a while to get used to.

It starts to soften several minutes in as the layers begin to develop. We get a delicious fruitiness from the raspberry, tartness from the orange and lemon and a soft, floral patina from the rose and honeysuckle. Each of these elements adds colour to the leather experience, imbuing it with depth and richness. One gets hints of scents such as Russian Tea and Godolphin.

Leather is a scent that may initially overwhelm but ultimately charms one over with its tapestry of olfactory textures. Projection and sillage are moderate on me but longevity is decent, things eventually moving to an aromatic woody base. It leans fairly masculine and works best in cooler weather. A solid offering from the house.",09/30/22 19:12,nkapped
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I don’t understand how people are getting raspberry and citrus fruits from this. It’s just pure, dark, smoky old leather; and it’s vile.

It’s less intrusive on the dry down but still old and smoky. Not a scent I’ll be associating myself with any time soon.

I prefer Ombré Leather which has the primary cardamom scent with floral notes but the leather is evident. It’s more intriguing.

Edit; 3 days later. I DO get the orange and raspberry scents. The problem I was having was that I was sticking my nose in and smelling it. You need to let this sit and all of the other fragrances come out over time and as it weakens.

Quite nice actually. Still maybe a bit old fashioned for myself, but quite nice.",09/24/22 06:30,Steparko23
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is divine. I love it as it changes a bad mood to a better one. It smells great and performs amazingly. I have Parfum de Marly's Godolphin, but I would not say that they smell alike.",09/16/22 10:57,itsallaboutmega
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Imagine the brown broken-in interior of a properly kept luxury car from the 80s polished with leather conditioner, warming under the sunshine and a touch of petitgrain and tart fruitiness entering through the window.

I much prefer this to both Tuscan and even Ombre Leather, because they feel very much like high fashion leather, jet black shiny leather. On the other hand, AdP Leather feels rounder, more complex, and has a certain depth to it, while still screaming ''leather''.
I find this one is best enjoyed when spraying conservatively, because too much of it has an overwhelming effect. Spraying once or twice max. allows the leather to kind of loom around you and reveals a lot of nuance in the mix, tart, spicy, woody, and herbal facets just kind of radiate through the dense leather and it comes off less jarring and aggressive. The leather also flickers between a smoky incense-y almost charred wood like effect which I personally enjoy.

This is one of the few fragrances from AdP that I thoroughly enjoy and this comes from someone who avoids leather fragrances in general. This one is undoubtedly top of the line for me.

p.s. This is pretty much identical to the brown Colonia Leather flanker. You could honestly just see which is cheaper online and just pick that up without any reservation.",08/24/22 16:50,derby2169
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Dry smoky leather...hints of raspberry and rose, but overwhelmingly smoky leather. I get the burnt smoke others mention, but I also feel it's pretty smooth, despite the hints of ash. I'm not a leather or dark frag person, so not for me and I'm probably not the best judge of what a leather frag lover would like. It's certainly not for those who are not into smoky leather, but I can see somebody enjoying this...maybe a Harley rider in black biker jacket with a marlboro hanging off his lips. It certainly captures the vibe of stern, Harley riding smoker, but in an upscale way.

Scent: 6.5 / Sillage: 8 / Longevity: 7 (8/8/2022)

UPDATE:
Revisiting my thoughts and it's pretty spot on...dry smoky leather. Hints of Fahrenheit gasoline notes. Still not exactly my style, but pretty great for classy, natural, leather lovers.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Thus far I have limited myself to only reviewing fragrances I've used on my skin, as those are the fragrances I have the most familiar impressions of and can authentically comment on after having used them during different times of day, throughout different seasons, and sometimes across different climates. Today, I have broken this rule.

I came across Leather in my adventure of finding new fragrances for my partner. The notes and the description were pleasantly intriguing enough that this ended up being one out of three fragrances from Acqua Di Parma I decided to smell in-store. And oh how wrong I was, because today, I can finally say there is a fragrance I hate. This went straight to the base notes and was a horrible cacophony of strong hard leather and incense smoke.

In my country, the burning of joss paper (or incense paper, or to the Western world, ""hell's banknotes"") is a ritual in our ancestor worship. It is not uncommon to see people burning joss paper in metal cannisters on the streets - mostly in residential areas. I was walking back home with not a care in the world, when all of a sudden I started to smell Leather. I was alone on the escalator ascending a footbridge, and was obviously quite confused to be bombarded with this horrible smell. This was also through my K95 mask. As I started walking along the footbridge, in the distance I saw a man burning joss paper. And that is what Leather smells like to me.",06/12/21 01:26,bergamotted

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Acqua Di Parma Leather EDP opens with a moderate to a strong projection of leather, woody, faint fruit, and floral accords. The opening is mature, intense, bold, but not harsh, elegant, and refined. The leather is by far the most noticeable note, a natural leather, polished, with a suede touch, elegant, not pungent or animalic, and without that combustible or gasoline vibe found in leader prominent fragrances. A step behind is the guaiac wood, a woody smoky, and leathery note. Several steps behind are the raspberry, orange, and honeysuckle, adding a very shy sweet fruit, and white floral accord. The rest of the notes are there to provide support but don’t have any significant participation. The fragrance is linear, all featured notes come up as soon as the fragrance is applied and continue into the dry down. One Acqua Di Parma Leather EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a moderate to a strong projection, leather, and guaiac wood fragrance with faint fruity, floral and spicy accords.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I dunno. Other than being a leather dominant fragrance, I’m not seeing the comparisons to tom Ford Tuscan leather.

Acqua di Parma Leather is beautifully intense - the Leather note almost comes across as a petroleum type smell - with the most subtle kick of sweetness and tangy-ness buried in the background.

I think Tuscan leather and acqua di Parma leather certainly compare when you consider the fact that they are both “harsh” leathers - but in terms of actual smell similarity...I just don’t see it.

I find this to be one of the more unique leathers I’ve come across - and its oddly satisfying. The opening is distractingly harsh - not a “that smells awful” type harsh - more of a “oh shit - maybe i should’ve spayed it once.”

Within 20 minutes or so, the smack in the face wears off - and you’re left with a pleasant, slightly citrusy leather. I would also clarify, that although rose is listed in the notes, it’s not prominent. Again, I would think of a heavy “petrol” type scent when trying to compare this to others. There was one by histoiries de Parfums called Petroleum that kind of reminds me of this. I sold it a long time ago...it was definitely more rugged and less refined than this - but same ballpark.

If you’re a fan of fairly rugged/masculine heavy leathers, I can see this being appealing. To me it’s a very nice Alternative to the standard “Tuscan leather” type scent. I’m a big fan",08/20/20 12:37,picknenders

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"THREE

I went on a mission this summer to try neroli-forward traditional colognes. I hoped to find something fresh that fits a casual T-shirt vibe for Westside LA. I grabbed 5 ml decants of Neroli Portofino, Mandarino di Amalfi, Colonia Essenza, and Colonia Pura and wore them throughout the heat. Pura ended up my favorite of the bunch. The twist is that the whole “neroli cologne” lane ended up reading formal to me. Pura is less formal, which leaves it in a tricky spot. When I want a dressy cologne, I would reach for Mandarino di Amalfi, and for truly casual, I would go outside the lane. I’m sure I’ll finish off the decant next summer, but won’t re-buy.

TL;DR: Easier-going Essenza energy with an ozonic, airy opening, then a smoother floral-citrus where orange shows more than expected, finishing in a clean woody-musk that sits close. Clean, modern, polite. Casual feel in a traditionally formal genre. It does evolve from opening to heart to drydown; not wildly, but enough to feel like a journey. Probably a good wardrobe piece for someone who likes this scent profile, less so for me.

Rating:

Opening: 3.1/5
Drydown: 2.8/5
Overall: 5.9/10

Opening
Early ozonic hit. Petitgrain pushes a clear soapiness on my skin, stronger than I prefer. I had hoped that skipping neroli would avoid that effect, but petitgrain plus white musks and airy florals creates the same “Cheap McDonalds Soap Dispenser” vibe (how my nose reads heavy neroli). It feels like a softer, friendlier Essenza that stays in the classic cologne mold, just airier. As the soapiness settles inside the first half hour, a gentle orange facet unexpectedly comes forward.

Heart
From about 60 to 120 minutes, it is an easier floral-citrus that is smooth and tidy, with a light herbal thread. The coriander note blends with the florals and reads greener than Essenza. It is pleasant and feels purposefully “traditional cologne” while clearly offering a unique take.

Drydown
By hour 5, you are in a clean woody-musk of cedar, soft patchouli, and white musks. It does not project much, but it has more presence than the airy opening suggests. Quietly masculine and easy to carry into evening. The core trace lingers to about 7 hours, mostly at skin level.

Performance on me
Polite, but strong for the genre. About 1.5 to 2 hours of aura, then close to skin. Roughly 5 to 7 hours total, with the last stretch as a subtle skin scent. I’d catch scents of it through the day if I applied it to my wrists if I was hand talking.

Versatility
High in theory and trickier in practice. The DNA says formal, but it wears casual on me. I would use it for a T-shirt-and-shorts creative meeting, although I still prefer other summer picks for that slot.

Use cases
Office days, client coffees, brunch where you want the first hug to smell clean. School events and travel days, anywhere conservative etiquette helps.

Vibe
White tee, good jeans, fresh haircut. It’s clean and modern, but not “too cool”. This is the well dressed guy who's wearing a white t-shirt tucked into jeans with a crew cut. He looks good, smells good, but doesn't have too much main character energy. The cooler dude with messy hair who may be stealing your girl is probably wearing Neroli Portofino.

Blind-buy safe?
No. I think this whole genre requires testing. Won’t perform well enough for some. Florals won’t land for others. Too mature for yet others. Give it a decant if you want a clean, modern feeling cologne that replaces some of the “Floral!” with ozone and aldehydes.

Comparisons
Colonia Essenza: Sharper, dressier, more neroli-forward snap and more obvious soapiness. Pura is softer and airier, a modernized take.
Tom Ford Neroli Portofino: Louder orange-blossom soap. Next to NP, Pura reads less soapy and more airy and orange-clean. Less floral, more white-musk and ozonic.
Tom Ford Mandarino di Amalfi: Juicier mandarin and grapefruit with *mint, basil, and thyme. More sparkly and aromatic in the heart; less overtly soapy than **Pura. Dries down to light citrus-aromatic over musks and woods, while Pura turns cleaner and more white-musk polished.
Dior Homme Cologne (2020): Brighter “iced-lemonade” citrus and better early projection. Pura trades fizz for tidiness.
Le Labo Bergamote 22: Greener, grapefruit-tinged bergamot with a diffusive *musky-woody* halo and a clearer vetiver and cedar second act. B22 radiates more, while Pura stays closer and cleaner. It still has a three-phase evolution, just subtler.

Conclusion

Colonia Pura threads the needle between classic Italian cologne polish and modern, low-key cleanliness. It was my favorite of the group, yet it is the least “me,” because it lives between dressy and casual. If you want that perfect just-showered aura without orange-blossom drama, this nails it. If you want sparkle, volume, or a signature flourish, reach for Bergamote 22, Dior Homme Cologne, or Mandarino di Amalfi. For hot days when you want to look put together without trying, Pura delivers exactly what it promises.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I wear this as a basic cologne... I bought it for my brother for christmas... the salesman at the Bloomingdales was a pro... and for some reason I felt the need to buy this....

Long story short, my brother didnt like it... so I kept it... Im trying to use it all cuz Its a little too expensive to gift to a random person... but smells too basic to give to a friend or family member.

So when I do decide to wear it and I want to smell like a basic clean man... I spray the hell out of it, cuz the bottle is so big... over 6oz of this shit I still need to go through...

Acqua di Parma has some amazing scents... this is not one of them... unless you are a white dude who enjoys a warm glass of milk before bed, then go for it... youll smell ok at the next family wedding you get invited to...

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I received a sample from a mail-order service. While it's enjoyable, I won't repurchase it. I think it's within the unisex range, but the sweetness is high pitch, so someone taking a cautious first step toward sweet instead of rugged probably should start elsewhere. Like many freshies, Colonia Pura doesn't last. To its credit, it's not a repeat of everything. The fruity mixture moves beyond citrus, so it smells more like an oceanside farmer's market. Thus, the bright open is a bit green, ozonic, and marine. The brief later phases are floral, then ozonic again, and woodsy. In addition to being short, the journey is all over the place, if pleasant and evocative. There are two catches: First, this is sweeter than my favorites, so I wonder if I'd find it cloying after repeated wear. Second, the short jasmine stage was potent, so I'd only wear this when staying in instead of risking trouble for people with allergies. Still, if you're looking for something uplifting, brightly sweet, and slightly romantic that might surprise you, I'd give this a try.",12/22/24 12:30,JimmyMisfit

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Went to a store a few days ago (galeries lafayette) and was surprised to see AdP and even more surprised to see that some of their perfumes were available for testing !

Short story, I've been trying to recreate an amateur homemade version of Colonia Pura for years now without pulling of something good. I have quite a few chemical and essential oils to do so. And by essential oils I mean real ones : bio ones from France and Italy. After years of searching, reading and learning the marketing of AdP about this one.

What a deception.
First : this is a two stages scent, citrus for 1 to 2 hours and then soap at skin scent range.
Second : fake, chemical citrus here. Not bergamote, not orange and definitly not petigrain. Having all of them (really good, pure essential oils quality), the opening of Colonia Pura is none of those. Just a disapointing generic chemical lemon, like candy lemon without the sugar.
Third : marketing bullblabla. There is no narcissus, jasmin (who I recognise immediatly for the real essential oil, very strong and amazing, and expenssive. So just Hedione ?), cedar (not atlas, not virginian, not others, so just Iso e super ?), and definitly not patchouli. I don't say they are not here, just you can't smell of feel them. Just soap.
Final : the dry down, after 1 or 2 hours of chemical lemon, just the soap is remaining. Good or bad it is up to you but on me, just a generic hotel lemon soap. The in between is ok you get the soap through the citrus fast but there is nothing else here. No ozone, no flowers. Soap. And after 4 to 6 hours it is turning bad on my skin, almost yuky.

Happy not to have blind bought this one !

Tldr, what a deception for a cologne at that price and marketed so fresh and with some naturals. Not good and definitly not natural, just lemon soap.",10/29/24 03:03,fragrangc

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The opening of this is wonderful, the ozonic note really elevates the citrus, but sadly this pleasant phase lasts maybe 15 minutes. Then nuclear jasmine kicks in, overpowering everything else. Despite having very different body chemistry and preferences, both me and my partner experienced the middle notes as extremely unpleasant and a bit sickening. The jasmine is really persistent and long lasting, I had to wash it off and could still smell hints of it after. I didn't get to experience the drydown. People who have issues with jasmine turning bad on them should stay clear of this.",10/04/24 13:39,twojtrener
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I love this scent. It’s summer. It’s classy. As always with ADP bottles it looks the part too.

Observations about longevity are not unfounded, it’s steady, you need to reapply before lunch and mid afternoon if you want to keep the thing alive, and it isn’t going to fill a room, but it will ooze classy and rich summer vibes to those within your sphere, and that’s ok with me. It will always be in my arsenal, I love it, and those in my life do too… and that’s all that matters. You could reach for this after the gym, at the poolside, on a summer night… it’s an all rounder. It would never be mistaken for generic in my view, it’s too classy and sophisticated for that, too expensive smelling, but it’ll never offend and never let you down…

In terms of the profile, it’s citrusy but has an undercurrent of earthiness and jasmine… it’s vibrant and playful in a way, but really elegant. Others have commented that it’s a chinos and yacht kind of vibe, and I whole heartedly agree with that, and who doesn’t want to smell like they’ve just egressed their yacht?!

Overall, a respectable 8/10, if it projected a little more it’d be a 9 or more, but the score is like the scent, decent, worthy.",08/23/24 15:32,NickTheGreek1
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"#803 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""

I will never understand why anyone spends more than $35 on a citrus freshie and this scent has not changed my mind. I tried every one of the Blu Mediterraneo line. Performance is always terrible for any citrus freshie but those set a new low. Absolute waste of money every one of them. Performed like an $8 Cuba Paris scent. Hell, the Nautica's, Chrome's, Ferrari's, even Adidas performed better. This scent far outperforms those AdP blues, but it's still just a ""me too"" among the hundreds of citrus freshies on the market.

Of the scents I've tried this reminds me of MFK's very disappointing and ridiculously overpriced Aqua Universalis Forte (when they have ""water"" in the name, believe them). You get nothing from this scent you won't get in a bottle of John Varvatos Artisan Blu, a $27 EDT. Projection-wise, by mid-morning coffee break no one will know you're wearing this, though it's a skin scent for 6-7 hours. It's certainly car pool, elevator and office safe, as is every citrus freshie since they're all too mild to offend anyone. But I don't see what you get with this scent that you don't get with a $35 bottle of Chrome Aqua, or a $23 bottle of Armaf Ventana Marine, other than the AdP rep, which based on the nine AdP scents I've tried to date I would to say is undeserved.",08/17/24 07:50,JusttheFactsMan

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This stuff is divine. For what this fragrance does and how it makes you feel in a tropical climate you really cannot go wrong. I first smelled this at Epcot of all places in the Italy pavilion. If you are familiar with the park, then you would know that several of the countries feature fragrance brands from their respective countries of origin. At first sniff I was in love with this juice. It is not crazy complex but very sexy, alluring, and masculine although generally a unisex smell if that makes sense. The retail price is not terribly out of touch, but the price you can get this at on grey market retailers is insane! I got my 100ML for around $62 and I can't see how that could've been a better deal. This fragrance is very adult though in my opinion. I can't see a teen pulling this off. Im in my early 20s and I still feel a little out of place when I wear this sometimes. It's just so sophisticated and grown rich man smelling. This is like all of the best aspects of sunscreen fresh type fragrances but made a little more well rounded with different accords. As far as when to wear this, I would say anytime spring or summer. There's not really a casual vs. formal scent to this. More of a who are you as the person wearing this type of vibe. This is white linen, suede summer walks, and cream colored pants type of vibes to me. Longevity is great but projection is not. People will need to be close to smell this on you, but they will be able to smell you at least 6 hours after application. Fantastic performance for an Eau De Cologne concentration to me. If you can get this for sub $80 and are into what I described above I would say just grab it. You really can't go wrong with this juice. It might even get you a new love interest if that's what you're looking for ;).",06/24/24 22:11,FloridaFrags33
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura by Acqua di Parma is a cherished part of my fragrance collection, embodying both elegance and modern sophistication. From the moment I first encountered its vibrant opening, I was captivated. The blend of bergamot, lemon, and orange greets you like a warm embrace, instantly uplifting and refreshingly bright. It’s not your typical citrus scent; it carries a touch of regal freshness, reminiscent of stepping off a yacht into the sun-drenched Mediterranean.

What sets Colonia Pura apart is its seamless evolution. The heart of the fragrance reveals jasmine, dancing gracefully with narcissus and coriander. This floral bouquet adds a layer of complexity, transforming the initial citrus burst into something more refined and harmonious. The jasmine, in particular, stands out, lending a sophisticated charm without overpowering the composition.

As Colonia Pura settles, the base notes of patchouli, cedarwood, and musk come forward, grounding the fragrance with a warm, earthy elegance. This balance between brightness and depth is what makes Colonia Pura truly special. It’s a modern take on the classic Colonia, paying homage to its heritage while introducing a contemporary twist that feels both timeless and current.

In my experience, Colonia Pura is versatile, suitable for any occasion. It’s invigorating enough for daytime wear, yet sophisticated enough for an evening out. I appreciate how it adapts to different settings, always maintaining its elegant presence.",06/20/24 22:22,zeeworldoffragrance
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The opening is much more floral than the others in the line. The narcissus is quite defining, with jasmine providing a slightly powdery yet very fresh background. The aldehydes curiously give me an aquatic sensation, similar to the aquatic flowers in Eau D'Issey, especially the feminine one.

It's probably the furthest from the original Colonia and has the most modern tones. There's something metallic as well, reminiscent of the metallic-aquatic, fresh, and floral side of Hermès H24.

Over time, the white musk appears and reminds me a bit of the dry down of Dior Homme Cologne (one of my favorite scents). It is the most unisex in the line, leaning slightly towards the feminine, and like the entire line, it is delicious.",06/05/24 10:03,danilodeathayde
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"My impressions after going through a 2ml sample:

The opening smells like spraying Acqua di Sale once and lemon pledge twice in the air. It’s scary how close the cologne dries down like Acqua di Sale and its baby sister Fiore dell’Onda. About 70% there with less of a tangy seaweed note, replaced with a generic citrus scent you’d find on those hand wipes they give you at a fish restaurant.

Pleasant cologne overall. One could say it’s overpriced but considering the overall quality of the juice and lower proportion of aroma chemicals compared to its peers, it’s a well concocted fragrance. Inoffensive, leans feminine but you could totally rock this if you’re an extroverted, happy fellow.",06/04/24 02:37,SmellyBoye
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Fresh laundry hanging under a citrus tree, while someone is peeling an orange next to you. Nothing impressive, but No one around you are going to complain about this scent (unless they hate clean cloths and citrus...). Longevity and projection is pretty good on me. 2 sprays are blasting of my skin for 3 solid hours, until i got wet and dried of with a towel. After toweling off, it's 8-10 inches of the skin projection. Enough to leave an ok scent trail. Pretty good for a fragrance like this.

This is Very Italian perfumery. Soapy clean and refreshing, a hint of spice, and loads of citrus, florals, and woods. Perfect when you want to freshen up, dress down and relax, or dress up in style.

Personal score: 8/10. What's not to like? Citrusy, floral, and woody, is one of the oldest and most loved combinations of fragrance. This has a classic style and a classic scent. Exceptional versatility.",05/31/24 10:33,ZeaMoore4

I can't say old fashioned on this, as I am a fan of old fashioned frags. This one just comes off as a bit dated and irrelevant.

My review is as effete and apathetic as the fragrance and I'm not going to get into my personal experience with this. The notes listed on this Fragrantica profile are 80% correct in their depiction save for waxy musk, wet rocks and the slightest tinge of fish.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,Its nice but it's probably my least favorite from the Colonia line up that I've tried. Opening is an orange blast. Very nice quality citrus which unfortunately doesn't last. The ozonic and florals take over rather quickly. The ozonic notes overpower the citrus. It's ok but I'm not crazy about the ozonic notes. Goes alittle soapy which muddled everything to some extent. Something about how the ozonic motes mix with the florals isn't for me. There's also something slightly sour in here. Acqua di Parma does citrus aromatics like none other. This one unfortunately isn't for me. I much rather prefer Colonia Essenza and Intensa. It's fine but not great. I'll finish off my sample but probably won't get a full bottle.,04/20/24 17:22,3ak
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I’ve been wearing this for the last 3/4 years during spring & summer. I liked it because it got away from your typical citrus freshies. The more experience I have with this, the more it moves into one of my favorites.

Opens ozone, slight citrus, and w/the narcissus note (this is the main note on me throughout). Very light and airy. As it continues to dry down the musk note adds depth.

Longevity and projection are average…5/6 hours. I overspray to increase both.

I am never disappointed when I apply this. Certainly one of their best IMHO. Saying that, this is very different than ADP’s fragrances….I certainly would sample and wear for a day or two before going all in with full bottle.",04/11/24 05:33,MNadz
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,The house is among my favorites for a reason. Cannot imagine a summer without one of their colognes.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"More of a chalky-musk rather than powder.. There is a calm & smooth citric sweetness here mixed w/ the musk that makes me think of Pez candy. I think it may be sweet patchouli creating the slightly strange scent.
@Discardedandroid said- ‘fun dip candy’. Yes the chalky simi-sweet white dipping stick!
As much as I absolutely hate Jasmine- the blending, harmony & softness of notes is extremely pleasing. Care-free vibe 🍃.
Spring time banger. Unisex. Casual.
Soft citrus, ozonic, dewy, soapy-sweet florals that doesn’t smell feminine.

Edit: 3/4/24
So I bought a 100ml.. this batch differs slightly from the sample I had.
It’s more green- specifically petitgrain smelling.. because of this, it isn’t as smooth & sweet. It’s more like a herbal citrus soap.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"It's very lovely and there's not much to dislike despite it being very weak. On a warm day in a linen shirt it's really quite delightful. You can smell the naturals so clearly: Oranges and bergamot with a lovely subtle sweetness and air of sophistication. It's VERY Italian and conjures up images of walking through a sun dappled path in Amalfi with the sound of the sea in the distance and orange trees either side of me. I can hear the birds singing and the air is warm, yet fresh. I'm on my way to a terrace overlooking the coast to have an early afternoon aperitif and a light lunch with great company. Yes, the longevity is bad but it's a cologne and can be reapplied whenever you fancy.",02/06/23 08:42,OllieH163
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This unique scent takes strengths from Aqua Di Parma's Colonia and makes it fresher, floral, and smoother. This scent reminds me of playing tennis in the summer! It can be overwhelmingly fresh on clothing on first opening, but when you let it rest on your skin it is a marvelous scent that will offer lingering floral, citrus, and herbal notes. This scent will be good to you if you are patient with it :)

I most admire the use of Jasmine, Petitgrain, Orange/ Mandarin that make it sweet and floral

the Patchouli and Coriander offer good balance as well

Try this scent as part of your ADP collection, well worth it!",11/28/22 12:51,sukonik

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"A different take on your usual colognes that may not suit everyone. While I do love my usual cologne, I appreciate ones that take on a different route. This one opens with a blast of citruses, but it is mixed with strong ozonic notes and aldehydes. Soon after, Narcissus comes to play and adds a sweet floral note. The dry-down is mostly musk with some woody aspects and very faint patchouli.

For an EdC, the performance and sillage are so good. Overall, it is a really unique and interesting take on your typical cologne DNA. However, I recommend trying it before purchasing a full bottle.",10/22/22 06:53,OmarBlue

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"An ozonic/narcissus flower variation on the OG Colonia ( kind of gave me memories of wearing Givenchy Insensee too ). Very nice...still think Essenza and OG are more my taste but I don't hate them for providing a new flanker. Well-done.
Edit: A reviewer below me compared this to Dior Homme Sport 2021 and yes it has that same steamed and starched white shirt sort of ozonic things going. Worked well in this 70 degree day.",10/17/22 16:07,Manny44

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I have a problem with Acqua di Parma, like with most commercial fragrances apparently - but with Colonia Pura I finally understood what's wrong with AdP colonies: my skin is very acid and highlights all the ""wrong"" notes in every perfume I try. In this case, all the pleasant citrusy and flowery notes quickly disappear and all I'm left with is a very chemical, awful smell that could remind that of a cheap car fragrance.
I had to give up a LOT of fragrances for this reason, and this makes me really sad and frustrated (it happens with very expensive niche Parfums as well!).
Too bad :(",09/20/22 11:58,Acidula
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"For me this more modern version of Colonia beats the original (and Essenza), a very pleasing iteration that I am very happy to wear and smell on others. It still feels traditional but fresher and less soapy in the dry-down than I find with the original.

Out of all the Aqua Di Parma fragrances I still favour some of the Blu range (particularly Mirto, Chinotto and Bergamotto) as they feel a bit more interesting but Pura offers an excellent classic fragrance. Well worth checking out.",08/23/22 06:56,MagicBez
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The citrus in here gives off a sour smell off my skin. But I have had the same issue with light blue intense and in a lesser extent with versace pour homme. So if you have already experienced this, maybe you should expect that with colonia pura.
That being said, it is not a bad scent, it's okay even with this ""sour"" smell, because it is balanced with floral and aquatic notes. If this was mainly citrus, it would have been a problem for me, but it is not the case.

Edit : the sourness issue is fixed after about 20min, now I get a pretty interesting but easy to wear aquatic citrus along with the other notes.
Overall, it is a fresh and clean fragrance, but it is not at all generic, it still smells interesting enough for the fragrance aficionado.",08/17/22 08:38,PLK
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,This is the only aqua di parma fragrance I have tried and it has quickly become my go-to scent for the summer. Wonderful light citruses that can be worn casually but this also has a grown up element to it as well and would be great in the office too without being offensive to anyone. It can be enjoyed in the warm weather by anyone in their mid-20's and up! Very safe fragrance and decent value when purchased from a discounter too.,08/15/22 21:18,cp4044404
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This is the most ""modern"" of the Colonia flankers i have tried (I have not smelled them all). It's very fresh, airy and floral and to my nose 100% unisex. It's always nice when fragrances try a new route and do things in an unexpected way. If I had blind smelled this the first time I tried it I would never have guessed it was a AdP Colonia flanker; there is nothing of the familiar DNA in Pura.

This is a very pleasant and fresh scent for the summer but it took a little while before I could put my finger on why I didn't like to wear it as much as the other Colonias. I then figured out that it's the jasmine that puts me off from wearing Pura. I prefer to smell jasmine on women, not on myself. Pura is to jasmine heavy for my taste. I asked a few female friends to try my sample and they enjoyed Pura a good deal. It's a nice and fresh fragrance for the warm weather, but just not for me.",07/30/22 08:35,Grensfall
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Hmm, definitely the weirdest of the Colonia line I've tried yet. The added ozonic notes to the Colonia formula make me think a little bit of some kind of powdered candy from when I was a kid, maybe it was ""Fun Dip""? Either way it's surprisingly sweet and the ozonic notes behave the same way violet does in that the fragrance becomes very smooth. It's an interesting twist on the original Colonia but for me the twist doesn't pay off. It's just okay.",07/03/22 05:39,discardedandroid
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The deliciously divisive commentary below is hilarious.

Back in 2008 I wore the original Colonia when it was just creeping back onto the radar, and, to echo @Leftofcenter below also felt like Cary Grant himself when I wore it. Despite not usually being a fan of citrusy fragrances, I've always loved ADP's sharp, lemony opening, but not how it evolved on my skin.

Last summer in Rome, I tried Essenza and nearly bought a bottle, but after trying it once more in my native Paris, found it incongruous. Today, I popped into the Paris boutique and spritzed Essenza on my left arm and Pura Colonia on my right and I have to say that Pura is the more intriguing of the two, at least here. The citrus quickly let the aldehydes and ozonic notes forth and they're fascinatingly blended with the musk, to feel both fresh and salty yet cosy and skin-like all at once.

I could see how this could be too adolescent on men, but on this woman it's a wonderfully different fresh summer scent.",06/15/22 09:22,ephemeral
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Summer, Scent: 6,5/10 Opening is citrus, smells like lemon peel. Smells like Turkish kolonya. In the dry down however it gets a bit warmer, perhaps its the cedar. Silage: 3/10 Longevity: 2/10",06/07/22 15:01,SNKIOP
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura was my first ever encounter with the Colonia line from Acqua Di Parma and while it was the first that I tried and fell for, it was Colonia Essenza that I first purchased (I'll review that later, it really does deserve a piece), Pura is fresh, cool and has a really unusual metalic/ozonic quality which to me, makes it a bit more interesting.

The opening is brisk, ozonic aldehydes fizz while bergamot, mixed with orange begin to emerge, it sort of reminds me a little bit of cloudy lemonade with ice. The thing is with Pura, the ozonic notes seem to stay throughout wear, the ozone/aldehydes give the florals; jasmine and narcissus, some real pop and along with a small touch of coriander, theres an injection of extra depth. The ozonic florals lace together in the base with white musk and cedar which wraps up the entire composition beautifully, giving a freshly laundered t-shirt/just out of the shower vibe.

The longevity is good for an EdC, I get 6 hours with a moderate silage. I honestly can see this working well on women as well as men, its perfectly unisex and I think if you're looking for a scent for someone that doesn't generally like wearing scents, this could be one to try. It'll work well for the office, casual wear and I really can't wait to try this one out at the beach too. Personally, I feel due to its light nature that Pura is better reserved for the summer months and I do think that while its well made, it could be a little bit more reasonably priced.
I would repurchase, and I'm glad I got a 100ml bottle since Mr Gin also seems to like this one as well.

Contrary to one reviewer, I am not ""writing lies"" and nor am I affiliated with Acqua Di Parma, I'm just writing out what I smell and what I feel, which we are all entitled to do here.",05/28/22 11:11,GinCatsBooks

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Well, Colonia Pura is definitely a different take on the AdP barbershop genre. It both corrects some of the things I don't really like about Colonia, and introduces new oddities all its own. The word ""Pura"" might make you think this is a ""back to basics"" fragrance. Ha-ha, no, not at all. This is like a ""virtual reality"" fragrance. Interesting, but definitely not natural.

That soapiness in the original Colonia is replaced with a sort of robotic ozonic quality. It definitely smells clean, but less of a ""just showered"" clean and more of a ""just got my car detailed"" clean. There are floral components somewhere in the mix, but they are sort of mystery white floral ""accords"", as opposed to a more specific lavender scent in the original Colonia.

For me, this is a ""like"", not ""love"" fragrance. I think it smells really good, but also rather fake. It seems to tickle my throat and make me cough a bit. Not sure what component is doing that.

It's like the ""auto-tune"" version of Colonia. It can be fun, but I wouldn't want it every day, just as I wouldn't want auto-tune in every song. Acqua di Parma, feel free to use these synthetics as a tool for effect from time to time. But don't think you can replace the old ways entirely without anyone noticing.

Anyway, it's worth a look if you are into fresh, masculine, citrus, herbal (or robotic) fragrances.",03/22/22 19:24,S_Mazza
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I have read that people compare this with the original colonia. This however doesn't smell like the original. However this is a modern fresh masterpiece.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The ozonic note is really offputting to me. I bought a 100ml bottle and enjoyed it at first, but it, unfortunately, became the only fragrance I own that I dislike.

The sweetness + the ozonic note is nausea-inducing. My fiancé also felt nauseous from the scent, which is crazy to me!

I actually thought I had bad juice, but I got it with the body wash and deodorant. Since these 3 products smell the same, I am assuming the juice is not bad.

It would be great if the ozonic note was not there...

Very sad. I will sell my bottle.",12/08/21 12:56,thiagovidotto
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I love the Acqua di Parma Colonia range but there are several different variances of it so it's confusing to know which is which. Each of them are subtly different from one another but all are very nice. One of them is my favourite but I haven't tested it in a store for 3 or 4 years and can't remember which one it is! Maybe this one. Next time I get to test the range I need to make a note of it! Anyway, the one I favour is almost as beloved by me and almost rivals the now, tragically, discontinued Tuscan Soul so at some point I'm going to get myself a bottle! The Colonia range is definitely suitable for men and women, although I'm sure some women may not find them 'sexy' enough for them to wear. I'm a Gemini though so I'm more than happy to wear unisex fragrances and 'different' fragrances and, thank god, don't have a preference for stenchy, nausea inducing stink bombs!",10/18/21 12:29,Kittycat63
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Another ""meh"" from the Colonia line. The original is a weak skin scent, this is a bit better but not much. Different smell profile, more orange zest I guess, a bit deeper, woodie (prob the cedar) but they are both so weak.. and for $125 USD for 100ml, no way.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful and bright exit. Citrus and airy, bright, energizing and you already perceive that it is not the same as the other colonies in the house. A good modern but classic remake, adaptation of the master Demachy to the demands of a perhaps younger clientele.
I like it a lot because without forgetting its family DNA it is different and balanced, a magnificent fragrance for heat or temperate climates, but even in autumn it can give play.
On my skin it performs better than classic or intense, without forgetting that it is still an eau de cologne.

Would not recommend, unless you want to smell like toothpaste.

Ok, that toothpasty smell goes away in about 45 minutes, but then it smells almost the same as Colonia Essenza, but then a bit spicier. Hmm. Then it's just expensive hotel soap, which is nice, but not as a perfume!",07/21/21 09:46,Eiland

First, they don't carry it at any stores in my city and second, I heard it compared with Aqua di gio, which I have never liked.
I got a sample with another order and shortly afterwards, I bought a bottle.

Opening is fantastic. Bright realistic citruses and aldehydes. Drydown retains some citrus and adds some semi soapy creaminess with musk.. Excellent versatility. Not a great performer, but not as bad as I was expecting. Smells great on skin and clothes. I got about 4 hours sweating in brutal Texas heat.

This is also very cheap these days! I picked up 100ML tester for 40 dollars.
100% worth checking out; just know that you'll need to carry an atomizer.

Considering the allegedly poor longevity of this one, I bought the biggest bottle and was surprised by the lasting power of it.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"For hot, sunny goes at adult life, Colonia Pura is tough to beat. It doesn't smell juicy or even squishy at all to me, it smells dry and firm, unripened, but so beautiful that Colonia Pura would be worthy of buying a nice even number like 4 and leaving them on the sunny part of the counter for a few days to get into later even though they still don't seem ripe, but this Airbnb is only here a few more days and you wouldn't want to get the car all sticky in case the Colonia Puras surprised you with ripeness the second you remove them from the air conditioned accomodation. Whatever, just bite one. It's not ripe enough. Whatever, just get in there and eat it. Then you eat all 4, you remember what that much citric acid does to your esophageal tract but don't feel guilt because you're radiating citrus, granting those nearby +2 antioxidation. Colonia Pura smells like that, mixed with an authoritativeness one might not be able to back up. On me, it smells like I'm the disappointment.

I have however order it again because it is great: a twist to the original formula with more floral making it very pleasant and unisex. Not soapy (like Colonia or to some Essenza) but still retains the classic DNA.

Niche quality fragrance that if you look around is available also at good prices (even major outlets run discounts, I wouldn't trust Ebay or alike).

It is one of the best of the line and the Narcissus flower is just beautiful. If you are looking for something more masculine then Essenza or Intensa would be the best ones but as a man I still enjoy switching to this one from time to time.

A day at the beach.

That's what this fragrance embodies. It smells like a mild suntan lotion with a citrus zest;
the smell of the ocean lingering on the horizon.

Almost like a day's temperature at the beach, when this fragrance stays mild it is truly wonderful stuff. However, as the hours pass the scent intensifies and it becomes a little too much, bordering on annoying.

In my opinion, this isn't a blind buy. This is the definition of a unisex fragrance. Once the citrus notes fade away and the floral notes come to the forefront, the scent becomes quite feminine. Definitely try it out first to see if the beach life suits you.",05/02/20 13:37,LukeS
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The first time I smelled Colonia Pura I didnt like it much and, probably because I focused on its metallic dimension, I found it quite artificial. However I decided to finish my decant wearing it throughout this past week and I have to say that I have change my mind completely. Obviously the 'metal' feeling was still there but I ended founding it quite comfortable and appealing.

The smell is dominated by aldehydes and floral notes which makes it quite unisex, the citrus notes are nothing like obvious and coriander and patchouli are definitely there though measured out perfectly. The whole is bright and transparent, appropriately named Colonia Pura, and has a surprising tenacity, staying almost the whole day with you.

Disclaimer: personally I dont like colognes with so much longevity, 5-6 hours is enough for me, if I am comfortable with the scent I prefer re-aply it, too much longevity may be sometimes a bit tiresome and this is happening to me with Colonia Pura.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This is definitely unisex. As a woman, I love this scent for the summer. The orange-bergamot opening is so refreshing (perhaps a bit bitter-but I like it) in warm weather. It’s a light scent, and the projection is light; I don’t think it could cut through cold air well enough to make it a viable winter scent. I’m not sure this would be a standout for me, if I was a man. It does hold some of the generic characteristics of a men’s citrus cologne. However, it is special as a woman because our summer fragrances rarely have this cedar-woody/musky dry down. The patchouli doesn’t really show up for me, which I prefer.

For a man, perhaps good, but not great.

For a woman, a perfect summer scent.",02/26/20 07:49,my2scentsmore

It's fresh and elegant; daffodils and jasmine, with a hint of ozonic melon. The creaminess that others mention is definitely there, too. Just a truly wearable, uplifting fragrance that pulls off the trick of being both airy and persistent; one that's not so easily done. More women should give it a go.",02/11/20 06:58,Layla54

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura is an aromatic fougere. The opening is lush with aldehydes, brazen on the classic Colonia DNA of barbershop botanicals and musk. An Old World aroma—with its legendary complexity that's so easy to get lost in.

Neroli, orange flower, lavender, and vetiver—laced atop a deep, heady musk which begets the flagbearer of masculinity. Classically this was done so alongside an accord of citruses—which seem entirely missing in this formula.

Odd that the Colonia fragrance is so renowned amongst men, as I personally always had the creeping feeling that the botanical aspects were a bit uncomfortably feminine, and the citrus and musk just attempts to cover this up.

The addition of aldehydes here certainly doesn't do anything constructive for this. It blends with the floral aspects to give the fragrance an immensely greater feminine aura. The musk however is still very prevalent (and anything but feminine), so this is still not something that I could recommend for women.

Something intriguing—I noticed that the aldehydes seem to get quickly cannibalized, and don't retain their standing very long in the formula. In a fresh bottle their presence is almost overbearing throughout, but in just a little time, it's hard to detect them outside of the opening. There's only a noticeable glaze atop the oversoul of the fragrance.

Not sure what difference that makes for the orientation, but I guess that would make this a very high-maintenance fragrance to keep for whoever it might appeal to.",10/27/19 18:40,ReapThaWhirlwind
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I have been debating purchasing a decant of this for a long time. Acqua di Parma is my favorite house, but the reviews below made me hesitant. When I finally pulled the trigger and smelled it for the first time, I was surprised. This is unlike any other Colonia flanker. First, this feels like the first Colonia targeting a younger crowd. I can see anyone between 18 and 30 pulling this off really well. Of course, anyone older than that can also wear it. Secondly, this is their most mainstream, ""designer-like"" Colonia to date. Thirdly, this somehow retains the Colonia DNA. I can smell the trademark AdP citruses in this that connect it to Essenza and the OG.

It is very pleasant to wear and I think I would love wearing this in the summer heat. It's simple and elegant. Unfortunately, I already have a fragrance, Dior Homme Cologne, in this exact category of fragrances and which accomplishes the same thing. Imo, owning both would be entirely redundant, even though they don't smell the same.

If you are looking for a signature scent for the hot summer months, I highly recommend considering a citrus/musk combination. Compare AdP Colonia Pura and Dior Homme Cologne and see what you think. They're both fantastic.

EDIT: just realized that Francois Demachy is the nose of both AdP Pura and DH Cologne. Go figure.",10/10/19 07:49,agonzony

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This is what I had hoped Bvlgari's Aqva Amara or Cartier's Roadster Sport would smell like. It's an orange-driven fragrance with an aquatic, aqueous sort of sheen and a cooling herbal edge which I interpret as mint despite the fact that it's not one of the officially listed notes in the pyramid. There are some light floral qualities and that clean, bitter-soapy citrus embellishment of the petit grain, giving it a slightly formal, ""white button down,"" impression, reminiscent of more classic eau de colognes . But overall, Pura is an easy wear, and something that can be thrown on casually or feel right at home in a more dressy situation. In fact, it seems like something that would be great to wear to a summer wedding, when the the thought of dutifully sweating it out in a tux keeps you from reaching for those heavier, darker fragrances. Performance is solid, with about 5-7 hours of longevity with good projection for 3. What I enjoy about Pura is its focus on orange, which is a nice departure from the more common citrus notes--it conveys the mandarin with a confident, unapologetic presence and in turn gives it distinction. Paired with a cool, green, herbal quality resembling mint, we're left with a fragrance that is both refreshing and relaxing to wear. Thumbs up and worth sampling. For now my rating stands at 8.5/10.",06/12/19 05:18,Buysblind

Description on the sample card:
A radically fresh fragrance, delicate and bold, which embodies the most modern side of Italian lifestyle. The spicy notes of coriander are combined with the classic citrus notes of cologne.

It may not smell niche, it may not be unique, I totally agree on that. However, I feel that it's been formulated in an interesting way, as it kind of smells metrosexual to me. I can definitely see it being used by a lady as well, but it's got that feminine note that actually works on a man too. A modern re-formulation of the original Colonia, just like some say.

Love the citrusy/floral notes, of which I'm generally a big fan. It's a spring/summer fragrance only, I would say. Very fresh and clean.

To me, it smells a little spicy on the opening, but it gets very pleasing on the dry down.

Aldehydes and the Acqua Di Parma citrus; a little musk. I get a hint of white florals, a slight soapy vibe and a metallic touch. Pura smells like a modern take on the classic Acqua di Parma concept

Average projection and sillage; lasted about seven hours before becoming soft. Just fine for work and not really sexy. I'd say it's unisex leaning masculine and for hotter weather. This isn't horrible but it smells like too many designer scents out there; not very creative. The aldehydes are almost headache inducing for me.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Review of EDC:
As a long time fan of ADP and having sampled practically their entire range over the years (including soaps, shaving foam, shower gels etc.) my initial emotions after trying this were disappointment, followed by sadness and then something bordering on anger.This is a lovely scent, it just doesn't last!
I mean that sincerely, the longevity is very poor and when you consider the price of this, it's actually outrageously awful.
I'd place the original Colonia is my top 10 fragrances, even though I wear it less and less these days, it's still a scent I hold close to my heart and so I was of course, attracted to this new offering and intrigued to try it out.
I remember the days when nobody in my circle had heard of of ADP and I felt like Cary Grant himself when I wore it. Slowly but surely, the range increased and then the rate of productions progressed to the point whereby I can barely keep up (or even care to). What was once an indulgent and gratifying online purchase (i'm in UK not Italy) only to be found on the unobtainable shelves of Harrods and Selfridges suddenly became omnipresent in stores such as John Lewis, overnight ADP was a mainstream scent. So what? Now it was easier to obtain and once i'd overcome my snobbery, I could only see the positives.
Sadly, the quality and innovation seemed to drop off as I made my way through the new issues from this house. I could forgive the Blu Mediterranean range as some of them smelled nice (Mandorlo Di Sicilia for one) but they kind of left me unimpressed with their variations and longevity.Then came Oud, Leather and others in the brown bottle which i cannot recall now and they made me question the price to quality ratio for the first time. The only ADP i've found to have substantial longevity / projection are Colonia (original) Intensa, Essenza, Quercia and perhaps Assoluta, although I never gave that much of a run as i found it too feminine for my tastes and sold it on pretty quickly.
As much as I love this house, I have to admit that I don't hold it in as high regard as I once did.
I sampled Colonia Pura and Quercia at the same time and although I liked both, I loved Quercia and so plumped for that one. Rightly so I feel, as that one at least gets through a day and it a much more complex scent.Still, I couldn't resist the shower gel of Pura when I saw it at a decent price, the writing was already on the wall and I was forced to confront my denial. The shower gels have never been anything but a brief and expensive indulgence, they don't really carry any scent once out of the shower, but at least I know to expect that. Considering the retail price of Pura, i'd expected more and would never plump for a full bottle, despite the fact I like it, simply for the fact that it's not superior to the original Colonia in any way and is one of the worst performing scents from the entire range. The reviews below claiming 9 hours longevity are laughable and extremely suspect. I'm about as far from an ADP hater as could possibly be (I even considered their bathrobe at one point!) but sometimes you just have to say it like it is and put aside personal bias.This is weak..pleasant, but oh so weak.",07/06/18 01:30,Leftofscenter
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This Fragrance is very different from the other Colonia variances. It is not as powerful and explicit as the others and more just a fresh summer cologne. That is why it probably will dissatisfy a lot of ADP users.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"With each new release, Acqua di Parma is committed to producing products of lower quality each time. With the classic Cologne reformulated and a lot of pitiful launches (for me, Essenza was already pretty bad), now this? Was it really necessary?

This looks more like an Invictus fresh flanker than an AdP. Loose, synthetic, insipid. With a performance that makes the classic colony look like an oriental perfume. Little more I will comment. Yes, the price, well ...

If this is done by Paco Rabanne as flanker of Invictus, he fits perfectly and everyone who is involved in the forums of perfumes, then give him sticks.

It has about 15 initial minutes that can be pleasant, mixing citrus with a sweet / aquatic note, but the perfume dilutes absurdly and after that phase, there is hardly anything interesting, except the typical synthetic and totally generic white musk.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Pura is manifestly modern. A brilliant effervescent take on Colonia.

As expected of an AdP release, Colonia Pura opens with that typically magnificent citrus accord. Here though the citrus is light, lurid and very unlike the original Colonia; the orange and petitgrain are sharp and acidic but transparent as if carried by a cool sea breeze on a scorching day. I suspect there are aldehydes at play here, lending that transparent and slightly metallic edge to the citrus. Coriander too imparts a cool sharpness that carries through to the middle.

In the middle, Pura really comes into its own, omitting any floral/herbal similarity to Colonia. Jasmine sambac and narcissus, both typically heavy and heady, are rendered less potent as petitgrain taints them green. This green floral accord sits atop the still spicy coriander and airy aldehydes of the opening, though the aldehydes are more distinctly metallic now than before. As patchouli and cedarwood begin to form the base, white musk again lifts the composition to airy heights when it might be expected to go the other way.

Very pleasant overall. Colonia Pura manages to be fresh, sharp and natural without ever veering overtly sweet or cloying as some Colonia flankers can. This is sure to be a spring/summer staple in my wardrobe.

Longevity is moderate at 6-8 hours, sillage is moderate also.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"DNA of the original colonia, but with less flowers like rose. Pura is salty and the citruses are natural like fresh pressed limes. I also get a minty note in this one, but its not listed. It may be another green note, but the perceived smell to my nose is mint. Reminds me alot of a creation from atelier cologne actually. Or if you have tried Renaissance from Xerjoff, Pura is similar but lighter, especially on the mint note. This is sharp and crisp vs the original plus essenza which are more smooth and round with a little sweetness.

Not much more to say. Very nice sparkling citrus freshy with good quality ingredience. Actually one of the best citruses I have tried.

It's more versatile and enjoyable than classic colonia that is, in my opinion, more serious, for special occasion, not really young.
The only cons is that is not very long-lasting. But it regain strength just wetting a bit the skin with few water drops. But it's a EdC, I'm quite surprised that someone complains about that on their reviews, they should be aware of that.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Being an impulsive fraghead and a sucker for bargains, I ordered the 180ml bottle after I did a single testing from a department store and liking it. After several wearings over the weekend, I agree with philball that this is a mediocre release and with Bluslippers that there are better ones in the Colonia range than Pura (Essenza for instance).
Using 6 sprays, performance is less than 3 hours on my skin in mostly hot outdoor setting but surprisingly getting whiffs of it every now and then even after 5 hours which should be coming mainly from my clothes. What I get is a pleasant, unique enough soapy scent that leans masculine which should have been more than Ok if it actually lasted for at least 6 hours. Oh well, my only consolation is that it cost me around the same as a discounted 100ml decent designer bottle and it will serve its purpose as my first full bottle of ADP in my collection.
Will test this in an air conditioned setting these next few days and will update this review. Will do as much spray as needed to make it work. I got the 180, remember?

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"In response to Amen Corner, I tried this fragrance for the first time this week and I felt quite disappointed. To my nose, it was fairly generic; a light, nondescript citrus with a dash of spice - aimed at a younger crowd. Certainly not offensive but far from outstanding either. I would call this fragrance safe and commercial - okay for the cheaper, designer end of the market but not worth the AdP label or price.

However, what was most disappointing was the performance. Barely there once sprayed and completely gone in little over an hour. An over-priced tonic water and AdP's weakest fragrance yet. I know it's a cologne but for £100 a bottle, I really would expect more.

It's probably safe enough for a blind buy but it doesn't step far from a well-worn, mass-market appeal, path so don't expect too much. Personally, I think the new Dior Homme Sport is better than this, it certainly performs better and it's cheaper, although, even the Dior isn't anything overly special.

I was so looking forward to trying this, after seeing the note breakdown above and owning several AdP fragrances myself. Oh well, I guess that's what happens when a conglomerate gets its hands on a fine-perfume house and I shouldn't have expected anything more!

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"It starts with brief citrus. Nice. But very brief citrus. Then nothing. No original Colonia-style herbs, no lingering neroli like in Essenza. Then some weak, indeterminable florals appear. But not strongly enough. Then a dosage of 90s-style, aquatic aromachemicals, presumably the ozonic accord. One tiny step away from calone! (Eek!)

Then it's shifts to a smoother, ambroxan-type accord (or what I thought was ambroxan) but which must be the musk. It starts off a little sickly for me, to be honest, but then mellows, and aside from the fleeting citrus is the best bit.

All in all, it smells suspiciously to me like an aquatic - citrus, woods, watery aromachemicals. They could've called it Acqua di Parma Acqua or Eau Fraiche.

Unbearably unisex. No dominant floral or woods. Chance would be a fine thing. No real smell. A mere suggestion of a scent. Perhaps they're aiming for the younger man or the teenage market. It's a country mile away from 1Million though.

All they need to fully mess up their heritage is to do is a gourmand version. Yuck!

Seriously, I do worry that these guys have taken too much of an advantage of their recently (re-)found success in the market - one scent in nearly one hundred years since 1916 - and then waaay too many flankers.

I tried it from a good few sprays on one arm in John Lewis. A second visit might discover something different but I doubt something 'new'.

Anyway, when I left I sprayed Aramis on the other arm afterwards. Haha.",08/11/17 10:57,Jareth
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I wore this a few times and must say I love Colonia Pura. A perfect MODERN cologne of a high quality. A 100% Demachy style. I always praise him for this ability to catch the trend and he did it again.
Colonia Pura is a journey from the bergamote / bitter grapefruit peel to the oceanic salty molecules on a slight ambroxan base. Despite the salty elements the fragrance doesn't smell as Heeley Sel Marin or something like that; it's still of a citrusy genre and the oceanic part gives it contemporary vibe.
I emphasized the word ""modern"" as Colonia Pura nothing like the regular Colonia or Assoluta/Intensa/Essenza. So do not expect it to be a lighter version of Colonia. On other hand, Colonia Pura has been done for the generation of Le Labo Bergamote 22 lovers, that beautiful grapefruit/bergamote/ambroxan concotion. And I do find a big resemblance to Bergamote 22; a 2,5 times cheaper Bergamote 22 with salty elements added. That's a dream of those who are looking for cologne of nowadays!",08/09/17 10:51,antonpan
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This opens with a beautiful, full-bodied, zesty orange note with a dash of sweetness. I'm not sure if it's the aldehyde notes, or the sharp bergamot, but something gives the citruses in this an effervescent quality, very fizzy. It's very pleasant. The base seems to consist of light musk and florals. The citrus aspect never completely fades.

This seems to be a bright citrus in the opening, drying down to earthy florals. It's not blended quite as well as Essenza or Assoluta.

Now, it reminds me of a few fragrances, I can't put my finger on what exactly, but it's quite strongly reminiscent of Chanel Allure Homme Sport to my nose.

Main notes to my nose are orange, bergamot and petitgrain.

Longevity is about 5-6 hours with projection for 1.5 hours on my skin.

I'll keep using this and will give a more concise review down the line.

So far it's good, but not great. Smells very designer and mass market, but the performance doesn't seem quite up to scratch.",08/07/17 05:09,kelkyang
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Nor can I as a fan of Acqua di Parma. Only know this house since last year Spring. But it is already my second best house.
I don't have the original Colonia because of it's weak performances, but Essenza, Assoluta & Intensa and Bergamotto di Calabria are all in y top 10 Spring/Summer fragrances.
Mandorlo di Sicilia & Intensa are more for Fall/Winter.
So I would love to have a kind of the original if with better performances.
Since it will be launched only in September, does it mean it will not be a fresh Spring Summer fragrance like the original?
Also I would like to know who has rated this fragrance already? Would that be real connaisseurs? Professionals?",07/02/17 03:08,Louismanuel
