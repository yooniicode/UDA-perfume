Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"TWO

Not a go-to for me; this is a report after finishing a 2 ml decant. I picked it up to compare with my all-time summer favorite (Dior Homme Cologne) and a shoulder-season staple (Bergamote 22).

BdC smells great, especially if you like citrus (I do). It is less “iced lemonade” than Dior Homme Cologne and more like the whole fruit.

TL;DR: A photoreal take on an Italian citrus most of us have not smelled in person. Bright citrus-green opening that settles into a light woody-musky hush. Polite, easy, pleasant, but likely to underwhelm on performance, especially projection.

Rating:
Opening: 4.1/5
Drydown: 2.8/5
Overall: 3.5/5

Opening
Fresh-cut bergamot on a board. Knife through peel and pith, oils mist up with a green-bitter spritz. The interior is ripe enough to read a touch sweet. Sweet, acidic, and green at once. The blend is seamless; I do not see edges between the citrus, ginger, and bergamot. Together they paint a convincing bergamot portrait.

The issue: despite smelling fantastic, it lies flat on my skin. Detectable at about two feet, but it does not seem to want to be smelled. Where Dior Homme Cologne leaps off my skin, this is reticent and almost apologetic.

Heart
No distinct heart notes on me; it stays linear. At about 90 minutes I am still getting that beautiful bergamot, just closer to skin.

For a fresh scent, it is oddly dense, like the aroma is bound up in the fruit’s oil and cannot quite escape.

Drydown
The opening thins to skin level around 3-4 hours. By about 4.5 hours it is a soft, slightly creamy (benzoin?) skin-musk.

A faint musk trace sticks around 6-8 hours, but only with your nose on skin. Nice to wake up to, but no one else will notice.

Performance on me
This gets dunked on online for atrocious longevity. On me it is not atrocious, just not great. About 60-90 minutes of a modest aura, then close to skin. 3-4 hours of practical wear on skin. It is a liberal respray fragrance, and because the musky base is light, you can reapply a few times a day without issue.

Versatility
Wearable anywhere because it is so understated. That same understatement means I will not reach for it often, and it will not justify a full bottle. Too flat, too little projection.

Use cases
Patio brunch where you want to smell nice on the first hug. Business meetings where you want to be pleasant but not noticed as the cologne person. Around home when you want a quiet scent for yourself.

Vibe
Crisp white tee, rolled-sleeve linen, top down on a windy coastal road in a posh red roadster. Polished, sunny, approachable.

Blind-buy safe?
If you like citrus, yes. If you crave projection, no. This is about scent quality, not horsepower.

Comparisons
- **Dior Homme Cologne (2020):** More acidic up top, the famous iced lemonade vibe. BdC smells more like an actual fruit. DHC projects better in the first hour; BdC sits closer but can linger longer as a skin trace.
- **Bergamote 22:** Similar green-bergamot aura, but B22 is brighter from grapefruit and offers a proper second chapter with its vetiver-forward drydown.

Overall take
Bergamotto di Calabria smells wonderful up front, juicy citrus that reads like the whole fruit: bitter skin and sweet juice. It is sheer, not a statement. You will smell pleasant; people around you may not notice. The rub is not just longevity, which is average for a citrus, but the flat projection while it is there.

I like the scent, but with Bergamote 22 and Dior Homme Cologne on my shelf, it is redundant. I would love a cheaper replacement for B22, given it begs liberal resprays.

Context: Four sprays on a warm day (two wrists). Indoors in a warm room, likely less projection and a slightly longer tail. Sprayed on moisturized skin.",09/11/25 13:13,joelajackson
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,Divine lemon opening. More floral and unisex drydown but still beautiful scent. Longevity and projection are not notoriously bad as some people say but the truth is you have to overspray which is not a very big problem as you can get a big bottle relatively cheap. The only downside is that you can get some whiffs of synthetic cleaning product smell from time to time but it is not offensive. Other than that quality is great. My first aqua di Parma and given that is not the most popular i can’t wait to try more. 8/10 easy !,08/11/25 05:43,Ikg90
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Can AdP make a mediocre scent? I think not. So far Mandorlo di Sicilia is the least liked AdP I have smelled, and that is a pretty nice scent. Coming to this scent, bergamot is such a common note yet there's a lot different smelling notes. Anyway, BdC (Bergamotto di Calabria in this review, not Bleu de Chanel) is a scent I really liked. It is quite similar to Mancera Lemon Line, which too I like. The big difference is that Mancera lists lemon but no bergamot, yet smells suspiciously similar initially. The Mancera lasts longer, but the BdC smells nicer, more natual.

Now there's a host of products from insect repellents/bug sprays to floor disinfectants to room freshers that have a similar smelling perfume component so many might be put off by those less ""luxury"" oriented products having similar odor - but if you're willing to see, or smell, past that, this BdC is a beautiful scent.

Longevity is okayish being an EDT concentration scent. Projects well initially, but seems like a skin scent in 2 hrs or less, nothing unusual as that's the case with most EDTs/EDPs from the past 20 years or so.",07/27/25 09:32,Icyspicy
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Today, I'm diving into the final sample I possess from Acqua di Parma's Blu Mediterraneo collection: Bergamotto di Calabria. Based purely on its name, I'm anticipating that bergamot will be the undeniable star of this olfactory journey. While I certainly appreciate bergamot—it's a widely utilized note for very good reason—it's not typically a note I actively seek out in fragrances I ultimately acquire. However, with it poised as the focal point here, I'm hoping for a truly exceptional representation of the note. Will this offering surpass my experience with yesterday's Arancia di Capri? Let's get into it and find out.


Opening:
The opening is a luminous burst of radiant citrus, crisp spiciness, and invigorating freshness. The primary notes that immediately greet my senses are bergamot, citron, ginger, and musk. Bergamot and citron are the undeniable protagonists. The bergamot, as one might instinctively imagine, is the commanding presence in this initial accord. It delivers a citrus vibrancy, underscored by that hallmark aromatic spiciness one expects from a bergamot note, though perhaps not quite as pronounced as some other iterations I've encountered. Following closely is the citron, which amplifies the citrus with a distinctly brighter and zestier character, also carrying with it a subtle hint of rindiness. Next, ginger and musk join the composition. The ginger presents itself as a fresh and invigorating spicy accord, artfully counterbalancing the abundance of citrus-forward notes. Lastly, a whisper of musk lingers in the background, offering a fresh, almost fuzzy tonality, reminiscent of that clean ""fresh laundry"" essence musk can sometimes possess.


Dry Down:
The dry down continues the journey, evolving into a composition that is still predominantly citrusy, distinctly aromatic, and gently woody. The primary notes I discern are bergamot, citron, vetiver, and musk. Bergamot and citron remain the highlights in the dry down. The bergamot still commands attention, retaining its core citrusy accord, but it has become noticeably more aromatic and spicy than it was in the opening. The citron continues its supportive role to the bergamot, offering the same bright and zesty citrus quality, though it now feels rounder and smoother than in its initial presentation. This enduring citrus heart is then joined by vetiver and musk. The vetiver subtly emerges in the dry down, providing a delicate woodiness, beautifully accentuated by a hint of that ""fresh grass"" accord that vetiver notes sometimes carry. Lastly, the musk continues to provide a touch of clean freshness in the background, echoing its presence from the opening.


Performance:
The initial projection is moderate to strong, extending its aura approximately three to four feet. Sillage mirrors this, leaving a scent trail that is certainly noticeable but never overpowering. However, by the three-hour mark, the fragrance had largely receded to a mere whisper on the skin. There was a faint, almost ethereal projection and scent trail, but not enough to truly register.


When to Wear:
Bergamotto di Calabria, as its character suggests, is undeniably a spring and summer fragrance, ideally suited for daytime wear. It possesses an effortless, easy-going vibe, making it a perfect companion for casual outings, any activity enjoyed under the sun, or even a refreshing choice for the gym. Due to that casual nature, I wouldn't consider it appropriate for anything formal or for typical office wear, where a more refined presence might be desired.


Blind Buy:
If you are a devoted admirer of bergamot or simply appreciate bright and invigorating fresh fragrances in general, Bergamotto di Calabria would certainly be worth exploring. Just bear in mind that its fleeting nature means you'll likely need to reapply it if you wish to enjoy its charms throughout the day.


Final Verdict:
What can I truly say about Bergamotto di Calabria? It was, without a doubt, a fresh and vibrant fragrance, with an emphasis on its namesake note. As I've expressed before, bergamot isn't a note that consistently sends me into raptures, and I honestly don't feel that the bergamot in this particular fragrance did anything radically different or groundbreaking compared to other iterations I've encountered. It smells undeniably pleasant, yet it offers nothing particularly special or memorable. My significant disappointment, however, stems from the fact that this fragrance suffers from the exact same Achilles' heel that plagued Arancia di Capri: its performance is notably lackluster. By the time I truly settled in to appreciate the nuances of its dry down, it had already receded to a mere whisper on the skin, making it challenging to discern the individual notes. At least Arancia di Capri, despite its brevity, left me with a truly captivating opening. Needless to say, this is not a fragrance I will be considering for a full bottle purchase. Next on my agenda is the celebrated Colonia line from Acqua Di Parma. It's a collection that enjoys considerable recognition and discussion, and I am earnestly hoping it leaves a more impactful and lasting impression than my experiences with the Blu Mediterraneo line have.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I absolutely love the opening as it is an incredibly well done citrus/bergomot opening. If it could just stay that way it would be phenominal. As it starts drying down, those wonderful notes give way to a flowery bouquet and ginger and gets incredibly weaker fast. I don't know if my skin hates this or what but all but disappears within an hour or two.",04/28/25 22:56,Killsocket
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"One of the best smelling fragrances and best bergamot scent ever. There is always a trade off with natural smelling notes and performance. Being the best smelling scent in its category will have the obvious trade off of non-beast performance.

That said I believe most people go nose blind to fragrances early on, it doesnt last ""30 minutes"". I get 6 hours of a soft projecting heavenly scent.

Generally speaking natural notes have weak performance, it has to be enhanced by synthetics which will change the scent so its a compromising battle between the 2.

I own many ADP frags (more than any other house) and I do so for their scents (which I think is the best smell to cost ratio)",04/04/25 04:44,arsenal01

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"10 minutes of heavenly citrus experience which somehow I find to be zingy, fizzy, almost boozy tonic-like! Which is surprisingly pleasant... only to fade rather quick and turn to become more fresh-spicy, ginger-focused average cologne, that is somewhat uninspiring.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,This is my go-to summer scent! It's so fresh and bright thanks to the bergamot and citron. The ginger adds a subtle kick that makes it really interesting.,12/19/24 12:22,Riya2
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I have such an ambivalent feeling about this one it's even hard to explain. Lemon and bergamot are in my top 5 notes as I simply love citrus smell, with this one in the opening you get a Mike Tyson KO, jaw-breaking punch of both, it's beautiful.

It starts to dry down and that's where it disappoints a little, the citrus is barely there, flowers kick in with a hint of cedar and ginger. It goes from mascilune/unisex to unisex/female fragrance at this point.

My problem is, you put a bergamot in a name of the fragrance and you get a minute of it, I think the more fitting name would be 'Fiori di Calabresi'. The second thing I noticed, at one point between citrus punch turning into flowery base it smelled like lemon diswashing gel, I think this is why people say it smells 'generic' and 'chemical', it's just a brief moment but you notice it.

It's weak with intimate sillage, it's overpriced, I could get better ones for less value...



...but somehow, I still like it!",11/03/24 04:27,kaju23
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Nice, but underwhelming. I’m surprised at how simplistic this is, given the complexity of Fico di Almalfi. I was expecting the same sort of brilliance in blending.

Opening is a bright citrus with a touch of ginger; it reminds me of this lemongrass soap I have. Very pleasant, but as a personal fragrance, kind of “meh.” The citrus disappears quickly, and I’m left with a fresh, woody floral. Again, lovely, but nothing really unique to set it apart from similar fragrances. Eventually the fragrance dries down to a skin scent.

Performance is abysmal. Stays very close to the skin, and lasts no more than a couple of hours.

This is something I’d gladly wear if I received it as a gift, but definitely wouldn’t spend money on an FB myself.",10/05/24 00:12,Jadelynn
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Perfect vacay scent, love the smell and the ginger note is the star of the show imo (makes it “spritzy”). People are complaining about the longevity, but I couldn’t be boterhed less, the perfect blend between green fresh and sweet fresh and it reminds of the vacays on Sardinia (Italy). This is the best from the blue line imo because it’s actually a freshie and not to sweet like fico di Amalfi and the orange one (forgot the name).",09/17/24 03:22,gustavseng
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"the whole house does italian citrus style like no other. the bergamot here is so lovely.

i agree with the longevity however this is misunderstood as pointed out. stop calling things ''generic''. just a dumb lazy buzz word at this point. like what exactly is generic about it? its a citrus scent, we know. but after you go thru 100 fragrances you might just end up with 3 to 4 with a take on bergamot exactly like this. the note was always a top note. but you are able to enjoy that top note for longer than you usually would albeit it doesn't have any complexity or longevity. it does what it does in the name. try to look past that. fragrances like this have a place in the world. they're meant to give this feeling of refreshment that heavier compositions cannot offer you. even if it was slightly based out more. it wouldn't give you that ultra fresh feeling. these southern italian's know their climate.

it's for when the sun is trying to burn you alive. it cools you down. the heat will give a scent bubble that will come to life and soothe you like angels flapping their wings on you!

but no i 100% get it. it's not worth the money just for that. the blu line are perfect gym scents tho. because of the poor longevity and scent profile. it will make you stand out in that environment like nothing else. and it'll be so comfortable to wear for you and those around during your 1-2 hour work out. the right tool for the job!",09/02/24 11:07,fragrantlyenhanced

If you've smelled other scents in the Blu Mediterraneo line, it might feel familiar. There’s some cedarwood, vetiver, and musk for warmth, but it sticks to the usual citrus vibe.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"After having this on my wishlist for a VERY long time, I finally bought this but unfortunately am somewhat disappointed.
First off, I got a 30ml bottle and I hate it. Instead if having the proportions of the larger bottle, it is kindof tall and narrow and abit disappointing. Even the small samples in the discovery kit are the same kindof wider proportion so I don't get it. Anyway, not that important if the fragrance actually performed.
So the fragrance is really nice, I mostly get the bergamot and ginger notes on my skin. It is PERFECT for summer, so refreshing, I tested it out on a hot day in Sicily. However, the performance is where this falls short. It has near to zero projection, pretty much turns into a skin scent after 10 minutes, and I cannot smell it any more after pretty much 1 hour. How they charge such extortionate prices for such disappointing performance is beyond me. It's a pity as I really really REALLY think that if this has more sillage and better lasting power, it would be my go to summer scent. Worth the money? No, I don't think so.
I currently have Mirto di Panarea from the same collection as a tester and will be testing it out soon as apparently it has better staying power, will have to see, but for now I am surely done buying from this range. My next freshie to try shall be Pomelo Riviera from Atelier des Ors.

EDIT: I am trying this again on a hot day (I believe it's like 30degC) and I OVERSPRAYED a little. I am about 1 hour in and I still smell it on me and do not feel the need to reapply. If this can do at least 3 hours I will be much happier, I am ok with reapplying especially since citrus fragrances in general do not last.",05/24/24 03:43,martinaazz

This combination gives the fresheness and the zest with a slight sweetness required from happily starting your day for 20-30 minutes- i really hoped if it can stay more longer than this on clothes- then it becomes a skin scent due to Musk and disappering.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"We are in the midst of a heatwave here in Ireland, so I sprayed this at a department store on a hot day. There is a wide range in the Blu Mediterraneo collection, and I suspect that they are all freshies of some description. I picked this one up at random. Bergamotto di Calabria is a straightforward citrus cologne with a woody-spicy base. It is simple and traditional in structure, perfectly unisex and serves its purpose well - it is very refreshing. However, it is also very fleeting.

BMBdC opens with a radiant citrus accord, zesty and fresh. It is aptly named - bergamot is the dominant note, but there is a hint of lemon. I get a hint of spice, and a soft woodiness emerges as it fades. It develops and fades to nothing extremely quickly though - it is one of the most ephemeral scents I've come across. Sillage is intimate and longevity is very weak.

Pleasant but pretty generic, this is let down by its abysmal performance, and is overpriced for what it is despite not being too expensive. Just buy a big bottle of 4711 EDC instead and be done with it. 2/5.",09/07/23 12:58,Enrium

Fleeting, ephemeral, evanescent, fugitive, momentary, transient, transitory, passing so quickly as to make apprehending it difficult. Translation: The performance totally sucks. Seriously. It won't last long enough for you to tie your tie. I've long since learned reviewers on here really tend to overrate the fragrances. Everyone who gave this lemon water a higher rating than 2.00 would probably give five stars to a bottle of BODman. Are you kidding me? The performance here is ""Yachtman"" bad, but at least with those scents you're only out like $5.95. I have now tried every AdP ""Blu Mediterraneo"" scent and I'll save you time. ""Blu Mediterraneo Mandorlo Di Sicilia"" isn't a complete waste of money. But you can go on Gift Express, sort on price, buy any scent that's under $10, I guarantee the performance will be as good or better than this Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto. Adidas, Jaguar, Cuba Paris.

Can't detect florals or the cedar. Surprisingly, I get wafts of it during the day and in the gym, but it is as faint as it gets. Safe to overspray as it is so light and borderline undetectable, but in the end it settles for a nice lemon-candy-esque smell. I also get whiffs of lime every now and then.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I own, if not all, then almost all, the Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo line of fragrances and this one has become my favorite of the bunch. Reasonable projection (sillage) for a citrus, especially in the first 30-60 minutes––at least this seems to be the case for me in warm weather, as summer is the only season I've had the opportunity to wear it in so far. An invigorating citrus, though subtly, artfully tweaked by just the right balance of just the right selection of secondary, underlying scents (e.g., ginger, cedar, floral). To my mind, this arguably makes it something of a minor masterpiece. One way I enjoy it is applying it in the last couple hours of my late night work shift on top of almost anything I put on earlier that day, which, by that point, is pretty far into the drydown stage.

[Side note: When it comes to longevity, citrus scents are typically weak, and often very weak. It just comes with the territory. If you're buying a citrus fragrance––any citrus fragrance––don't do so for longevity. The easy solution, however, is just reapply every couple hours and enjoy that just-like-the-first-time application all over again.]",08/16/22 21:36,MidwesternGothic

You have to spray around 5 times though, and have an undamaged sense of smell to get to enjoy this lovely smell for a long while.

I have read quite a lot of reviews of perfumes I own myself where people complain that it's gone in an hour when my experience is quite different, which makes me wonder; could it be that some people are so used to strong and in-your-face synthetic scents (like for example Invictus, the smell of that literally makes me sick) that their noses get damaged to the point where they simply can't smell softer and - in my view - lovelier scents like this one.

I own and have smelled lots of citrus fragrances, and this is one of the best and most natural I've ever smelled.

The only way this makes sense is if you get a BIG bottle and you get it for cheap. I paid 50$ for 5 ounces. You will need an atomizer to carry in your pocket or purse.

I think of this like an Italian Sports car.
It's not practical, it's got no room for groceries, it gets terrible gas mileage, and it breaks all the time.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"My absolute favorite ADP. This one is all about the beautiful lemony, musky, powdery, soapy dry down that is so warm and clean. Although I wouldn't describe it as gourmand it does very much remind me of a creamy lemon sherbet. It’s the kind of smell that just feels soft and comfortable. Everyone complains about longevity but I find a few extra sprays gets the job done nicely. But yes, it's certainly not the best performance and I do wish it was stronger.",07/14/21 20:19,PapaTLooch
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I live in Atlanta, and this is perfect for the VERY humid and sticky summer here. It does EXACTLY what I want, and while many others criticize it, what they find to be vices, I consider to be virtues.

I have moved almost exclusively to niche fragrances, and to my nose, this doesn't smell like ANY of the designer fragrances out there. It has the best, most NATURAL citrus scent I have EVER smelled (and I am 60 yrs old). Here in Atlanta in the summertime, the morning may start out cool to warm, but by afternoon the weather has changed to humid and hot. When the air itself feels like an extra layer of clothing, I want zero scent, it's just not needed. So with this, I spray on my neck and back of my head, then when I get dressed I spray more on my shirt (upper chest, shoulders), and yes it does move to a skin scent within a few hours, which is what I wanted as the day gets warmer, and what remains on my shirt hangs around and informs the rest of the day. So while others don't like the way it performs, I love it. The smell is very fresh and light, perfect for humid days.

If you're hesitant, get a sample, but honestly, this is a really great citrus scent for morning, office or casual environments.",06/24/21 13:42,Gabriél_de_ATL

the opening as expected is citrusy bergamot with notes of woodiness and slightly herbaceous. If you like Aesop Tacit, you might like this for some days when you want something more breezy and easygoing. Wears well in hot climate, doesn't turn acidic on my skin. It's a no-brainer inoffensive fragrance, so I usually pack this for my business trips.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Squeezed bergamot

This is not just the oil from inside of a bergamot. It's the whole fruit plus it's leaves and even the tree itself. The sourness and bitterness from the green leaves and bergamot is obvious.
After an hour flowers, musk and cedar goes hand in hand to fill the place of bergamot and citron and make the perfume a bit sweet and deep.
Unfortunately (for me) it has a soapy cleanness which I think was not necessary and because of this feature I think there is an unnecessary pumped up sweetness to this fragrance which could be more toned down and it could lead to a more natural scented fragrance.

It's suitable for every and each occasion in summer and spring. It doesnt last long but it is enough and the sillage is normal and acceptable for such a fragrance.

A nice zing from the bergamot and citron with the ginger and woody notes peeking through. This is favorite type of citrus fragrance. However, like everyone else has stated, the last power is pretty abysmal. It lasts about an hour on me and that is with multiple sprays (six or seven). I was willing to pay $105 for the 50ml bottle but even that was a stretch since the fragrance is so short-lived. Well, the fragrance has apparently gone up $15 since I bought it two summers ago. No way in heck am I paying $120 for a fragrance that lasts one hour, no matter how awesome it smells. ADP needs to get their heads out of their rears.

The opening was so good that I decided to give it a second try. This time it was warmer outside. I got only slightly better performance - again less than an hour!

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Took this perfume with me on my holiday to the south of France as my only scent for 2 weeks.
Absolutely the most beautiful bergamot fragrance I've ever smelled. Such a shame that it doesn't last at all!

It does have some projection the first 15-30 minutes but after that, it gets really close to the skin.
You will have to overspray this before anyone else with notice you got anything on. Sprayed 10 times one day before a road trip and it didn't clog up the whole cabin. Actually had my family in the car and for any other fragrance they would have kicked me out for having to much on, but this time they didn't even say anything about it. And that should tell you more about the poor performance than the smell.

Won't be buying a new bottle after my 30ml runs out... and it will soon, as I need to use so goddamn many sprays every time, just for it to perform a little.

EDIT: Finished the bottle as we had some warm days here in the late spring. I can not stress enough how good I think the smell is. It also performs a little better when it's not super hot outside... But it still sits very close to the skin.",08/15/19 14:14,SebastianSmellsGreat

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Nice bergamot, realistic. As for the smell, this one is very unisex, round. Unfortunately I confirm it has poor performance, unacceptable for the price it retails. (a simple summer days eau de cologne shouldn't cost more than $50 for 100ml at online discounters)

For these reasons, I cannot recommend this one, and for a more masculine take on bergamot and a big step-up in terms of quality and performance, I would suggest to go for Zegna Italian Bergamot (the new EDP, not the discontinued EDT). Obviously, it's also a step up in terms of pricing, but with a bit of patience, it will show up in 1-2 years at discounters.

If you don't have patience, I would suggest to go for Zegna Acqua di Bergamotto or Guerlain AA Bergamote Calabria instead, which both do the same job (with similar poor performance) and both currently retails around $30-40 for a large bottle online.

For a more feminine take on Bergamot, I cannot recommend enough Atelier Cologne Bergamote Soleil.

In summary, AdP Bergamotto di Calabria: good, but overpriced compared to the competition given what it delivers. A pass for me.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Treat this like an eau de cologne and you may not be as disappointed as you otherwise would have been. It is bright, happy and juicy. Quality is there but you have to weigh the pros and cons.

Pro: As a lover of bergamot it hits the spot. It's the only citrus scent I crave more of and want to repurchase a bottle of, nothing else delivers on the promise of fresh, happy, bright citrus like this.

Con: The bottle goes very fast as a result of poor projection and longevity. I used up a full 75 ml bottle in under a year, which is unheard of seeing as most of its play was seen during summer. It needs to be sprayed at least 6 times per use to be worth while. Reapplication is necessary throughout the day.

Pro: Quality ingredients and natural scent, it is such a pleasure to wear. It's not piercing or synthetic like other citruses can be. It's light enough and perfect for high heat. Love the bottles too.

I adore this fragrance. I wish it stuck around longer, but I trust Acqua Di Parma know what they're doing. Compared to other brands who push edc's for roughly the same price, Acqua Di Parma is winning in my books. They're a classy brand who don't rely on bells and whistles to sell their products, they just make good perfume on the basis of quality and simplicity. I'm a big fan.",03/22/19 16:37,Swedelish

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"This is a citrus bomb on my skin with a hint of ginger but no other notes. It lasts in cold weather (50 degrees) at least 6 hours on my extremely dry skin and has a nice scent trail for several hours. I live in the Arizona desert so it is hot most of the year here. I’m unsure how this fragrance does above 90 degrees but I bought it in November when we were still in 90s and it lasted about 4 hours as strong skin scent. I love it! I plan to buy the lotion and shower gel to increase time it lasts. Not sure why other reviewers had bad luck with it.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria is a citrus aromatic. It projects with a stingy zesty citrus accord, between bergamot and citron. It's awakening, invigorating, and has a touch of candy-like sweetness to it. Not sure what the concentration here is, but the aroma dies down hard after the opening, and shortly after is very hard to pick up (unless presumably you have a virgin nose).

I think this one had so much more potential for greatness, but possibly Acqua di Parma is playing hard ball here, and doesn't wish to cater to the underlying problems of people. Instead, they might be taking a page out of Ralph Lauren's book, and are seeking to force people into finding a more effective solution for their problems (in the sense of some olfactory rejuvenation therapy). Although the formula here is a bit simple and linear, the fragrance is so good that it would probably be well worth the effort. That's just the classic style of Italian cologne.

You could always bathe in it I guess, but not sure how popular that's going to make you with all those sensitive noses out there amongst the crowd. I really enjoy this one for its style and flare, and would suggest just wearing it on the skin, so that you can freshen up regularly without it becoming overbearing to anyone.",12/10/18 00:28,ReapThaWhirlwind
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Citrus fizzle. Looks like it's unanimous then - I smelled this without reading any of the reviews here and had exactly the same experience.

Puts a smile on your face and makes you think of clear blue skies. Perfectly unisex, utterly charming. And this after I've had a string of failures with other AdPs which looked great on paper but turned too cheap / butch / aftershave-y to work on my female skin.

Drawback: lasts for an hour, at most. Aaaargh! Che fiasco! In a perfect universe maybe I'd buy a one-litre bucket of this and spritz myself with it hourly. In this one, AdP have scored an own goal making Bergamotto di Calabria, because it's persuaded me I really need a bergamot perfume for summer 2019 and I want to explore the note further, but I know for sure I won't be paying out for AdP's take on it.",11/01/18 16:40,trabuquera

Absurd, and I was so expensive. I am really pissed off for wasting my birthday money on this . If I was the perfumerer who creates this , I'd be embarrassed . Seriously, not even worth $20, as for what I paid for it is simply obscene . $156 Ripoff. I am never buying another Blue Mediterraneo Edt, Never.
That being said, the smell, when you can actually smell it, it's the most natural lime and bergamotte you could dream of. I have a bottle of essential bergamotte oil next to me, they are very similar. Except that the oil was one tenth of the price of the perfume. So I guess I'll need to mix this edt with some essential oil and hope it becomes strong .... what a pity. It could have been the perfect summer fragrance . And keep in mind that I usually prefer not so strong fragrances.
My recommendation ? Don't buy . I did and I regret it. Swap anyone ? 150 ml bottle, with box, booklet, everything .",05/27/17 06:35,Happyme2009

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamot üzerine konumlanmış bir parfümün Türkiye de işi zor. Bizler limon kolonyası ile büyümüş bir nesiliz.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"If only this (and many others from this house) worked on my skin, I'd be a very happy man.
I get very little from this beautiful fragrance. Very little at all. Spray, sniff - gone!

It's a recurring annoyance for me with the house of Acqua di Parma. Classy and wonderful as most of them that I've tried are, I am always left feeling somewhat disappointed.
I love the smells but the strength is wasted on me.

I have tried all the Blu Mediterraneo collection and (most of the) Colonia collection too and none of them last more than an hour on my skin giving me practically no projection / sillage. I mean, like nothing.

Sure, I get the amazing smells and adorable flavours they permit but they are nothing more than a skin scent on me. Maybe it's my DNA, although I have seen other similar comments.

It's for those reasons that I find them far too expensive and over-priced for what they offer you as a buyer. I've spent a small fortune buying some of these fragrances but sadly, I simply can't afford to justify making the same mistake again.

Yes, I know many people will strongly disagree with me and mention that we shouldn't expect all fragrances to be powerhouses, sending passers-by into an olfactory frenzy; but I definitely want something more to show for my money than what Acqua di Parma have offered me to date.

Yes the performance is certainly not the best, but this is one of those rare moments for me when the overall effect of the fragrance makes up for it's performance woes IMO.

It does remind me slightly of Sel de Vetiver but only briefly. It also reminds me of Dior Homme Cologne to some extent, but it is better to my nose than the Dior. It reminds me of many fragrances in part, however none capture the magic that this possesses for me.

This is what I might have imagined Grace Kelly to waft of in ""To Catch a Thief"", though I realize the movie was in Nice.

I realize there are a million versions of this type of fragrance, but this for me is very, very special. It is the best of summer in a bottle.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria has a pleasant citrusy opening that rapidly adds a spicy soapy component. The dry down, which develops quickly, is all about the ginger, bolstered by hints of cedar, musk, and benzoin. If you like ginger this fragrance might be for you, but be advised you're going to have to reapply it a lot: the longevity is very short. Very. I wanted to like BdC--I generally like all the notes that go into its formulation--but, at least on my skin, it really doesn't work.

Sitting on the beach, with a fruity drink in super hot weather is the picture this gives me. This definitely leans towards the masculine side.

The staying power is horrendous, which i am assuming is due to the bright opening which never really goes away. I'm not sure how anyone can justify paying the price of this fragrance for such lame longevity.

I will say if it lasted longer and has better performance, I would have to give in and buy it.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria is a very pleasant citron scent with some bergamot and lime which sits next to the skin. As the lemony notes mostly fade away after an hour or two, it becomes a very gentle woody musk. It's very delicate but it does last quite a long time, around 6 or 7 hours before it starts to vanish properly off the skin.

Bergamotto di Calabria is the nicest of the Blu Med range by far. It's flexible in that it works day or night and any time of year and for any occasion. I like the bottle and the packaging too. However, I do think it is overpriced. The Blu Med range feels more like a marketing gimmick by AdP to get the cash registers ringing. The revivification of the company in the last twenty years has led to lots of new lines but very little of genuine top class merit for the money. BdC is a genuine unisex perfume and you could use it straight out the shower, getting back from work, going to bed, just about anything you want that relies on subtlety and discretion. If you want to make an impression or just smell your perfume after an hour, then it's not the one.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria is a straightforward lemon and bergamot fragrance on me. The citrus is aromatic and gently sweetened. The presence of cedar renders the scent a powdery woody texture, while the ginger brings a subtle cool, crystalline feeling to the citrus.

The sillage is soft and the longevity is around 6 hours.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Amazing..!! The Acqua di Parma line is incredible and a “best kept secret” for fragrance perfumers…

I was reminded this morning of the clean and fresh feeling of wearing Acqua di Parma’s, Bergamotto di Calabria. This juice is good..!! Out of the bottle, you get the initial blast of bergamot notes followed by the dry-down into an extraordinary blend of citrus, ginger, green, and a whisper of vetiver notes. Somehow, I have managed to accumulate nine (9) of the Acqua Di Parma fragrances – each unique and amazing in their own identity, but all share a common citrus DNA. While Bergamotto di Calabria (BdC) is geared toward Spring and Summer wear, it does offer great flexibility during this timeframe – from casual outings to more formal events. I find that BdC lingers close to the body and unfortunately, last only about four (4) hours on me and clothing. But during that 4 hour window – whoa, this juice is good stuff.. Given the brevity and low sillage of the fragrance, I would suggest that BdC is “office safe” and will add that based on the note composition, BdC is totally unisex.

My final tally for Bergamotto di Calabria is 4.0 stars out of 5.0 stars. It is classy, refined, and will leave the wearer feeling clean and fresh. If this fragrance only had greater staying power, definitely a Top 5 fragrance. Based on my increased confidence level while wearing today, BdC comes with a solid recommendation to add to your collection and is a definite “love” in the fragrance community…

Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…",06/22/15 15:05,OCNBreeze7
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria embraces the semi-bitterness of the eponymous bergamot note, which stands out above all else and is mainly paired with a musk base.

I haven't tried many fragrances that rely solely on bergamot, not coupling it with another citrus or top note, but this is almost a refreshlingy bitter take on a citrus-heavy fragrance. Its opening only is slightly saltier and more acidic than its dry down. Longevity and projection are on par with most other ADP fragrances, good but not great.

Most reviews cite similarities to Dior Homme so I'd have to try that to compare, but as it stands, this is a pleasant warm weather day fragrance. Still debatable if it merits the Acqua di Parma price, cheaper designer options notwithstanding, but something that I imagine most men and some women could pull off in the summer especially. I probably wouldn't opt to buy this as I get a similar-enough experience from the cheap, grapefruit-based Elixir White by C.O. Bigelow, but some may find ADP BdC more compelling.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"A somewhat one note fragrance, this hesperidic offering from Acqua di Parma is definitely bright and cheerful. Intense citrus facets of bergamot are further amplified by citron, beautifully capturing both the sour and bitter notes found in the freshly peeled rind and pith of each. Unfortunately, this is all that one can appreciate, as the accompanying notes are so far relegated to the background as to be nonexistent. I am only able to note subtle nuances of ginger far into the dry down, which does pair nicely with the intense citrus. Rose and cedar are lost on me. Lastly, barely perceptible vetiver (here capturing its lemony and woody facets) is noted several minutes after applying. Like most other citrus based fragrances, its tenacity and sillage are weak. I prefer Creed's Neroli Sauvage over this. (147)",07/17/14 19:47,jhitt793

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I'm not sure if this is a summer scent or a balmy fall scent. Why not both, I suppose. It sort of lacks the cooling effect one would want during the summer to balm the skin and soul of oppressive heat, but it is still very fresh and invigorating. Monsieur Duchaufour has done a masterful job of creating a cypress accord that lasts quite a long time, throughout most of the life of the fragrance - a tricky feat for sure since cypress and pine notes have a tendency to disappear quite quickly. He accomplishes this by showing the different facets of cypress through each evolutionary step of the perfume. In the opening notes there is a beautiful mélange of herbs - notably rosemary, basil, and sage - combined with grapefruit that together delivers the very green herbal and also somewhat astringent and sulfuric qualities of cypress. After these dry down, which happens quite quickly, we're onto a more floral and spicy heart of jasmine and white florals, lavender, and coriander and cardamom, which together deliver the softer and drier side of cypress; the indolic jasmine and white florals give a smooth and fragrant feel, the lavender an aromatic and herbaceous lift, and the coriander and cardamom the spicy and resinous qualities. Just superb. By the time you are able to pick out what is going on in the heart, the base ingredients pick up their instruments and begin playing their notes of real cypress and pine oils, spicy cedar, and bright and earthy patchouli, oakmoss, and vetiver - the real deals in what would and should be a cypress/pine-forward perfume. High quality materials in the deft hands of a technical master is very nearly always a sure thing for a great perfume, and CdT is no exception. It gives this tremendous and evocative feeling that I've spent an entire day in a Tuscan cypress forest condensed to a matter of a few hours. The beautiful, cool, and dew-soaked morning when the sun first starts to evaporate the water from the cypress trees and the air, the wet herbs and earth taking their last big drink of the day, and the light begins coaxing the trees to life; the warm afternoon when the growing heat of the day encourages the cypress trees and wildflowers to begin releasing their oils; and finally the beginning of the evening, after the heat has been its most oppressive, the aromatics of the hot trees and the warmed earth have given all that they have to give and all start winding down to the cool evening preparing to do it all again tomorrow. Maybe I'm aggrandizing this perfume a bit; I've always had a big soft spot for green perfumes centering around cypress, pine or the like - so a beautifully executed perfume like CdT is going to be an easy win for me. I can live with my bias, and I can certainly live the rest of my days with this perfume.",06/06/25 10:09,Nathan86
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"The Acqua di Parma line is new to me, having only recently sampled some of the cologne and EDT/EDP offerings, and overall it does feel like the ingredients are natural and high quality. Cipresso di Toscana is probably my favorite in the AdP lineup (I've still to sample the entire range). I liked Mirto di Panarea as well, which was my top choice from this house until today when I sampled CdT. CdT to my nose, has a dark/smoky tinge probably from the pine or cypress (not sure which, some other pine scents don't have the same smokiness) that reminds me of Mon Vetiver by Essential Parfums.
Overall, the scent is a 9/10, but the longevity and projection do fall short, which being an EDC, might not surprise anyone but I do kind of expect better performance if the prices are more like EDTs and EDPs.",05/31/25 08:58,Icyspicy

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Described in one word: Crispy. I'm a big fan of fresh, summer ready fragrances that achieve light, invigorating profiles without relying heavily on the usual notes. Think citrus, colone, ambroxan, aquatic notes etc.

Cipresso di Toscana achieves freshness using tricks from the past, while managing to stay current enough. Freshness in the classical sense. Herbs, conifers, flowers, a freshness that is inspired by nature. I think this almost certainly features aromachemicals, but the overall feel and impression is a natural one. Seems like Acqua di Parma pulls this off pretty well across their line.

While it opens up with a piercing barbershop sharpness similar to Cerruti 1881, it quickly settles into a crispy green and invigorating heart that smooths out quickly. The cypress is there along with some other snappy green nuances, a little spice, and very blended floral lightness that exists without my nose picking up any obvious jasmine, lavender, or lily of the valley that's listed. If you despise flowers in your fragrance, the floral notes here shouldn't be a problem. I think they just provide a little lift and give an impression of ""fresh air through the trees"".

As it further dries down Cipresso reveals some of the slightly warmer base notes which maintain the natural theme. It does have a very slight hint of shaving cream, barbershop vibe in the base as well, but nothing like Azzaro PH or Drakkar. Also much sharper, and lighter in feeling than something like Z-14, which I like but reminds me of wood panel office parks in the 70s/80s. My gripe with some of older classic is they can feel muddy or dark brown in color, but Cipresso maintains a uplifting green presence. It doesn't scream 80's or Dad's aftershave to me, but then again I am a dad to-be in my 30s. So, take that with a grain of salt.

The base is very long lasting and warms up and darkens slightly, and sticks around as a closer to skin scent for a good 12 hours. The heart notes stick around too if you get some on fabric or your shirt collar. I think performance gripes here are a bit overstated, if you can make peace with the low to medium projecting scent. This is one of those weird ones that seems to wax and wane throughout the day, and almost gain strength as it sits on skin. I'll lose the scent sitting in place, but catch whiffs as I move through spaces or get active. I think any addition of fixatives would change this scent, and I'd much rather have this light and crisp profile than to have it end up a chemical mess on dry down.

In summary, I highly recommend this for fans of classic men's fragrances with a more natural and (slightly) updated feel. Cipresso is a bit more sober and serious. Yet the coniferous, gently spicy, and green notes give it a casual side that lends to evening and weekend wear as well. More versatile than some purely summer fragrances for these notes and the warmer/darker base notes that mix in. I'll be mixing this one into rotation throughout the year for when I want something mature and crisp, but not too conservative.

Did I mention it's crisp?",08/19/24 09:13,MaxMellows
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Discontinued for a good reason. This is a much ""lesser"" interpretation of the Italian cypress, compared to Tom Ford's Italian Cypress. The approach is similar yet the notes here are much less smoothly blended, a rough mix of pine needles and bitter herbs on a soapy base.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Cipresso di Parma by Acqua Di Parma was a fragrance I had to give a chance as I am a huge fan of the Blu Mediterraneo line and a discontinued fragrance from this collection piqued my interest. However, I feel like this fragrance while an odd one out from the line doesn't really smell as great as the others and I can understand why this fragrance was discontinued. This smells like walking through a forest and passing by different types of leaves and trees which some people may like but again I wouldn't prefer it to the others in the line. The lavender from this fragrance is what makes this fragrance stand out and is what makes this smell good overall but I feel as if the other notes feel artificial so it can be a 50/50 for some people when smelling it. You could also say that when you smell this fragrance it may smell like a grassy and empty field that reminds you of memories from visiting the park or garden from the instant combination of different greenery in this fragrance. Just like the other Blu Mediterraneo fragrance the price is pretty modest for a niche fragrance as I was able to get this for around $150 so it's a good intro to unique fragrances.

The longevity is a bit surprising as a summer EDT fragrance which usually doesn't last long however this fragrance lasts around 5 hours on my clothes and skin which is way more than what I expected from the start. The sillage is however very weak and I can only really smell this fragrance at a very close distance so nothing really surprising for its sillage. Overall this is an average fragrance with a hint of uniqueness with strong green notes and is a great introduction to new fragrance enthusiasts.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I recently discovered this lovely gem.

It reminds me of scents like Halston Z-14 and Ralph Lauren Polo (Green). To me, there's something very nostalgic about it. I guess, the men around me when I was a child, back in the early 80's, smelled similar. Thus, this is my perception of what a real man is supposed to smell like and I love it. I feel, I gravitate more and more towards these old school type of fragrances.

I don't understand the criticism about the longevity. I've worn it a couple of times now and it lasts, especially on clothes. I sprayed it around 19 hours ago now and I can still smell it prominently on my shirt. The other day I sprayed it on my arm and also got a good 8 hours of a nice whiff now and again.

Such a shame that it's discontinued. You can still find it, but it's going and soon it'll just be another memory of how men used to smell...",06/21/24 00:53,Tyler2004durden

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I remember when I first started collecting. I always liked cypress and pine as favorite notes. This was discontinued. Glad it's back!
It was a blind buy. I heard it had a lot of anise, which is often too sharp and bitter for my taste. I was glad at first impression, I got the anise, but it's perfectly blended with the citrus. It felt a bit peppery, like the Blenheim Bouquet structure of citrus, pepper, lavender, conifer.
A lot of cheepos have poor synthetic cypress. But the cypress and pine are quite good and recognizable. The cypress took some time to be really noticable, around the mid.
It's fresh and spicy in an Italian way perhaps.
Love the conifer base.
Will be best in Summer, but has good enough projection to be enjoyable in Winter.

Just a side note: Clive Christian Cypress, is the best quality, realistic cypress I have found.

PS: Just put it as my signature for Summer. It takes 15 minutes to settle to a harmonious fragrance of spicy, green, conifer fougere.
Fresh yet has warm spicy touches.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Cipresso di Toscana is an aromatic fougère, masculine and barbershop-like, but underwhelming. The green woody goodness I was expecting fades fast, leaving in its wake a generic, soapy aftershave.

CdT has a promising green opening, with a realistic pine accord and a strong lavender note - so far, so fougère. It is quite herbal here, and as it develops, a peppery undertone becomes evident, complementing the greenness and keeping things aromatic. Woody notes follow, a natural progression from the green opening.

However, this all happens very quickly, and after about half an hour, it fades to a musky, soapy, barely-there skin scent that isn't even that pleasant. Sillage is intimate and longevity is weak.

An aromatic, masculine-leaning freshie for hot weather, CdT shows promise initially but ultimately falls flat. Disappointing and definitely overpriced. 2/5.",09/08/23 11:17,Enrium

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I have tested Acqua di Parma Cipresso di Toscana for a second time on paper, yesterday.
At the same time I tested Chanel Paris-Edimbourg, another Cipress based fragrance.

Curious thing: If I smell first Cipresso di Toscana and then Paris- Edimbourg, I am not able to smell the Chanel. If I smell
Paris- Edimbourg first, I still can smell the Acqua di Parma, which is stronger to my nose.
I have been on the fence with Cipresso di Toscana simply because the ratings on Fragrantica are lower but on paper it does pretty well. It's stronger than the Chanel and I also enjoy the scent more.
Furhermore the price for the Chanel has been increased this year from 83€ to 98€ for 50 ML.

The opening is sharp, piney, and VERY aftershavey; the dry down is more mellow oakmoss. The barbershop comparisons are apt; although ""barbershop"" can mean different things to different people.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is a bit of a departure from most of the other ADP Blue offerings (almost all of which I have really enjoyed). I've worn it several times now and every time I spray it I have an initial blast of piney loveliness followed by a perfectly pleasant but very familiar lasting aromatic, sweet, woody smell which gives me strong flashbacks to teenage changing rooms in the '90s. To me this smells very similar indeed to a Lynx (or Axe for those outside the UK/Oz/NZ) body spray, it's been too long for me to put my finger on precisely which one, possibly Java? Tempest? Nevada? Mirage? Maybe Apollo? it's 100% one those old ones from the '90s. I searched to see if anyone else has made this connection but it seems to just be me so take all of this with a pinch of salt but I swear it's very similar.

This is not really a criticism, the smell is nice, especially after a few hours when it's settled down but the familiarity for me is so strong that it feels positively retro whenever I wear it and I worry that if I ran into an old school-friend they'd think I'd been hoarding discontinued Lynx products all these years.",07/11/22 07:05,MagicBez

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Cipress di Toscana has a very sharp and penetrating opening with a strong initial sillage. The opening gives you pine, cypress, petitgrain, a hint of lavender, a greenish tinge that feels close to sage, and something a little spicier as well as a hint of citrus that feels half way between orange and lemon and grapefruit. The petitgrain and pine combination can be a little headachy for me, but then petitgrain and I tend not to get on very well together. The licorice note (star anise) gradually comes through very gently but with increasing presence in the first hour. There's a sort of thin lemon incense feel in the first hour which I presume is the elemi in the background. In the opening hour Cipresso di Toscana feels like a much sharper, much more aggressive version of Tom Ford's Italian Cypress.

Two hours in and Cipresso di Toscana has settled down into a nicer blend, softer, more subtle, and with a correspondingly reduced sillage. There's not a massive development from this point onwards. By five and a half hours in the petitgrain headaches have gone and the scent is a little softer again but it feels more of an okay than a like to me. It's perfectly fine in that there's nothing wrong with it but it's just not good enough to dislodge the likes of similar perfumes (Tom Ford's Italian Cypress, Floris 1962, Acqua di Parma's Chinotto di Liguria) from my preferences among aromatic scents, especially those with leading themes of cypress or pine. By this stage it's just a skin scent but it really sticks to my shirt sleeves.

Six and half hours in the perfume has become a little sweeter. The lavender is more prominent and there's something else green and something a touch sweeter. The fading process is well underway but it really hangs in there - I get about twelve hours from it so if you want durability you certainly get it here by the bucket load!

I think Cipresso di Toscana is one of those perfumes that works at any time of the year but I'd favour it during the early autumn and spring with the cool morning air that warms up. Despite my disagreement with the petitgrain I can appreciate it's an elegant scent. But I think there are one or two which do the cypress - pine - aromatic better.",09/15/21 16:45,mutatismutandis

Its good, buuuuuut, it's not going to garner you any compliments in 2020, it smells like an older gents skin DNA, you know when a guy wears a cologne for decades and it just melds with his natural body scent (like my dad...lol may he rip). It gives off a light yet rich barbershop/soapy scent + a lil dry small florals in the mid notes.

I think you'd need to be in the right situation to wear this, im thinking while on vacation in Italy, driving a convertible from town to town with your sunglasses on and the wind blowing through your hair vibe. It's dated, yet, kindly beautiful. I'd recommend 'Sedley' from PDM as a superior frag in this genre.

Cipresso Di Toscana was one of the first I tried and it was not an immediate love. The first time I sprayed it on it was on a very hot day and the scent simply didn't stick well with my skin. The next time it was a totally different story. While I couldn't smell much of the citrus, the cypress was obvious from the get-go.

But after wearing it couple of times, I'm kinda disappointed. It's somehow very weak on my skin. I feel heavy liquid on the skin, the smell is there, but it's somehow subdued, faint.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Blind-bought a 30ml bottle after everything i've heard about it. It's a safe blind buy for men. It smells simple and green. Doesn't smell like a fragrance. Just green cypress plain and simple that doesn't develope at all. Is the type that you you don't need to like, but it's impossible to dislike it. Quite boring, but that's what i was after. Have a scent in Your Collection that is completely safe and just smells refreshing like the smell of a forrest breeze where you can smell the moss and leaves from the trees. That is exactly what this is. The refreshing, yet the dry, slightly powdery nature of the forrest.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I've had a bottle of the post-relaunch perfume for about 2 weeks now, and I'm very satisfied. It's still the same Cipresso di Toscana, and it's beautiful. Some friends of mine describe it as a barbershop fragrance, and there are certainly people who think it's nothing special; yes, it's an aromatic fougere and it smells like the 1980s. However, it's everything people wished they had back then. I think Bertrand Duchaufour took an old style and created something that would have been the envy of his colleagues back in 1985. When I smell Cool Water, it's dull, but Cipresso di Toscana is happiness. It has elements of the sea and the pines lining the coast. It's inspired by Italy, but it reminds me of the beaches of Virginia, where I'd go every summer as a boy. Pines grow on the barrier islands, so pine naturally goes with marine notes to create a seashore complex. This fragrance transports me back to that time in my life.",05/18/19 01:02,drkool_phd
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"They must have released this again. I have a cool little sample (1.2ml/0.04oz).

An intense and aromatic scent. Fresh notes of sage and rosemary embrace the lively scents of star anise and petit-grain, together with a balsamic cypress and pine base.",05/02/19 16:31,KooKills

A balance of every scent, Citrus-Flower-spice and woods.

What site is this on, as of 5/2019???

Straight masculine to my nose, not unisex. I remember where I first sprayed this scent on at Neiman Marcus back in the early 2000s, I then walk in Macys and Dillards an ask the sales women to sniff my arm. They look they had on there face was priceless. "" Whoa What is that, we definately dont sale that kind of fragrance here""???!! The perfumer Bertand D was in a category of his on with this one.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"To me, as a women, Cipresso di Toscana feels like an olfactory equivalent of boyfriend jeans (which are no favorite of mine, but that's not the point I want to make).
This is unisex and has notes that are typically used in male fragrances. But they're blended into something smooth, light and slightly sweet that would never feel like I've doused myself in my boyfriend's cologne. It feels soothing and natural. So, it's easy to wear even for women who don't usually like masculine scents, but I could imagine that it also smells very nice on men.

This has nice aromatic notes. A coniferous opening, lavender, fresh herbs and spices. Later in the drydown it's a bit woody. I'm kind of surprised there is not a single sweeter note listed, maybe it's just my skin, but on me the base definitely smells a bit vanillic and warm besides the refreshing and herbal notes.",06/01/18 15:40,SailorV

I like the green tone of it, feels natural to me and with a good balance of those green notes, which are of my liking.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I've tried the majority of the Blu Mediterraneo line by now, and so far there hasn't been a single one I didn't at least like. Cipresso di Toscana is no exception: it's great, very natural-smellig, more aromatic and herbal than woody, even a bit spicy as it dries down. Actually quite succesful in evoking a hot summer's day in a coniferous forest full of herbs!

There's only one problem, which isn't really a problem since it's been discontinued, more like a relief: it's not quite unisex enough for my taste. Of course there's no gender to smells, and I only really dislike uber-masculine fragrances with their macho in-your-face vibe, which this one definitely isn't guilty of: it's rather subtle, and very nice. But it is does lean more towards the clasically masculine, which means I think I'd appreciate this more on somebody else than on myself.",01/22/15 23:25,dsty

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I recall this being very weak, but I wanted to give it a fair shake again. Initially, I'm getting a lot of coniferous notes, but it's been sweetened and tamed by the addition of fruity notes that seem all too reminiscent of men's designer fruit fragrances. Even a bit of the old dreaded melon is here, and our old friend the Curve ass-leather note, all over synthetic woods. This is very disappointing, and to me seems very uncharacteristic of a respected niche line like AdP (not that any of their others have impressed me very much!). As the base approaches, I'm presented with the same cheap cherry/wood scent as the new version of Dunhill, which to me just feels like an easy cop-out. The sweetness isn't strong, but it's too full of fruits and honey, and ends up being no better than what you'd find in a run-of-the-mill designer scent. It has a bit of the ""moneyed"" vibe that their Colonia Intensa has, and that helps a bit, but overall I just don't find it to be worth the niche price or the niche brand. Geir does it better, and stronger. Looks like I better move on to their Fig one!",09/25/14 17:28,Redbeard
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Having sprayed it first, it really smells masculine, but in a beautiful fresh just-out-of shower way. I detect pine, citrus and rosemary, and yes, perhaps the very first impression is shaving foam.H However, after just a few minutes it transforms into a cloud that can be described as aromatic awesomeness of herbs and salty seawater with a bit of a barber vibe.

Although pine and cypress are still there, they form the canvas instead of dominating. I detect lavender and rosemary, sage, perhaps a little coriander, but no cardamom or flowers. CdT is on the juicy side, I wouldn't say its a dry pine scent. and it is very aromatic, warm and smooth, hides under your skin and blends with your natural skin scent.

When its settles further, i detect more cypress as well as vetiver and patchouli base, so it does tick all the boxes for me. At the same time I admit, CdT leans more masculine. Stays close to the skin, but staying power is good for summer EdT,4 h aromatic bliss.",08/07/14 10:12,katariina9

I consider it a very nice and natural smelling perfume. The longevity is so and so according to others but i'm not in a position to determine this now. Definitely, a perfume for summer first and all year round for those who do not like heavy artilery perfumes.
I cant see a woman wearing this as the odour of cypress is more or less, masculine...and this is it! it is a masculine perfume for men that reminds pino sylvestre somehow but CDT is much more quality fragrance.

It smells just like cypress trees, and if you really inhale deeply into your skin, you should be able to smell some soft florals and aromatics, but they are disguised so well that this easily passes as a unisex fragrance.

It evolves right away into a very clean and tonic summer/day fragrance with basil, musc and pine. I live in Tuscany where we have Cypress as our regional Tree and I can say TC evocates perfectly the countryside landscapes of my region. I agree with some other reviewers who says it gets a bit ""perfumery"" in the drydown, but nothing disturbing or changing the idea I have about TC.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"When in search of a Summer scent, the contents of these sea-blue bottles seem to be just what you've been looking for.

I almost wrote off Cipresso di Toscana based upon the opening, which to my nose was a typical citrusy lemon and grapefruit fragrance with not much depth. However once settled, this fragrance transformed into something in which its beauty is difficult to describe.

The scent is warm, somewhat herbaceous, sweet, soothing and woodsy. The citruses vanish in a matter of seconds when applied to the skin, making way for a beautiful blend of lavender, pine, jasmine, cypress and patchouli.

Cipresso di Toscana is distinctively unisex, there is enough versatility for this to wear well on both men and women. Some say that this fragrance reminds them of nature and the Mediterranean. I've personally never ventured there, however I do feel as if this fragrance transports me to a picturesque island covered in pine trees, exotic flora and surrounded by clear, sparkling blue seas.

I find this fragrance to be very complex, hence the reason why I enjoy it so much. The absence of harsh citrus and strong fruity accords, places this fragrance in a unique category for a Summer scent.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Sea water..the first sensation at very first sprinkle is of sea water! I love how Acuqa di Parma has such natural tendencies ( in the only 2 that I have tested). Another enjoyeable facet of this perfume is that the florals are just enough, never too forward or sweet, and there are so many individually distinguishable notes-and so many perfectly blended and meshed combinations of scents here. I do love unisex perfumes, this one leans towards masculine. I think it is the lavender, sage, petit grain, all combining together, and then, the added zing of pine and sometimes cypress, that makes it so manly. However, the cardamon here is not so strong, neither the patchouli. The sillage is medium to high, the lasting power is long and excellent. (The spicy notes last forever during the dry down).

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I like the opening (10-15 minutes). From the very beginning to the end finest ingredients, that are far from synthetics, are obvious. Big up to that.

And the end is not near! More than 12 hours of longevity on this one. Fortunately no Tonka bean. Just a hint of lavender in the middle phase, and sandalwood in the base. But again this is all about CARDAMOM. I am not a fan of it. And I wish the lavender and sandalwood is more upfront.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Very luxurious. Has a warm, creamy, barbershop, sandalwood opener that dries down with the creaminess dampening and the sandalwood becoming quite lush. The kind of perfume I imagine would be worn after a long day skiing, after sitting in the woody sauna and shower getting squeaky clean, and then putting this on, ready for some apres ski with scotch in hand, warm knitwear on for dinner or bathrobe on in the lodge, fire crackling, ready for action with your partner. If worn in warmer weather, I imagine would easily be quite cloying if not lightly sprayed.

The opener is like a warm version of Creed's Himalaya. The Creed is more reserved, controlled, and changes into more of an airy, fruity note with some sandalwood lingering.

The counterpoint comparison would be Armaf's Sillage (SMW knock-off), which starts on a peppery, ginger, chemical note with some woodiness and sandalwood characteristics, so is an edgier, lower quality sandalwood alternative.

Starts with the signature colonia citrus, I am very happy with this part. But it's only 1 minute or less.
The cardamom kicks in early and slightly strong to my like.
But as the lavender slowly comes to the surface its beautiful, my favourite part. I wish this opening would last longer. Still the cardamom won't weaken. And this citrusy, floral, spicey start reminds me of aftershaves with either menthol or mint in them (a grapefruit mint mix for me).
So, after this 20min show, there's a creamy sandalwood, nice. But the cardamom still disturbing me, and the whole thing just goes away too quick.

On clothes it's a completely different story:
The opening not obvious colonia citrus, not that bright. Perhaps it's already a mix with the lavender, that spice is there again, but not overhelming. This time it let the lavender win the show. Favourite part this is, everything going much slower, more bold. And the cardamom support the whole, nice. I am not only start tolerate cardamom, but I am in love how it's lift my beloved lavender.
The next twist after the summer night walk by the lavender field is that barbershop vibe. Yes here it is, but nothing of this sort on my skin, never happened. 😭 Someone mentioned PR PH the green bottle earlier, and I have to say: yes I am get that. But don't expect that strong similarity, just it makes some of us surely to remember one or two old school barbershop scents. But AdP style...
So much going on, what a game, and everything so smooth, well planned blend. Once, I think its going to turn to the creamy sandalwood scent on my jumper as well, but not yet. Little powdery at the moment, and the citruses almost fully disappeared. Like a nice full bodied red wine as you decant and once what it was harsh (citrus in this case) now turns into a fantastic creamy juice.
I am waited a good 40mins. I am expected the tonka going to tame the wood but the amber came along instead, and the cardamom toned back up a little again but not for long. At the end when you can't separate any of the notes, its a nice, light woody finish. (a very little like honey and tobacco/wood for me at the very end, must be the amber's trick)
A not too hot summer night for me, the wind brings some lavender from a little distance and I am watching the stars until I fall into a quality deep sleep.

I hope this grows on me once, because it is fantastic from start to finish.

Last/final sniff on my skin: Almost nothing, maybe faux leather, little reminds me of the green bottled jaguar.

The usual AdP longevity and silage, not much better -for me- than the colonia or blu M line.",01/19/21 12:48,cpower
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion. I own around 150 fragrances and this is my favorite, period. I've tried or own all of the 'brown bottle' line of Acqua di parma fragrances and, for me this is the best and most underrated of all. Oud is also a masterpiece and Ebano and Ambre are very good (leather is far too animalic and not to my taste) but this is the best.

The fragrance opens very citrus and aromatic, with bergamot, lemon and lavender dominating. This phase lasts about 20 mins.

The mid looses the citrus and focuses more on the lavendar, cardomom and the sandalwood coming through. The aromatics are quite spicy but very sophisticated. The Sandalwood gives the fragrance a woody back bone but does not smell like your typical 'creamy' sandalwood you get in Lebo Santal 33, Creed original Santal or even YSL La Nuit D'lomme EDP. I think the creaminess is hidden behind the lavender, but the overall impression is very sophisticated and alluring. This phase lasts for 3-4 hours

In the far dry down you are left with the lavender and sandalwood. I don't pick up any tonka really.

Performance from my bottles (I have 100ml bottle and a 180ml bottle, yes I like it that much) is excellent. Projects for around 2-3 hours with a lovely silliage before sitting close for a total of 6-8 hours (which is great for my skin which really sucks up fragrances). I think this is a more mature fragrance, I always get a lot of compliments from this one (I'm in my 30s). It's complex and sophisticated but still approachable and easy to wear. It's also very versatile and suitable for all seasons and occasions. I personally like to wear it for spring/summer/autumn 'dressed up' evening occasions.

If you want a sophisticated citrus/woody/aromatic fragrance with great performance and that will set you apart from everyone else wearing mainstream designers around you, this is an absolute gem.",01/13/21 06:34,nt277i
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Sandalo for me is all year around fragrance it opens with fresh side Bergamot, Lemon and Orange then start to get some Cardamon & Lavender the dry down id Sandalwood, Tonka bean, Amber

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"A very likeable masculine sandalwood and lavender. Soft, clean, pleasant.

This reminds me a lot of aftershaves that your grandfather might have worn. It has a classic appeal, while still being likable for most people.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Yes i think this is one of the better perfumes that hits the theme of Sandal. Its opens fresh and in that way it is really a Italian kind of perfume. The citric note is there and typical for Aqua di parma that Lavender note .
Petit grain and Sandal come in the end.
I still prefer Serge Lutens on Sandal but this one is second best.
It is a sophisticated perfume and nicely balanced.
The woody so typical for Sandal comes in the end.",01/08/20 08:04,osiris5
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Got this one for Christmas and I really like it!
I like to use it after my morning shave personally as, to my nose it has a sort of classy ""barbershop"" vibe with a refreshing opening.

Though not the same, it's reminiscent of YSL Rive Gauche pour Homme. Like an expensive men's grooming product scent. Clean, fresh, creamy, and smooth.

Feels like it could also be a versatile performer..in the workplace, for dinner out, summer or winter ect.

Has the citruses in the opening and then I get the lavender and sandalwood coming through, really well blended.Very nice indeed.",01/05/20 09:16,Ticktock
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is beautiful. The sandalwood is prominent here, though you can definitely detect a nice bergamot note on the opening, which gradually fades in about an hour. That's when the creaminess of the sandalwood comes out.
It's a very relaxing scent: brings my memory back to a time I was happy and stress-free. I personally like to wear this for myself rather than for compliments. This is what I'd normally call a ""zen fragrance"".
Overall, it's very reminiscent of Indian scents.
This can be easily worn in summer months, though I feel this is more of a fall scent.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,It’s a good blend. Nothing ground breaking or something you should go out and buy. It’s just spice and sandalwood.,05/26/19 18:08,clintjr82
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Tested it on paper: A nice take on sandalwood. Very vanillic and creamy, with a hint of spice, but kept on the masculine side.

That said it's not groundbreaking imo, and since it hasn't hit discounters yet, there are better scent around for the price it currently retails for (i.e. Dyptique Tam Dao EDP, which costs half the price online: a little more unisex than AdP Sandalo, but still, it's my favourite sandalwood as of today).

Will definitely reconsider it when it will be on sale at online discounters/ebay.

Spring/Fall days, 30+


Edit: tested it on skin.
On skin it is less round, much fresher and sharper. I have to be honest: I am not sure the cardamom/lavender/sandalwood trio works well here. Fact is that this fragrance is centered on cardamom, with strong lavender support - the sandalwood note only shows up in the base and doesn;t smell very natural (is it? or is there no sandalwood at all, but only creamy vanilla, sold as sandalwood? who knows).
It is so sharp, that in the drydown, it seems that there is a some ambergris, and results being similar to Guerlain Encens Mythique (an aldehydic ambergris centered fragrance) that I am testing simultaneously on the other arm. Projection is moderate (good in the opening).

At the point, I can say that Colonia Sandalo should have been marketed unisex. (I would even say that results in being the unisex version of Colonia Ambra, despite the listed notes are very different). The comparison with Aesop Marrakech Intense and Floris Santal are spot on, since both of these are cardamom-centric, not sandalwood-centric. No similarities whatsoever with the great LV Sandalo.
Will do the job for who looks for a modern barbershop fragrance, even if a bit boring and unoriginal to my nose, and the name 'Sandalo' is definitely misleading. A pass for me, and should I decide to get a clean/fresh sandalwood fragrance, I will go with Tam Dao EDP (that despite the cedar, is rounder than Colonia Sandalo). For great sandalwood notes though, I will go directly with LV Sandalo, MPG Santal Noble and Profvmvm Santalum.",04/17/19 16:45,Andy the Frenchy
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Sandalo is another solid entry from the darker bottle line, formerly known as Colonia Intensas. It follows in the tradition of Colonia Oud and Colonia Leather before it as being an interesting albeit not too divsive entry, a blend of the ""eau de cologne"" concept mastered via the now-antique original Colonia as well as a mix of various other notes.

In the case of Sandalo, the blend is overall a bit lighter and fresh than in Oud or Leather, just based on the nature of the signature of note. The fragrance consists of the predictable ensemble of citruses, paired with spunky additives like lavender, cardamom, and petitgrain, with a predictable base of sandalwood and amber (and allegedly tonka bean, though I don't get much of this, myself).

The fragrance is refreshing and invigorating without being too loud, and somehow comforting without being too boring. It's palpably versatile, wearable day or night, winter or summer.

It's a decent performer but probably not quite as good as Leather or Oud, but still satisfactory. Like the others, retail pricing ($260 for 100ml at Neiman Marcus) feels like a tough sell for a relatively safe offering, but it'll no doubt become cheaper on the secondary market (i.e. FragranceNet) with time.

Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma’s Sandalo is very nice indeed with deliciously smooth and almost ‘sweet’ sandalwood notes - reminiscent of Comme des Garçons ‘Concrete’ - given a fresh relève by the citrus accord then warmth by a touch of aromatics.

I sprayed a tester on the back of my hand and on the walk home all I could smell was this fragrance - excellent performance and even 9 hours later and several hand washes it smells as if I applied half an hour ago but just without the projection. After the 11 hour mark Sandalo begins to fade and after 12 hours I can smell a faint remnant but the real performance is probably a good 10 hours.

AdP’s Sandalo holds up well in bitter Winter weather but the aromatics would really sing in Springtime.

Well done, Acqua Di Parma... well done.",01/29/19 13:40,monkey500
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is very special. If I have two sprays in the morning, I'm able to smell it for the whole day, after I take a shower and on my sleeping T-shirt afterwards. The longevity is amazing. As to the silage, I think it is just the right one - the fragrance is creamy and very warm, manly and yet not aggressive. Sandalwood, lavender and bergamot is an extraordinary combination - simple, subtle and yet quite strong especially when the ingredients are of the highest quality. The price is indeed quite high but I prefer to give my money for this fragrance than for one of the terrible overpriced fragrances by Creed or Kilian.",01/28/19 06:12,danielbankov
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I’ve been testing this fragrance for the past week and was surprised because it’s not your normal sandalwood perfume. It’s intriguing, one of the most non-linear scents I’ve ever tried. The first three-minute blast is an alcohol bergamot/lemon explosion that took me back to my high school days when I’d liberally shake Old Spice Lime over my neck and shoulders after showering, making muscles and admiring my imagined animal magnetism in the mirror afterwards (yes, there was no Axe in my time). Then, Sandalo’s heart turns into a honeyed citrus essence (probably the citrus, lavender, and amber notes) with a powdery background (the sandalwood?). This slowly decays over about three hours into a cardamom/lavender that reminds me of Perfums de Marly’s Layton. Sillage is not enormous and turns into a skin scent that lasts 6-9 hours. This is a great scent for wandering about, for business, for informal social gatherings. It’s fresh and clean and won’t draw undue attention, while at the same time being bright and eye-opening, though it won’t replace the morning coffee. It’s a fall, winter, and spring scent easily, and probably summer capable.

I’m on the fence over buying this. I don’t have anything in my current collection that’s similar to the opening or the creamy heart. The dry-down, however, is redundant with Layton. I layered it with Serge Lutens’ Santal Majuscule to enhance the sandalwood and liked the dry down better that way. If I didn’t own Layton, it would be a no brainer—I like the overall non-linearity and progression of Sandalo better than the comparatively boring Layton.

Edit: After trying it many more times, I bought it.",01/26/19 11:16,IpodHappy
Colonia Sandalo Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is not a sandalwood dominant scent. It is a clean, spicy, soapy fragrance with sandalwood nuances. In fact so clean, it immediately reminded me of the original Paco Rabanne pour Homme (green bottle). An oakmossy barbershop opening, followed by a spicy oudy sandalwood. Finally it dries down to a chergui like type of scent. Performance could be better, but its ok.

Seriously this is awesome stuff! Smells very classic and very masculine but you are paying a premium for it. I’d feared, with a name like Sandalo that it would be a very slight, sandalwood but it’s more of a classic, I detect oak moss and patchouli, and a dirty lavender with a kind of eathiness reminding me of Tom Ford for men maybe or RL Safari, VC&A Tsar or classic eighties fragrances with sandalwood. It’s an aromatic Fougere type scent, citrus top notes, herbal and woody, the soft, clean woods left at the end are like a oud and sandalwood combo. I think it’s fantastic and another classic masculine idea in the same way Quercia from this line was too. I hope it’s not wildly expensive because I want it.",08/12/18 15:44,Houdini4

Much better than Oud. This Sandalo finally brings back meaning into perfumery, the lost art. This is special, and takes some time to delve the layers.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"When I first got it about four years ago, it was mostly just a dry, dusty myrhh with mediocre performance. Abandoned old wooden houses must have smelled like that, I thought.

It had a somewhat bright and promising resinous opening that quickly faded and turned dry and dusty within an hour; it stayed linear and soft, almost like a whisper that way throughout its remaining lifespan of about four hours.

It took a bit of imagination to perceive that lingering chalkiness as cocoa powder, but even that would be kind of a stretch.

Fast forward a few years to the present—it has likely undergone maceration and has become a rich, moderately sweet resinous amber fragrance with clear gourmet warm tones of vanilla and rich, dusty cocoa powder.

Its projection has improved to almost an arm length, while its longevity has stretched to about ten hours.

From a meh fragrance almost designated to becoming a layering fragrance for its base notes—evolved into nearly a powerhouse!

I guess I got lucky!",10/07/25 21:23,Digfigs
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Honestly love this stuff. ADParma very hit or miss for me. This, Essenza & Futura are great.

This is just smooth and a great cooler weather fragrance. I love Myrrh as a note and this is in my top 3 for sure, it's basic and a little linear but just right. For an ADC it lastly a decent while 4-7hrs, it's soft and has a nice bubble which I'd describe as fuzzy warm cookie dough(ish) ambery feel.
I'd imagine the sillage is very nice too.

I'm picking up another 180ml this week. I would love an EDP of this... a little deeper and bolder! Come on ADP!

Seriously on a cold morning few sprays behind the ears and BOOM! In my own Cosy bubble.

For me 10/10 for what it is. It's not an all rounder, somewhat versatile and nowhere near a beast. But! That's exactly why I love it. Simple, smooth, warm, gorgeous. Apparently discontinued, what a shame I will definitely get another bottle for a back up.",06/07/25 23:13,Crusader Smitty

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Mirra is a sophisticated and versatile fragrance from the Italian house’s Colonia line, blending the brand’s signature citrusy freshness with warm, resinous, and spicy notes. Launched as part of their Ingredient Collection, it centers around the rich, balsamic aroma of myrrh, elevated by complementary notes that create a smooth and calming experience.

Scent Profile:

Colonia Mirra opens with a subtle citrus burst, characteristic of Acqua di Parma’s Colonia DNA, likely featuring bergamot or orange blossom, which gives it a bright and approachable start. As it settles, the heart reveals a delicate spice accord with noticeable hints of nutmeg, adding a warm, slightly sweet, and earthy dimension. The star of the show, myrrh, anchors the base with its resinous, amber-like depth, creating a soothing and elegant finish. The fragrance strikes a balance between freshness and warmth, making it a refined take on an amber fragrance.

Performance:

Projection: Light to moderate. Colonia Mirra projects softly, creating an intimate scent bubble that feels personal rather than overpowering. It’s ideal for those who prefer understated elegance.

Longevity: Fairly good, lasting around 6-8 hours on the skin, which is impressive for an Acqua di Parma fragrance, given the brand’s lighter, eau de cologne-inspired roots. Reapplication may be needed for all-day wear in some cases.

Vibe and Versatility:

This fragrance exudes a calming, sophisticated aura, making it suitable for nearly any occasion—work, casual outings, or evening events. Its darker, resinous undertones, driven by myrrh, give it a slightly moody character that might feel heavy for hot summer days but shines in cooler seasons like spring, fall, or even mild winter days. It evokes a sense of timeless luxury, reminiscent of the discontinued Armani Privé Myrrhe Impériale, though Colonia Mirra leans lighter and fresher.

Comparison and Uniqueness:

Fans of amber-heavy fragrances will appreciate Colonia Mirra’s refined take on the genre. The nutmeg and citrus accents set it apart from denser amber scents, giving it a brighter, more wearable edge. Its similarity to Armani Privé Myrrhe Impériale suggests a luxurious, resinous warmth but with Acqua di Parma’s signature Italian finesse.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I wish they'd do an EDP for this one... ADP has been a hit or miss house for me. I appreciate there perfumes but some just ain't for me.

This, Essenza & Futura are my favorites...

Considering this is an EDC it lasts quite awhile... I would love a pumped up version of this. However, this is absolutely beautiful. When I first tried it i thought bleh, nothing special but it's not meant to be... this is just smooth warm cozy and that's exactly what it's made to be and it's excellent. This will not make your jaw drop but once you wear it a few times it becomes addictive.

Come on ADP do an EDP!!! Don't know if this is discontinued or what but I have a couple of back up bottles and it's available in New Zealand.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Bought as sample 5 years ago. I wondered at the time, if my sample was stale. I didn't find citric top notes, or pachouli base note. It opened with a smell like stale iris and lavender, with a powdery quality that stayed the same all day.
I'm giving it another try today. It hasn't improved or worsened in 5 years. After a few hours, it's stinging my eyes a bit, with a cloying, spicy sweetness.
I found it 'meh' at first, and kind of boring. Hours later, annoying.
I'm obviously no expert. I don't know what myrrh is meant to even smell like. I don't know if my chemistry is incompatible with this fragrance or, like I suggested, it's stale.",02/01/25 08:27,Jim_Smith
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just got this, my initial thoughts.

Myrrh is one of my favorite notes, so I've wanted to get my hands on this. They don't smell completely alike, but as someone who loves Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense, this reminds me of a much less sexy, more casual, less soapy version of the Prada. If the Prada is for date nights in sleek, upscale bars and restaurants when you want to inflect a certain understated air of elevated but nonchalant ""cool"", then Colonia Mirra is for the following easygoing day, waking up, heading out to get a late breakfast and then a walk in the park. Overall, the blend here doesn't feel as ""special"" or ""interesting"" as the Prada. This is a lot more straightforward, but I wouldn't go as far as using the word ""linear."" This still has enough depth so that it doesn't get boring.

So far, this is a strong like for me, but again I'm a sucker for myrrh and oriental fragrances, so this fits right into my wheelhouse. I can actually see myself using this much more than my discontinued bottles of Amber Pour Homme Intense to conserve those. Will edit with a full review later.

Edit: The amber in this leans towards that synthetic kind of amber accord one often finds in modern day male perfumery (you know the aura I'm talking about, usually accompanied by ambroxan, though, thankfully, there's no ambroxan in this), and overall slightly ""cheapens"" the overall feel of this. It's surprising as my experience with other Acqua di Parma fragrances has been noting how natural they smell. I'm not saying Colonia Mirra smells ""cheap"", but it's just not as ""elevated"" as I initially thought off the first couple of wears. I do still like this though! Downgrading my rating from an 8 to a 7.5

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This is a real head-turner! Colonia Mirra is warm, spicy and definitely masculine. The initial citrus burst fades quickly into this rich amber and myrrh scent that lasts all day. It's sophisticated and perfect for evening events.",12/17/24 14:33,Steve198
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just a superb fragrance that many have overlooked but, this is a magnificent blending of citrus and smooth amber, myrhh goodness. A semi dark Oriental with an Italian twist that combines freshness up top with a spicy, semi-sweet near gourmand drydown and a near perfect mix of amber & Patchouli in the mid to end to give it a nice, well rounded light woods & earthy mix. Close to Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense but, none of the soapy like accord that Prada is known for nor a pronounced woods that Prada has with the Sandalwood & Vetiver. Just an Italian take on a spicy oriental that creates a magic from fall to early spring. This feels slightly more casual and laid back compared to Prada's version yet, can be worn just as easily as the latter in a work or professional setting. I just prefer Prada for that particular environment or scenario. But, for friends & family gatherings or that date night occasion in cooler to cold weather, this is simply stellar. Performance is quite good as well as I get 6-8 hours of duration with half a dozen sprays. For me I rank the brown bottled colonia line in this order; Colonia Oud Intensa, Colonia Sandalo Concentree and then this gem right here Mirra but, they are all super close for me. No losers in this bunch at all.

An underrated creation that exudes quality from the first spray and on. There are still some tester bottles and 180ml. bottles available for excellent prices. If spice & everything nice is your calling, this is your gateway to that occasion.",12/03/24 07:51,Apocalypse6vs8
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"The leaves are falling, autumn is here, it's time to break out this fantastic warm amber-spicy fragrance. For me, I find four sprays is enough, where I typically do six, and I find it lasts. I was fortunate in that someone gave me a full-size tester bottle of this... it's great to have friends with connections like that!",10/28/24 07:30,LandNoise
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful scent of myrrh and amber, fresh with its light touch of patchouli and citrus. It has a slight subtle sweetness, I am not sure if it comes from the orange flower notes. This is really gorgeous and probably unisex. I think I need a bottle of this. Wonderful scent! this is an underrated gem! don't go buying expensive Tom Ford Myrrh scents without sampling this first!",07/05/24 07:29,aspirina
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Smells like a less intense and more rounded version amouage crimson rocks. A warm spicy, powdery, amber frangrance. Quite resinous in the dry down. Insane sillage and longevity. Could be cousins with Tom Ford Noir.",06/09/24 06:21,Tunzz
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"A great day wearing Mirra. The trick is to apply with weight, confidence, and persistence. Then do it again.

Within 30 mins, the perfume has relaxed and settled into a lovely warm woody, resinous, soft patchouli fog that projects enough so that you can pick it up easily, wallow in it even. And yet it doesn’t overpower those around. Lasts all day and is enjoyable even after 12 hours. One of my favourite Aqua di Parma perfumes.",03/12/24 11:59,jwc001
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Lightly powdery and nutty amber dominant scent accented with fresh citrus. Very clean, but warm and cozy and perfect for the cold weather.
Not a big projector, have to lean to get a nice whiff, but does last for hours on skin and more on clothes.",01/04/24 10:38,Ferra_Verto
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Top notes are a bit hard to decipher, but there is at least some floral and citric notes. They are very pleasant, but not very distinct and they evaporate in less than 30 minutes, transforming into saponin notes.
In the mid, nutmeg is prominent but the myrrh and other, warmer spices fills out the picture.
Base is solid, and nice with amber and discreet woodiness.

The AdP signature of citrus and soap is quite obvious although the profile has more to do with Eau Sauvage EDP – citric with a spicy and resinous base – than with the classic colonias. There is, however, not sufficient citrus notes to say that this is a ""hespéridé"" – leaning on citrus essential oils – and the top notes are not an important part of the overall experience in general. There is more spice and resinous notes and less soapiness compared to other colonia bottles from this house.

All in all I think that if this was a stronger concentration, I would consider replacing my Eau Sauvage EDP (2017) with Colonia Mirra. Autumn-winter-early spring office scent, but does not have sufficient performance to defend the price. Although I like discretion, even the skin scent phase is too weak after 3 hours on me. Edit: Funny how the opening reminds me of the way Fahrenheit smells on you past lunchtime, but this really lasts only 15 minutes.",12/01/23 23:48,Opato

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,This is a wonderful fragrance. Lots of spice with very dark smoothness about it. It's not the run of the mill fragrance .,06/15/23 13:00,Tonymast1984
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"My first review on here, LONG time lurker..
Looking at some of the reviews below makes me question my own findings., but I found Mirra to be massively disappointing. It opens well, fresh whilst intoxicatingly reassuring and classic ADP, and the initial drydown is lovely. For the price I paid for it £65 - I thought I was on a complete win.
However - 20/30 minutes later and it's a skin scent on me. An hour or two and it's all but gone. So disappointing that I boxed it straight back up for a exchange, thinking that something had to be amiss. The second bottle was identical, so that went back too. Now I have ADP Oud, Leather and Ebano - all of which have good to great performance, so I'm not sure whether it is just my skin? The readily available, relative 'bargain bin' pricing does suggest that I may not be the only one being less than impressed though..",01/27/23 07:22,Vape

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just looked at my bottle and only have about 10ml left. This is a gem, definitely one of my favorite Myyrh fragrances.

I will be getting another bottle this year, possibly another for a back up.

9/10 loses a point because it's not a year round nor most versatile fragrance.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Masculine, solid, linear (not a criticism - an observation of this range of single note emphasis colognes). Straightforward, brown/amber (if you find scents resemble colours, as I do). Easily wearable I can daytime/work situations, as evening ones.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Since i made my first review I want to add one.
I love this one in the first place.
The more i use this fragrance I feel it is a one you can put into the realm of the ones who relate to the Arabian notes used in Oud and those very expensive ones you can find here.
The notes, as I said previous, are very distinct in their consistence and combination.

Wow this is so good and powerful and yet it is balanced and so sophisticated.
It does remind me indeed of the spice shop or market in India or the middle East but it has also that mystical smell typical for mire.
It has a long-lasting power for eau de cologne and makes you feel dressed-up for a nice diner or just for a good evening party on a sunny day outside.
What ever occasion, this is gorgeous and well balanced to wear.",08/21/22 01:17,osiris5
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Gorgeous fragrance from Acqua Di Parma!

I love this! Only just purchased a few days ago and it’s stunning! This seems to be a rather underrated not so well known fragrance from Acqua di Parma which surprises me!

Like a walk through a pine forest on a sunny winters day!

Versatile and office safe.",02/15/22 12:45,scottgiles86
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I learned to love Myrrh from Dior Eau Sauvage Parfum 2012 and Jo Malone Myrrh Tonka, but I'm just ok with this one. I'm not sure what to make of this one. Dark, warm, cozy, dry myrrh and other dark notes I can't pick out. It's nice enough but nothing pops out and grabs me.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I'm a big fan of Acqua di Parma line up and Colonia Mirra is no exception to this. This Eau de Cologne Concentrée, despite lacking a bit in longevity, really pays off with a luscious, deep and layered olfactory experience. It echoes the seriousness of the original Acqua di Parma but with a completely different set of notes, though it plays in the same arena in terms of elegance.

The opening is quite dark, bittersweet (almost medicinal) and reminds me of dark cocoa powder; there are sweeter orange blossom nuances that bright it up enough to avoid it feeling stuffy and gothic. As the initial citrus sparkles fade, it becomes drier and almost powdery in a very pleasant way, like if you were smelling in a wooden cupboard where resins and nutmeg have been left for months. Myrrh provides the luscious bittersweet background that becomes more prominent 30 mins in, while nutmeg is more prominent at the beginning and adds a note of spiciness.

As soon as the base notes hit your nose, the warm ambery base makes the bittersweet smell of myrrh more akin to burnt brown sugar - this is no gourmand at all, but just really gives the idea of sugar taken off the stove right before it burns. At points it gives me the idea of being sucked into a black hole and, as much as it sounds like a negative comment, it is not in reality as it removes your focus from anything else surrounding it.

Colonia Mirra has such a dark, mysterious and alluring scent profile I can't stop smelling my wrist. This is a dressed up fragrance, good for your own enjoyment and amazing when you need to smell refined and opulent. Due to its low contration, longevity is not amazing - 3 to 4 hours, give it or take it, and that is expected; it effuses convincingly but not aggressively for the first hour before becoming a sking scent. Great for fall and winter, both day and night, rainy days and formal situation. Classic Acqua di Parma bottle (batch code 0260337), in dark brown glass similar to those of the discontinued Ingredients collection; a number of fragrances in the line have been moved under the Signatures of Sun line and became EdP concentration, but alas not Colonia Mirra although this one is still widely available at discounters.",12/08/21 12:56,skaccomatto
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I am a young woman, however I thoroughly enjoy wearing this fragrance all year and weather long. I see as a very complex, but easily wearable fragrance. For me it is a very cozy smell, therefore I tend to wear it on cooler days, however I see how it could be pulled of in a nice summery, flowy dress, sipping double espresso on ice.
The fragrance opens up to this strong medicinal smell, I get just a little bit citruses, more like sweeter orange peel/ blossom citruses (probably the orange blossom). However the myrhh, amber and patchouli is amazing. After 15 minutes on my skin, it starts to sweeten and then I get just a bit of that nutmeg. But it is not sweet as in candy sweet, it is a natural sweetness. It is somehow fresh, but warm and spicy at the same time. After a hour it becomes fresh for me. It is so mysterious, but familiar at the same time. I love it when my boyfriend wears it, I love it to wear it myself.
When it dries, it becomes quite sweet and aromatic, reminds me of dialed down Black Phantom By Kilian.
I got a 180ml bottle of this fragrance at TKMaxx for a fraction of the original price. I believe I paid 68 euros. I don't think I would pay the original price for this fragrance. It is not my favorite fragrance, but I appreciate it.",09/19/21 05:59,Todobien

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Quite medicinal in the early spray. But changing to more pleasant after a while when it starts to polarize gradually. I think this is more masculine than unisex. Smells classy but performance is moderate. The myrrh is dominant here, and of the same nuance with JM Myrrh and Tonka. Expensive but worth the biggest size resides on my shelf.",07/24/21 07:01,klix27
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Wow. Just wow.... I'm in love with it, it's definitely got that brite, fresh citrus opening that after a half hour or longer absolutely settles down into this yummy, warm, creamy, delicious, nutmeg/myrrh/amber thing that gives it a sweet, brown sugary, gourmand vibe... of course the star is that creamy, smooth, warm, nutmeg/amber/myrrh combo. My god.. A woman with whom I had a romantic date with a few weekends ago was stuck to me like a magnet, afterwards later texting me about how delicious I smelled to her. I have Colonia Mirra to thank for such a nice compliment from her.... Now the downsides... It is only a cologne concentrate, which is so disappointing. This NEEDS to be an EDP or at least an EDT... But other than so-so performance and so-so longevity, this stuff is soooo beautiful and delicious. I absolutely LOVE citrus/amber/myrrh/olibanum fragrances.

It's not to say the others were bad, they were nice but not bottle worthy for me. Mirra is back up bottle worthy for me, I just wish it lasted abit longer. This smells rich, deep and opulent. Reminds me of the Myyrh in Zaharoff.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This starts off as a Pow to the senses then calms down to this nice mixture of amber ( and myrrh ) with other elements of the fall time ( although I wore this in the winter, it still fits perfectly )

I don't personally know or have smelled what Myrrh is but, whatever it is, this fragrance works and works well.

It's nothing explosively amazing to me, but just beautifully done and enjoyable.

A woman could likely pull this off but... it's not so obvious either way to be just for men or women to me.

The box I received was in a plastic case but not sealed/stickered.
I like the fragrance itself but would be annoyed if I had paid full price for it!",01/03/21 18:51,jman316
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This is going to be complicated and I may even contradict myself on a couple of points.

I got this just after Christmas from a UK retailer who I think had made a mistake in pricing on their Euro site, it was a fraction of what they were charging in GBP and for what I paid it’s a fantastic bargain.

Putting the above aside I’ve got to say I like it but I don’t love it. I have Colonia at present, I’ve had a few other ADP fragrances in the past and have always been wowed by them, this doesn’t quite hit the spot.

The initial hit I get is of high cocoa content dark Swiss Chocolate, which immediately calms down into mirhh and amber. It’s got that ADP mark of quality all over it, but at the same time there’s just something missing to take it to another level where I couldn’t live without it.

I don’t get the longevity or projection I was expecting either. It arrived a few day’s ago and I sprayed it before bed on two nights and there was no hint of it in the morning, today has been the first time I’ve worn it during the day and after 6 hours I’m having to really search for any hint of it.

I think I paid around 1/4 of RRP so I can’t complain at that price but I would have been disappointed if I hadn’t got it heavily discounted.

It’s obviously quality and it’s nice but it doesn’t really stand out as anything special.",01/02/21 09:10,Nick68

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"At first wearing I quite liked this fragrance. A brighter, bit more light myrrh than usual, while still carrying the same dryness it's known for.
Something kept bugging me though and I never felt I really liked the scent. After smelling it a while I think I've realized what it is: a scratchy and strong synthetic woody amber, perhaps the old pal Amber Xtreme popping up again. This causes the fragrance to have a scent reminiscent of a more generic cheap masculine and, as my girlfriend describes it, causes it to ""go up the nose"" really much and hurts a little if you smell it too close. I would guess this is a way to boost the sillage of the scent, which unfortunately completely ruined it too.

It was launched in 2017 but is already discontinued as of 2020, so maybe other people agreed with me. If you like myrrh, there are just so many other scents around that I would recommend over this.",11/24/20 14:55,Borzoi

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,i don't know what it is but this scent like many of the other Acqua di Parma scents smells cheap. Just everything about this radiates synthetics. I've tried a dozen or so of their scents after liking one of their Blu Meditteraneo scents and reading all of these positive reviews. I love resins and myrrh but this just doesn't sit right with me. It smells unbalanced with a largely vacant top note register.,08/31/20 07:59,patrick.herron
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"The top notes last relatively little, only a few minutes. Immediately appears the main note of MIR, and from now on the myrrh is the main player who will feel throughout the period of wearing.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Tested it on skin: a little disappointed after the high hopes that the paper test gave me.

I thought I had found the Holy Graal of Myrrh, but no.
Don't misunderstand me: it's a good round myrrh centred frag, but my previous impression in regard to the lack of AdP's signature citrusy opening and the drydown, that reveals to be even more vanillic than it appeared on paper, makes it lean very feminine imo. Projection is moderate at best, and the fragrance is short lived on my skin (disappeared after just 3 hours).

I think it may be interesting on a woman, but quite boring on a man. That said, today I also tested Guerlain Bois Mysterieux: THIS is the holy grail of masculine myrrh. Given the price tag similarity between the 2 frags, it's a no-brainer for me for my myrrh frag quest: AdP is out, Guerlain for the win!

Edit: Guerlain Bois Mysterieux is a masterpiece imo, but should you look for a frag totally myrrh-centered, I can't recommend enough Goutal Ambre Fetiche and Armani Myrrhe Imperiale. Really, imperial!",04/17/19 16:57,Andy the Frenchy
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I beautiful take on myrrh. It's indeed pretty warm and round, and the typical AdP citric opening is a little less fresh than other frags of the same line. Myrrh is noticeable in the heart. Then it morphs to an ambery (resin/vanilla) drydown - for sure a little less interesting than its big brother, AdP Note di Colonia III. Colonia Mirra is overall sweeter and a little less refined than the latter, but also 2 to 3 times cheaper.

A win from AdP, but try on skin before you buy!

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma is such a classy brand.

From the moment you open the box you can feel the quality and the luxury. Colonia mirra delivers exactly what its name says. From the very start you are greeted with an ambery, sweet but steady myrrh note. This is for the elegant, dark haired gentleman over 30. Longevity is good but not excellent. If you genuinely like myrrh, give it a try. However, my myrrh obsession is already fulfilled by the 2012 version of Eau sauvage Parfum which has a bit more brightness IMO and better performance.",06/23/18 12:03,Leopold
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Spiritual, meditative, sensual, deep, elegant, masculine.

Perfectly matches its name as it's VERY resinous, which I find lovely.

However, the more it drys down the sweeter it gets and becomes a bit cloying. It's also not very easy to wear so although I fell in love with the scent at the beginning I won't be buying a bottle, I can't spend so much on something that's not 100% satisfactory.",06/22/18 04:57,torom
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma, my new favorite brand and a true master of blends.
All their perfumes are made of high quality ingredients and this one is no exception.

This perfume says: I enjoy being a man!

This creature is extraordinary, utterly admirable. Everything about this perfume is as it should be. Everything is in its place. Everything is balanced.
The notes come in, play their role in the light of a resinous myrrh and amber accord and slowly fade away with a goodbye kiss on your senses.

The opening is a little bit powerful, but just enough to grab your attention. Then the myrrh comes in and the beautiful, sweet, and boozy amber starts to play in the background. This is the main theme of the perfume and it will be like this until you can't smell the perfume anymore.
I've applied it 12 hours ago and I can still smell it on my arm. I actually sniffed my arm more than 100 times today.

Myrrh and amber are two of my beloved notes in perfumes and they always will be. So I have to say, this is one of the top 5 perfumes I've ever smelled in my life, maybe even the best.

Overall, a sweet lovely perfume, made of high quality ingredients, suitable for colder months with a not-so-casual vibe.

Thank you for making this gem!

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Mirra is the third one I have tried from the ADP Ingredient line after Oud and Leather and like those two, I love this one as well. This is a beautiful, powdery spice n Myrhh fragrance.

Top notes are a fleeting dash of citrus and the sharp spicy note of the nutmeg. This spicy nutmeg is joined by a very beautiful myrhh note. This heart phase is just lovely and then turns powdery when the patchouli comes into focus. The dry down is a blend of the myrhh, and powdery patchouli with hints of amber notes. All in all, very clean smelling for want of a better word. longevity is pretty decent, around the 6-7 hour range on me although projection dies down after the first hour into what I would call the ""hugging"" range. I get whiffs of it all through it's scent life so it does last.

In conclusion, I would say if you are a fan of the Myrhh note or of powdery frags in general, this is a good entry with the usual fantastic ADP quality in ingredients and blend. I would say this is Masculine mostly although a woman could easily pull this off too if she does not mind the spice.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"After investigation, the originality of this frag is probably due to a component which is not stated in the parfume pyramid above, myrrh oil, which gives rise to some confusion or questions in the reviews here (honey? creamy? amber? ...).
Myrrh is present here in two forms: myrrh resin (a middle note) and myrrh oil (a base note along with a discrete patchouli).
It's this oily base note which is really dominant and long lasting in this frag.
I should have read the small booklet which is included in the 150 ml box I bought ! It tells it all: no amber as erroneously stated in the pyramid above, just myrrh oil.",08/02/17 09:01,orpailleur
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Applause, what a well balanced and interesting perfume.
I didn't expect otherwise by this house of course.
How to describe this perfume is not easy. It is a compilation of different notes that are not natural easy partners to combine. This perfume is distinctive and also adepts to everyone who wears it.
The opening is a typical Italian based perfume with the the fusion of citric notes. But they are not overwhelming.
The aromatic raisins and nutmeg keep it in balance.
Happily the patchouli is of a good quality so it stays in the background, but gives also balance by its light sweet freshness to the strong fusion of the balsamic amber and spicy nutmeg notes.
This is really a nice perfume for a man who is distinctive but also modest.
When to wear? I guess its a four season perfume:)
Every note reacts different according the season you wear it.
This is a really modern perfume for one who likes class and style in a modest way. It represents in some way the Italian way of life like the Blue mediterraneo series really do.",07/22/17 05:57,osiris5

Mhyrr is a quite complicated scent and ADP is right to give it a try IMHO.
I agree that something is lacking in the parfume pyramid ... could be honey, or also a special tuberose-evocative amber I smell only on some of the parts of my skin after an hour.
I'll try to investigate !
A great frag nevertheless.",05/25/17 03:32,orpailleur
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma masters the blending of aromatic scents, and here they've done it again! In Mirra we have the fragrant and sweet myrrh mixed with aromatic nutmeg and neroli on a pleasant amber base. The myrrh notes came out relatively quickly after the initial citrus blast, and gradually became sweeter over the course of the dry down. Just like any other ADP scents all notes are harmoniously blended. No harsh edges.

The performance is at least 7 hours, however the projection can be a bit shy on cooler days.

I like it a lot, and would say this is a good summer myrrh perfume, which is not that easy to come by!",04/22/17 13:28,pepperoniann
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"A very noticeable bay leaf note is what characterises this leather perfume. And the official list of notes does not even mention it.
It's complex, smokey, mature, elegant, but unique as well. Most people will not be smelling of smoked spices with leather, and this will definitely invite curiosity with its unusual and mysterious projection.
Though it is prominent, it is not aggressive. This is because of its mature, base note heavy presence.
I love it, and find it to be best for cool/cold evenings.
Nothing skanky but not citrusy either.
Smokey, spicy, and a touch of sweetness....",10/31/25 10:37,Katusatya

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is born like stories woven from the threads of time: the first breaths from a luxurious Italian leather bag, exuding the scent of the ancient craftsman pouring his soul into every thread and stitch.
It is not just a leather scent, but a sensual poem that begins with light and completes in shadow.
From the first spray, the Mediterranean Sea breeze rushes through a wave of Sicilian lemon and Brazilian orange, illuminated by red raspberry as a playful smile at the start of the journey.
The freshness here is not superficial; it is a quick light that gleams before the colors shift toward a warmer and more mysterious depth.
At the heart, a hidden garden blooms: soft rose, wavering honeysuckle, and green bitter orange shining like morning dew, while the sound of red thyme rises like oriental spices whispering warmth.
Here, leather appears for the first time, neither harsh nor loud, but warm and soft like the page of an old notebook wrapped in a leather strap, blended with flowers and herbs in a harmony that amazes.
As for the base, it is the climax of the story: a rich, luxurious note, deep and evocative, blended with smoky guaiacwood and the steadfast Atlas cedar.
It's as if you are wearing a new leather jacket that smells of the remnants of a distant winter's fireplace smoke, or as if you open the door to an old library holding leather-bound books pulsating with memories.
It is a fragrance that combines frankness and softness, featuring luxurious leather that harmoniously blends masculinity and femininity.
Performance: long-lasting for many hours, with moderate to strong projection, making your presence felt even after you leave.
Mood: evokes a sense of quiet strength and dignity mixed with elegance, like someone wearing a dark suit and carrying an Italian leather bag on a refined winter evening.
And if Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather is loud and rebellious, then Acqua di Parma's Leather is the polished, aristocratic, quiet voice that doesn't need to shout to assert its presence.
This perfume is the companion of cold evenings and formal nights, where its deep, leathery features shine most splendidly.
Ideal for high-level business meetings, a luxurious dinner at an elegant restaurant, or as a finishing touch for a man who knows how to balance strength and refinement.
In summer or hot weather, just a few sprays are enough to give it space to breathe without overpowering.
Leather is not just a scent to be smelled, but an experience to be told.
It is a statement of luxury, a personal signature written with leather, citrus, and flowers, leaving an indelible mark.
It teaches you that true luxury does not come with noise, but with a deep calm that remains in memory.

So far, only Ford has done this well with Ombre; the rest of the good ones are primarily proper compositions, not leather lollipops like, I guess, Leather Patchouli or Guerlain’s leather take, etc. As I understand, this is some EDP version of a scent already known in the ADP?",07/18/25 05:37,korngoldo

What it does smell like is a rich leather couch ina gentleman's smoking room.....there is a beautiful smokiness like an expensive cigar or cigarettes, mixed with a bouquet of spices such as black cardamom.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The bottle is beautiful, AdP is renowned, and I honestly bought this fragrance because not only am I currently into leathery/smoky/spicy scents, but because this particular perfume has been discontinued, I figure it'd be a sought-after collector's item one day. Unfortunately, as a fragrance, it's not tops on my list in this genre. The opening is rough and unappealing -- it's a mix of leather, used cigarette butts and a little bit of burnt rubber. The mid is a bit more mellowed out and yet still rough because of the over-prominence of the leather note. At that point, it smells sort of in the vicinity of Maison Crivelli Oud Maracuja, but not as smooth, fruity (not that I consider OM to be that fruity in the first place) or strong in performance. The dry down comes much faster with AdP Leather than with OM, which is the longest-lasting cologne I have ever used. When this fragrance finally smells at its best, it's too late -- by then, it's almost a skin scent. It would have helped if AdP had added a vanilla accord, not to make it gourmand but to tamper down the leather / cigarette ash smell a little. AdP Leather isn't bad per se; it's just not that great as a scent, and its arc doesn't properly align with its lifespan.",02/03/25 06:45,UGAMark
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Another masterpeice by François Demachy who gave us the most elegant leather of all time; Dior Homme Parfum. ✨👑 (and like the beloved DHP, AdP Leather is also discontinued 🙄)

AdP Leather is a smokey primal brooding dark leather where the Paraguayan Guaiac wood takes center stage and gives you that dark smokey aspect of a leather accord. 🌫️ 🖤 🌫️ 🖤

It's a true leather fragrance where the leather is always present throughout the fragrance's journey with you. The famous AdP citrus is also here to give it that elegant freshness, preparing you for a dark descent into the primal dark journey of the rugged bold leather accord. This is such a well-blended formulation! The cedar gives it that alpha masculine sharpness. 😎

This smells like you had to do some hard decisions in your head. It is a very serious fragrance, which is why it's leaning very formal. 🤵

Regardless of the listed notes, I get immediate leather and essentially nothing else in the opening. The far dry down has a little woody scent appearing in addition to the leather. This is strictly a clean leather. Not a hint of band aid smell and does not come across as strongly animalic. Overall leather scent is smooth, clean and classy. Seems pretty versatile; would work for formal or casual wear, any time of day, and day of the year outside of very hot days. I have not tested any of the Tom Ford leathers, but will be doing so soon. Should be interesting to compare. Longevity good - about 8 hours for me with decent sillage and projection the first hour, becoming a closer scent bubble after that.",10/27/24 14:46,Smirky

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I own both this and Tuscan Leather.
While Tuscan Leather is the new, designer made leather jacket, Colonia Leather is the jacket that went through a few motorcycle crashes with cigars in its inner pocket.

Imagine this: You are at the Italian coast, starting the aperitivo. The girls order an aperol spritz and the boys a negroni. One guy doesn't want either, and orders a whisky and lights up a small cigar. Everyone looks at him weird. He doesn't care and does what he wants.

THIS is how he smells. As you could probably tell from the length of this review, I am very passionate about this fragrance (and Acqua di Parma as a whole). Perhaps I am biased because I am Italian, but there is nothing quite like ADP available. How they go about their perfumery is pure art, and modern designers could learn a lot from them.

To start: I don't think this smells like Tuscan Leather at all, in the same way that a retro leather jacket is very different from a modern one. This one is more masculine, more rough. It's the perfect combo between that classy Acqua di Parma citrus and the animalic notes from the leather, woods and smoke. Like a man riding a sports bike in a suit :)

I'm not saying that this is 'a better fragrance' than Tuscan Leather, but damn, there is just nothing like this on the market. Tuscan Leather has a few alternatives like Godolphin and that one from Rasasi (they are all worse than TL though), but there is not a single fragrance that captures that Italian masculinity like this one. Besides, it is not redundant to own them both. I reach more for Tuscan Leather when the setting is outside/colder and more for Colonia Leather in warmer settings.

Moreover, I do detect a slight difference between the old Colonia Leather and the new black bottle (I have a decant of the new stuff). The new version has a slightly more prominent raspberry note, but I only noticed the difference when I smelled them side by side, and it would be impossible to detect the difference in the air. I am sure it is caused by the fact my old, brown bottle is from 2018 so it has aged a bit, while the decant is from the newest bottle. It is not worth hunting old bottles, unless you connect sentimental values to it.

Lastly, the fact that people think this is ""hard to wear"" and ""too smokey"" makes me even love it more. This stuff is Italian confidence in a bottle. 10/10.",09/10/24 07:48,sweetymasculine
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Yes, it is in the Tuscan leather lineage but on the lighter and slightly brighter side with a prominent citrus note
Highly wearable and classy",07/06/24 16:30,Vitriol08
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The leather note is incredible right from the start; it is probably the strongest and most natural leather note I've ever encountered (even more pronounced than in the Leather Colonia). This note is very animalic in its naturalism but not ""dirty,"" reminding me more of sun-tanned, rustic, and bronzed leather tools than the smell of a sweaty animal and other bodily odors, as in Kouros.

Edit: It seems this version and the Leather Colonia are exactly the same fragrance. I haven't compared them side by side, but one really reminded me of the other, with strong impressions right from the opening.

From the start, there is a quite smoky oud that brings similarities to the house's Oud & Spice and really solidifies for me that, contrary to what I previously thought, Acqua di Parma is not just about fresher, naturalistic, and minimalist (or barber-shop) fragrances but also has some of the best dark and ""niche"" fragrances on the market.",06/05/24 10:09,danilodeathayde

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The opening felt challenging where every note seems to fight and scream against each other but the dry down is where the magic starts to happen. ADP Leather calms down and starts to exude a slightly sweet, Chinese herbal smelling leather. For me, this herbal quality can also be interpreted as medicinal and also smoky.

This perfume is actually more similar to Gucci Guilty Absolute / Kilian Dark Lord in its presentation compared to Tom Ford’s OM/TL. GGA/Dark Lord also has this herbal/medicine note, but they are less sweet and go for a smokier, dryer and even more herbal route. As a result, GGA/Dark Lord can smell flatter with less depth compared to ADP Leather which has more of a body due to the more balanced sweet + herbal.

Personally, I don’t correlate GGA, Dark Lord or ADP Leather to be a “leather” scent. I feel that TF Leathers are more leather-like to my nose.

Regardless, ADP Leather is a good alternative to GGA/Dark Lord with its more balanced profile. Make no mistake - this leather is still not mass pleasing but it is certainly less harsh and aggressive compared to GGA/Dark Lord. If you want mass pleasing, this perfume is not for you.

This perfume is good value as it can be found for good prices at discounters. It’s certainly an acquired taste which I think GGA/Dark Lord enjoyers can appreciate.

Longevity is similar, if not slightly behind GGA and Dark Lord. ADP leather is a long lasting fragrance. It feels like it sits close to your skin but actually the projection and silage performs well.",01/17/24 04:05,Torky
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"***Blind Buy Review*
Well, after reading all these reviews, and ADP being my favourite brand, I had to blind buy this, it was on sale and felt like missing out on the deal would be a crime.

When i first sprayed this onto myself, i felt that its different, but i did not really liked it.
It is deeper then what I usually use in cold:
darker, more agressive, far from my safe (most of the time synthetic) sweet choices

This feels like taking a long walk somewhere on the countryside on an autumn or winter dawn, it’s dark outside and really frosty, the wind is feeezing cold, people are burning wood to keep themselves warm in their houses, you can smell it in the air.

You get home after your mind has been cleared on the “fresh air”.You became calmer and ice cold inside and out, the leather jacket which suits you so well wasnt warm enough for the occasion, you take it off and while you are trying to put it onto the hanger with your frozen hands.

You Catch a smell…….
Fumy and Rigid smelling shiny black leather, smells like you’ve made some hard choices in your head outside, it is okay, thats the reason why you feel sharper and more pleased with yourself, dont worry you deserved this already.

Unique and natural smelling leather at the same time.
Wear it for harder days, or for a special occasion, maybe when it is windy and cold outside.
10/10 scent with great Longevity and an okay sillage, which could be better but you would probably choke someone out.
I recommend it, but dont blind buy if you expect something uplifting.🙂",01/12/24 14:18,Filepp

What i get is a linear, animalic, sweet leather with a touch of citrus and raspberry...great performer too!",11/27/23 15:34,Andre_p
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is a great fragrance, but I have trouble actually discerning the leather. Everyone says it’s an amazing, realistic leather fragrance, but on my skin, it’s so well blended in with the other notes that I struggle to discern an actual leather note. On the other end, however, I have no trouble sniffing out the rose, raspberry, petit grain, and citrus, as well as some of the thyme towards the back end, and that smack in the face of smoky Guaiac wood which prevails for the first couple hours. Because of how it sits on my skin, I only get about 5 hours of good projection, and it isn’t full bodied enough for it to be a go-to for winter in cold climates, but it’s great above 45*f and under 90*f for me, which makes it pretty versatile. Once you’re safely in the dry down and out of the smoke, I’d say this is office friendly and would definitely distinguish you from your colleagues. It’s mature, sophisticated, and yet still current - it exudes confidence and intellect and it’s just as good on a night out as it is at the mall, in the office, or on a drive through the mountains, so long as you don’t intend to go clubbing

On a side note, this is definitely not a sporty fragrance, I wouldn’t suggest you wear this to the gym, hiking, biking, or even golfing, this is definitely a more dressed up fragrance which requires a well dressed man for it to be at its best

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Leather Eau de Parfum (EDP) by Acqua di Parma is a leathery, floral and woody fragrance.

Unlike the opening of the Leather Cologne Concentree (CC) where the citrus shines and gives it an air of a classic leather cologne, in the EDP version we have a more intense opening in something that seemed to me like a chocolate truffle with one or several fruity notes and leathery tone, almost like shoe polish cream. As time goes by, the rose note increases and comes to the foreground, leaving the leathery aroma as its companion. After more than an hour, a wood base remains with a touch of animalic musk, while the rose and leather remain present.

Leather Eau de Parfum is elegant and formal, perfect for events or special situations and preferably for use between autumn and winter.

Its longevity was good for me, a little more than 8 hours, although the sillage was average.

There are some differences between the EDP and CC versions, mainly in the presence of citrus, which is almost absent in the black bottle version. They are both very good fragrances, but I think I like the Cologne version a little more because it is a little more versatile.",09/23/23 09:08,caifan

When I noticed that the bottles had changed to black, I tried it to make sure it hadn't changed, but unfortunately this is not the Leather I'm used to...

The opening note honestly smells like fish. I've tried it in several different stores in 3 different countries to confirm that it wasn't just a bad batch. Nope. It smells like a fishmonger's leather apron.

Whatever ingredient they've changed, they need to reverse their decision as soon as possible. Once the fishy smell has faded, it does start smelling like the original fragrance - but I'm not sure why anyone would subject themselves to the initial smell.",02/19/23 09:47,zpgnbg
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Heaviest of the batch, oily, fruity faint floral flowing above some brown-ish ‘leather’ as a starter, not animalic at first.

Then you can tell there’s a strong core that’s yet fully exposed. Roses step down and only embraces the leather from afar, the lather note, here a thick dense raw leather is projecting even bigger and louder!

The leather accord is similar to that of la yuqawam, but the raspberry note is less prominent, making it less sweet.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Just because fragrances have the same notes doesn't mean they smell similar or the same. This doesn't smell anything like Tuscan Leather.

This is a smokey dark rough leather fragrance that some might find hard to wear, especially with the opening. However, to me, this is a rich elegant fragrance.

In the opening, you will get a strong but classy smokey dark rough leather with a toned-down raspberry note that doesn't smell sweet or sugary. People that aren't used to rough or strong leather might think the opening smells a bit animalic, but I agree with people that say this smells like a well-conditioned leather seat in a classic sports car.

The scent stays a predominantly leather fragrance through its lifespan but it's tamed down as it develops. To me, you don't get a recognizable rose note but you get the feel of a rose petal. Giving this leather a silky feel, the same as feeling a silky rose pedal.

With the mid and base notes of honeysuckle and cedar along with lingering citrus top notes, this scent dries down to a tame semi-fresh woody leather.",12/02/22 07:53,...Pleasehold
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is fire 🔥 I love this fragrance. If you haven't tried it, get a sample first. It lasts at least 6 hours and the leather and fruitiness lingers. This for me is, 10/10!",11/29/22 17:04,LeeHill
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I thought I was done with this brand after trying almost 10 fragrances which is my usual bar that sets if the brand is good enough to invest in
But here emerges one of the best made fragrances from this house that I rarely hear about
The statement I have about this scent is that it’s one of the best depictions of rugged dirty dark leather you could ever get your nose on
It’s not the best by a long shot but you can definitely align it with other greats such as Tuscan leather and ombre leather
This is what you call leather
I still can’t understand the old fragrances that supposedly are leather dominant and when you smell them all you get is orange or citrus (looking at you bel ami )
Performance is perfect if you have any appreciation for dark leather it’s a choice you shouldn’t ignore",11/22/22 10:19,Fragaddict123
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Leather EDP is a scent that definitely makes its presence felt! The leather announces itself immediately - a dry, dark, slightly dirty leather that crackles with an undercurrent of smoke. I definitely get some BBQ vibes in the vein of Patchouli 24 which gives it a savoury edge. Not quite animalic to my nose but a little rough round the edges, something that may take a while to get used to.

It starts to soften several minutes in as the layers begin to develop. We get a delicious fruitiness from the raspberry, tartness from the orange and lemon and a soft, floral patina from the rose and honeysuckle. Each of these elements adds colour to the leather experience, imbuing it with depth and richness. One gets hints of scents such as Russian Tea and Godolphin.

Leather is a scent that may initially overwhelm but ultimately charms one over with its tapestry of olfactory textures. Projection and sillage are moderate on me but longevity is decent, things eventually moving to an aromatic woody base. It leans fairly masculine and works best in cooler weather. A solid offering from the house.",09/30/22 19:12,nkapped
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I don’t understand how people are getting raspberry and citrus fruits from this. It’s just pure, dark, smoky old leather; and it’s vile.

It’s less intrusive on the dry down but still old and smoky. Not a scent I’ll be associating myself with any time soon.

I prefer Ombré Leather which has the primary cardamom scent with floral notes but the leather is evident. It’s more intriguing.

Edit; 3 days later. I DO get the orange and raspberry scents. The problem I was having was that I was sticking my nose in and smelling it. You need to let this sit and all of the other fragrances come out over time and as it weakens.

Quite nice actually. Still maybe a bit old fashioned for myself, but quite nice.",09/24/22 06:30,Steparko23
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is divine. I love it as it changes a bad mood to a better one. It smells great and performs amazingly. I have Parfum de Marly's Godolphin, but I would not say that they smell alike.",09/16/22 10:57,itsallaboutmega
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Imagine the brown broken-in interior of a properly kept luxury car from the 80s polished with leather conditioner, warming under the sunshine and a touch of petitgrain and tart fruitiness entering through the window.

I much prefer this to both Tuscan and even Ombre Leather, because they feel very much like high fashion leather, jet black shiny leather. On the other hand, AdP Leather feels rounder, more complex, and has a certain depth to it, while still screaming ''leather''.
I find this one is best enjoyed when spraying conservatively, because too much of it has an overwhelming effect. Spraying once or twice max. allows the leather to kind of loom around you and reveals a lot of nuance in the mix, tart, spicy, woody, and herbal facets just kind of radiate through the dense leather and it comes off less jarring and aggressive. The leather also flickers between a smoky incense-y almost charred wood like effect which I personally enjoy.

This is one of the few fragrances from AdP that I thoroughly enjoy and this comes from someone who avoids leather fragrances in general. This one is undoubtedly top of the line for me.

p.s. This is pretty much identical to the brown Colonia Leather flanker. You could honestly just see which is cheaper online and just pick that up without any reservation.",08/24/22 16:50,derby2169
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Dry smoky leather...hints of raspberry and rose, but overwhelmingly smoky leather. I get the burnt smoke others mention, but I also feel it's pretty smooth, despite the hints of ash. I'm not a leather or dark frag person, so not for me and I'm probably not the best judge of what a leather frag lover would like. It's certainly not for those who are not into smoky leather, but I can see somebody enjoying this...maybe a Harley rider in black biker jacket with a marlboro hanging off his lips. It certainly captures the vibe of stern, Harley riding smoker, but in an upscale way.

Scent: 6.5 / Sillage: 8 / Longevity: 7 (8/8/2022)

UPDATE:
Revisiting my thoughts and it's pretty spot on...dry smoky leather. Hints of Fahrenheit gasoline notes. Still not exactly my style, but pretty great for classy, natural, leather lovers.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Thus far I have limited myself to only reviewing fragrances I've used on my skin, as those are the fragrances I have the most familiar impressions of and can authentically comment on after having used them during different times of day, throughout different seasons, and sometimes across different climates. Today, I have broken this rule.

I came across Leather in my adventure of finding new fragrances for my partner. The notes and the description were pleasantly intriguing enough that this ended up being one out of three fragrances from Acqua Di Parma I decided to smell in-store. And oh how wrong I was, because today, I can finally say there is a fragrance I hate. This went straight to the base notes and was a horrible cacophony of strong hard leather and incense smoke.

In my country, the burning of joss paper (or incense paper, or to the Western world, ""hell's banknotes"") is a ritual in our ancestor worship. It is not uncommon to see people burning joss paper in metal cannisters on the streets - mostly in residential areas. I was walking back home with not a care in the world, when all of a sudden I started to smell Leather. I was alone on the escalator ascending a footbridge, and was obviously quite confused to be bombarded with this horrible smell. This was also through my K95 mask. As I started walking along the footbridge, in the distance I saw a man burning joss paper. And that is what Leather smells like to me.",06/12/21 01:26,bergamotted

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Acqua Di Parma Leather EDP opens with a moderate to a strong projection of leather, woody, faint fruit, and floral accords. The opening is mature, intense, bold, but not harsh, elegant, and refined. The leather is by far the most noticeable note, a natural leather, polished, with a suede touch, elegant, not pungent or animalic, and without that combustible or gasoline vibe found in leader prominent fragrances. A step behind is the guaiac wood, a woody smoky, and leathery note. Several steps behind are the raspberry, orange, and honeysuckle, adding a very shy sweet fruit, and white floral accord. The rest of the notes are there to provide support but don’t have any significant participation. The fragrance is linear, all featured notes come up as soon as the fragrance is applied and continue into the dry down. One Acqua Di Parma Leather EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a moderate to a strong projection, leather, and guaiac wood fragrance with faint fruity, floral and spicy accords.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I dunno. Other than being a leather dominant fragrance, I’m not seeing the comparisons to tom Ford Tuscan leather.

Acqua di Parma Leather is beautifully intense - the Leather note almost comes across as a petroleum type smell - with the most subtle kick of sweetness and tangy-ness buried in the background.

I think Tuscan leather and acqua di Parma leather certainly compare when you consider the fact that they are both “harsh” leathers - but in terms of actual smell similarity...I just don’t see it.

I find this to be one of the more unique leathers I’ve come across - and its oddly satisfying. The opening is distractingly harsh - not a “that smells awful” type harsh - more of a “oh shit - maybe i should’ve spayed it once.”

Within 20 minutes or so, the smack in the face wears off - and you’re left with a pleasant, slightly citrusy leather. I would also clarify, that although rose is listed in the notes, it’s not prominent. Again, I would think of a heavy “petrol” type scent when trying to compare this to others. There was one by histoiries de Parfums called Petroleum that kind of reminds me of this. I sold it a long time ago...it was definitely more rugged and less refined than this - but same ballpark.

If you’re a fan of fairly rugged/masculine heavy leathers, I can see this being appealing. To me it’s a very nice Alternative to the standard “Tuscan leather” type scent. I’m a big fan",08/20/20 12:37,picknenders

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"THREE

I went on a mission this summer to try neroli-forward traditional colognes. I hoped to find something fresh that fits a casual T-shirt vibe for Westside LA. I grabbed 5 ml decants of Neroli Portofino, Mandarino di Amalfi, Colonia Essenza, and Colonia Pura and wore them throughout the heat. Pura ended up my favorite of the bunch. The twist is that the whole “neroli cologne” lane ended up reading formal to me. Pura is less formal, which leaves it in a tricky spot. When I want a dressy cologne, I would reach for Mandarino di Amalfi, and for truly casual, I would go outside the lane. I’m sure I’ll finish off the decant next summer, but won’t re-buy.

TL;DR: Easier-going Essenza energy with an ozonic, airy opening, then a smoother floral-citrus where orange shows more than expected, finishing in a clean woody-musk that sits close. Clean, modern, polite. Casual feel in a traditionally formal genre. It does evolve from opening to heart to drydown; not wildly, but enough to feel like a journey. Probably a good wardrobe piece for someone who likes this scent profile, less so for me.

Rating:

Opening: 3.1/5
Drydown: 2.8/5
Overall: 5.9/10

Opening
Early ozonic hit. Petitgrain pushes a clear soapiness on my skin, stronger than I prefer. I had hoped that skipping neroli would avoid that effect, but petitgrain plus white musks and airy florals creates the same “Cheap McDonalds Soap Dispenser” vibe (how my nose reads heavy neroli). It feels like a softer, friendlier Essenza that stays in the classic cologne mold, just airier. As the soapiness settles inside the first half hour, a gentle orange facet unexpectedly comes forward.

Heart
From about 60 to 120 minutes, it is an easier floral-citrus that is smooth and tidy, with a light herbal thread. The coriander note blends with the florals and reads greener than Essenza. It is pleasant and feels purposefully “traditional cologne” while clearly offering a unique take.

Drydown
By hour 5, you are in a clean woody-musk of cedar, soft patchouli, and white musks. It does not project much, but it has more presence than the airy opening suggests. Quietly masculine and easy to carry into evening. The core trace lingers to about 7 hours, mostly at skin level.

Performance on me
Polite, but strong for the genre. About 1.5 to 2 hours of aura, then close to skin. Roughly 5 to 7 hours total, with the last stretch as a subtle skin scent. I’d catch scents of it through the day if I applied it to my wrists if I was hand talking.

Versatility
High in theory and trickier in practice. The DNA says formal, but it wears casual on me. I would use it for a T-shirt-and-shorts creative meeting, although I still prefer other summer picks for that slot.

Use cases
Office days, client coffees, brunch where you want the first hug to smell clean. School events and travel days, anywhere conservative etiquette helps.

Vibe
White tee, good jeans, fresh haircut. It’s clean and modern, but not “too cool”. This is the well dressed guy who's wearing a white t-shirt tucked into jeans with a crew cut. He looks good, smells good, but doesn't have too much main character energy. The cooler dude with messy hair who may be stealing your girl is probably wearing Neroli Portofino.

Blind-buy safe?
No. I think this whole genre requires testing. Won’t perform well enough for some. Florals won’t land for others. Too mature for yet others. Give it a decant if you want a clean, modern feeling cologne that replaces some of the “Floral!” with ozone and aldehydes.

Comparisons
Colonia Essenza: Sharper, dressier, more neroli-forward snap and more obvious soapiness. Pura is softer and airier, a modernized take.
Tom Ford Neroli Portofino: Louder orange-blossom soap. Next to NP, Pura reads less soapy and more airy and orange-clean. Less floral, more white-musk and ozonic.
Tom Ford Mandarino di Amalfi: Juicier mandarin and grapefruit with *mint, basil, and thyme. More sparkly and aromatic in the heart; less overtly soapy than **Pura. Dries down to light citrus-aromatic over musks and woods, while Pura turns cleaner and more white-musk polished.
Dior Homme Cologne (2020): Brighter “iced-lemonade” citrus and better early projection. Pura trades fizz for tidiness.
Le Labo Bergamote 22: Greener, grapefruit-tinged bergamot with a diffusive *musky-woody* halo and a clearer vetiver and cedar second act. B22 radiates more, while Pura stays closer and cleaner. It still has a three-phase evolution, just subtler.

Conclusion

Colonia Pura threads the needle between classic Italian cologne polish and modern, low-key cleanliness. It was my favorite of the group, yet it is the least “me,” because it lives between dressy and casual. If you want that perfect just-showered aura without orange-blossom drama, this nails it. If you want sparkle, volume, or a signature flourish, reach for Bergamote 22, Dior Homme Cologne, or Mandarino di Amalfi. For hot days when you want to look put together without trying, Pura delivers exactly what it promises.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I wear this as a basic cologne... I bought it for my brother for christmas... the salesman at the Bloomingdales was a pro... and for some reason I felt the need to buy this....

Long story short, my brother didnt like it... so I kept it... Im trying to use it all cuz Its a little too expensive to gift to a random person... but smells too basic to give to a friend or family member.

So when I do decide to wear it and I want to smell like a basic clean man... I spray the hell out of it, cuz the bottle is so big... over 6oz of this shit I still need to go through...

Acqua di Parma has some amazing scents... this is not one of them... unless you are a white dude who enjoys a warm glass of milk before bed, then go for it... youll smell ok at the next family wedding you get invited to...

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I received a sample from a mail-order service. While it's enjoyable, I won't repurchase it. I think it's within the unisex range, but the sweetness is high pitch, so someone taking a cautious first step toward sweet instead of rugged probably should start elsewhere. Like many freshies, Colonia Pura doesn't last. To its credit, it's not a repeat of everything. The fruity mixture moves beyond citrus, so it smells more like an oceanside farmer's market. Thus, the bright open is a bit green, ozonic, and marine. The brief later phases are floral, then ozonic again, and woodsy. In addition to being short, the journey is all over the place, if pleasant and evocative. There are two catches: First, this is sweeter than my favorites, so I wonder if I'd find it cloying after repeated wear. Second, the short jasmine stage was potent, so I'd only wear this when staying in instead of risking trouble for people with allergies. Still, if you're looking for something uplifting, brightly sweet, and slightly romantic that might surprise you, I'd give this a try.",12/22/24 12:30,JimmyMisfit

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Went to a store a few days ago (galeries lafayette) and was surprised to see AdP and even more surprised to see that some of their perfumes were available for testing !

Short story, I've been trying to recreate an amateur homemade version of Colonia Pura for years now without pulling of something good. I have quite a few chemical and essential oils to do so. And by essential oils I mean real ones : bio ones from France and Italy. After years of searching, reading and learning the marketing of AdP about this one.

What a deception.
First : this is a two stages scent, citrus for 1 to 2 hours and then soap at skin scent range.
Second : fake, chemical citrus here. Not bergamote, not orange and definitly not petigrain. Having all of them (really good, pure essential oils quality), the opening of Colonia Pura is none of those. Just a disapointing generic chemical lemon, like candy lemon without the sugar.
Third : marketing bullblabla. There is no narcissus, jasmin (who I recognise immediatly for the real essential oil, very strong and amazing, and expenssive. So just Hedione ?), cedar (not atlas, not virginian, not others, so just Iso e super ?), and definitly not patchouli. I don't say they are not here, just you can't smell of feel them. Just soap.
Final : the dry down, after 1 or 2 hours of chemical lemon, just the soap is remaining. Good or bad it is up to you but on me, just a generic hotel lemon soap. The in between is ok you get the soap through the citrus fast but there is nothing else here. No ozone, no flowers. Soap. And after 4 to 6 hours it is turning bad on my skin, almost yuky.

Happy not to have blind bought this one !

Tldr, what a deception for a cologne at that price and marketed so fresh and with some naturals. Not good and definitly not natural, just lemon soap.",10/29/24 03:03,fragrangc

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The opening of this is wonderful, the ozonic note really elevates the citrus, but sadly this pleasant phase lasts maybe 15 minutes. Then nuclear jasmine kicks in, overpowering everything else. Despite having very different body chemistry and preferences, both me and my partner experienced the middle notes as extremely unpleasant and a bit sickening. The jasmine is really persistent and long lasting, I had to wash it off and could still smell hints of it after. I didn't get to experience the drydown. People who have issues with jasmine turning bad on them should stay clear of this.",10/04/24 13:39,twojtrener
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I love this scent. It’s summer. It’s classy. As always with ADP bottles it looks the part too.

Observations about longevity are not unfounded, it’s steady, you need to reapply before lunch and mid afternoon if you want to keep the thing alive, and it isn’t going to fill a room, but it will ooze classy and rich summer vibes to those within your sphere, and that’s ok with me. It will always be in my arsenal, I love it, and those in my life do too… and that’s all that matters. You could reach for this after the gym, at the poolside, on a summer night… it’s an all rounder. It would never be mistaken for generic in my view, it’s too classy and sophisticated for that, too expensive smelling, but it’ll never offend and never let you down…

In terms of the profile, it’s citrusy but has an undercurrent of earthiness and jasmine… it’s vibrant and playful in a way, but really elegant. Others have commented that it’s a chinos and yacht kind of vibe, and I whole heartedly agree with that, and who doesn’t want to smell like they’ve just egressed their yacht?!

Overall, a respectable 8/10, if it projected a little more it’d be a 9 or more, but the score is like the scent, decent, worthy.",08/23/24 15:32,NickTheGreek1
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"#803 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""

I will never understand why anyone spends more than $35 on a citrus freshie and this scent has not changed my mind. I tried every one of the Blu Mediterraneo line. Performance is always terrible for any citrus freshie but those set a new low. Absolute waste of money every one of them. Performed like an $8 Cuba Paris scent. Hell, the Nautica's, Chrome's, Ferrari's, even Adidas performed better. This scent far outperforms those AdP blues, but it's still just a ""me too"" among the hundreds of citrus freshies on the market.

Of the scents I've tried this reminds me of MFK's very disappointing and ridiculously overpriced Aqua Universalis Forte (when they have ""water"" in the name, believe them). You get nothing from this scent you won't get in a bottle of John Varvatos Artisan Blu, a $27 EDT. Projection-wise, by mid-morning coffee break no one will know you're wearing this, though it's a skin scent for 6-7 hours. It's certainly car pool, elevator and office safe, as is every citrus freshie since they're all too mild to offend anyone. But I don't see what you get with this scent that you don't get with a $35 bottle of Chrome Aqua, or a $23 bottle of Armaf Ventana Marine, other than the AdP rep, which based on the nine AdP scents I've tried to date I would to say is undeserved.",08/17/24 07:50,JusttheFactsMan

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This stuff is divine. For what this fragrance does and how it makes you feel in a tropical climate you really cannot go wrong. I first smelled this at Epcot of all places in the Italy pavilion. If you are familiar with the park, then you would know that several of the countries feature fragrance brands from their respective countries of origin. At first sniff I was in love with this juice. It is not crazy complex but very sexy, alluring, and masculine although generally a unisex smell if that makes sense. The retail price is not terribly out of touch, but the price you can get this at on grey market retailers is insane! I got my 100ML for around $62 and I can't see how that could've been a better deal. This fragrance is very adult though in my opinion. I can't see a teen pulling this off. Im in my early 20s and I still feel a little out of place when I wear this sometimes. It's just so sophisticated and grown rich man smelling. This is like all of the best aspects of sunscreen fresh type fragrances but made a little more well rounded with different accords. As far as when to wear this, I would say anytime spring or summer. There's not really a casual vs. formal scent to this. More of a who are you as the person wearing this type of vibe. This is white linen, suede summer walks, and cream colored pants type of vibes to me. Longevity is great but projection is not. People will need to be close to smell this on you, but they will be able to smell you at least 6 hours after application. Fantastic performance for an Eau De Cologne concentration to me. If you can get this for sub $80 and are into what I described above I would say just grab it. You really can't go wrong with this juice. It might even get you a new love interest if that's what you're looking for ;).",06/24/24 22:11,FloridaFrags33
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura by Acqua di Parma is a cherished part of my fragrance collection, embodying both elegance and modern sophistication. From the moment I first encountered its vibrant opening, I was captivated. The blend of bergamot, lemon, and orange greets you like a warm embrace, instantly uplifting and refreshingly bright. It’s not your typical citrus scent; it carries a touch of regal freshness, reminiscent of stepping off a yacht into the sun-drenched Mediterranean.

What sets Colonia Pura apart is its seamless evolution. The heart of the fragrance reveals jasmine, dancing gracefully with narcissus and coriander. This floral bouquet adds a layer of complexity, transforming the initial citrus burst into something more refined and harmonious. The jasmine, in particular, stands out, lending a sophisticated charm without overpowering the composition.

As Colonia Pura settles, the base notes of patchouli, cedarwood, and musk come forward, grounding the fragrance with a warm, earthy elegance. This balance between brightness and depth is what makes Colonia Pura truly special. It’s a modern take on the classic Colonia, paying homage to its heritage while introducing a contemporary twist that feels both timeless and current.

In my experience, Colonia Pura is versatile, suitable for any occasion. It’s invigorating enough for daytime wear, yet sophisticated enough for an evening out. I appreciate how it adapts to different settings, always maintaining its elegant presence.",06/20/24 22:22,zeeworldoffragrance
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The opening is much more floral than the others in the line. The narcissus is quite defining, with jasmine providing a slightly powdery yet very fresh background. The aldehydes curiously give me an aquatic sensation, similar to the aquatic flowers in Eau D'Issey, especially the feminine one.

It's probably the furthest from the original Colonia and has the most modern tones. There's something metallic as well, reminiscent of the metallic-aquatic, fresh, and floral side of Hermès H24.

Over time, the white musk appears and reminds me a bit of the dry down of Dior Homme Cologne (one of my favorite scents). It is the most unisex in the line, leaning slightly towards the feminine, and like the entire line, it is delicious.",06/05/24 10:03,danilodeathayde
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"My impressions after going through a 2ml sample:

The opening smells like spraying Acqua di Sale once and lemon pledge twice in the air. It’s scary how close the cologne dries down like Acqua di Sale and its baby sister Fiore dell’Onda. About 70% there with less of a tangy seaweed note, replaced with a generic citrus scent you’d find on those hand wipes they give you at a fish restaurant.

Pleasant cologne overall. One could say it’s overpriced but considering the overall quality of the juice and lower proportion of aroma chemicals compared to its peers, it’s a well concocted fragrance. Inoffensive, leans feminine but you could totally rock this if you’re an extroverted, happy fellow.",06/04/24 02:37,SmellyBoye
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Fresh laundry hanging under a citrus tree, while someone is peeling an orange next to you. Nothing impressive, but No one around you are going to complain about this scent (unless they hate clean cloths and citrus...). Longevity and projection is pretty good on me. 2 sprays are blasting of my skin for 3 solid hours, until i got wet and dried of with a towel. After toweling off, it's 8-10 inches of the skin projection. Enough to leave an ok scent trail. Pretty good for a fragrance like this.

This is Very Italian perfumery. Soapy clean and refreshing, a hint of spice, and loads of citrus, florals, and woods. Perfect when you want to freshen up, dress down and relax, or dress up in style.

Personal score: 8/10. What's not to like? Citrusy, floral, and woody, is one of the oldest and most loved combinations of fragrance. This has a classic style and a classic scent. Exceptional versatility.",05/31/24 10:33,ZeaMoore4

I can't say old fashioned on this, as I am a fan of old fashioned frags. This one just comes off as a bit dated and irrelevant.

My review is as effete and apathetic as the fragrance and I'm not going to get into my personal experience with this. The notes listed on this Fragrantica profile are 80% correct in their depiction save for waxy musk, wet rocks and the slightest tinge of fish.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,Its nice but it's probably my least favorite from the Colonia line up that I've tried. Opening is an orange blast. Very nice quality citrus which unfortunately doesn't last. The ozonic and florals take over rather quickly. The ozonic notes overpower the citrus. It's ok but I'm not crazy about the ozonic notes. Goes alittle soapy which muddled everything to some extent. Something about how the ozonic motes mix with the florals isn't for me. There's also something slightly sour in here. Acqua di Parma does citrus aromatics like none other. This one unfortunately isn't for me. I much rather prefer Colonia Essenza and Intensa. It's fine but not great. I'll finish off my sample but probably won't get a full bottle.,04/20/24 17:22,3ak
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I’ve been wearing this for the last 3/4 years during spring & summer. I liked it because it got away from your typical citrus freshies. The more experience I have with this, the more it moves into one of my favorites.

Opens ozone, slight citrus, and w/the narcissus note (this is the main note on me throughout). Very light and airy. As it continues to dry down the musk note adds depth.

Longevity and projection are average…5/6 hours. I overspray to increase both.

I am never disappointed when I apply this. Certainly one of their best IMHO. Saying that, this is very different than ADP’s fragrances….I certainly would sample and wear for a day or two before going all in with full bottle.",04/11/24 05:33,MNadz
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,The house is among my favorites for a reason. Cannot imagine a summer without one of their colognes.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"More of a chalky-musk rather than powder.. There is a calm & smooth citric sweetness here mixed w/ the musk that makes me think of Pez candy. I think it may be sweet patchouli creating the slightly strange scent.
@Discardedandroid said- ‘fun dip candy’. Yes the chalky simi-sweet white dipping stick!
As much as I absolutely hate Jasmine- the blending, harmony & softness of notes is extremely pleasing. Care-free vibe 🍃.
Spring time banger. Unisex. Casual.
Soft citrus, ozonic, dewy, soapy-sweet florals that doesn’t smell feminine.

Edit: 3/4/24
So I bought a 100ml.. this batch differs slightly from the sample I had.
It’s more green- specifically petitgrain smelling.. because of this, it isn’t as smooth & sweet. It’s more like a herbal citrus soap.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"It's very lovely and there's not much to dislike despite it being very weak. On a warm day in a linen shirt it's really quite delightful. You can smell the naturals so clearly: Oranges and bergamot with a lovely subtle sweetness and air of sophistication. It's VERY Italian and conjures up images of walking through a sun dappled path in Amalfi with the sound of the sea in the distance and orange trees either side of me. I can hear the birds singing and the air is warm, yet fresh. I'm on my way to a terrace overlooking the coast to have an early afternoon aperitif and a light lunch with great company. Yes, the longevity is bad but it's a cologne and can be reapplied whenever you fancy.",02/06/23 08:42,OllieH163
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This unique scent takes strengths from Aqua Di Parma's Colonia and makes it fresher, floral, and smoother. This scent reminds me of playing tennis in the summer! It can be overwhelmingly fresh on clothing on first opening, but when you let it rest on your skin it is a marvelous scent that will offer lingering floral, citrus, and herbal notes. This scent will be good to you if you are patient with it :)

I most admire the use of Jasmine, Petitgrain, Orange/ Mandarin that make it sweet and floral

the Patchouli and Coriander offer good balance as well

Try this scent as part of your ADP collection, well worth it!",11/28/22 12:51,sukonik

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"A different take on your usual colognes that may not suit everyone. While I do love my usual cologne, I appreciate ones that take on a different route. This one opens with a blast of citruses, but it is mixed with strong ozonic notes and aldehydes. Soon after, Narcissus comes to play and adds a sweet floral note. The dry-down is mostly musk with some woody aspects and very faint patchouli.

For an EdC, the performance and sillage are so good. Overall, it is a really unique and interesting take on your typical cologne DNA. However, I recommend trying it before purchasing a full bottle.",10/22/22 06:53,OmarBlue

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"An ozonic/narcissus flower variation on the OG Colonia ( kind of gave me memories of wearing Givenchy Insensee too ). Very nice...still think Essenza and OG are more my taste but I don't hate them for providing a new flanker. Well-done.
Edit: A reviewer below me compared this to Dior Homme Sport 2021 and yes it has that same steamed and starched white shirt sort of ozonic things going. Worked well in this 70 degree day.",10/17/22 16:07,Manny44

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I have a problem with Acqua di Parma, like with most commercial fragrances apparently - but with Colonia Pura I finally understood what's wrong with AdP colonies: my skin is very acid and highlights all the ""wrong"" notes in every perfume I try. In this case, all the pleasant citrusy and flowery notes quickly disappear and all I'm left with is a very chemical, awful smell that could remind that of a cheap car fragrance.
I had to give up a LOT of fragrances for this reason, and this makes me really sad and frustrated (it happens with very expensive niche Parfums as well!).
Too bad :(",09/20/22 11:58,Acidula
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"For me this more modern version of Colonia beats the original (and Essenza), a very pleasing iteration that I am very happy to wear and smell on others. It still feels traditional but fresher and less soapy in the dry-down than I find with the original.

Out of all the Aqua Di Parma fragrances I still favour some of the Blu range (particularly Mirto, Chinotto and Bergamotto) as they feel a bit more interesting but Pura offers an excellent classic fragrance. Well worth checking out.",08/23/22 06:56,MagicBez
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The citrus in here gives off a sour smell off my skin. But I have had the same issue with light blue intense and in a lesser extent with versace pour homme. So if you have already experienced this, maybe you should expect that with colonia pura.
That being said, it is not a bad scent, it's okay even with this ""sour"" smell, because it is balanced with floral and aquatic notes. If this was mainly citrus, it would have been a problem for me, but it is not the case.

Edit : the sourness issue is fixed after about 20min, now I get a pretty interesting but easy to wear aquatic citrus along with the other notes.
Overall, it is a fresh and clean fragrance, but it is not at all generic, it still smells interesting enough for the fragrance aficionado.",08/17/22 08:38,PLK
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,This is the only aqua di parma fragrance I have tried and it has quickly become my go-to scent for the summer. Wonderful light citruses that can be worn casually but this also has a grown up element to it as well and would be great in the office too without being offensive to anyone. It can be enjoyed in the warm weather by anyone in their mid-20's and up! Very safe fragrance and decent value when purchased from a discounter too.,08/15/22 21:18,cp4044404
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This is the most ""modern"" of the Colonia flankers i have tried (I have not smelled them all). It's very fresh, airy and floral and to my nose 100% unisex. It's always nice when fragrances try a new route and do things in an unexpected way. If I had blind smelled this the first time I tried it I would never have guessed it was a AdP Colonia flanker; there is nothing of the familiar DNA in Pura.

This is a very pleasant and fresh scent for the summer but it took a little while before I could put my finger on why I didn't like to wear it as much as the other Colonias. I then figured out that it's the jasmine that puts me off from wearing Pura. I prefer to smell jasmine on women, not on myself. Pura is to jasmine heavy for my taste. I asked a few female friends to try my sample and they enjoyed Pura a good deal. It's a nice and fresh fragrance for the warm weather, but just not for me.",07/30/22 08:35,Grensfall
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Hmm, definitely the weirdest of the Colonia line I've tried yet. The added ozonic notes to the Colonia formula make me think a little bit of some kind of powdered candy from when I was a kid, maybe it was ""Fun Dip""? Either way it's surprisingly sweet and the ozonic notes behave the same way violet does in that the fragrance becomes very smooth. It's an interesting twist on the original Colonia but for me the twist doesn't pay off. It's just okay.",07/03/22 05:39,discardedandroid
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The deliciously divisive commentary below is hilarious.

Back in 2008 I wore the original Colonia when it was just creeping back onto the radar, and, to echo @Leftofcenter below also felt like Cary Grant himself when I wore it. Despite not usually being a fan of citrusy fragrances, I've always loved ADP's sharp, lemony opening, but not how it evolved on my skin.

Last summer in Rome, I tried Essenza and nearly bought a bottle, but after trying it once more in my native Paris, found it incongruous. Today, I popped into the Paris boutique and spritzed Essenza on my left arm and Pura Colonia on my right and I have to say that Pura is the more intriguing of the two, at least here. The citrus quickly let the aldehydes and ozonic notes forth and they're fascinatingly blended with the musk, to feel both fresh and salty yet cosy and skin-like all at once.

I could see how this could be too adolescent on men, but on this woman it's a wonderfully different fresh summer scent.",06/15/22 09:22,ephemeral
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Summer, Scent: 6,5/10 Opening is citrus, smells like lemon peel. Smells like Turkish kolonya. In the dry down however it gets a bit warmer, perhaps its the cedar. Silage: 3/10 Longevity: 2/10",06/07/22 15:01,SNKIOP
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura was my first ever encounter with the Colonia line from Acqua Di Parma and while it was the first that I tried and fell for, it was Colonia Essenza that I first purchased (I'll review that later, it really does deserve a piece), Pura is fresh, cool and has a really unusual metalic/ozonic quality which to me, makes it a bit more interesting.

The opening is brisk, ozonic aldehydes fizz while bergamot, mixed with orange begin to emerge, it sort of reminds me a little bit of cloudy lemonade with ice. The thing is with Pura, the ozonic notes seem to stay throughout wear, the ozone/aldehydes give the florals; jasmine and narcissus, some real pop and along with a small touch of coriander, theres an injection of extra depth. The ozonic florals lace together in the base with white musk and cedar which wraps up the entire composition beautifully, giving a freshly laundered t-shirt/just out of the shower vibe.

The longevity is good for an EdC, I get 6 hours with a moderate silage. I honestly can see this working well on women as well as men, its perfectly unisex and I think if you're looking for a scent for someone that doesn't generally like wearing scents, this could be one to try. It'll work well for the office, casual wear and I really can't wait to try this one out at the beach too. Personally, I feel due to its light nature that Pura is better reserved for the summer months and I do think that while its well made, it could be a little bit more reasonably priced.
I would repurchase, and I'm glad I got a 100ml bottle since Mr Gin also seems to like this one as well.

Contrary to one reviewer, I am not ""writing lies"" and nor am I affiliated with Acqua Di Parma, I'm just writing out what I smell and what I feel, which we are all entitled to do here.",05/28/22 11:11,GinCatsBooks

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Well, Colonia Pura is definitely a different take on the AdP barbershop genre. It both corrects some of the things I don't really like about Colonia, and introduces new oddities all its own. The word ""Pura"" might make you think this is a ""back to basics"" fragrance. Ha-ha, no, not at all. This is like a ""virtual reality"" fragrance. Interesting, but definitely not natural.

That soapiness in the original Colonia is replaced with a sort of robotic ozonic quality. It definitely smells clean, but less of a ""just showered"" clean and more of a ""just got my car detailed"" clean. There are floral components somewhere in the mix, but they are sort of mystery white floral ""accords"", as opposed to a more specific lavender scent in the original Colonia.

For me, this is a ""like"", not ""love"" fragrance. I think it smells really good, but also rather fake. It seems to tickle my throat and make me cough a bit. Not sure what component is doing that.

It's like the ""auto-tune"" version of Colonia. It can be fun, but I wouldn't want it every day, just as I wouldn't want auto-tune in every song. Acqua di Parma, feel free to use these synthetics as a tool for effect from time to time. But don't think you can replace the old ways entirely without anyone noticing.

Anyway, it's worth a look if you are into fresh, masculine, citrus, herbal (or robotic) fragrances.",03/22/22 19:24,S_Mazza
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I have read that people compare this with the original colonia. This however doesn't smell like the original. However this is a modern fresh masterpiece.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The ozonic note is really offputting to me. I bought a 100ml bottle and enjoyed it at first, but it, unfortunately, became the only fragrance I own that I dislike.

The sweetness + the ozonic note is nausea-inducing. My fiancé also felt nauseous from the scent, which is crazy to me!

I actually thought I had bad juice, but I got it with the body wash and deodorant. Since these 3 products smell the same, I am assuming the juice is not bad.

It would be great if the ozonic note was not there...

Very sad. I will sell my bottle.",12/08/21 12:56,thiagovidotto
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I love the Acqua di Parma Colonia range but there are several different variances of it so it's confusing to know which is which. Each of them are subtly different from one another but all are very nice. One of them is my favourite but I haven't tested it in a store for 3 or 4 years and can't remember which one it is! Maybe this one. Next time I get to test the range I need to make a note of it! Anyway, the one I favour is almost as beloved by me and almost rivals the now, tragically, discontinued Tuscan Soul so at some point I'm going to get myself a bottle! The Colonia range is definitely suitable for men and women, although I'm sure some women may not find them 'sexy' enough for them to wear. I'm a Gemini though so I'm more than happy to wear unisex fragrances and 'different' fragrances and, thank god, don't have a preference for stenchy, nausea inducing stink bombs!",10/18/21 12:29,Kittycat63
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Another ""meh"" from the Colonia line. The original is a weak skin scent, this is a bit better but not much. Different smell profile, more orange zest I guess, a bit deeper, woodie (prob the cedar) but they are both so weak.. and for $125 USD for 100ml, no way.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful and bright exit. Citrus and airy, bright, energizing and you already perceive that it is not the same as the other colonies in the house. A good modern but classic remake, adaptation of the master Demachy to the demands of a perhaps younger clientele.
I like it a lot because without forgetting its family DNA it is different and balanced, a magnificent fragrance for heat or temperate climates, but even in autumn it can give play.
On my skin it performs better than classic or intense, without forgetting that it is still an eau de cologne.

Would not recommend, unless you want to smell like toothpaste.

Ok, that toothpasty smell goes away in about 45 minutes, but then it smells almost the same as Colonia Essenza, but then a bit spicier. Hmm. Then it's just expensive hotel soap, which is nice, but not as a perfume!",07/21/21 09:46,Eiland

First, they don't carry it at any stores in my city and second, I heard it compared with Aqua di gio, which I have never liked.
I got a sample with another order and shortly afterwards, I bought a bottle.

Opening is fantastic. Bright realistic citruses and aldehydes. Drydown retains some citrus and adds some semi soapy creaminess with musk.. Excellent versatility. Not a great performer, but not as bad as I was expecting. Smells great on skin and clothes. I got about 4 hours sweating in brutal Texas heat.

This is also very cheap these days! I picked up 100ML tester for 40 dollars.
100% worth checking out; just know that you'll need to carry an atomizer.

Considering the allegedly poor longevity of this one, I bought the biggest bottle and was surprised by the lasting power of it.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"For hot, sunny goes at adult life, Colonia Pura is tough to beat. It doesn't smell juicy or even squishy at all to me, it smells dry and firm, unripened, but so beautiful that Colonia Pura would be worthy of buying a nice even number like 4 and leaving them on the sunny part of the counter for a few days to get into later even though they still don't seem ripe, but this Airbnb is only here a few more days and you wouldn't want to get the car all sticky in case the Colonia Puras surprised you with ripeness the second you remove them from the air conditioned accomodation. Whatever, just bite one. It's not ripe enough. Whatever, just get in there and eat it. Then you eat all 4, you remember what that much citric acid does to your esophageal tract but don't feel guilt because you're radiating citrus, granting those nearby +2 antioxidation. Colonia Pura smells like that, mixed with an authoritativeness one might not be able to back up. On me, it smells like I'm the disappointment.

I have however order it again because it is great: a twist to the original formula with more floral making it very pleasant and unisex. Not soapy (like Colonia or to some Essenza) but still retains the classic DNA.

Niche quality fragrance that if you look around is available also at good prices (even major outlets run discounts, I wouldn't trust Ebay or alike).

It is one of the best of the line and the Narcissus flower is just beautiful. If you are looking for something more masculine then Essenza or Intensa would be the best ones but as a man I still enjoy switching to this one from time to time.

A day at the beach.

That's what this fragrance embodies. It smells like a mild suntan lotion with a citrus zest;
the smell of the ocean lingering on the horizon.

Almost like a day's temperature at the beach, when this fragrance stays mild it is truly wonderful stuff. However, as the hours pass the scent intensifies and it becomes a little too much, bordering on annoying.

In my opinion, this isn't a blind buy. This is the definition of a unisex fragrance. Once the citrus notes fade away and the floral notes come to the forefront, the scent becomes quite feminine. Definitely try it out first to see if the beach life suits you.",05/02/20 13:37,LukeS
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The first time I smelled Colonia Pura I didnt like it much and, probably because I focused on its metallic dimension, I found it quite artificial. However I decided to finish my decant wearing it throughout this past week and I have to say that I have change my mind completely. Obviously the 'metal' feeling was still there but I ended founding it quite comfortable and appealing.

The smell is dominated by aldehydes and floral notes which makes it quite unisex, the citrus notes are nothing like obvious and coriander and patchouli are definitely there though measured out perfectly. The whole is bright and transparent, appropriately named Colonia Pura, and has a surprising tenacity, staying almost the whole day with you.

Disclaimer: personally I dont like colognes with so much longevity, 5-6 hours is enough for me, if I am comfortable with the scent I prefer re-aply it, too much longevity may be sometimes a bit tiresome and this is happening to me with Colonia Pura.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This is definitely unisex. As a woman, I love this scent for the summer. The orange-bergamot opening is so refreshing (perhaps a bit bitter-but I like it) in warm weather. It’s a light scent, and the projection is light; I don’t think it could cut through cold air well enough to make it a viable winter scent. I’m not sure this would be a standout for me, if I was a man. It does hold some of the generic characteristics of a men’s citrus cologne. However, it is special as a woman because our summer fragrances rarely have this cedar-woody/musky dry down. The patchouli doesn’t really show up for me, which I prefer.

For a man, perhaps good, but not great.

For a woman, a perfect summer scent.",02/26/20 07:49,my2scentsmore

It's fresh and elegant; daffodils and jasmine, with a hint of ozonic melon. The creaminess that others mention is definitely there, too. Just a truly wearable, uplifting fragrance that pulls off the trick of being both airy and persistent; one that's not so easily done. More women should give it a go.",02/11/20 06:58,Layla54

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura is an aromatic fougere. The opening is lush with aldehydes, brazen on the classic Colonia DNA of barbershop botanicals and musk. An Old World aroma—with its legendary complexity that's so easy to get lost in.

Neroli, orange flower, lavender, and vetiver—laced atop a deep, heady musk which begets the flagbearer of masculinity. Classically this was done so alongside an accord of citruses—which seem entirely missing in this formula.

Odd that the Colonia fragrance is so renowned amongst men, as I personally always had the creeping feeling that the botanical aspects were a bit uncomfortably feminine, and the citrus and musk just attempts to cover this up.

The addition of aldehydes here certainly doesn't do anything constructive for this. It blends with the floral aspects to give the fragrance an immensely greater feminine aura. The musk however is still very prevalent (and anything but feminine), so this is still not something that I could recommend for women.

Something intriguing—I noticed that the aldehydes seem to get quickly cannibalized, and don't retain their standing very long in the formula. In a fresh bottle their presence is almost overbearing throughout, but in just a little time, it's hard to detect them outside of the opening. There's only a noticeable glaze atop the oversoul of the fragrance.

Not sure what difference that makes for the orientation, but I guess that would make this a very high-maintenance fragrance to keep for whoever it might appeal to.",10/27/19 18:40,ReapThaWhirlwind
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I have been debating purchasing a decant of this for a long time. Acqua di Parma is my favorite house, but the reviews below made me hesitant. When I finally pulled the trigger and smelled it for the first time, I was surprised. This is unlike any other Colonia flanker. First, this feels like the first Colonia targeting a younger crowd. I can see anyone between 18 and 30 pulling this off really well. Of course, anyone older than that can also wear it. Secondly, this is their most mainstream, ""designer-like"" Colonia to date. Thirdly, this somehow retains the Colonia DNA. I can smell the trademark AdP citruses in this that connect it to Essenza and the OG.

It is very pleasant to wear and I think I would love wearing this in the summer heat. It's simple and elegant. Unfortunately, I already have a fragrance, Dior Homme Cologne, in this exact category of fragrances and which accomplishes the same thing. Imo, owning both would be entirely redundant, even though they don't smell the same.

If you are looking for a signature scent for the hot summer months, I highly recommend considering a citrus/musk combination. Compare AdP Colonia Pura and Dior Homme Cologne and see what you think. They're both fantastic.

EDIT: just realized that Francois Demachy is the nose of both AdP Pura and DH Cologne. Go figure.",10/10/19 07:49,agonzony

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This is what I had hoped Bvlgari's Aqva Amara or Cartier's Roadster Sport would smell like. It's an orange-driven fragrance with an aquatic, aqueous sort of sheen and a cooling herbal edge which I interpret as mint despite the fact that it's not one of the officially listed notes in the pyramid. There are some light floral qualities and that clean, bitter-soapy citrus embellishment of the petit grain, giving it a slightly formal, ""white button down,"" impression, reminiscent of more classic eau de colognes . But overall, Pura is an easy wear, and something that can be thrown on casually or feel right at home in a more dressy situation. In fact, it seems like something that would be great to wear to a summer wedding, when the the thought of dutifully sweating it out in a tux keeps you from reaching for those heavier, darker fragrances. Performance is solid, with about 5-7 hours of longevity with good projection for 3. What I enjoy about Pura is its focus on orange, which is a nice departure from the more common citrus notes--it conveys the mandarin with a confident, unapologetic presence and in turn gives it distinction. Paired with a cool, green, herbal quality resembling mint, we're left with a fragrance that is both refreshing and relaxing to wear. Thumbs up and worth sampling. For now my rating stands at 8.5/10.",06/12/19 05:18,Buysblind

Description on the sample card:
A radically fresh fragrance, delicate and bold, which embodies the most modern side of Italian lifestyle. The spicy notes of coriander are combined with the classic citrus notes of cologne.

It may not smell niche, it may not be unique, I totally agree on that. However, I feel that it's been formulated in an interesting way, as it kind of smells metrosexual to me. I can definitely see it being used by a lady as well, but it's got that feminine note that actually works on a man too. A modern re-formulation of the original Colonia, just like some say.

Love the citrusy/floral notes, of which I'm generally a big fan. It's a spring/summer fragrance only, I would say. Very fresh and clean.

To me, it smells a little spicy on the opening, but it gets very pleasing on the dry down.

Aldehydes and the Acqua Di Parma citrus; a little musk. I get a hint of white florals, a slight soapy vibe and a metallic touch. Pura smells like a modern take on the classic Acqua di Parma concept

Average projection and sillage; lasted about seven hours before becoming soft. Just fine for work and not really sexy. I'd say it's unisex leaning masculine and for hotter weather. This isn't horrible but it smells like too many designer scents out there; not very creative. The aldehydes are almost headache inducing for me.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Review of EDC:
As a long time fan of ADP and having sampled practically their entire range over the years (including soaps, shaving foam, shower gels etc.) my initial emotions after trying this were disappointment, followed by sadness and then something bordering on anger.This is a lovely scent, it just doesn't last!
I mean that sincerely, the longevity is very poor and when you consider the price of this, it's actually outrageously awful.
I'd place the original Colonia is my top 10 fragrances, even though I wear it less and less these days, it's still a scent I hold close to my heart and so I was of course, attracted to this new offering and intrigued to try it out.
I remember the days when nobody in my circle had heard of of ADP and I felt like Cary Grant himself when I wore it. Slowly but surely, the range increased and then the rate of productions progressed to the point whereby I can barely keep up (or even care to). What was once an indulgent and gratifying online purchase (i'm in UK not Italy) only to be found on the unobtainable shelves of Harrods and Selfridges suddenly became omnipresent in stores such as John Lewis, overnight ADP was a mainstream scent. So what? Now it was easier to obtain and once i'd overcome my snobbery, I could only see the positives.
Sadly, the quality and innovation seemed to drop off as I made my way through the new issues from this house. I could forgive the Blu Mediterranean range as some of them smelled nice (Mandorlo Di Sicilia for one) but they kind of left me unimpressed with their variations and longevity.Then came Oud, Leather and others in the brown bottle which i cannot recall now and they made me question the price to quality ratio for the first time. The only ADP i've found to have substantial longevity / projection are Colonia (original) Intensa, Essenza, Quercia and perhaps Assoluta, although I never gave that much of a run as i found it too feminine for my tastes and sold it on pretty quickly.
As much as I love this house, I have to admit that I don't hold it in as high regard as I once did.
I sampled Colonia Pura and Quercia at the same time and although I liked both, I loved Quercia and so plumped for that one. Rightly so I feel, as that one at least gets through a day and it a much more complex scent.Still, I couldn't resist the shower gel of Pura when I saw it at a decent price, the writing was already on the wall and I was forced to confront my denial. The shower gels have never been anything but a brief and expensive indulgence, they don't really carry any scent once out of the shower, but at least I know to expect that. Considering the retail price of Pura, i'd expected more and would never plump for a full bottle, despite the fact I like it, simply for the fact that it's not superior to the original Colonia in any way and is one of the worst performing scents from the entire range. The reviews below claiming 9 hours longevity are laughable and extremely suspect. I'm about as far from an ADP hater as could possibly be (I even considered their bathrobe at one point!) but sometimes you just have to say it like it is and put aside personal bias.This is weak..pleasant, but oh so weak.",07/06/18 01:30,Leftofscenter
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This Fragrance is very different from the other Colonia variances. It is not as powerful and explicit as the others and more just a fresh summer cologne. That is why it probably will dissatisfy a lot of ADP users.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"With each new release, Acqua di Parma is committed to producing products of lower quality each time. With the classic Cologne reformulated and a lot of pitiful launches (for me, Essenza was already pretty bad), now this? Was it really necessary?

This looks more like an Invictus fresh flanker than an AdP. Loose, synthetic, insipid. With a performance that makes the classic colony look like an oriental perfume. Little more I will comment. Yes, the price, well ...

If this is done by Paco Rabanne as flanker of Invictus, he fits perfectly and everyone who is involved in the forums of perfumes, then give him sticks.

It has about 15 initial minutes that can be pleasant, mixing citrus with a sweet / aquatic note, but the perfume dilutes absurdly and after that phase, there is hardly anything interesting, except the typical synthetic and totally generic white musk.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Pura is manifestly modern. A brilliant effervescent take on Colonia.

As expected of an AdP release, Colonia Pura opens with that typically magnificent citrus accord. Here though the citrus is light, lurid and very unlike the original Colonia; the orange and petitgrain are sharp and acidic but transparent as if carried by a cool sea breeze on a scorching day. I suspect there are aldehydes at play here, lending that transparent and slightly metallic edge to the citrus. Coriander too imparts a cool sharpness that carries through to the middle.

In the middle, Pura really comes into its own, omitting any floral/herbal similarity to Colonia. Jasmine sambac and narcissus, both typically heavy and heady, are rendered less potent as petitgrain taints them green. This green floral accord sits atop the still spicy coriander and airy aldehydes of the opening, though the aldehydes are more distinctly metallic now than before. As patchouli and cedarwood begin to form the base, white musk again lifts the composition to airy heights when it might be expected to go the other way.

Very pleasant overall. Colonia Pura manages to be fresh, sharp and natural without ever veering overtly sweet or cloying as some Colonia flankers can. This is sure to be a spring/summer staple in my wardrobe.

Longevity is moderate at 6-8 hours, sillage is moderate also.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"DNA of the original colonia, but with less flowers like rose. Pura is salty and the citruses are natural like fresh pressed limes. I also get a minty note in this one, but its not listed. It may be another green note, but the perceived smell to my nose is mint. Reminds me alot of a creation from atelier cologne actually. Or if you have tried Renaissance from Xerjoff, Pura is similar but lighter, especially on the mint note. This is sharp and crisp vs the original plus essenza which are more smooth and round with a little sweetness.

Not much more to say. Very nice sparkling citrus freshy with good quality ingredience. Actually one of the best citruses I have tried.

It's more versatile and enjoyable than classic colonia that is, in my opinion, more serious, for special occasion, not really young.
The only cons is that is not very long-lasting. But it regain strength just wetting a bit the skin with few water drops. But it's a EdC, I'm quite surprised that someone complains about that on their reviews, they should be aware of that.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Being an impulsive fraghead and a sucker for bargains, I ordered the 180ml bottle after I did a single testing from a department store and liking it. After several wearings over the weekend, I agree with philball that this is a mediocre release and with Bluslippers that there are better ones in the Colonia range than Pura (Essenza for instance).
Using 6 sprays, performance is less than 3 hours on my skin in mostly hot outdoor setting but surprisingly getting whiffs of it every now and then even after 5 hours which should be coming mainly from my clothes. What I get is a pleasant, unique enough soapy scent that leans masculine which should have been more than Ok if it actually lasted for at least 6 hours. Oh well, my only consolation is that it cost me around the same as a discounted 100ml decent designer bottle and it will serve its purpose as my first full bottle of ADP in my collection.
Will test this in an air conditioned setting these next few days and will update this review. Will do as much spray as needed to make it work. I got the 180, remember?

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"In response to Amen Corner, I tried this fragrance for the first time this week and I felt quite disappointed. To my nose, it was fairly generic; a light, nondescript citrus with a dash of spice - aimed at a younger crowd. Certainly not offensive but far from outstanding either. I would call this fragrance safe and commercial - okay for the cheaper, designer end of the market but not worth the AdP label or price.

However, what was most disappointing was the performance. Barely there once sprayed and completely gone in little over an hour. An over-priced tonic water and AdP's weakest fragrance yet. I know it's a cologne but for £100 a bottle, I really would expect more.

It's probably safe enough for a blind buy but it doesn't step far from a well-worn, mass-market appeal, path so don't expect too much. Personally, I think the new Dior Homme Sport is better than this, it certainly performs better and it's cheaper, although, even the Dior isn't anything overly special.

I was so looking forward to trying this, after seeing the note breakdown above and owning several AdP fragrances myself. Oh well, I guess that's what happens when a conglomerate gets its hands on a fine-perfume house and I shouldn't have expected anything more!

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"It starts with brief citrus. Nice. But very brief citrus. Then nothing. No original Colonia-style herbs, no lingering neroli like in Essenza. Then some weak, indeterminable florals appear. But not strongly enough. Then a dosage of 90s-style, aquatic aromachemicals, presumably the ozonic accord. One tiny step away from calone! (Eek!)

Then it's shifts to a smoother, ambroxan-type accord (or what I thought was ambroxan) but which must be the musk. It starts off a little sickly for me, to be honest, but then mellows, and aside from the fleeting citrus is the best bit.

All in all, it smells suspiciously to me like an aquatic - citrus, woods, watery aromachemicals. They could've called it Acqua di Parma Acqua or Eau Fraiche.

Unbearably unisex. No dominant floral or woods. Chance would be a fine thing. No real smell. A mere suggestion of a scent. Perhaps they're aiming for the younger man or the teenage market. It's a country mile away from 1Million though.

All they need to fully mess up their heritage is to do is a gourmand version. Yuck!

Seriously, I do worry that these guys have taken too much of an advantage of their recently (re-)found success in the market - one scent in nearly one hundred years since 1916 - and then waaay too many flankers.

I tried it from a good few sprays on one arm in John Lewis. A second visit might discover something different but I doubt something 'new'.

Anyway, when I left I sprayed Aramis on the other arm afterwards. Haha.",08/11/17 10:57,Jareth
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I wore this a few times and must say I love Colonia Pura. A perfect MODERN cologne of a high quality. A 100% Demachy style. I always praise him for this ability to catch the trend and he did it again.
Colonia Pura is a journey from the bergamote / bitter grapefruit peel to the oceanic salty molecules on a slight ambroxan base. Despite the salty elements the fragrance doesn't smell as Heeley Sel Marin or something like that; it's still of a citrusy genre and the oceanic part gives it contemporary vibe.
I emphasized the word ""modern"" as Colonia Pura nothing like the regular Colonia or Assoluta/Intensa/Essenza. So do not expect it to be a lighter version of Colonia. On other hand, Colonia Pura has been done for the generation of Le Labo Bergamote 22 lovers, that beautiful grapefruit/bergamote/ambroxan concotion. And I do find a big resemblance to Bergamote 22; a 2,5 times cheaper Bergamote 22 with salty elements added. That's a dream of those who are looking for cologne of nowadays!",08/09/17 10:51,antonpan
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This opens with a beautiful, full-bodied, zesty orange note with a dash of sweetness. I'm not sure if it's the aldehyde notes, or the sharp bergamot, but something gives the citruses in this an effervescent quality, very fizzy. It's very pleasant. The base seems to consist of light musk and florals. The citrus aspect never completely fades.

This seems to be a bright citrus in the opening, drying down to earthy florals. It's not blended quite as well as Essenza or Assoluta.

Now, it reminds me of a few fragrances, I can't put my finger on what exactly, but it's quite strongly reminiscent of Chanel Allure Homme Sport to my nose.

Main notes to my nose are orange, bergamot and petitgrain.

Longevity is about 5-6 hours with projection for 1.5 hours on my skin.

I'll keep using this and will give a more concise review down the line.

So far it's good, but not great. Smells very designer and mass market, but the performance doesn't seem quite up to scratch.",08/07/17 05:09,kelkyang
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Nor can I as a fan of Acqua di Parma. Only know this house since last year Spring. But it is already my second best house.
I don't have the original Colonia because of it's weak performances, but Essenza, Assoluta & Intensa and Bergamotto di Calabria are all in y top 10 Spring/Summer fragrances.
Mandorlo di Sicilia & Intensa are more for Fall/Winter.
So I would love to have a kind of the original if with better performances.
Since it will be launched only in September, does it mean it will not be a fresh Spring Summer fragrance like the original?
Also I would like to know who has rated this fragrance already? Would that be real connaisseurs? Professionals?",07/02/17 03:08,Louismanuel
Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"From the heart of the Italian house Acqua di Parma, Camelia is born as an olfactory hymn celebrating the purity of beauty and the calm of elegance.
It is not a loud fragrance … but a quiet presence that touches your senses before it catches the eye ...
A scent that whispers rather than shouts, seen through emotion rather than sight.
Camelia is part of the Signatures of the Sun collection, a line that translates the radiance of the Italian sun into refined fragrances built around rare ingredients.
The world first met it in 2019 as an Eau de Parfum, crafted just as Joelle Lerioux Patris envisioned.
Its opening notes sparkle like dew: Italian bergamot, young mandarin, a dash of pink pepper like morning spices, and cardamom as soft as nostalgia.
At its heart lies the camellia flower ... the undisputed queen of this perfume ... gracefully centered, wrapped in herbal sage that adds balance between delicate florals and green freshness.
The base settles into a whisper of benzoin and clean, white musk, leaving a sheer, silk-like trace on the skin.
Camelia is a summer, daytime scent ... ideal for casual or light formal wear.
Perfect for air-conditioned workdays, a quiet midday stroll, or simply as a “clean fragrance” after a nice shower.
Its projection is intimate, close to the skin … never intrusive, lingering gently for 4 to 6 hours before it fades in a soft silence.
In short, this perfume suits those who adore simplicity ... scents that don't pretend to be anything but honest.
Yet … it's not for everyone.
It's for those who appreciate quiet detail and seek a feeling, not a performance.
""True beauty doesn't scream ... it’s quietly noticed.""

Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Both Japanese and Italian. Flower petals with ambery depth, and a few drops of the classic Colonia Orange/Jasmin old-world magic. (I suspect AdP drops a bit of their original scent in everything they create). As it develops, orange becomes more and more prominent to my nose, and it's the orange I like the most : paired with woody notes and a balmy benzoin, but still radiating sunshine. I think I sense it so strong because I know it.
But then again, the star, the camelia, like a paler and greener rose, brings even brighter daylight over the balanced complexity of this fragrance, making it deceivingly simple and minimalistic.
All this somehow reminds me of the softness of a photographer I really like, Rinko Kawauchi. Especially an album called Semear that she did after travelling in different Brazilian cities where a great deal of Japanese immigrants were established a century ago. All those supposedly intense colors she saw, and somehow managed to give them that dreamy Japanese softness without forcing it, naturally. I imagine if she went to Italy, Camelia would be the result.",08/31/23 16:03,iris
Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Not overly impressive at first - as others have mentioned, there’s a definite rhubarb note. I think it improves on dry down to a mild citrus / floral. Projection and performance not great, though. I picked up a large bottle during lockdown at a 75% discount - so not particularly concerned.",03/20/23 14:35,Gorta
Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I was testing perfumes in store and ADP haven't really appealed to me before. I sprayed this one and I was curious about it... I liked it, but it also wasn't the sort of thing that I'd really buy.

I still was smelling myself on the way home and made a note of it on my phone, as it's rather expensive and I usually wait for discounts. There was just something about this one. So I did find an offer on it, on an eBay perfume store. I was expecting to really regret the purchase.

So anyway. Upon first spray, it's a musky citrus on me. I see the cardamom note and I think it's there, very well blended. It transforms into a fresher citrus and the clary sage comes out then. I think this almost smells a little bit like tea, but it's hard to define. I'm a jasmine lover, but it doesn't play in the way you expect it to here, it almost helps to keep the other notes smoothly blended.

While this isn't weak and the notes are hard to become anosmic to, it's not meant to be an offensive powerhouse. I won't describe it as intimate, but it's a subtle, comforting scent.

The longevity is what lets this fragrance down. Many of my more mainstream and cheaper scents last longer. It lasts a few hours on my clothes.

I'd say this fragrance leans feminine to my nose, especially on my skin.",12/27/22 10:34,KevinTheCarrot
Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Rhubarb with soft woody under tones. Leans more towards the feminine but a confident, classic dapper Dan can pull this one off. It has a peppery Jo Malone feel and in the same context linea scents which are underrated can become classic gems well worth converting. If you like rhubarb without the usual vanilla gourmand cliches them this is the one for you.",12/24/22 20:40,Ed Winser
Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I get a sharp, citrussy rhubarb here - is this what camelia smells like? The rhubarb note is really distinctive to me! Super tart citrussy, with a floral peony like heart. I get the spiciness too underneath, and some creamy powderiness, but also, sadly some kind of synthetic concoction which is not agreeing with my nose. I'm comparing this with Roger Gallet The fantasie, as it is said to be similar, well it definitely is not - in my opinion RG The fantasie is far better, much lighter, more tea and lemons and aromatics, and zero synthetics. That said, if you love the tart fruity feel or rhubarb and your nose isn't sensitive to synthetics, this can be a nice one too.

Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Definitely it’s a very soft refined sweet floral fragrance but I wouldn’t say very feminine. The floral note is more sweet aromatic floral, almost like hint of light honey like sweetness and I smell also some kind of sweet soft and round woody note that is probably coming from benzoin and musk. Camelia itself doesn’t normally have fragrance like rose but probably it’s an aroma chemical that mimics like rose and it’s done very well. Opening is fresh with citruses and pink pepper but transitions to this very comforting sweet floral aroma that gives you a whiff every time you move around. It’s like you’re present in a simple and modern luxurious spa. The silage and longevity are softer but not too bad. This fragrance is not for screaming loud but to have a relaxing and comforting ambiance around you so it’s so pleasant and enjoyable. Well done! 👍🏽👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽😻",02/13/22 18:50,1universe

Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"A soft and pretty floral scent that is very easy to wear and to like. The rose is dominant but is a “pink” kind of rose, not the deep dark jammy kind. It does evoke the image of a camelia in bloom, but not the scent of a camellia (tbh, camellia does not really have any scent).",11/05/19 12:27,Fragandalf
Camelia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This one starts off with a fresh burst of freshly cut lemon, but no lemon is shown as part of the notes. This must obviously be a combo of the bergamot and mandarin. The camelia flower is there, but in the background. After about 10-15 minutes the bergamot and mandarin settle and the camelia rose becomes more prominent. It's a very unique smelling elegant scent, but I would say it leans a little more feminine because of this rose.

The fragrance died after 2 hours and became a skin scent. Not really a scent for me, but others might enjoy this one more.",09/16/19 10:43,Armando_approved

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Arancia La Spugnatura Acqua di Parma,"The best release of 2023 for me personally.

I love citrus freshies anyway, but I think this might be my favourite straight up citrus forward fragrance ever. I basically just get the citruses but with very light touches of sweetness and creaminess, but the orange/mandarin easily stand out above everything else in the mix.

Longevity is excellent for this type of fragrance, citrus heavy fragrances don't tend to last all that long, but on clothes this lasts all day. On skin it's about average but on my t-shirt I was still smelling it in the night after spraying it on at 8am and being in work all day.

Named due to the process of rubbing the citrus fruits against a sponge and draining the infused oils. This seems to have done wonders for the longevity of the citruses within this fragrance, as well as how great they smell.

This is a stunner and perfect for hot/warm summer days, and totally unisex.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Arancia La Spugnatura Acqua di Parma,"Tested on skin twice. Initially I dismissed it as a less impressive version of the original.I love the original, but performance is terrible. Tested again today and liked it more than I originally did..I picked up some soapy musk and wood in the base which I didn't notice the first time. The citrus is on full blast in this one. I hold the original Arancia Di Capri in high regard and this feels unenessary and uninspired. Need to test side by side but longevity seems boosted by an aroma chemical, but it's still poor. You will need to spray the living hell out either Arancia to get them to have any legs. Ideally, carry a decant.

Performance isn't a deal breaker for me, it goes with the territory. I LOVE the house of ADP, and I've owned many, but I've still never paid full retail for any of them. 50 bucks for 3.4oz is the sweet spot for the Mediterraneo class, and ideally, try to get 5 or 6 ounce bottles because they go fast. Anyway, yeah, this feels like a waste of creativity and resources. @ Acqua Di Parma, if you're listening, please bring back Ginepro and Cedro, and stop messing around with silly flankers in pretty bottles. You're better than this.

Initially they are near identical, however this fragrance seems to stay stronger for longer and slightly more ""full"" but the core smells are the same. I also feel that the woody (cedar) dry down is a bit more prominent after a couple of hours too.

There’s a gentle warmth that makes it more wearable.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Thanks to a recommendation from another reviewer, I decided to let this scent mature for about 3 weeks. Initially, it was quite underwhelming and I almost gave up on it. All I could pick up was a metallic musk with just a hint of fig buried underneath. But now it has become much more rounded, the fig has finally come forward, creamy, slightly sweet, and beautifully balanced. The musk is still present, but now softer and more refined, just enough to maintain the freshness. The projection during the first 3 hours is surprisingly strong, easily filling a room, however it's not pungent but feels airy and smooth. After that, it settles closer to the skin, but it lingers well into the next day.

That said, this is one of those scents that’s easy to go anosmic to. I initially thought it was weak until I tested it properly: I sprayed 3 times in a room, closed the door, and within minutes the fragrance filled my entire apartment. I could smell it in the air for about 3 hours, even with the lingering smell of dinner. You never really know how potent a perfume is until you test it this way.

P.S. What’s with all the fake reviews in the last few days? Did Acqua di Parma pay people to flood the page or something? I hate how it dilutes the genuine reviews.",10/26/25 06:03,LeHuppert

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"The Aqua di Parma fico de amalfi la riserva is a very unique scent. It's not the typical scent I prefer. It's hard for me to distinguish the notes, I'm not good at that unless it's simple. To me it is a very unisex fragrance. It reminds me of a high end store at the mall. I think it's a good year round fragrance. The scent has great longevity, I could still smell it after an 8 hour day. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.",10/24/25 17:43,afjtullock
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This version of Aqua Di Parma is absolutely refreshing and bold. It’s unique scent and blends of blood orange and grapefruit are the first notes, and then it settles into a lemon woodsy scent for me. It lasted a decent amount of time without reapplying. The bottle it stunning and easy to use without leaking. I loved this scent and have already recommended to friends. This bottle was provided to me for an honest opinion.",10/24/25 16:29,AshleySaun87

The scent opens with fresh citrus and fig notes that are both bright and soothing, and as it settles, it becomes warm, soft, and incredibly elegant.The blue bottle itself is stunning luxurious and timeless, just like the fragrance inside. It lasts beautifully throughout the day without ever being overpowering. I’ve received so many compliments whenever I wear it.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I reviews stating you received this as a part of an educational promotion.

It’s such a beautiful fresh scent that feels like a sunny day on the Amalfi Coast in a bottle. 😍 It opens with a burst of bright citrus mandarin, blood orange, grapefruit, and lemon that instantly lifts my mood. Then it softens into a creamy blend of fig and orris, which adds this elegant and slightly powdery touch I really enjoy. The base with tonka bean and ambrettolide gives it a smooth, warm finish that lingers softly on the skin. I love that it’s unisex so my husband can wear it too and he actually loves it just as much as I do! It smells clean, fresh, and sophisticated without being overpowering.
Perfect for everyday wear or special occasions!",10/24/25 11:29,Namprik
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I was given this product for educational purposes in exchange for my honest review . Fico di Amalfi is a beautiful, unisex fragrance that's great for spring and summer it’s got a richness to it that makes it smell, luxurious and expensive. It has awesome projection for being a toilette perfume it only takes two sprays to leave a nice trail behind that isn’t cloying it’s long lasting and it has a beautiful freshness and sweetness that’s different than any perfumes that I own. It’s definitely a statement scent I know this is unisex, but I feel like it means more feminine I’d be happy to wear this daily and not get tired of it it’s layered perfectly on its own that it doesn’t need any other perfumes to be warn with it. The fragrance is very uplifting and sophisticated. I really think this is a crowd pleaser, and a great blind buy. You won’t be disappointed!",10/23/25 22:22,BellaRay
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This perfume makes a bold entrance. A little goes a long way and it lasts for hours. It gives a summer or early fall vibe with a slightly beachy twist, but not a typical “fresh” scent. It’s mysterious and different for someone who likes to stand out. I get fig and citrus with a tiny cherry-like hint. A love-it-or-hate-it type of scent.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,This is a very Unisex fragrance to me. It has a subtle sweet citrus scent at the opening then dries down to a very green subtle scent. It’s not overwhelming but leaves a nice scent trail for a couple hours. I think it’s a nice year round scent but u would suggest it more for men than women.,10/23/25 21:46,HeatherM312
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I like to start with the packaging. It's what you see first, so it's always nice to begin there. This beautiful blue bottle is simple, yet it sceams luxury. Like you see this bottle and you know it belongs in your collection.

The very first spray gives me a delight of zest and citrus and then starts to move toward floral territory before you're in the woods of just green fields.

I'd classify this as fresh, floral, and a little spicy. The beginning notes want to give me sweetness, but it's very subtle and moves too quickly to linger.

I really like the top notes and the base notes, but the middle isn't my favorite of this journey. But like all road trips, it's not where you start; it's where you end up. And believe me, you'll want your journey to end where this does. It's smells beautiful, gives off class, and you'll want this scent to hug you when you wear it.

I do think I'll enjoy this more in the warmer months, so I can't wait to see how I feel when that time comes back around. I will also add that the longevity could be better for something of this value. It all fades too quickly for my liking.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,I love the packaging. It’s very high quality for being affordable. It is luxurious in every sense of the word. It’s warm and comfortable. It has this high end vibe that I’m sitting at a very fancy restaurant enjoying an excellent meal. It’s sitting in front of the fire with your favorite person. I’m in love with this scent. I want to know who ever is wearing this scent. It gives me such a familiar feeling. But very unique at the same time. I would definitely consider this scent to be unisex but in a great way. I know I will definitely be grabbing for it a lot this winter.,10/23/25 20:57,Michellejerseygirl
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This perfume is such a great mix of fresh and classy. It kicks off with a burst of bright citrus—like sun-kissed lemons and crisp bergamot—that smells super clean and instantly lifts your mood. After a while, some soft woody notes start to come through, adding this cozy, natural warmth that balances everything out perfectly. There’s even a hint of pine that gives it a refreshing, outdoorsy feel without being too strong or sharp. What really stands out is how long it lasts—it sticks around for hours but still feels light, never heavy or overwhelming. And the best part? It’s completely unisex, so anyone can wear it and feel amazing. It’s like a cool morning walk through citrus trees and pine woods—fresh, modern, and effortlessly stylish. Perfect for everyday wear.",10/23/25 20:39,Aidaj15
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Reading the notes of this fragrance I wasn't sure how it would come together. I love Bergamot and have been venturing into more fruity and coastal scents. Fico Di Almalfi La Riserva is not what I expected.

The opening is packed with citrus. It's strong and smells more like zest instead of the juice of citrus. The wood notes surprisingly gave this a much darker fruity/ coastal scent then I expected. There is also a freshness that makes this lean aquatic. The fig was what I noticed after but I also found that It didn't add a lot of sweetness.

This is a pleasant scent that is unisex and leans a little bit more woody. I liked this it's not really a love but the packaging is a beautiful blue.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This perfume is very light and fresh, with a heavy citrus top note. It's a pretty unisex fragrance with both myself and my husband enjoying its scent and using it regularly. This fragrance has a pretty good longevity, and last s a good portion of the day, maybe needing to be reapplied in the afternoon if you're wearing it all day. This is a good light everyday perfume, because I wouldn't say it's overpowering. I didn't get Commons from people saying about how fragrant I was when wearing it, but I would still get whiffs of it throughout the day.

I liked that it reminded me of eating food with friends. At first it smells very light and fresh and feminine. These top notes were my favorite part. The bottom notes where it is woody and earthy make it a more unisex scent. It only requires a few sprays so a little goes a long way. The bottle is also beautiful and is definitely eye-catching.

The more I have been wearing it the more I like it. It lasted all day, I wore days and night and received compliments whenever I went out.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I received aqua di parma in exchange for my honest review . How cool to review on fragrantica as I spend a lot of time here and I have written hundreds of reviews . This is my first time trying this brand and the scent is nice . I’m very surprised though that it’s not more citrus dominant . You do get light citrus in the beginning, but ultimately it leans very fog heavy on me . It’s soft and aromatic . Very easily unisex . It reminds me a bit of nouvelle vague or mulberry fig . The fig is very green , in the middle notes it’s more of an unripe green fig smell but then it settles into a soft and powdery fig . It’s fresh and clean . Probably best suited for spring or summer . The silage and longevity though aren’t exactly what I would expect for the hefty price on this . All in all , it’s a beautiful scent . I’m not sure the bottle really matches the vibe I’m getting from it but it’s a beautiful bottle as well . This scent in a nutshell , “citrus, green aromatic, soft fig “. I’m on the fence , I can’t really tell if I like it or if I’m just intrigued by how unique it is . Will I continue to wear it ? I’m not sure yet .",10/23/25 18:11,Katelynl88

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance piqued my interest as both a fruity/citrus and a tonka lover. While it leans much more on the fig and tonka and overall “greenness” to my nose than any of the citrus notes, I do really like it. To me, it’s clean, light, and pretty unisex. Some coastal Italy vacation vibes are definitely present. It’s not so much a juicy, tart one as it is a laidback, warm fruit. Overall a fan.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Fico di Amalfi La Riserva is a refreshing and sophisticated take on a fig fragrance. The opening hits with bright citrus—lemon, mandarin, and grapefruit—that instantly feels clean and uplifting. As it settles, the fig note comes through, smooth and creamy but never overly sweet. It blends beautifully with soft orris and a bit of warmth from tonka and ambrettolide in the dry-down, giving it a balanced mix of freshness and comfort.

This scent feels effortlessly elegant—easy to wear in any season but especially perfect for warmer days. It’s unisex, leans slightly fresh, and has a quiet confidence rather than being loud or heavy. Longevity is better than expected for a citrus-based perfume, lasting several hours with a subtle trail. The bottle itself is gorgeous, and the fragrance inside truly matches that sense of understated luxury. A modern, polished scent that feels timeless—definitely a five-star addition to any collection.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Fico di Amalfi La Riserva is an amazing, elegant, timeless fragrance. I have been using
this perfume for a week now and have received so many compliments. It opens with a burst of fresh citrusy orange, grapefruit and lemon essences, then slowly develops into a deeper, warm, woody green scent. The citrus notes remain throughout but softens as the woody notes take over. The heart notes are jasmine, pink pepper and fig nectar which really shine through! On my skin, the scent lasted six to eight hours and even longer when sprayed on clothing. The balance of fresh and woody elements makes this perfect for both day and night wear.
I highly recommend for loves that love warm, woody scents!

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
I personally really enjoy this one, I am a big fan of citrus scents, and this one has it, along with lemon, grapefruit and more. It is nice and light and definitely not heavy, great for wearing everyday. I do have to add a little more when I want the scent to linger longer. I also feel that anyone could wear this, it's not super sweet either. Also, it comes in a beautiful package. I would definitely recommend this if you like light citrus scents that can be worn daily.",10/23/25 15:24,Dee7
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"It’s got that classic Fico di Amalfi vibe — fresh, citrusy, and just so Mediterranean — but the La Riserva version feels more grown-up and smooth. You still get that burst of grapefruit and lemon at first, like sunshine in a bottle, but then it settles into this soft fig-and-tonka thing that’s warmer and a bit creamy. It’s like the original went on vacation and came back with more confidence.
The fig isn’t super strong, though — it’s there, but not juicy or loud. More like a subtle sweetness behind the citrus. I’d say it lasts longer than the regular version, but it’s still not a beast. It sits close to the skin after a while, which I actually like because it feels classy and not overpowering.
Overall, if you liked the original but wanted something a little deeper and smoother, this one’s a solid upgrade. It smells like sunshine, clean skin, and a lazy afternoon by the sea. Pricey, yeah, but kind of addictive once you get a whiff.",10/23/25 15:21,Kittysoftpaws
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I received this as a part of an educational promotion. Fico di Amalfi La Riserva opens with a burst of citrus, like sipping a sweet, sunlit juice cocktail by the coast. The blend of blood orange, grapefruit, Italian mandarin, and lemon feels bright and sparkling, instantly uplifting. Beneath that fresh opening, there’s a subtle musky and earthy touch, likely from the orcanox and ambrettolide, giving the scent more depth and balance.

It’s beautifully unisex, never too sweet and never too sharp. The fig and orris in the heart add a creamy, slightly green softness that rounds out the citrus notes perfectly. As it settles, the tonka bean brings a gentle warmth without making it heavy.

Longevity is moderate; I get around four hours of wear before it fades into a soft skin scent. That’s typical for citrus-forward fragrances, but while it lasts, it’s effortlessly refreshing and comforting.

Overall, Fico di Amalfi La Riserva feels like a summer day in Greece bright, breezy, and full of warmth and light.",10/23/25 14:06,Stinkyla

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This product was received complimentary as part of an educational promotion.

I haven’t tried an Acqua di Parma fragrance before so couldn’t wait to get my hands on the Fico di Amalfi la Riserva. The bottle is absolutely beautiful - unboxing it is a luxurious experience and everything is very high quality. Unfortunately, whether it’s my skin or living in the Florida humidity - it seems the citrus evaporated very quickly. I was hoping to smell more of those citrus notes but I smelled more of the middle and base notes like the Fig and Tonka Bean. I am always looking for a crisp and energizing fragrance but felt this was more warm and musky. I can definitely see it being a unisex fragrance leaning towards it being more masculine. I found applying it to my clothes rather than just my skin did help the citrus last longer. I could also see layering it with another citrus scent helping it last longer. Unfortunately, once it dried down, the lasting fragrance was a lot more musky and warm than I was hoping for so it won’t be a go to for me. My chemistry just didn't seem to mix well with it. I could see it being a great Fall and Winter fragrance for someone who enjoys a heavier, musky scent.",10/23/25 13:03,girlwhowritesreviews

The packaging was definitely high quality and elegant. At first spray, I wasn’t entirely sure about it — the opening felt a bit sharp to me and was not entirely pleasant for me. I really didn't sense citrus at all though. However, as it dried down, the fragrance evolved beautifully. The vanilla, powdery, and earthy notes came forward, softening the edges and creating a warm, elegant balance that I really enjoyed. It lasted about 4-6 hours and I noticed with hand washing throughout the day, the strength faded a bit on my wrists. It has a refined, unisex character that feels fresh yet comforting. My husband absolutely loves it and even said he would wear it himself, which says a lot! Overall, it’s a fragrance that surprised me in the best way once it settled.

The notes in this fragrance are nice on their own, but something is a bit off with this fragrance. It’s as if the notes aren’t blending harmoniously. The packaging mentioned the fragrance might need a few months to “settle”, especially if you notice it seems off at first. By letting it sit, I’m hoping it will help the fragrance round out and blend better. Until then, this fragrance is only receiving a 2 out of 5 star for me.

It’s bright and fresh smelling and reminds me of a fancy spa or hotel. It’s marketed as unisex and some women will find this scent is for them. I do find it is more masculine smelling and love it on my husband more than I do myself. For women that prefer a bolder and more “spa-like” scent, this is worth checking out, however.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I received this as part of an educational promotion Acqua di Parma Fico di Amalfi La Riserva is a fragrance that feels like a warm breeze straight from the Amalfi Coast. The moment you spray it, you’re greeted with a burst of sparkling citrus — lemon, bergamot, and grapefruit — that instantly lifts your mood and brings a sense of effortless freshness. As it settles, the scent reveals its heart: juicy, creamy fig blended with soft floral notes of jasmine and a touch of cedarwood. The result is a beautifully balanced aroma that feels both luxurious and natural, never overpowering but always noticeable.

What makes this fragrance stand out is how genuine and uplifting it feels. It’s elegant without trying too hard, and it perfectly captures that sunlit, carefree feeling of summer in Italy. The scent wears close to the skin, making it ideal for everyday use — especially in warm weather or during the daytime. It’s unisex, but its smooth sweetness may lean slightly more feminine.

I wasn't really sure what to expect, although the product description was very detailed and thorough. When I received my bottle of Fico di Amalfi La Riserva, the first thing I noticed was the beautiful blue glass bottle and the premium appearance of the product. The scent itself is very nice. I must not have as sophisticated a nose as some other people, because I can only detect some of the ""notes"" of the scent. The strongest for me is the citrusy aspect, particularly a strong grapefruit dominating. I definitely feel like the scent is fresh, fruity, and full of citrus. I didn't notice some of the other things purportedly in the aroma, but that's ok. I like what I can smell. It is a little on the bitter side for me, but it's subtle and not overpowering. I don't feel that the scent is especially long-lasting.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Yikes......really strange to see a respected niche house stoop to such levels.

The scent is quite mid too btw. A dark green version of the original that strips it of what made it so good in the first place.",10/23/25 07:00,FujiMoto

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Received as a part of an educational promotion.
This is my first time trying Acqua di Parma Fico di Amalfi La Riserva and let me tell you, you need this if you want to be transported to a bright citrusy, elevated and intimate place. This is going to transport you to Italy on the Amalfi coast with the brightness and citrus.
The citrus notes come in opening with bursts of orange, mandarin and lemon. It starts of with a strong scent and gently mellows down upon wear
This is unisex but more masculine for my nose.
The longevity is pretty good and lasted around 5 hours or so on me.
I love the packaging and how sophisticated it looks in blue. Definitely recommend trying this one out and adding to your collection if you like bright sophisticated scents",10/23/25 05:50,Nixm19
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I was not lucky enough to receive a tester of this for educational purposes - I blind bought it based on reviews and how much I loved the other two in the La Reserva line.

I have spent quite a lot of time with Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo testers over the years, trying to love them but finding them a bit basic and hopelessly short lived. The La Reserva set hits the jackpot and are much more what I was hoping for. There's significantly more depth to support the sparkling citrus, which sticks around for a good length of time. And I do enjoy a perfume with a sweet fig note, ever since I first met, and became smitten by, Diptyque Philosykos.

Love it!",10/23/25 04:53,alisonjwhiting
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I was in heaven to receive the opportunity to review the sophisticated, unique Eau de Parfum of Fico di Amalfi La Reserva. This fragrance gives me the vibe of a beautiful man or woman taking a stroll along the Italian Coastline of Italy with the scent of this fragrance following behind. At the initial spray of this fresh classic fragrance, I smell the citrusy aroma of lemon, a touch of fig nectar with the sweet hint of creamy Tonka bean. With this versatile fragrance for both men and women, I can smell the masculinity in the notes of cedarwood and fig wood, and would make a nice scented aftershave. With the first spray the scent is strong not overpowering, but slowly dissipates over time. The aesthetics of the blue bottle and casing are stand out, with the white label standing out, and would make a great decor for on counter top or dresser. I really like the scent , and it's griws on you the more you spray it on. It makes a lovely fragrance for a breezy spring or summer night. I received this product as part of an educational promotion.",10/23/25 02:12,Kimberly@65
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I received this as a part of an educational promotion. Wow, this scent is clean, fresh, and sexy! It opens with a burst of citrus that feels so crisp and bright, and I can truly smell every note individually but working so well together. It’s a green, refreshing fragrance with a subtle cologne-like background that leans a bit more masculine than unisex to my nose. The longevity is pretty solid, around 3–4 hours depending on the person. Personally, I prefer how it smells on my man, but I still love catching whiffs of it! The blue bottle and case are absolutely stunning. I always find myself drawn to blue bottles for him, they just feel so airy, clean, and effortlessly attractive.",10/22/25 22:59,nCaila
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I am a fragrance lover and citrus is one of my absolute favorite scent families, and Fico di Amalfi La Riserva from Acqua Di Parma totally delivers all of my citrus dreams! It is the most realistic citrus perfume I have ever smelled. I grow lemons and grapefruits in my yard, and this smells EXACTLY like freshly picked citrus, even with a hint of the green leaves and blossoms. I have no idea how they did it. I like that it is citrus-y without being sickly sweet–it’s like a grown-up summer scent. I think the fig in this really helps. It adds such a nice creamy background note that helps balance everything together. It’s definitely there, but I wouldn’t say this is a fig-forward scent. I think this is a pretty true unisex fragrance, it maybe leans slightly feminine but really anyone would smell great wearing this. It has nice projection, and I found it lasted over 8 hours on me. It is a unique take on citrus in my collection and I’m loving it! Note: I received this product as a part of an educational promotion.",10/22/25 20:19,lazydaisy37
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I am blown away with this scent, this is unique and The notes blend so well together. The top notes are so magical, with grapefruit blood, orange, Italian, Mandarin and lemon. This scent reminds me of a stroll on the Amalfi coast, it makes me feel carefree and relaxed. This also has an elegant sense to it, with the other notes like fig and Tonka bean, making it a bit sophisticated. I get multiple compliments when wearing this and I love that it is not a blend that you can find easily. The bottle is such a beautiful blue and makes for great decor as well. I am impressed with how long this wears and a little bit does go a long way. This seems to be more on the stronger side but I like that so personally I have no issue with that. This brand has exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend this to anyone if the notes sound intriguing. I received this as a part of an educational promotion.",10/22/25 20:00,Justin12345!
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,I received this perfume in exchange for my honest review. I love it! I love a good marine scent that is fresh and fun.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This was my first experience with Aqua di Parma perfume. I’ve heard a lot about this brand and wanted to give it a try! I put my hands on their new Fico di Amalfi La Riserva, which truly embodies the spirit of Italy. The top notes are citrusy, with blood orange, grapefruit, Italian mandarin, and lemon, which I enjoy for their sweet freshness. The middle notes feature fig, orris, and more lemon, while the base notes include tonka bean, orcanox, and ambrettolide, giving a powdery, musky finish. The scent is quite rich and lasts the whole day. It's a unisex fragrance suitable for both men and women. Personally, I find it a bit strong; I prefer lighter, more refreshing scents. Still, it’s an excellent perfume, especially for the fall and winter seasons. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.",10/22/25 13:54,Yoksana
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I’ve received this product in exchange for my honest review. Acqua di Parma’s Fico di Amalfi La Riserva feels like a sunlit stroll along the Italian coast—fresh, sophisticated, and effortlessly elegant. The scent opens with a burst of juicy fig and citrus, instantly uplifting and bright, like sea breeze brushing against sun-warmed skin. As it settles, notes of pink pepper, jasmine, and cedarwood create a beautiful balance between fruity sweetness and woody depth, making it feel both luxurious and comforting.

The texture of the scent is airy yet full-bodied—it lingers softly but leaves a clean, memorable trail. I also adore the packaging: that signature Acqua di Parma bottle with its timeless blue hue captures the Mediterranean spirit perfectly. Though it’s definitely a splurge, the value lies in the quality and craftsmanship—it’s refined, unique, and long-lasting on both skin and fabric.",10/22/25 05:45,Zoey cross
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This is my first time trying a perfume from this brand. It is a luxury product so I had high expectations and it did not disappoint! I’ve never tried a unisex fragrance before but I thought it did lean more on the feminine side. It is a very unique scent! I don’t have anything like it. It starts out with a citrusy, fresh clean scent with an edge of sweetness. As time goes on, the sweetness becomes more prominent. Even though it is a fig based scent, it’s not heavy or overly sweet like others I’ve tried. It feels modern and elegant. The bottle is beautiful, dark blue with a sleek glass design. I think it would be perfect for spring and summer! It feels too bright for winter but would be better for warmer weather. Overall, I’m very happy to add this to my collection! It’s really one of a kind! I received this as a part of an educational promotion.",10/21/25 18:04,Arothrock1990

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Acqua Di Parma Fico di Amalfi La Riserva instantly brought me back to summers on the Mediterranean, where my grandmother grew the most beautiful fig trees. We’d spend long afternoons under the sun eating fresh figs, and this scent captures that memory perfectly, with the ripe fruit, the salty sea breeze, and the brightness of citrus in the air.

The opening is radiant and joyful, with notes of mandarin, blood orange, grapefruit, and lemon that smell like pure sunshine. Then the fig takes the lead, creamy, green, and softly sweet. As it settles on my skin, tones of tonka bean and musks add warmth and depth, making it feel both comforting and quietly luxurious.

What I love most is how balanced it feels. It’s fresh without being sharp, warm without being heavy, and completely unisex. It’s one of those scents that instantly lifts my mood and works just as well for daytime as it does for evening events.

The packaging deserves a mention too. The deep blue glass bottle and box are stunning, simple yet refined, and perfectly capture the Mediterranean spirit that inspires this fragrance.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I think this is one of the best summer fragrances I’ve tried lately. It opens with this bright mix of citrus and fig that instantly reminds me of being on the coast somewhere warm. It feels fresh and clean, but there’s a sweetness from the fig that makes it a little different from your typical citrus scent. As it settles on my skin, it gets warmer and slightly woodier, which gives it a more sophisticated, almost relaxing vibe. I’d say it’s unisex but leans just a touch masculine. What really impressed me is how long it lasts. I can still smell it on my skin hours later, even after being out in the heat. It’s not overpowering, just consistently pleasant and refreshing. To me, this feels like a “vacation in a bottle” kind of fragrance. It's perfect for daytime, but it transitions nicely into the evening too. If you want something fresh that still feels luxurious and long lasting, this one’s worth checking out. Received as a part of an educational promotion.",10/21/25 12:04,lunartrio
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I’ve always been drawn to fragrances that tell a story, and Acqua di Parma’s Fico di Amalfi does exactly that. From the moment I first spritzed it, I was whisked away to a villa overlooking the Mediterranean, the air thick with the scent of ripening fruit and the salty spray of the sea. This isn't just a perfume; it's an olfactory vacation.
The opening is an absolute burst of sunshine. The Italian Lemon and Bergamot are so bright and zesty, they immediately wake up your senses. It’s like taking a bite into a perfectly ripe citrus fruit, with that invigorating tang that’s both fresh and sophisticated. But the real star of the show, the element that truly sets this fragrance apart, is the fig.
Acqua di Parma has managed to capture the fig in its most beautiful form. It’s not overly sweet or syrupy, but rather a nuanced, creamy, and slightly green aroma that feels incredibly natural. It has a velvety smoothness that balances the initial citrus burst beautifully. You can almost feel the soft, yielding texture of the fig skin.",10/21/25 07:54,Komal8800
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This perfume took me some time to understand, but in the end, I decided I really enjoy it. It feels deep, mysterious, and luxurious, yet it has the strong citrus notes giving it a light more airy feel. I think having the combination of these two things make it an excellent spring and summer scent. I think it can also play well both day and night time wear. When I smell this, I think of going out to dinner, somewhere fancy, at a resort after spending a full day on the beach. That fresh, but fancy feeling of a Mediterranean vacation. Additionally, the atomizer for this bottle is excellent and very high quality. The bottle design is also fabulous, and I feel the deep yet bold blue color of the bottle actually matches the scent quite well. It also lasts a long time and has a small radius of projection, which is how I prefer my scents to wear. Lastly, this fragrance is truly unisex and I think it fits any gender well. This was received as part of an educational promotion.",10/20/25 19:53,Mandor00
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma is a great unisex perfume. It smells green, lightly soapy, and like a juicy grapefruit peel. There's a slight bitter note that really amps up the complexity. The fragrance is stereotypical masculine, but it's a little more fresh than just standard musk. The warmth makes it's a great daily perfume for the colder seasons. And the bright citrus notes match well for spring and summer. This scent would be a hit all year-round. As a woman who doesn't like gourmands, I really enjoyed this one. It's genderless and doesn't smell too sweet or too cologne-like. The lasting power is great. I can still smell it at the end of my work day after applying it in the morning. It's timeless and an instant classic for me.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I am hard to please when it comes to fragrances with dominant fig notes but Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma pleasantly surprised me. It opens up with a juicy citrus (slightly bitter) blend: blood orange, mandarin, lemon, and grapefruit. Very citrusy, botanical, and warm.
Fig notes come throughout mostly as the fragrance settles down on the skin. It’s creamy, earthy, and slightly sweet. Amber notes add some powdery notes to it. The dry down is slightly warmer, soapy, and a tad bit masculine but still with the fresh and zesty DNA from the initial spray.
It’s a unique, genderless perfume. It’s perfectly embodied Italian essence. I can see myself wearing this fragrance in early spring, fall, and winter. The projection is outstanding and the scent lasts all day on me. One spritz is so powerful.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Okay I’m a huuuge fig fan especially when it comes to perfumes. So I was very excited to try this scent. Fico Di Amalfi is like a citrus explosion! It’s light, it’s fresh, it’s airy perfect for summer and spring in my opinion. I definitely smell the lemon and citron notes the most followed by the fig note. I love how they included the fig tree note as well because it brings a slightly creamy note to the whole vibe. This is a perfume I could see myself reaching for on a trip to the beach with the wind whipping and the sun glaring. The longevity is about 6 hours I would say and the sillage is decent. Of course it lasts longer on clothes than skin. I think layering this with a creamy scent with a watery coconut note would elevate this and tone down the citrus a bit bringing a cozy touch. product was received as part of an educational promotion.",10/20/25 09:53,amacz124
Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Wow… this scent feels like summer on the Amalfi coast bottled up. The first spray bursts with juicy citrus — blood orange, mandarin, and grapefruit dancing together. It’s so bright and happy, yet elegant.

As it settles, that creamy fig and soft iris appear — smooth, a little powdery, but still fresh. The dry down is my favorite part… warm vanilla and amber notes gently wrap everything in comfort, like golden sunlight on skin after a swim.

It’s perfectly balanced — fresh yet cozy, unisex but personal. I can smell the craftsmanship in every layer. 💛

If you love citrus with depth and sophistication, this one’s truly special.
Rating: 9/10 — timeless, luminous, and addictive.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This perfume by Acqua Di Parma smells like an absolute dream. I only have to spray it once or twice and it lasts all day on my skin. I love that it has many different types of scents that blend beautifully together. It has hints of citrus as well as wood making it last long and feel rich and luxurious on my skin.
I love how versatile it is, i’m able to wear it in the day or night time whenever I want to stand out. I also love that my husband is able to wear it as well, and it smells differently on us. I love how sleek and sophisticated the packaging is. I would absolutely recommend this perfume to anyone (men or women).

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"Fico di Amalfi La Riserva by Acqua di Parma feels like a sunny escape to the Italian coast in a bottle. The scent opens with a burst of fresh citrus that instantly lifts your mood and slowly blends into a soft mix of fig and floral notes that feel both natural and elegant. There is a gentle sweetness wrapped in warm amber and a hint of vanilla that makes it smooth and comforting without being heavy. It smells clean and luxurious, the kind of fragrance that feels effortless but leaves a lasting impression. The balance of fruity and woody notes gives it depth, while the citrus keeps it light and refreshing all day. It lasts well on the skin and settles beautifully into a creamy, soft finish that feels warm against the air. The blue bottle looks stunning and matches the feeling of calm, ocean freshness inside.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I was on the hunt for a nice unisex fragrance that my male partner and I could both enjoy and I think Fico Di Amalfi is it. This reminds me of those clean and alluring unisex fragrances of the 90's. This has fresh and sparkling notes of citrus with slight hints of fig that does not leave you smelling too sweet or too spicy like a seasoning rack. This fragrance is like drinking an Aperol Spritz on the coast of Italy. This Italian fragrance is strong but balanced and fresh. You can definitely notice light scent trail in the most pleasant way but most importantly it does not smack you in the head with nausea like a side of bricks laced with herbal aftershave. It leaves an such an uplifting scent experience of sparkling citrus. This fragrance is powerful but in a sophisticated and restrained way, it does have staying power for an entire day. Aqua Di Parma has such gorgeous packaging, from the ocean blue bottle to the luxurious cylinder box. As a woman, I did enjoy this fragrance very much (it also layers nicely with florals) and partner gives it two thumbs up as well.

People say the EDT doesn’t last but this new EDP line has good longevity with good sillage. It lasted a full workday for me and was still going when I got home. I’d say it can be worn all year around but it definitely shines in the summer heat.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This is lovely. The initial scent after just applying it is what remains of the original Fico di Amalfi edt after a few hours (when you can usually barely detect it). Less of a fresh citrus, but the blood orange does make it quite sweet. Its also deeper sweeter and greener then the original. Performance and projection are solid and this is a obvious upgrade compared to the edt. I'd say this is a unisex fragrance, like the original. My gf says it is too manly for her to consider wearing.

Fico di Amalfi La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"This one smells magical, inviting you to a land of secret whispers and unexpected charm!

It's probably 70% similar to the OG, with a much more sparkly top, and a surprise transition to the warmer mid and base, and the lemon in the mid keeps the freshness going for much longer. Absolutely divine and totally worth the full bottle price. The OG does smell fresher, but is also a lot more linear, the LR is darker, more intriguing, smoother, sexier AND can smartly bridge a hot summer day into a cooler afternoon/evening!

Having said this, I agree with those reviews that say this veers away from fig. This smells fantastic, but fig is just playing around the edges of the scent, so bring an open mind and be ready to have your socks knocked off!

And just think about it, you really need to suffer from some sort of mental disorder to ""hate"" this... =)))",08/13/25 22:24,kalilax

I have shied away from ADP due to longevity issues with their EDT, this is EDP strength & is definitely hanging around. I don't think I can pick out the individual fruits but more just a collection of citrus, the fig & a bit of sweetness from the Tonka.

The base notes makes Fico di Amalfi mor deep a little bit tart with a vanillic undertone, definitely sweeter, its less fresh and transparent, but richer and long lasting. The base notes provide the foundations to make this fragrance outlast its predecesor lasting between 6-8 hrs and it has a beautiful sillage.

It smells a bit like Jasmin tea without the bitterness.

It only lasts couple hours and I usually spray 8-10.

I only have a few drops left of it and I will cherish it forever. I'm so sad it's discontinued.",01/12/25 23:41,Ringga12
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is my go-to spring/summer scent! It's so fresh and floral, but not overpowering.

It lasts all day and gets compliments everywhere I go.",12/16/24 16:29,Shreyasi21
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I wish I bought a backup bottle as soon as I found out they were discontinuing this and Iris Nobile. I have all five EDPs from the line and they went and discontinued my two favorites. At least I have Iris backups.
I love jasmine in all it's many forms. This is my special ""Italian chic"" jasmine. It's crisp and not as heady as one would associate with a white floral. While it can be worn all year, it shines best in the warmth of spring and early summer. Of course I blame LVMH for the decision to discontinue. I am going to have to be selective about when I choose to wear this, and do my best to preserve the quality of what remains now. There's no use in complaining about it. LVMH makes decisions based strictly on the bottom line, do once a fragrance is gone, it's gone. I see it is now selling on eBay in the $450 range. That should tell them something about the demand. If they had to ""break up the band"", any of the remaining three would have been fine for me, especially the Peony and Rose, which smell almost exactly the same in my opinion.

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"On me this leans more masculine, I'm getting a lot of a herbal/woody scent, citrus, but no discernible jasmine. Very fresh and nice enough but I'm disappointed after reading the reviews saying it was very floral and feminine!",01/04/24 08:05,Happycamel
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I'm a wee bit surprised to be writing such a favorable review. Normally citrus fragrances don't last at all - on me or most anyone, methinks. Here we have a floral that begins as a strong citrus and lingers with good musk and white florals. The top notes are happy and airy. I was told, 'That's pretty' by a discriminating friend. She was right! The base notes are quiet, but last through most of the day. The overall impression on me at this point is a modest, gentle rendition of Paul Sebastian Design. I adore Design, even if it's a beast by modern standards. In Design the top notes are loud and the base notes more restrained, if opinionated!

My overall conclusion is that the sophisticated citrus opening of Gelsomino is a delight. The base is surprisingly long lived, but as a white floral-musk, perhaps inferior to my all-time favorite in this category - budget winner Paul Sebastian Design.",04/15/23 12:33,drugstore classics
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"For me Gelsomino Nobile is quite heavy on the neroli for my liking. I know it isn't listed in the above accords but I smell it all the same. Real orange blossom is very sweet and there is not much sweetness in this perfume. This perfume is ultra fresh. Green Jasmine sambac, tuberose, petigrain, neroli, slight orange blossom. Very tart and a bit headache inducing for me. There are much better jasmines out there than this. Patou's Joy, Chanel's Allure edt, Isabey's Route de Emeraude. Just to name a few. I swear this perfume smells like a glass of tang orange drink w/ some of the sugar taken out of it. I remember the smell vividly, my father used to drink gallons of it, and I despised it. Just downgraded this to a dislike. This smells like tang orange drink w/ white flowers ground into it. Very headache inducing for me. I can see why they discontinued this. I wouldn't buy it. The only thing from this line that I liked was the peony and I have a better peony from Caswell and Massey.",01/21/23 16:32,LSAUG
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Have to say it. The decision to discontinue this and Iris Nobile is a crime.

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I have several aqua di Parma Nobile line perfumes, also magnolia and peony but Gelsomino is my favorite. It has some sparkle to it that makes it so perfect. Not sure if it’s the pepper or something else but it makes this perfume so distinguished and yes, noble.

Sadly, it’s discontinued and my bottle is almost finished too… so I’m trying to save it.

And no, I don’t think Grand Ball by Dior is similar. Yeah, white flowers and all but they’re sooooo different. I have an old Grand Bal version (2014 maybe?) and it’s much more sweet and smooth, it’s a night scent where Gelsomino has some peppery freshness and sparkling to it and could be an every day perfume.",12/09/21 23:43,Laziza

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Naturalistic jasmine, and funnily enough, a lilac note. During the dry-down, a very pleasing depth and richness start to emerge. Now I detect an aroma redolent of tea – the kind of tea-like note I would love to find in a fragrance, but ironically, thus far in my explorations of actual ""tea""-inspired scents, have not yet encountered...

I wouldn't buy this, as it skews too sweet and feminine for my tastes. I also prefer a ""cool"" if not outright ""cold"" scent, and this is decidedly warm. The tea-like depth during the dry-down intrigued me, though.

I enjoyed this very much, although it is not my usual sort of fragrance. I can imagine a mature and elegant older woman wearing this. Good sillage and longevity, lasting several hours and even overnight.

It is an exceedingly pleasant fragrance, overall. I'd be delighted to smell it on somebody else, and will certainly be interested in sampling other offerings from this house.",05/09/21 05:20,cho-ku-rei

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This was given to me as a gift. I don't know how they did it but Gelsomino Nobile does not give me the vibe of an artificial fragrance; the scent captures the real smell of a big bouquet of fresh flowers. When I spray it I get taken away to nature to a grassy mountain top or perhaps an open field of flowers in the early morning with dew drops covering the petals.. Idk. The bottom line is it's like the real thing in a bottle.

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"8 sprays - chest, wrists, neck, hair

Initial impression was wow what is that. It strangely smells white floral like Jasmine, and leather, but not the light but sharp leather from perfumes like AP Maitrese. This is strong and projects. My husband was able to smell me about 15 feet away, and asked what the scent was.

5min- the Jasmine/leather note still continues. The cedar provides the scent an incredible masculine edge. Coworker also says it smells lovely.

30 min- the scent is linear but wonderful. It's unique, feminine, but very edgy.

1hr- the Jasmine leather note continues. I can detect the mandarin slightly.

3hrs- Still going strong with the edgy Jasmine, Mandarin, and the leather note that I smell. On a business flight, and the gentleman next to me in the plane says I smell amazing and asks me what I'm wearing. The male air hostess agrees. I've never been complimented this quickly by strangers on a perfume. Probably one of the sexiest scents I've smelled. It reminds me of TM Alien, but with a twist on the Jasmine. It's got the woodiness in the Jasmine like Alien, which I think is from the cedar, but the mandarin orange adds something spectacular. It's equally sexy to alien (if not sexier).

5hr- The scent is still going although a bit lighter and the cedar has come out more while the Jasmine had faded a bit. I'm still in love.

8hr- Scent has died quite a bit but the cedar notes are still there. I can't smell it much, but cohort who was 3 feet away says she smelled it.

10hrs- The fragrance has completely died, or so I thought. I step out outside to get to my hotel, and suddenly smell a metallic Jasmine. Looks like it's still lingering.

Smell: 9.5/10 (so fresh, woody, and unique)
Sillage: 9/10 (you will leave a trail, and many will get waves of it when you move)
Longevity: 9/10 (lasted 10 hours despite scent becoming faint)

Conclusion: I love this as Alien was one of my favorite perfumes until too many girls began wearing it. This is equally sexy but with an edge. It's not as long lasting as Alien, however longer lasting than most perfumes.

Amazing perfume!",07/19/19 10:09,MarnaL
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Just received a bottle of this beautiful, Italian, golden sunshine! What a gorgeous, clean jasmine. It's jasmine right from the top. Oddly, to me it seems that the mandarin only begins to peek through as it starts to dry down slightly, perhaps augmented by the orange blossom. I do not get any pepper at all! I need to wear this a few more times to get a really sense of the structure, but this has already replaced Ikat Jasmine as my go to summer jasmine scent. I love it!!

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Second review: I know I said in the first review that it's not complex enough to buy it. I was wrong, not everything has to be complex. But, I found it at a very good price, almost 50%off, so I ordered it after I sprayed myself with the last drops of my sample. Literally minutes after I confirmed the order, my father calls me to say that my mother is having a stroke and we took her to the hospital. I hope I'm not going to have bad memories with this, mother is ok now, but it was remarkable how I contained myself during the emergency state, and part of it I attribute to Gelsomino, I felt extremely confident and hopeful that everything will be ok, that's just a bad dream that I can control and make things better. 3-4 days after the event I was craving it like crazy, I had olfactory hallucinations/impressions that I smell it without the smell being present. My yard is filled with beautiful honeysuckle now and somehow it reminds me of Gelsomino, without smelling like it.",06/09/19 06:52,diatosin

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This an extremely pretty but ephemeral scent. The first few minutes are almost breathtakingly gorgeous and complex, but as it wears it loses a lot of that complexity and dries down into a nice but slightly nondescript soft white floral sitting very close to the skin.

I raced through my 50ml bottle of this, as the longevity isn't great, but also because its one of the few white flower fragrances that I own that is truly daytime and office appropriate and isn't going to offend anyone.

To my nose it is not heady enough to truly be called a Night-Flowering Jasmine scent- I would describe the overall impression to be more a of a combination of lovely light and wearable white flowers. In summary - very lovely but not a repeat purchase for me.",09/24/18 07:20,batgirl.27

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I'm steadily working my way through an enormous stash of long-neglected samples, and I'm at the point now where I'm mostly testing samples I got by accident and wouldn't have picked out for myself in most cases. So I find myself sounding like a broken record in my reviews lately, and this one is no exception: this is great, I really like it, but it's not for me.

It definitely is for you if you're a lover of white florals, though, at least worth a try! The opening especially is lovely: all the white flowers are so lush and lifelike then, and the dominant tuberose is the very best kind, not too loud or overwhelming. The drydown is soft and creamy, and very nice as well. The only negative is that it doesn't project very well after the first opening: for most of the day I didn't stop to notice I was wearing any scent at all, which is rare for me.

But in the end, it's the same as usual: it's rare for me to really fall for any scent in this category, and Gelsomino Nobile isn't one of those rare exceptions either.",09/05/18 10:04,dsty
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Bright fruity floral. I don't normally like fruity florals but this one is a winner! I do, however, love big, unashamed florals and Gelsomino Nobile has that in spades. The jasmine is rich and sweet, accented by the juicy orange. Not really complex or challenging but it's a lovely, happy fragrance. It does kind of collapse in the drydown. It lacks any longevity, and quickly loses the big jasmine and orange, fading into a light, rather pedestrian pink pepper musk. The opening is really wonderful though. Happy jasmine.",05/30/18 07:17,Cauda Pavonis
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is a crisp, fresh and festive jasmine with some green undertones.
Gelsomino Nobile takes me to a royal garden on a chill spring morning, in another era, where time stands still. A lemonade is waiting for me, but I don't care as I'm completely absorbed by a herbarium and some old books.
I don't find it vintage, or old school, but there is something timeless and carefree in it and I blame the natural, high quality ingredients.
Not creamy, gently sweet-but it's an elusive sweetness, genderless - because I cannot describe the woman wearing this, she's not vulgar, nor is she innocent, she doesn't want to stand out, yet utterly beautiful, you have no choice but to admire her because you cannot get close to her.
Not enough complexity for a full bottle, I would have enjoyed more richness to it, although it has a weird aftersmell (I don't know if that's a thing), like the first breath of air is sweet after you take your nose out of your arm.

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I met him in Paris, in the loveliest Le Marais near place des Vosges. He was Italian, but he felt free competing with French. He was so luxurious, rich, vivid and full of life, straight and clear but not simple, very complicated and intelligent, one of a kind I had loved and always looked for. This is very important he was resistant. Many of that kind couldn’t handle my hot skin and disappeared, but he stayed filling all the surrounding. He suited me and resembled me so much, but I wasn’t sure about that from the first sight. We were together for some time, then I promised to come back one day. I did. We met in Paris again, in Italy, he even came to Kyiv (who could expect!). But… you know, there are so many new tempting meetings, I can’t and don’t want to avoid them. I’ve got a new girlfriend Juliette who Has a Gun, I can play different roles with her, being Romantina, Lady Vengeance or even Mad Madame. And others… But there is something special between us, a strong connection, he reflects me perfectly. So we are keeping in touch. His name is Gelsomino. He is Nobile.

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Gelsomino Nobile didn't work for me. The pink pepper note is really strong, sharp and throat-scratching in this, or at least I perceive it that way, especially in the opening.
The floral notes are clean and creamy. They're not of the heady, hypnotic kind. Besides the titular jasmine, I can smell almost as much orange blossom. In the drydown, the base of musk and woods becomes noticeable, too.

I guess it would be a nice light floral scent, if the pepper wasn't so overwhelming to me. This even reminds me of Kersone Dirty Flower Factory, which has some of the same notes, but is even more sharp to the point of being metallic and unwearable to me. Gelsomino Nobile is like a softer, more wearable version of the same concept. Maybe I'm really sensitive to pink pepper in clean white floral perfumes, even though I generally like spicy perfumes, because other reviewers don't seem to have this problem.",04/08/18 14:30,SailorV
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma's Gelsomino Nobile is an extremely pretty, delicate and airy jasmine scent. Appropriate for Spring and Summer wear, this fragrance has subtle projection and an uncomplicated scent pyramid.

This office-friendly, polished jasmine was unfortunately not quite what I was expecting. I had hoped that Gelsomino Nobile would be more sensual and rich; a jasmine fragrance with an almost fecal, indolic aroma. Gelsomino Nobile is so discreet on my skin that it barely registers.

I am a huge fan of Iris Nobile in the Eau de Parfum concentration with its elegant yet creamy take on the popular iris note. Sadly Gelsomino Nobile is nowhere near as divine as Iris Nobile, at least not in my opinion.

Gelsomino Nobile opens with crisp citrus notes and soft, ethereal jasmine. There's a tiny hint of orange blossom in the top and heart of this fragrance which provides a subtle hint of sweetness. Despite featuring a multitude of white floral accords, Gelsomino Nobile is neither buttery or creamy. If anything this fragrance is a light, clean floral.

As mentioned before, the sillage is rather soft, and the longevity decent but unfortunately not outstanding. If a demure, predictable jasmine is what you're seeking I would recommend trying Gelsomino Nobile, but if you are anything like me and enjoy richer, deeper jasmine scents, I would delve further into the niche market to find what you're looking for.",02/06/18 02:31,missk

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is such a gorgeous fragrance, clean and elegant white floral. It's sweet and creamy at the same time, perfect for daytime use but could also work on a summer evening, if applied more generously or potentially layered with something a bit stronger and/or more masculine. I imagine it would smell great blended with a precious woody base.

The only downside are the sillage and lasting power. But especially the sillage. Acqua di Parma is on a medium to higher end brand, so I would expect they give a little more ""pump"" to their fragrances. It's a pity, because this is a great and versatile perfume, smells expensive and it's a very elegant perfume even if casual, so it shouldn't become a skin scent a couple of hours after spraying.",12/26/17 11:58,Seducianne

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I get a strong blast of mandarin upon spraying Gelsomino Nobile, and the jasmine soon joins in. The jasmine here has a very light touch of indole, and is mostly sweet, clean, with a tinge of green. Unfortunately, the sweetness of jasmine combined with mandarine, translates into hard candy on my skin, which does not feel 'noble' to me in the conventional sense.

The 'candy' association dies down after about 2 hours, and a silky bouquet of fresh jasmine and tuberose is unfolded. The fruity aspect is now kept in check. Along with the green tinge, it adorns the jasmine perfectly. Gelsomino Nobile then stays this way through the dry down, only becomes a bit warmer and more musky towards the end.

The sillage is moderate to soft, and the longevity is around 10 hours. Gelsomino Nobile is undoubtedly a very feminine and elegant rendition of fresh jasmine, and it shares a similar structure of citrus and white floral as Magnolia Nobile. However, I personally am less impressed by Gelsomino Nobile, probably because there're too many competitors among the jasmine genre. Moreover, the mandarine and sweet jasmine during the opening doesn't seem to agree with my skin chemistry. I'd recommend it as a nice and bright jasmine fragrance, but do try before buying.",07/31/15 14:42,StellaDiverFlynn

It aims in being pretty but ends up just being shallow. After 12 hours the (somewhat unpleasant) fresh/white musky basenotes can still be detected when smelling up close.",07/27/14 07:43,androidi
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Gelsomino Nobile is such a harmonious scent! I always picture blooming summer garden when I smell it. Perfection. It is sophisticated, timeless and classy perfume that will go well in any season and any time of the day. My new fav :)

Update: I'm wearing it very often now and I'm very happy with it. Got a lot of compliments from both women and men. It has moderate projection, so it's never intrusive but it lasts quite long (at least on my skin) and it is classy and very feminine scent. J'adore!",07/17/14 03:31,allbookerka
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Gelsomino Nobile is quality floral in a bottle, opening with a bountiful bouquet of fresh tuberose sprays--white petals and audacious green sepals. Mandarine and pink pepper then perfectly accompany the entrance of jasmine and orange blossom.

Musk and cedar are subtle in the drydown but knit the elements together with perfectly even silk stitches.

Gelsomino Nobile culminates into an outstandingly feminine fragrance with masculine tenacity, like liquid silk that binds your wrists together in uncompromising captivity.

Bold, cool, and unequivocally well-bred. A truly hypnotic floral that knows how to wield her power.",06/14/14 00:49,Tigerlillian
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Feminine, clean, and oh so floral. It smells like the ultimate garden.

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"The most obvious and apparent note in this perfume is tuberose. It's there from the first spritz until the last remnants of the dry down slowly fades away.
The next note which is obvious is jasmine which is a little screechy and sharp in the initial blast off.
I was slightly disappointed because I wanted to smell the orange, mandarin and pink pepper but all I can smell is very loud jasmine and a nice creamy tuberose.
This is nice for those die hard tuberose lovers, but I think that this is not unique enough for me. I can't tell much of a difference between this and Fracas, they smell almost identical to my nose.
Don't get me wrong, this is a lovely and long lasting scent which will delight many of you Fragranticans, but for me, this is not my nirvana. I'll keep trailing the perfumeries until the day that I find 'the one'.
Longevity is fairly average, I would say about 4-5 hours and longer when sprayed on clothes or in the hair.
Silage is pretty good too, all that Jasmin positively yells at you!

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I ordered Voyage en Mediterranee Jasmin d'Egypte L'Occitane during this past fall(so called blind buy), based solely on positive reviews and received a jasmine fragrance that was not completely comfortable for me. There is something with the honey here. There is honey and there is honey. I noticed that L’Occitane has used this version of honey in their other products too(linden soap, some hair products and hand creams). It's not so prominent, it’s subtle, but it's always there. The honeyed jasmine in Gelsomino Nobile is also somewhat dirty. Just like Jasmin d’Egypte L’Occitane, Gelsomino Nobile is not a dry woody jasmine, it’s not a suffocating jasmine as some of them are on the jasmine market. Gelsomino Nobile smells very natural and will let you breath easier as if during the parched day there is finally a rain. When yesterday I smelled Gelsomino Nobile the first time, I was perfectly prepared for this beauty, thanks to L'Occitane. There are at least two positive things about me using Voyage en Mediterranee Jasmin d'Egypt L‘Occitane during past spring and winter: I hope, I have been smelling perfectly French all this time, plus, hopefully, did not inhale too many aromachemicals plus everybody around me was perfectly content with my fragrance. I still have half of the bottle left. Since VEM Jasmine is discontinued, Gelsomino Nobile is a great alternative jasmine fragrance with better longevity, less transparent.
On my quest for a true jasmine “soliflore” I've found several fragrances that I would classify as more true to a real jasmine in bloom.

That's why I was quite surprised after 45 mins., when it really starts to develope on the skin, revealing more depth, as the floral notes surface and blend with the green citrus ones. It's a high-quality, complex sparkling fragrance that reminds me very much of the original version of ""Charlie"", a favourite of mine in the 70's. It wears close to the skin, so it's a great day or work scent. I plan on buying this as a replacement for my long-lost Charlie, it'll be worth every penny.",06/17/13 10:26,In Vogue
Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"The opening of Acqua di Parma GELSOMINO NOBILE is indeed a noble jasmine. Natural, lush, voluptuous. It's a sure buy-at-the-counter winner. Unfortunately, as the perfume dries down, the all-too-plebeian base shines through stronger and stronger, eventually completely clobbering what was the natural jasmine opening. Sorry to say: this is not cedar.

I may be hypersensitive to iso-E-super, or perhaps it is fat soluble, and my cells just cannot take any more of the stuff, but I must regretfully report that I do not love GELSOMINO NOBILE. Over the course of a wear, as the day becomes more and more gray and my mood more and more somber from reflecting upon the current state of perfumery, I feel compelled to cover up its commoner base--shared with nearly every mainstream men's designer fragrance in existence today--with something, well, noble!

My bottle is small, so I do not regret having acquired this perfume scent unsniffed, but I will not buy it again. I blame the usual four-letter suspects for my disaffection with Acqua di Parma and am seriously considering boycotting all conglomerate-owned perfume houses in the future.",12/20/12 10:47,sherapop

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"My first foray into the big white floral category of fragrances. Opening sharply with mandarin orange and peppercorns, this EDP caught me off guard; it actually smelled strangely smokey and almost leatherish on me at first and I didn't know what to expect. I quickly assumed it was not a good match for my chemistry. But within moments the white florals stepped in and stayed all day long. (not kidding; incredible staying power on me, now up to 11 hours.) After the initial sharp opening it settled into a warm, appealing jasmine/tuberose fragrance; the musk and cedar listed in the base are secondary players in this fragrance. These two basenotes are very subtle, adding a little heft to the floral notes without asserting themselves. The quality of the materials is extraordinary--a feature of this house, from my limited experience with their fragrances--and is a must-try for jasmine lovers. I'm not sure I'm in that catagory, so I'm going to use up my sample before making a big financial commitment on this one.

In my opinion, this is one of the most creative jasmine-dominant creations since 24 Faubourg and Alien. Longevity is outstanding, even in Kuwait's heat.

Acqua di Parma Gelsomino Nobile Acqua di Parma,"**Once again I ""tip my hat"" to the generous ElenaLondon, for the lovely gift of a carded sample of this, which (at the time of this review) is a Harrod's London exclusive. Cheers, dear!**

Notes, and description (from AdP sample card):

""A unique and sophisticated fragrance that celebrates Calabrian Jasmine, a noble ingredient used in classic perfumery. A blend of: Italian Mandarin, Pink Peppercorns, Tuberose, Orange Blossom, Jasmine, Cedar Wood and Musk.""

This is the first AdP woman's scent I have sniffed; and I must say it is lovely! Jasmine comes right at you out of the sprayer, not heavy or thick just sweet and heavenly...dreamlike, on a soft nocturnal breeze. The mandarin orange does lend a bit of fruity clarity to this, and the pink pepper adds a subtle warmth and savoriness. It is like Lady Jasmine is strolling through her garden. She is the Mistress here, surrounded by bright, sunny citric blossoms and a slightly smoky tuberose. This perfume makes me feel like I am out of doors on a beautiful temperate evening, perhaps at a Garden Party chatting with lovely people at a very classy villa or country house. Surrounding this soiree are tall strong noble cedar trees, aromatic and warm with shady green boughs and the faintest hint of musk is on the wind, not animalic or ""pissy"", just natural and enticing. Gelsomino Nobile (noble jasmine) is a very appropriate name for this scent. Naturally beautiful, poised and very very elegant. If you are a jasmine lover, (as I am) you simply MUST smell this refined and stunning take on one of the most used flowers in perfumery, that is anything but common.

Sillage: good
Longevity: very good
Overall: 4/5

On reading the notes (and before actually trying this) my first thought was ""Eeh, again...REALLY?!?"". After spritzing and sniffing its obviously natural essence oils, combined by a skilled hand and learned nose; I can say this is one of the best homages to jasmine, surrounded by the perfect accents, I have sniffed. AdP is one of those houses that may cost more...but, trust me, it is worth it!

NB: This perfume very feminine, but I find it to be just balanced enough to wear myself. Though scents are intrinsically gender-neutral, this is definitely one slanted more towards for the ladies (or a guy who is not ashamed of his ""feminine"" side): slightly sweet, VERY floral and subtly woody. Amazing...",08/13/11 09:54,gypsy parfumista

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"Buongiorno Acqua di Parma is a citrusy, aromatic, and green fragrance.

Its opening is citrusy and herbal, slightly sweet and almost fruity, where the citrus aroma seems to come more from the leaves than from the juice or zest. As time passes, the mint note becomes more intense and realistic. Once it reaches its drydown, the scent becomes slightly musky and ambery, but still fresh.

As its name suggests, this fragrance is ideal for daytime wear and provides a pleasant sense of energy, perfect for spring and summer, casual outings, with friends, office work, etc.

Its longevity was average, lasting up to 8 hours on me, with a fair to low sillage.

Compared to Il Profumo, Acqua di Parma's other release this year, this is a more unisex fragrance, more sparkling, energizing, and modern, because Il Profumo is more masculine and contains more classic elements without being a vintage scent. Personally, I like Il Profumo more, but I think Buoungiorno could appeal to a wider audience.",10/19/25 17:31,caifan

It’s perfect for the office and for warm spring and summer days.
Similar to Torino 21, although with clear differences: in Torino 21, the aromatic side of mint and basil dominates over the citrus notes, making it much stronger and longer-lasting; Buongiorno takes the opposite approach, highlighting the citrus opening and drydown, making it more delicate and refined.
Both are, to me, the summer of my country—Italy—in a bottle.

Similar a Torino 21, aunque con claras diferencias: en Torino 21 domina la parte aromática de la menta y la albahaca por encima de las notas cítricas, lo que lo hace mucho más intenso y duradero; Buongiorno, en cambio, resalta más la parte cítrica en la apertura y en el secado final, haciéndolo más delicado y refinado.
Ambos son, para mí, el verano de mi país—Italia—dentro de una botella.

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"I can’t even grasp how people would prefer Torino21 over this? Every time when I tried to sample T21 the scent is so faint and literally gone in 1-2 hours. For a much cheaper price you can get this one, which last longer and is even better.",07/07/25 10:06,Benzzz

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"If you are comparing this to Torino 21, my opinion is that Boungiorno has a much harsher opening, almost stinging my nose a little bit.

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"A more refined, unisex and better rounded version of Molinard Thé Basilic with less citrus and smoother basil. I say this as Xerjoff Torino21 pretty much passed off Molinard’s release as their own 2 years later at 3-4x the price retail so Torino21 is an overpriced copy. Molinard’s is the OG DNA with mint, basil, citrus, rosemary, lavender, and musk. (Thanks, I see that
@eaudemale already posted about this.)

I’ve owned the Molinard for a while, and while the greenness in Thé Basilic is much sharper and ""in your face"" it's more well blended here. I think the mandarin leaf here, or another note contributes to a fruitier quality so the overall smell is slightly less astringent.
As someone with 100 fragrances I already have a few aromatic green citrus frags that fulfill a similar purpose to this, but I will consider buying a bottle in the future.
Also, I don't ever think men should dictate what fragance women can't wear by saying this is more ""masculine"" BUT because this is fruitier than the alternatives I mentioned, it's more unisex and a woman can definitely wear this.",05/23/25 08:41,Willowthewisp

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"Good morning from Torino!
This Acqua di Parma is truly amazing — a very uplifting, green, and citrusy scent. It's very Italian: simple, timeless, and impeccably made.
If you like mint and basil, you need to try Buongiorno.

I’ve never tried Torino21 — it’s way too expensive for me. Buongiorno is still pricey, but in my opinion, it's worth the retail price.

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"You guys like to write non sense based on brands cashgrabs. This is AdP copying Torino21, is it better? yes.. but then the dry down of Torino21 is a synthetic mess that smells like shampoo from the 80s, anything would be better than that. And Torino21 is a blatant copy of The Basilic by Molinard, quintessential Italian? lol, this DNA was created by Molinard which is French.

Unfortunately, many Italian niche houses copy others and each other, they all have their versions of Acqua di Sale, Arabians Tonka, Britney Fantasy (I mean, Erba Pura), Delina, BR540, Aventus and now The Basilic, I mean ""Torino21"".",05/12/25 14:31,eaudemale
Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"It seems Buongiorno does not belong to any series Acqua di Parma is known for, but is rather promoted as a sunny perfume standing on its own two feet, celebrating the arrival of the Tuscan spring and coming in edp concentration.

The first thing I would say after this perfume greets me ""Good morning"" is a slightly hesitant ""How do you do"". It is a bright opening indeed, but I find the brightness to be a bit muddled. The top is like an unsuccessful mix of Fico di Amalfi and Mandarino di Sicilia from the Blu Mediterraneo line where the woody and elegant fig and the fresh, green mandarin both loses out. I am reminded of Xerjoff's summer scents that I do not really care for. Most high end brands have the weakness that whilst being onto something interesting, they sometimes cover up the artistic outset under thick layers of talcum in order to obtain the nod of approval from an imaginary (or real) Nan or Aunt Primrose.


In brief, I think it is a departure from the AdPs I have tried that Demachy was behind. They started out bright but mostly developed nicely into something woody with green spices and herbs to support. Apart from Demachy's creations, I find that AdP has often struggled with the later phases of their scents, and Buongiorno is no exception. Good tenacity, but linear to the point where you get quite bored after a while. Occasionally what remains from the top smells like a high end version of nameless (and countless) ladies' scents from the early 1990s over a masculine white musk. This effect is much like Essenza's fantastic opening slowly evolving into smelling more and more like the generic white soap bars that smelled the same all over continental Europe cirka 1993. Absolutely not worth the retail price, but not off putting either.",05/12/25 12:10,Opato
Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"Delicious. Subtly fresh and natural. Has the Acqua di Parma DNA - in other words it's quintessentially Italian and perfect for summer.

Very light though

This is definitely unisex in that pleasant citrus/herby way. Opens with spearmint, dries down to a perfect abstract summery woody/citrus.

For some reason it made me think of The Talented Mr Ripley. It's probably too uplifting and pleasant for, say, Tom Ripley or Dickie Greenleaf (they'd wear the more masculine classic Acqua di Parmas) but Marge would wear this perfectly.

I imagine Marge floating around Capri maybe, wearing citrus yellow linen and a very wide-brimmed straw hat.

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,Very strong basil and mint notes that personally I don't like. Very green scent generally. Not my cup of tea.,04/27/25 13:24,Stelcon
Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"I love almost all of Acqua di Parma releases and I have to say this one is exceptionally good. I ordered it on the same day I tested it in a store.

The opening is fresh, natural and invigorating. You can smell the mint, citruses and herbal notes. In the dry down woody notes and slightly sweet musk start to come out. This fragrance really lifts the mood.

I've seen some comparisons to Torino21 and I can understand that but it's definitely not the same, just similar style. Some also say this smells very simple and I guess it's true but at the same time it's quite unique comparing to vast majority of really boring contemporary releases. It has this sort of classic cologne backbone which in my opinion is missing in contemporary perfumery.

Projection is not too strong, I would say moderate for a few hours. Longevity is pretty good for a fresh fragrance like this one.

The only drawback is the price. I got a 180ml bottle for ~220 EUR and that was the cheapest one I could find from a legit store. I assume it will be a bit cheaper once it hits discounters if you don't mind waiting.",04/26/25 16:16,Glue

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma’s Buongiorno is 10/10 stunning mint-forward fragrance that delivers an incredibly photorealistic mint note right from the start it's fresh, invigorating, and almost dewy in its realism. It's a fragrance that feels like a breath of early morning air in an Italian garden, wrapped in light yet confident elegance.

The sillage is impressive without being overpowering, and the longevity is genuinely great, easily lasting through the 6-8 hrs. mark. As it dries down, it reveals the signature Acqua di Parma DNA, echoing the refined backbone of ADP Colonia, with that crisp, clean, and effortlessly classy trail the house is known for.

Here is where it gets tricky, yes, its sits really close to Torino 21 so close that almost steps in the dupe territory, but just when you think it’s a copy, the differences begin to emerge. Buongiorno is more sober, less citric, and skips the creamy sweetness that defines Torino 21. What you're left with is a cleaner, more herbaceous and lighter experience, one that feels a bit more mature and grounded.

If you’re already a have Torino 21, this might feel familiar, but if you don’t have it in your collection, Buongiorno becomes an easy, safe blind buy. Honestly, if I didn’t already own Torino 21, this would have been a no-brainer addition. A classy, versatile mint fragrance that’s both uplifting and refined, Buongiorno is Acqua di Parma doing what it does best.",04/13/25 16:30,RØD
Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"This is very, very good.

1)EDP. Good longevity and projection (in comparison to all other ADPs I have - probably about 10).

2)I agree with PaddyOh Fraiche and Vitodito, it is in the same general family as one of my favorite summer citrus bangers, Xerjoff's Torino21

3)Great balance of tart and sweet citrus notes

4)Very strong yet pleasant realistic mint accord, provides a refreshing coolness in the summer heat

5)The juice is a very pretty golden color

6)This is like a thicker, stronger modernized ADP Colonia. I love that.

7) I also have the new Il Profumo, and Buongiorno is significantly better, in my opinion.

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"First Impression: Love the bottle color. I smelled it blind hoping that the bottle color indicated it would be something with citron. What I got was lots of spearmint, basil, and rosemary right out of the gate. The spearmint is distinctly spearmint and not mint which is cool.

However, I have a tumultuous relationship with basil as I've never really liked it in food, but I can sometimes tolerate the it in fragrance. Rosemary can also be hit and miss. Reminds me of Colonia Club which I thought was okay, and Colonia C.L.U.B (stupid name) which I cannot stand because they used too much shiso.

So far my opinion is not to purchase, but I will try it in the heat where it should thrive.",04/02/25 21:14,The Wolf

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma coming for Xerjoff’s meal with their Tonino21.. this is a way better mint herbal fragrance. Shares basic similarities with the original The Basilic (which is what Xerjoff copied for Torino21) but here the basil is toned down after the citruses fade and the blend is more herbal aromatic with a powdery woody drydown. This is the best of the bunch, then The Basilic, but this DNA is not that great. I would have liked them to do an Imagination interpretation instead.",03/22/25 19:28,eaudemale
Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"Enjoying this but not sure what to think of it. It's got some similarities to AdP Colonia's vibes deep down, but initial impressions is that it's more tart, more extroverted citrus...not the subdued, soft, elegant citrus of AdP Colonia. It's a stronger personality, more up front and stronger citrus with a pronounced Mandarin tartness and hints of mint. Great for spring and summer holidays.

Buongiorno Acqua di Parma,"I received an official sample of this and just tried it now on skin. Wow, another fantastic fun under the Italian sun fragrance by Acqua di Parma. Buongiorno starts off with a blast of citrus and mint and then proceeds to settle to a more herbacious and woody base for the dry down. Buongiorno is an amazing mint fragrance and smells much more natural than Torino 21, however, apart from the mint I actually find the dry down to be similar to Aqua Media Cologne Forte by MFK. Perfect for warm spring days and summer days.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma’s Iris Nobile is a fragrance that feels like a quiet luxury, evoking the elegance of a flower garden at dusk. This is a floral, oriental masterpiece that balances sophistication with approachability. I’m reviewing the Eau de Parfum, which offers a deeper, more lasting experience.

From the first spritz, Iris Nobile opens with a bright and refined blend of citrus—mandarin and bergamot—laced with a subtle hint of star anise. The anise adds a slightly spicy, licorice-like edge that keeps the citrus from feeling too predictable and more interesting. It’s fresh but not sharp, setting the stage for the heart of the fragrance: a lush bouquet of iris, orange blossom, and ylang-ylang. The iris here is the star, delivering a soft, powdery elegance that feels like velvet petals rather than the cold, rooty iris found in some other scents. It’s neither overly powdery nor heavy, striking a balance that feels both classic and modern. The orange blossom and ylang-ylang weave in a creamy, faintly tropical warmth, giving the floral core a radiant glow.

As it dries down, Iris Nobile settles into a base of vanilla and amber, with whispers of musk and patchouli. The vanilla is restrained—not sugary but smooth, rounding out the florals without overpowering them and this is my favourite stage. The amber adds a golden depth, like sunlight filtering through autumn leaves and again, it’s not overpowering. On my skin, the fragrance feels intimate yet present, with moderate sillage that doesn’t overwhelm but lingers for a solid 6-8 hours, impressive for a floral EDP.

What sets Iris Nobile apart is its versatility. It’s feminine without being frilly, refined without being aloof. It suits a crisp spring morning or a warm summer evening equally well, pairing beautifully with a tailored blazer or a flowing dress. It’s the kind of scent that feels like an extension of yourself—polished but not trying too hard, hence I wear it in the office too. I imagine it on someone confident, someone who appreciates understated beauty over flash.

My only critique? It’s discontinued, which is a heartbreak. Tracking down a bottle can feel like a treasure hunt, and prices reflect its rarity. If you’re lucky enough to find it, it’s worth every penny for its timeless charm.

A near-perfect floral that loses half a point only for its elusive availability. If you love iris done with elegance and heart, this is one to experience while it lasts.",04/12/25 01:26,seventh
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Delightful and exquisite fragrance! This is so beautiful. ✨Such a shame it was discontinued…🥺

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"In my quest to find a iris scent to rival Serge Lutens Iris Silver Mist, I have collected many samples of promising perfumes. I have been impressed with the other Acqua di Parma Nobiles. However, unlike its Rosa or Peonia counterparts, Iris Nobile curiously isn't an iris-dominant scent. It is a good-quality white/yellow floral bouquet, but not what I'm looking for.

IN opens with bright orange notes, juicy and fresh, almost like a reference to Acqua di Parma's signature Colonia. This segues seamlessly to a sweet, orange blossom note, paving the way to the tropical white floral heart. Sweet tuberose adds body, but tropical ylang ylang is dominant to my nose.

Mimosa follows as it develops, powdery and shimmering, rounding out the tropical, creamy floral heart beautifully and adding interest.

Vanilla keeps things sweet and creamy as it dries down, alongside soft woodiness. The florals remain, tropical and creamy throughout. There is no iris to speak of - any powder is due to the mimosa. It fades to a powdery vanilla skin scent. Sillage and longevity are moderate.

A feminine spring/summer tropical white floral, IN would be a nice example of that genre if it didn't purport to be an iris scent. Decent, but disappointing for this reason. Ylang Nobile. 3/5.",10/08/23 11:00,Enrium

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Sampled as I was curious how this brand would do a 'lady' perfume.

There is tiny hint of volatile citrus cologne in the opening which is probably the bit I liked the most!

As we often read, the iris has no scent in nature but perfumers have reached a consensus that it can be represented in perfume a certain way - which I think I am coming to recognise is too dry and powdery a floral scent for me, like an old-fashioned makeup scent. Then again, this also has notes of star anise and ylang-ylang (which I find anise-y) listed, and I'm a licorice hater, so maybe that's what I didn't like.

It's pretty light for modern mid-to-high-price women's perfume. I reckon people who like lighter scents, powdery florals and makeup-y scents should give it a go.",07/23/23 23:24,belinda.1

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I love this house, Acqua di Parma and I wore Magnolia Nobile for what seems like forever. I decided to give Iris Nobile a try and overall, I really like this EdP.

As others have noted, Iris Nobile is an iris fragrance but certainly not a soliflore. Shortly after the very intense ANISE and (signature) citrusy orange AdP opening, this perfume morphs into a lovely display of soft white florals. Iris is present but so tuberose, orange blossom, yling-ylang and other ethereal sweet florals are also evident. Yet Iris Nobile is not translucent or sheer in any way. This EdP is a rather hefty, creamy, dense spicy-floral fragrance that lands with ambrette, musk and a wee-bit of amber.

To my nose, Magnolia Nobile is feminine floral all the way. I detect spicy floral, some resin, a bit of cedar but not much more. And unlike what others have noted, I do not get a ton of vanilla in the dry down.

Similar to Magnolia Nobile, the silage with Iris Nobile is moderate and longevity is long, say 6+ hours on my skin.

Not sure yet about this one. I ADORE Magnolia Nobile but after a spell, I moved away from feminine floral and into oud, wood, resin, incense-y, sorta churchy fragrances. Now I feel like I need more of a balance because the latter mentioned tend to lean way too masculine for my current taste & lifestyle.

This is a lovely floral fragrance, which I understand is out-of-production. If you can grab a full bottle before there are none to be had and you love Italian leaning citrus floral fragrances, go ahead and give Iris Nobile a try!",04/01/23 18:49,tonileefiore
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Oh my. I never expected a perfume based on Iris to be this rich, animalic, and amazing.

(I don't know if they smelled like this freshly, but the copies I found years later certainly did!) The notes here did not prepare me for the depth of this perfume - darker than name, bottle, or notes could imply.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Boy, I'm not really digging this brand. 1 like so far. Iris Nobile really, really reminds me of Parfums Gres Lumiere Blanche. A perfume that I just grew to hate. At first just like this perfume Iris Nobile, I thought it was a ""meh"" take it or leave it but the more I smelled both of these perfumes a sickly feeling comes over me. Almost like the smell of death but a death that has been bleached by the sun or weathered w/ time or covered up by flowers and air freshener of a funeral home. I do not want to describe what this really smells like to me, but it is an upsetting memory that I would not like to relive. But it is a memory of death. This perfume is making me very sad. It is a visceral and emotional reaction for me. I am sorry.

Edit: 1/23/23 Trying to give some of these perfumes I hated so much another shot but this is still a no way for me.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I wonder if I got a bad batch :( I don't get any of the notes listed really. I'm a lover of powdery iris fragrances, unfortunately there must be something in this that just doesn't blend with my body chemistry or something. It's not a scrubber, but it's close.

It opened with the smell of sharp lime (which wasn't in the notes) and something faintly smelling of rubber. The rubber smell began to intensify after the ""citrus"" died away. After half an hour it is beginning to settle into a familiar iris (Ala Prada infusions d' iris) the dry down is nice enough but I still get faint whiffs of rubber. There are hints of ylang ylang and the pith of an orange.",12/18/21 15:51,AMMILLER

Iris Nobile is a complex and well rounded fragrance but it makes me feel very formal and older. If I go to the formal party or interview, I would probably wear it. I can’t imagine who can have sex wearing this. I wish I could return it. Such a waste.",08/21/21 12:46,Domina1

There is nothing creamy or soft about the EdT, it is just sweet fresh and sharp. The fragrance is not limited to iris; orange blossom, anise, bergamot are equal players in the composition.

Iris Nobile I find to be very chic, charming, but also haughty and demanding. A cafe with a marbletop table with a cup of fragrant Earl Grey tea on a rainy day in spring would be the picture that it paints for me.

I've been entranced with this for 2 days and nights and I still can't move on to any other perfume.
It's an elegant marvel and a wonder; I have nothing like it in my 300+ perfume collection.
Iris is the powdery, gleaming Diva in a symphony of moss-infused anise, white florals, peach-infused cumin (not in the notes here, but seen in the perfumer's notes) ambrette and vanilla.
The perfumer describes it well: ""The floral bouquet only accompanies, and not at all overlays the beautiful iris solo – delicate-retro-romantic, with a trace of aery powder.""
Discontinued (mine's a lucky ebay find) and well worth blind buying if you enjoy Iris; this is the most magnificent Iris-centric perfume I've encountered.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Please bear with me, as I know I've previously reviewed this and noted my heartbreak over its demise, but I just sprayed myself lavishly as my sleep scent. I want to cry, but I'm too angry to do so.
Why, Acqua di Parma? WHY????? Iris Nobile is the crown jewel of the Nobile collection, and I have all of them. It's the first and the best in my opinion. I understand that fragrance is a completely subjective experience and that its likability to any individual is based upon many factors, but it's really hard for me to fathom how anyone could find this objectionable. It may not be your cup of tea, but it's just formulated and blended so wonderfully that it at least deserves recognition based upon that alone. It's unique among my collection of various iris fragrances, and I really love how the Mediterranean vibe associated with the brand works here.
The iris is sublime - not too powdery, not to rooty or carroty, not to flat and reminiscent of paper, just my perfect style of iris. The fact that the tuberose in no way overpowers the iris and instead just lends some sweetness is amazing to me. I love tuberose and white florals, but would never categorize this as a white floral fragrance.
I just don't understand. I suppose it comes down to what sells and what doesn't, but I do consider this to be somewhat of a masterpiece, and you just don't (or shouldn't) stop making a masterpiece based upon profitability alone.
I know it's useless to beg them to reconsider, but a woman can wish. I plan on purchasing a backup bottle next month and another the following month. Thanks for hearing me out!

Very floral from the get-go. Strong and energizing at first and immediately calms to a musky, calm and powdery scent. Absolutely beautiful and spot-on! I think it might be too floral for some women but I love it!

It's bold and elegant but not loud. It definitely gets a lot of attention, this is a scent for working women who want to rule the world.

I absolutely love the dry down. You can clearly smell the iris and it's not as powdery as the beginning. I also smell a touch of vanilla which is just gorgeous! I usually wear this for important meeting or...just whenever I feel like it, really.

Now, this perfume is on the expensive side. But you get what you pay for. Moderate sillage and long-lasting. Absolutely one of the best iris perfumes I have encountered.

The citrus recedes but the anise hovers in the background, providing a type of spicy licorice that complements the beautiful iris.

I claim this is a good choice for delicate mothers, for its floral-creamy-powdery quality. Nonetheless, this is also elegant and classy for daily wear (with chic and dressy outfits), but not for the office, and also not for special evening occasions. Performance is probably the best for an Aqua di Parma.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"So I'm here because my beloved Tom Ford Violet Blonde (a stunning iris fragrance, despite the name) is nearing its end and I've been looking for a replacement iris. From what I've read, AdP - Iris Nobile has a great reputation so I decided to give it a try.

I have in my hands a bottle of the EDP and in the sticker in the back, it lists the notes like this:

FRAGRANCE FAMILY: Floral Cyphre

TOP NOTE: Bergamot, Mandarin, Star Anis, Orange Flower

HEART NOTE: Iris Pallida, Ylang Ylang, Peach, Cumin

BASE NOTE: Vanilla, Patchouli, Ambrette Crystals, Oakmoss.

Star Anis, Iris Pallida, and Vanilla are bolded, so I'm assuming that implies that those are supposed to be the most noticeable notes.

I wish Fragrantica had a separate listing for the EDP and EDT because the notes are so different. At the time I was buying this, I didn't realize there were two different formulations and sniffing the EDP on my hand while and looking at the EDT's note pyramid on my phone left me a bit confused. What I'm smelling is an Iris floral to be sure, but I was not getting any tuberose... maybe possibly some mimosa... There's a listing for a 2008 special edition EDP but those notes are different as well so I believe this page is the best place for my review.

So I'll say outright, this is no Violet Blonde. It's citrusy like Prada Infusion d'Iris EDP but MUUUCH warmer, sunnier and more floral. Someone described this as an orange colored iris and I 100% agree. When I smell my hand (4 sprays on hands and wrists right now) I get a honeyed Iris + Ylang + Peach + Vanilla + and orange creamsicle like notes with hints of warm spices, anise and oakmoss. It's bright, warm, full bodied, rich, smells expensive. Definitely a fall/winter cold weather scent. It's a very nice floral-fruity iris blend. Not what I was looking for but one that I did end up buying.

I'd definitely recommend smelling both EDP and EDT before buying one, I still haven't smelled the EDT yet but from what I've read, it's supposed to be more summery.

The hunt for Violet Blonde's successor continues...",06/01/19 19:40,bibibling
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"White florals, iris, some powder; the Acqua di Parma citrus is detectable in the background. To my nose white florals dominate with iris taking a back seat. Tuberose and orange blossom seem correct. Smells fancy and old world. Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard fancy. The notes are high quality and pretty natural smelling.

This is a feminine scent with a definite 0ld lady vibe. A fall and spring perfume that probably won't offend at work. It's slightly stuffy, formal, not super sexy. Average performance for about four hours before becoming soft. Iris Nobile is nice but it's not for me. It's a little too feminine for my tastes; a little too stuffy; the white florals a little too screechy. The right lady will rock the hell of this.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,". WOW. Only 10 or 12 years later does it finally occur to me exactly what it is that feels so uncannilly familiar about this: the ylang ylang. When I recalled the original Alfred Sung and how it reminded me of honeybees! Neroli, orange blossom, pettgrain, anise. Unusual for an iris fragrance in that it’s anisic root beer like quality recalls the flowers themselves rather than the root which is the typical fragrance component used in iris based scents. floral but also somehow subtly morphs into a clean masculine non powdery barbershop skin scent. Perfect in every way. I bought and wear the large EDT but the EDP is even more luxurious. This gold standard for every male floral.

Exactly the thought I had in mind at the instant I caught sight of your review is that this is more tuberose than iris.

Whatever! let it be more tuberose than iris then. I certainly know that it gave me a full day of solid perfumey goodness yesterday. You know - you keep catching whiffs of it; and in the brief window of opportunity before the idea that you are assessing your own perfume has had time to fully 'crystallise' you catch yourself saying ""[insert deity name] ... that's seriously good stuff!"". And then you know that it truly is!",10/31/18 00:18,YYY_Delilah
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I rediscovered this one recently, and purchased more. For me, Iris Nobile opens with a sharp green note, that quickly warms as the creamy orris root of the iris note opens. Some tuberose, slight touch of rose, lime peel and spice- the notes say cardamom, but it's more subtle than that on my skin, just a sharp intriguing edge underlying the warmth of the opening notes. And again, the notes say bergamot, but it's very lime to my nose in the opening! Over time, the orris stays in the forefront, and the cedar comes forward, with a touch of vanilla. The spice stays all day.

This is not a sweet scent, despite what some of the notes might promise. It's very warm, earthy, creamy, with a bit of an edge. Long lasting, usually good with one spray for the day, 12 hours later is a skin scent. I see a lot of other people report a powdery effect, but for me this is a deep, smooth, rich, buttery, orris extravaganza.

I had forgotten how much I loved this. Despite the fruit notes indicated above, I really get the wood, and orris. The creamy warmth of this scent brings lots of compliments and questions about what kind of lotion I use- people are surprised to hear that it is a perfume. The scent is deeper and somewhat darker than most perfumes, with a richness that I have not found in other scents. I know, I keep using that word, but it fits! This is currently my signature for the fall, as we are experiencing a very cold rainy season in Minnesota, and this scent has that comforting, almost nostalgic tone to it, that warms the heart and eases dreary days.

IN is expensive as a FB, but the EDP (which I strongly recommend, purple cap on the sample vials) is available for as little as $4 per vial on the bay. Worth trying, I promise. And a little goes a long way, start with one spray. The scent will strengthen as it evolves, so give it 20 minutes before deciding to add a second spray. My skin eats scent, but this one has oomph, fair warning!",10/01/18 13:36,lotus and jasmine
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I've had my sample of Iris Nobile for years; I remember liking it at first sniff when I got it, but thinking that I'd need a lot more experience to have anything significant to say about it. And even now, with my perfume vocabulary duly extended, I find it hard to put my impression of this one into words. So I'll just say that it's very good, and that the name is just right: noble really is the word for this refined, elegant, calm, subtle, but also very comfortable scent.

Actually, I get neither iris nor any of the other floral notes specifically - this is one well blended perfume, very cohesive. It makes for a wonderfully soft, subtly sweet and powdery bouquet, a little creamy at first and underpinned by a nicely subdued vanilla. Very clean in a cosy sort of way - one of those I could easily imagine as a signature, because it would work in so many settings without either getting old to myself or offending anyone around me. The only thing I'd change about it is the projection: I wish it were a little stronger. But that might just be the effect of keeping a sample around for several years, especially since so many reviews mention the exact opposite for the EDP version that I have, so I'll reserve judgement on that until I have a larger amount, i.e. as soon as I can get my hands on a little decant.",08/24/18 10:19,dsty

If the iris is the true star of this fragrance, the star anise is the dark matter which everything gravitate towards. Without it it would have been just nice.

Iris Nobile is really more orange blossom up front and the Iris is a misnomer is you like vegetal Iris (like Hiris) Having said that the perfume, the total effect, just oozes expensive, it's 'spendy' and splendid and opulent, a touch of Amarige in there, I guess that's the tuberose. I can't wear the EDP around my neck either, guess that's also the tuberose talking, but she's definitely a Riviera perfume.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Usually I'm not a big iris fan, as I often find it to be suffocating and too heavy and headache inducing. Stumbled over this by accident, tried it on, and fell instantly in love - and ran out and bought it the day after!

Of course iris is the big star of the fragrance (as the name suggest), but tuberose (which I love love love) also play a huge role, as well as a balmy almost wax-like neroli and orange flowers. There is a big fat anise in the mix as well, which personally I'm not a fan of, as I think its licorice-y quality often overrule all other notes. But in Iris Nobile, it is somehow a tame, controlled anise, even though it is massive and huge one.

Iris Nobile hits you with a massive blast at first (spray with caution - a little goes a long way with this baby!) but within half an hour it dries down to this smooth, elegant, feminine, divine balm. Iris continues to be the leading role, but tuberose and mimosa and vanilla peeks out more and more as time goes by, and end up being the most dominant notes, especially vanilla, after some hours. It lingers on the skin as a beautiful, creamy, elegant veil of exotic discrete spices, and white flowers. It reminds me somehow of gardens and markets of the Middle East. One of my best friends always mention how exotic and wonderful I smell when I wear this.

Beautiful, a masterpiece. Bottle match the scent perfect; elegant, timeless, chic, exclusive. Projection is massive - you only need 2 sprays to be fully covered. Last for ages - my jacket sleeve got a spray by accident, and I can still easily smell it several days later.

Highly recommend this wonderful fragrance to pretty much all women :)",12/10/17 04:50,Miffy8900

I sense a yellow lemon at the start, with a type of a sparkling white wine. The wine later looses its sparkle and becomes reminiscent of a freshly opened new cotton cloth, like a fine-machined cotton blouse made in a factory, packaged in a see-through plastic bag and sent to the chain of department stores like KAUFLAND from where I bought a night gown.
Then the fragrance continues in the same note without much change, at least to my sensing, which I like.
I find no powdery notes, not much iris in its bulb smelling form, but there is a bulb of a flower at the texture of the overall volume.
This fragrance relaxes me now, bringing predictability and clean comfort.

I had noticed over time that just like with drinking wine, tea, coffee and water, we bring to the original fragrances types of nuances we carry from our experience of life. That is how people who love chocolate, apples or fruits in general, use spices in their food with deliberation and knowledge, sometimes find those loved nuances in the smells of a wine. With fragrances, as synthetic or natural as they might be, I experience a similar appearance of my perception. But this fragrance somehow comes to me as if I experience it from a fixed point of view, without much change, rather a development based on my meditation through life.",10/23/17 14:42,chocolat

It's the orange blossom, ylang-ylang and tuberose that leads to the same smell. Mahora though is a mysterious 'closed' perfume, Iris Nobile is 'open and inviting' and always reaches out for the sun.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"You may see couple of ""reminds me of"" fragrances on this page, yet other than versions of Iris Nobile, I do not think there is anything that can remind you of this gem. I find this pleasant.

Acqua di Parma fragrances are essential. If you have the chance the smell or privilage to own more than one, you will understand the ""heritage"" they are proud of (or they are marketing, from another point of view). You will understand which frangrance is by AdP from a similar smelling group of fragrances. To me, it is mostly distinctive in the dry down. This white linen shirt, Amalfi breeze, lemon gardens and careless spirit thing.

I thought, to have iris in this mix which is already well grounded should be challanging and it would smell like some cheap body mist. I tried it on the paper with such prejudice in mind and I almost apologized from the small bottle as I smelled the most elegant iris in my life. How dare I doubted you.

Elegance, this was the key. Again there was the Amalfi feel, the breeze, gardens, the linen dress (instead of masculin reference to the shirt), and it was carefree but also confident in a subtle way. To ""play"" iris this way, this is a craftsman' s work.

I mostly prefer to use it in warm weather, probably because of all these associations. I recently noticed as it is ""light"" in heart, it will not ""hug"" you or feel ""blankety"" during colder months, a feeling most of us look for in a winter frangrance.",03/31/17 01:44,mono9

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"There is so much I would like to say about Iris Nobile. It took me quite sometime to get it. Now that it is mine, I can tell you what I think and feel about it.

Iris Nobile is simply beautiful. It might feel a bit bold when you first spray it, but that boldness goes away very quickly and it turns into a quiet but dazzling natural beauty. There is this very warm and subtle sweetness to it. Nothing like burned sugar or sour fruits, but more like sweet flowers under the summer sun. I can almost see the yellow fields when I smell it. The mandarin and orange notes make this scent light and wearable. They blend so perfectly with the flowers that they don't leave a sour feeling behind. The orange color of the citrus fruits melts into the yellow of mimosa, ylang-ylang, amber and the yellow patches of the purple iris petals. I can't stop thinking about how beautiful the color harmony of IN is. It is like a beautiful painting. Even before you open it, the colors of the packaging reveal the warmth and the comfort of this delightful scent that it hides inside.

Iris Nobile is one of the masterpiece fragrances in my opinion. Maybe you have seen and smelled others similar to it, but not quite like it. It is not loud or dramatic. Doesn't need to be. Once you wear it, forgetting or ignoring it is almost impossible. It sits there unpretentiously on your skin and radiates its beauty and warmth quietly.",11/30/16 12:12,Lille Rosse

Iris Nobile (Noble Iris) is my first foray into the fragrance line Acqua di Parma. My God have I been missing out. This is not the best example of their fragrances but it makes a fine intro. As an iris flower lover, and having worn such complex iris scents like L'Heure Bleue or Ysatis Iris, this is a fragrance that falls a bit flat as far as iris scents. It is very light and powdery. I realize that iris in perfumery can turn powdery but this was a bit too powdery, like actual iris scented talcum powder. It seems to want to be worn as a boudoir perfume or skin freshner and it makes me think of an Italian Contessa who loves the smell of iris so she kept a bottle of orris root and powders herself in iris.

Iris Nobile starts off with a citric smell. It's old fashioned citrus based notes of bergamot orange and mandarin orange. They are fresh, very cool, and though not an astringent or aftershave, it's very clearly an orange grove type of scent, juicy, fruity and sweet. The sweetness of the mandarin orange eventually embraces other citrus scents in flowers. I refer to the mimosa and orange blossom. This is as much a yellow floral as it is a purple floral (iris, hibiscus). The ylang ylang floral note smells just the tiniest bit like a banana. So for me there was indeed a fruitiness to this scent, though not heavy.

There is definitely orris root here and the dry down develops into an amber and vanilla powder which can smell like a common household domestic product like powder or soap. The scent is fresh, sweet, and powdery, feminine and clean, very clean.

This fragrance makes me think of the old saying: cleanliness is close to Godliness. This is a royal iris. Elegant, poised, womanly and mature. It has a very lovely aroma and longevity though it turns into powder, powder for days. I guess that's ok sometimes.

This frag can be worn to Church, to a wedding or to a formal dinner engagement. It's not heavy but it has a formality and solemnity to it. At times it does smell like L'Heure stripped down to bare bones. Gorgeous and powdery, and true to it's moniker, a noble scent.",10/08/16 06:16,Gigi The Fashionista

I actually didn't pick up on the tuberose, or at least it's certainly not the tuberose you find in Fracas, Cabotine or 24 Faubourg, which is a relief, because I think that would thrown off the scent in a different direction entirely.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Iris Nobile is a powdering of that appeal with the name of gauzy floral, but without the grace and style that prints Olivia Giacobetti its fragrances as nuanced as a breeze that comes to you from a floral bouquet on a ambarado background and sweet, but insubstantial and soulless.
In this iris bouquet queen in a feud where other flowers accompany him as a retinue of ladies in long flitting around without much power and poise, and that is an EDP.

Very nice, flowery and natural, but applied in skin and I get a jarring note perspiring could be some spice or wood that spoils everything, unless you like that kind of notes, of course :)
Iris Nobile, to me at least, does not convince me, or what vaporous or for that rancid touch.

I think it was a combo of these two that just didn't do it for me.

If all the notes work on your skin, I'm jealous. I'm sure this is a lovely scent on the right person. But for me, it's a no go. I've since sent it back and bought something else. I really wish this would've worked, but oh well, they all can't be winners.",05/15/16 17:59,Whit

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Iris shares her throne with her non-identical twin sister called tuberose. Like the lanky, lovely florals they are, they keep sitting there, all well-mannered and nice to be around.

The tuberose is exactly the kind I smelled in Histoires des Parfums' first of the three - namely, the creamy variety, reminiscent of expensive lotion on sunkissed skin. The iris herself bears little to no resemblance to her gothic cousin Iris Silver Mist (who is the root to Iris Nobile's blossoms) or the ""businesslady"" No. 19, except for maybe a bit of soapiness it borrows from the latter.
Interestingly, Iris Nobile has been praised as a chypre - let's just say, Mitsouko this is not. Anything dark and unsettling has been carefully hidden in the background, serving merely as props to complete the scene.

To me, this is the perfume equivalent of a spa day - it makes you feel neat and pretty and life look so easy.",09/17/15 15:59,globus pallidus

sweetness. refined. but not particularly powdery on me. with a delicious dry down.

actually...thinking about it, like all the Francis Kurkdjian perfumes i have tried...they are overtly feminine and muchly intoxicating.

test before you buy. it is strong and long.

what sprang to my mind as soon as i squirted...were Fracas and Mahora (not in smell, but in bombasticosiousness).

...i found Iris Nobile almost overwhelming to begin with!
despite the almost nausea, i was oddly drawn to it and now i can't get enough!

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"""Whole floral chorus"" is right! Testing the EDP, I do love it, but it's not an iris scent. It's a lovely yellow floral which dries down to a sweet blend of powdery orange blossom and mimosa. If iris is in there, it's hard to find. This is rich, deep, golden, buttery, flowery and strong. I'm surprised and pleased, as I've probably tested too many austere and melancholy iris scents. Also there's not much citrus in the EDP, it's more along the lines of Divine ""Divine"" and Too Much.

As it dries down it becomes slightly sweet, peppered with white florals. I even catch a hint of vanilla at the tail end, as the scent is about to leave me. Projection is just beyond a skin scent - someone near me can smell it for the first couple hours, but I don't believe it projects much further than arms' length. If you really love iris with a twist, I couldn't recommend this more. I'd already have a bottle if finances permitted - but believe you me, it will be a part of my collection as soon as I can manage!",03/07/15 20:43,angellama
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Iris is one of my favorite notes and flowers so I was compelled to try Iris Nobile even though many reviewers have clearly stated that there is not, in fact, much iris present here.

There may be one small austere stem of iris hidden behind the gardenia, tuberose, jasmine, orange blossoms and who knows what else, but how would you ever notice it? The floral avalanche comes to rest on a sweet base of vanilla and light resins. Lots of sillage, lasts forever. Glamorous, fun to try, but somehow not memorable.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Iris Nobile is a real mystery, albeit a beautiful one. My love affair with IN started with a sample I ordered - the impression it gave was an an iris on a lovely cloud of full white flowers and a powdery sweet base. I decided to order a bottle last month and it made me even fall harder for this release from Acqua di Parma. Since Fragrantica doesn't have a separate page for the EdT/EdP, I'll list the notes for the latter here (according to the official AdP site):

Top: Bergamot, Aniseed, Mandarin
Heart: Ylang-Ylang, Iris
Base: Vanilla, Patchouli, Oakmoss

I was really excited when my bottle finally arrived (I was able to snap it up for a bargain price!). As soon as I sprayed it on it confused me; it didn't smell like my sample. It started out rather airy/ethereal, nothing like my sample. I was afraid my bottle already turned since it smelled so thin. The opening consisted of fresh bergamot/mandarin and a light, silky and powdery iris, slightly spiced with aniseed. To my surprise, the opening lasted rather long: about 30 to 45 minutes. Most of the time top notes don't last that long on my skin, so it was a rather nice suprise. It slowly moves on to the heartnotes: the iris becomes more powdery and it gets a slight leathery/oily feeling. The ylang ylang note is simply heaven - it's sweet and smooth, not too intense. It really lifts up the iris and works great with the top notes. The heart notes also last quite long, about 3 hours before the basenotes start to show up. From this point on I start to recognize it; turned out my sample somehow consisted only of the heart/basenotes. The patchouli gives the fragrance some darkness, the vanilla contributes to the plush, powdery feeling and sweetens things up a bit. I can't really make out the oakmoss to be honest.

This fragrance is simply a real delight. I've never had a fume 'evolve' this much on my skin. It starts out light and airy, before transforming in a blooming flower and ending with a sensual whisper. Longevity is great, about 10 to 12 hours. Sillage is really sneaky; I gave it three sprays and at first I barely noticed anything, but when the heart- and basenotes appeared it became rather cloying/overwhelming. Go easy on the trigger with this one. It's versatile enough to be used anytime and anywhere. I would even wear it when going for a night out! It's also perfectly wearable by men - it would make a slightly more floral/fresher version of Dior Homme (without the amber/cacao).",01/04/15 05:32,deda147

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is pretty, powdery and delightful. Iris perfumes are often referred to as the ""little black dress"" of fragrances and this one fits that profile well. It's very wearable for any occasion or weather. It makes a great easy go-to perfume when you're not sure what you're looking for.

A quick word of warning to anyone looking for a rooty/carroty iris: this isn't it. It's a floral interpretation, focussing much more on the iris flower than the orris root. So just to let you know that in case that's not what you like from your iris scents.

This is so beautifully powdery. I sometimes call it my ""ballerina perfume"" because I could imagine it on a pretty, elegant prima ballerina.

The anise is very, very subtle. It lends a little edge to the iris, but that's all. The citrus is a nice burst in the opening, then leaves during the dry down. Surprisingly, I don't really get tuberose. I'm wary of tuberose because I find it tends to overwhelm anything it's in, but that's not the case here.

I got overnight longevity from this and sillage is moderate/strong. A little goes a long way.",08/12/14 07:49,becuille
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Based on EDP concentration.

I dismissed Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile the first time I tried it, as I was getting interested in iris soliflore fragrances, which Iris Nobile didn't seem to be.

Recently, while randomly reading some reviews, I was intrigued by the comments claiming that Iris Nobile focuses more on the iris flower rather than the earthy rooty orris, which I partially agree after trying it again.

On me, Iris Nobile is essentially an orange blossom-centric fragrance, although the iris is also detectable, just not that earthy, rooty, but has a more woody nuance. The floralcy, the vivid orange and the woody and slightly powdery characteristics do remind me of sniffing my pot of blooming iris last spring, as I did catch an orange nuance in the flower. However, the orange in Iris Nobile is so strong on me that I can't help perceving it as an orange blossom supported by iris as a strutural note. From time to time, I can also sense a discreet star anise flirting with the white bouquet.

As time goes on, Iris Nobile becomes more creamy with the addition of tuberose and a faint vanilla. And a moss-patchouli base quitely spreads under the white bouquet, which lends it a very classic character, yet overall, the fragrance still feels like a modern combination of floral and woody elements.

The sillage is heavy to moderate, and the longevity is at least 9 hours. Once I stop sticking too precisely to the name, I find myself enjoying Iris Nobile immensely. Such a chic, elegant composition of orange blossom, iris and moss base. I'd definitely recommend it to those who enjoy white floral or to those who'd like a solid but at the same time a more friendly interpretation of iris or chypre fragrance.",07/21/14 12:39,StellaDiverFlynn
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I think it's a very pleasant smell. The iris is not as strong as I would like, I tend to smell more of the citrus notes and the other floral notes. Thank you, Onaona for the sample. :)",06/22/14 16:54,misslovely
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile is a mix of sweet Iris and white floral. You really have to love white floral to appreciate this offering because, to me, it overpowers the iris smell in this fragrance.",06/22/14 14:17,Lana148
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"As an iris lover I felt dissappointed by this fragrance. I didn´t get the rooty nor the woody or green aspect of it. I was only getting a creamy-powdery vibe more of a violet and tuberose than of an iris. Well... How wrong I was! Last week I had the chance to smell a fragrant iris flower (despite I was told the flower itself is odourless). Now I can say that Iris Nobile is a wonderful and magical interpretation of the ""Iris Sicula"" flower smell. Thanks to Caron and Kurkdjian for revealing one more facet of the wonderful blue flower.",06/18/14 07:26,katacran
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Let me start by quoting another review : I like it and maybe in love.
It is a unique perfume yet so familiar. It evokes in my head words like elegant, luscious, extravagant, rich, warm, comfort, delicious, charming, gourmand...
It is also a perfume full with contradictions it smells old and new at once, it smells unique and familiar, seductive and comforting, sophisticated yet approachable; I think this adds to its charm.
After a couple of tries I found my self drawn to it , like a new love; you can't wait till you experience it again.",04/18/14 01:37,maissaa.zahran
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"My favouite iris. My favouite fragrance all together as of late. Its a stunner! I have it in all versions and the EDP with the golden lid is my favourite. This picture should be updated. I don't think this fragrance above is being made anymore.
There is ; EDP iris nobile.!!! Then sublime and a new edt is out now which is wonderful as well.
My very favourite remains the EDP , rich and loud and sweet and orangey with star anise and vanilla. Amazing luxurious and elegant. Fabulous perfume.

The sublime is more muted and suede like due to the birch , it's less sweet and less loud. Wonderful as well. The edt now , in the tall bottle and white container is fresh and creamy ,powdery and musky. In fact it smells very similar to Nivea cream.
Acqua di Parma perfumes are incredible well made and has high quality Italian made fragrances.",04/03/14 10:42,Germany
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I sampled this one before, and don't remember enjoying it quite as much as I do at the moment- on this cold night, when winter just refuses to let go of its grip on us, it is really hitting all of the right notes!

Dry iris, accented with orange blossom,bergamot and amber- a little powdery, a little soapy, definitely unisex-

Excellent longevity and potency-",03/25/14 19:07,pansylady
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Very, very light floral, in a way pretty and carefree, almost childish. I may be mistaken but it smells a sort of diet Juicy Couture JC, I mean, sugarless... and diluted also. Can't detect any note specifically, just a bouquet of white flowers. But quality is still very Acqua di Parma, Iris Nobile EDT smells fresh and natural, like a mixture just made.

Edit: it seems that I applied very little thus I couldn' smell iris Nobile properly. I can get the staranisee and amber quite strong, some vanilla, and woods up from the opening. Anisee and iris together makes IN smell a bit like Shalimar Parfume Initial. I like it very much and don't think it's that feminine after all.",03/11/14 10:55,Jose Marcos
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I had a carded sample of this and tried it but will pass it on to another perfume buddy here. While this is a classic floral fragrance that smells as expensive as it probably is, I would not call it an iris. If you are after Iris there are plenty of better options - cold, warm, sweet, dirty etc. This is iris hidden in a big bouquet - I can clearly detect a lot of tuberose here. I actually like tuberose, but I prefer my tuberose scents to be decadently sweet, with vanilla and gardenia etc. and I love my iris scents powdery, violetty, with orris root, etc. To me, these are two different kettle of fish that don't need to mix ;-)",02/02/14 07:58,patxaran
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This review is based on a decant. Touted by many as one of the better iris scents. Perfumeposse said it's a beginner's more accessible iris. Opening is a bit strong with AdP's signature citrus notes, which then quickly settles down and stays closer to skin. On my skin I get mostly white floral especially tuberose. It smells too familiar. It's the same tuberose from my wife's Fracas by Robert Piguet except that Fracas is a jammy one. Marketed as for women and I would have to agree with that due to the predominant white floral notes. I don't get the orris root I love so much from Dior Homme in this but It's a quality well-crafted scent nonetheless. It would fit nicely on my wife but I couldn't see myself pulling this off. Moderate projection and longevity on my skin.",01/25/14 08:27,ParfumFetiche

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I have deluxe samples of both the EDT and the EDP, and love them both, though they are very different scents. If you want a perfume that screams ""IRIS!"" definitely go for the EDP, the EDT is just as much about neroli as it is iris. Since I'm a neroli fiend, that suits me fine.

The EDP is warmer, darker, and more sophisticated. Beautiful, but I can't see myself using it until I'm older. It's not old lady-ish, but it's just a tad too rich for this particular 20 something.",10/11/13 08:57,elena788
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Somehow both powerful and understated. If there's one perfume I own that pulls attention from men, this would be it.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Based on EDP

I love love love iris and was so excited to try this version of Iris Nobile. Unfortunately for me, the iris is short lived. On my skin orange blossom and tuberose take over. I am shocked because this stage lasts forever. I've been waiting for the last 4 hours for the vanilla to show up and was hoping I might feel the iris again in the dry down. But no such luck. I tried Iris Nobile Sublime and found that closer to what I was looking for. Very nice for tuberose fans.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I got a deluxe sample of this and sprayed it on and was like ""whew!"" and put it in the ""to give away"" pile. Then just shortly after I got a whiff and thought is that the scary perfume? It smells phenomenal!! Then I ended up sniffing my arm over and over. Then I took it back out of the giveaway pile and put it back into the keeper pile. Then I forgot about it and ran across it again recently and now it is in the ""to be purchased"" pile.

There is no missing the iris in this so I am puzzled as to how anyone could say there is no iris in this. It is like an iris bomb. I grew up with a grandmother who grew irises and there is no mistaking the smell.

Lasts nearly all day for me and has decent sillage (or the max that I like to have, I do not want to completely overpower a room or leave a trail but I don't want a nose to have to be 6 millimeters from my wrist to be able to smell it either.)

A beautiful, classic fragrance and I recommend it to anyone looking for an old school classic scent that nobody else will have on yet everyone will notice and want to know what on earth you have on. I am not getting any unisex from this at all, it smells completely feminine.",08/08/13 22:05,christianne1
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I was pleasantly surprised with one of the most beautiful, unique, elegant fragrances I have encountered. This is in my top 3 favorite irises.

Iris Nobile blooms on my skin and develops stronger and stronger with time but never becomes overpowering (unless the orange blossom starts to get bossy like it sometimes does). It is a sensual iris-ylang combo with only a slight edge of powder adding some femininity. There is also something in Iris Nobile that smells of sweaty, salty hair but it never crosses the line into animalic territory (although if it did, I wouldn't mind). It reminds me a little of Putain des Palaces but more refined and with better lasting power.",04/06/13 09:42,antfarm
Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I ordered a spray sample of this based on ecstatic mentions of this fragrance on the discussion boards. I should have looked on the notes listed for this and recognized that the high register of powderiness is perfume doom for me. The initial spray brought a very pretty scent which quickly faded to powder that was completely gone in well under two hours. This is a gorgeous perfume, but apparently my chemistry blasts the poor darling into oblivion. The scent is definitely a good one for hot weather, if it works for you. I recommend you invest in a sample and try before buying. I expect if this works for you, it will work in a memorable and very pleasing way.",03/24/13 16:45,ranchorita

This is one of the rare cases when i like the EdT more. It's fresher, softer, brighter, very natural smelling. The EdP is heavier and it smells slightly synthetic to me compared to the EdT. I do like the EdP as well, just not quite as much. There's something in the drydown that makes me go ""meh"", maybe it's the oakmoss and patchouli combo?

I'm new to iris perfumes so my basis for comparison is non-existent, but I had expected it to be a big powder bomb at some stages, which thankfully it was not. Gently powdery and very beautiful. The white florals (tuberose, ylang-ylang and orange blossom) are prominant throughout. The dry down is a voluptuous, earthy mixture of amber, vanilla, and cedar--I couldn't find the patchouli or oakmoss there--which lingers for many hours. Wearability is great; I would wear this day or night as long as I applied with a light hand. Long wearing, 12 hours and up on me. This is going on my wish list. Love it!",11/28/12 14:06,dlane1953

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This was not what I was expecting. Iris Nobile I had hoped to be a more luminous version of Hiris, an iris scent with a little more kick. This however has entirely too much.
My first thought was 'What is this white floral monstrosity??' It's not actually a monstrosity of course, but it is certainly not what I would call an iris scent. I got citrus and anise in the opening then tuberose and orange blossom and they overpower everything else.
It slowly grows gentler, but never do I feel any powder or iris. Very nice projection and the staying power is doing very well, which is apparently very good for this line of scents. Not what I wanted at all.",10/15/12 10:27,DresdenDoll

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is quite the chameleon on me- each time I wear it, it smells differently- unusual for me-

On first impression, the opening citrus notes seemed very dominant and bracing, placing it firmly in the unisex category- completely drowning out the iris, unfortunately-

At times, the heart is off-puttingly indolic- but not always-

Orange blossom becomes prominent in the base, and I find this to be the most pleasant phase- I smell musk too, although this note is not listed here- however, the fragrance is categorized as a floral woody musk...

The warmer I am, the better it smells- which I've noticed often happens to me with orange blossom notes-


I'm guessing that my sample is the original rather than the reformulated version, which is supposed to be heavier on the iris and lighter on the citrus-

Decent sillage and longevity- 10+ hours is pretty good in my book-",06/02/12 20:25,pansylady

I very much liked the creamy drydown, but overall this fragrance is too sweet for me to wear everyday. I would have to be in a particular mood to be extra, extra girly. I bought the bottle, then returned it and opted to get a few samples of it for when I do feel in the mood.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"The following review is reffering to the E. d. P.

Elegant and well balanced a classical luminous fragrance more than an ""avant garde"" creation. Though iris is the main theme, many other ingredients are involved like Bulgarian rose and jasmine (in the opening) a gentle touch of peach even though not declared in the piramid above, noticeable especially during the dry down while it turns into a lovely powdery fragrance. Personally I prefer even a little more invention - when possible - BUT I see that the especially good ingredients here employed make the charming fragrance that it is and ingredients make always a difference! Good sillage, it reminds me the vintage Paco Rabanne E. de Calandre....but probably mine is just a fade memory. Very good persistence, even better than I thought. Whenever real iris is involved prices are always looking towards the sky... so if you are sure to leave it where it is, at least, think about a gentle introduction because it worth. I cannot suggest when to use it, I've tried it twice during the last three days (february) and I think it could be right for winter, probably also for the middle seasons, but I can't say without ""evidences"". Very good - in a different but interesting manner - either on a male skin or a female; on me it's perfect (another temptation!) but...every skin speaks a different language.

I've noticed my nose has started to tolerate irisses a lot more lately than at the beginning, and I also do think... It's probably the weather. I've smelled this in warm weather, but combined with sun and sweat this smells a bit odd and as I said earlier, mediterranian-bathroom-ish. But now in wintertime, it really blossoms on my skin! It's hard too describe what it is all about besides the iris, but I really dig the warm woody edge it has to it (and cedar always seems to smell musky on me!). Fresh, warm, powdery, floraly, woody, elegant, it has it all! Very very nice (for winter)!",12/19/11 07:59,melia

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I, just this past weekend, received carded spray samples of BOTH the Iris Nobile EDP and the EDT *bows deeply to ElenaLondon*...and here are the differences (as shown on the cards) between the two:

EDT: ""An elegant floral fragrance-transparent, fresh and crystalline: IRIS, STAR ANISE, ORANGE BLOSSOM and AMBRETTE CRYSTALS.""

EDP: ""An intense floral fragrance-sensual, sophisticated and long lasting: IRIS/ORRIS, YLANG YLANG, PATCHOULI, VANILLA and OAK MUSK.""

To me (at ""firsniff"") the EDP is definitely richer, thicker and more heady, sexy and deep...while the EDT (while remaining a ""true"" iris scent) is sharper, more ""active"" or energetic and spicier (after it dries down). I shall review BOTH of these ""Ladies"" (separately) VERY soon...

I do believe that the ""for HER"" AdP scents are actually more ""me"" than some of the men's releases are: (Cipresso di Toscano excluded) Iris Nobile EDP and Magnolia Nobile EDP, for example, are both well-constructed clean but complex florals with a touch of mystery and exotic spices, and marvelous dry downs that LAST!! My skin normally DEVOURS flowers like magnolia (or sours them!) but here they are amazing and long lasting (in either concentration)!

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Iris nobile (edp) is definitely very mediterranean. Kind of creamy but fresh, very strong... It really reminds me of organic olive soap!

I absolutely don't hate it, but I don't really like it either. I think I would prefer it as a candle though.

EDIT: sometimes I really don't understand myself! Why did I make that remark on the 50+? It doesn't make any sense. I'm still on the mediterranean bathroomcandle opinion though, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't like to smell it on a 20 year old too (still not on me!).",01/25/11 05:56,melia

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I've been sniffing all the iris-centric perfumes that I can get my nose on and happened upon a sample of Acqua di Parma IRIS NOBILE. Wow, I'm impressed. I may even be in love. Part of my surprise no doubt is due to the sheer fact that this is a perfume (edp, actually), not a cologne. Somehow I had been laboring under the misconception that a house called ""Acqua di Parma"" only traded in colognes, or watery ""eaux"". Not so, I am happy to have discovered!

IRIS NOBILE is a thick and rich, complex and layered iris perfume with a fantastically fine woody-iris drydown. I have to say that, next to this, Prada INFUSION D'IRIS does seem pretty boring--as some perfumistas have lamented. (Of course, that's fine with me, since if some did not like it I would never have acquired my big, beautiful bottle in a swap!)

This composition is closer to HIRIS, although it's true that the carroty, earthy facet of IRIS NOBILE is much less prominent. The anise adds thickness and depth. I do believe that this is a noble iris perfume, one of the best around. The quality is top-notch (yes, I'd compare it to Frederic Malle), and this composition is completely unisex. Iris lovers: do not neglect to give this gem a sniff!

Dark soil, chopped root vegetables, dill weeds, earthworms, feet, pepper, the smell of steel shovel turning earth in the cold morning (all good). And then, an organic metallic smell, like blood and saliva (bad *bad* BAD!).

Thankfully this transforms itself into a cold, inorganic metallic base to the spicy powdery iris arising out of the ashes.

Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. An iris based fragrance at its prettiest.

Iris Nobile is so very feminine and subtle. On the skin it becomes incredibly natural and soothing. This fragrance smells as expensive as it is worth, a delicate and interesting blend of notes which is in no way synthetic or loud.

I find that this fragrance could suit any age group, it's versatile and suitable for all occasions, all seasons.

The drydown is my favourite aspect of Iris Nobile, the powdery iris and vanilla blend is to die for. However, this fragrance is divine from beginning to end.

Lasting strength of this fragrance is excellent, well worth the money in my opinion. One of the prettiest florals I've ever come across and certainly worth all the rave reviews. Iris Nobile gets the thumbs up from me.",11/28/09 21:47,missk

Iris Nobile is real retro scent. It can seem very old fashioned to light, sweet perfume lovers, anyway this one has character and very noble personality.
Then after hours it goes more into sweet side. It has chypre feeling to it too. I was like love it, like it... oh, I own 1 like that! It's worth the price, because lasting power and sillage also is very good (I tried EDP).

Oud and Zagara Acqua di Parma,"Oud and Zagara smells like a woman who definitely didn’t push her husband off the yacht - but also didn’t shout for help. She’s stretched out on the upper deck in head-to-toe white linen, sipping a Negroni, already eyeing up husband number two. The vibe? Don’t touch my Birkin, darling - and keep your muddy shoes off the teak.

The florals are sharp as nails- orange blossom with a refined accent and zero time for your nonsense. There’s a clean, soapy chill to it, like the scent of freshly steamed curtains in a hotel suite you’re not fancy enough to stay in. The oud? Barely peeking through, but just enough to say “old money” without trying too hard.

It’s cold, composed, and smells like it’s got a lawyer on speed dial. Not quite my cup of tea but if you want to smell like inherited wealth, quiet scandal, and a perfectly timed divorce, this is absolutely your bottle.",06/16/25 10:57,Natalieex

2) 20% oud
3) 10% citrus

The oud is stronger than the concentration in either Oud and Spice or Oud from ADP. The white floral is very creamy and buttery and is the dominant actor in the composition.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree opens with Calabrian bergamot & Italian Orange. But they're not bright Citruses. They're fresh, but they're Dark. Darkened up by the immediate presence of Oud & Leather. The Citruses are also Piney from the Amyris.

From its initial opening Colonia Oud smells more like a Leather fragrance with supporting Citruses & Woody notes than it does an Oud forward fragrance.. The Leather note is fantastic.

This combination of Citruses, Oud, & the faint Spice of Coriander makes Colonia Oud smell like luxury leather. Like the interior of some ridiculously expensive luxury vehicle.

As Colonia Oud settles on my skin it becomes so well blended that for the next 2 hours I cant pick out any of the other notes outside of Leather & Oud until I finally begin to pick up on a subtle Bitter Green, & mildly Earthy Patchouli Leaf in the dry down. Several hours after that you're left with a Dark, Cedar, Sandalwood, & Musk skin scent with Spicy nuances.

Colonia Oud is a bit of a chameleon. It appears to be whatever you dress it up as.

If you wear it as a CEO, then it smells like a CEO. If you wear it in Black Tie Attire, then it smells Black Tie Attire. But it can also be very alluring in the right situation with the right outfit. That said, if you dress it up in a Dark Leather Jacket & Dark Clothes as a Bad Boy, then it smells like a Bad Boy.

The Oud note doesnt smell Earthy, Moldy, or like a Mechanics Shop, nor does it smell like a Barnyard. It smells like subtle Dark Dry Woods.

Performance is very good with Colonia Oud, & it can be worn year round..",04/19/23 09:12,NOSEYBODY

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"A clean musky oud and leather. Clean does not rhyme well with oud or leather but in this, it does. It has a very subtle animalic touch to it that interestingly stays very close to skin while this fragrance has an over the average silage. Hands down the longest lasting fragrance marketed as EDC I have ever seen. Stays on clothing for days and projects nicely for hours; better than most of EDPs and parfums these days. Musk is chosen as the main pairing note with oud here and I really like it -- a trend breaker that doesn't use rose. It stays on long and projects really good but yet it feels light. IMO, it's a year-round fragrance and office safe. It's marketed towards men and opens up a bit masculine leaning but in dry down it is very unisex to my nose.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Thinking of making it my signature, over the darkest coldest part of winter. 10ml decant from Ebay with free shipping, £9.95; cumulatively cheaper than many outlets charge for a full bottle. My first shot was sickly and cloying. The next time was extra dry and woody. Gorgeous.
It seems powerful. And 10 minutes later, even more so. One spray on a wrist, then rubbing over other wrist, and the neck, was plenty. Though one spray from Ebay seller phials tends to be too much- so possibly you can risk 2 sprays from the branded container if you own a bottle.
It's down to personal preference, but I love the intense woody aroma. It compliments the icy air of the day or evening. I personally like it as a daytime scent.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"A daring oud citrus that is pleasantly unique. I love fragrances that push the boundaries and this does that in a ""genius is simplicity"" sort of way. It certainly feels as though you will stand out wearing this. I have received a couple of compliments and if oud gives you comfort, I think youll find it very satisfying.

I must say at first I didnt like it, but I didnt hate it. I just felt like this was something like the Middle Eastern version of Rodney Dangerfield would wear? My take is that if you have a lot of personality then you can push the edge a little more. I am not much like Rodney Dangerfield, nor am I the kind of man that can make golf pants work while enjoying a fine plate of kebab. Regardless, after a couple of wears I can safely say I like it. It projects for several hours, the peppery oud will stick around and slowly rise up off the skin. It will fill a room quite easily if you linger for a bit. The richness of it makes it hang around, it has maybe a 2 meter sillage for the first 6 hours. Citruses compete with the oud for quite a while but they will eventually diffuse off faster than the oud. Amyris connects the oud's smokiness and the sweetness of the musk and it announces its high quality ingredients quite clearly. For me, unfortunately, there is not enough basey sweetness for me to offset the oud. Im not in to sweet fragrances, but the oud skank lingers a bit too much in all phases for me. Hilariously, even though I was looking for oud fragrances without rose, I think it is sorely lacking here in a just a minute tiny amount to offset that funk.

I like it, but it's not for me. It's clever and unique and thats what I really appreciate about it, but I got bored with it fast. One spray can be fine with this if you pop it on a pulse point and not the inner forearm where it takes all day to diffuse. I found myself layering it with Aqua Amara and JHAG Not-a-Perfume (Cetalox - synthetic ambergris). Id give it a 8 overall. If you want something different than the billion rose oud combos, this is one of them. I just wish it had a bit something to offset a little more of the bitterness of the oud to me. I dont really care if a blindly miss on a couple like this, it was an enjoyable learning experience. These are the kind of scents that remind me of why I love Italian fragrances in general. I find them fearless, artful, and elegant in most of their fine crafts. Never afraid to express masculine and feminine sexuality.",04/08/20 18:15,BlindFuryFragFanatic
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parmas Colonia Intensa take on oud, and what a great, unique way to do so!

Opens up with a beautiful combination of oud, leather and citruses. You're hit with a fresh, warm and woody combination. The oud isn't skanky or barnyward oud, but very woody. The leather/wood/oud combination gives the same vibe you'll also find in Issay Miyake Noir Ambre. There is coriander as well that gives it a subtle, spicy touch and then musk rounds it off and also gives it a powdery and fresh touch.

I've seen people talk about this being a rose/oud combo, but I cannot detect any rose what so ever. This really isn't a rose/oud combo. Again you have the Colonia Intensa DNA with oud. This also means, that if you normally do not like oud fragrances, but want to get into ouds, this might be something worth trying.

Due to the fresh, musky feel to it, it can in theory be worn year round, but I wouldn't wear this on hot days.

This is also something to go easy on the trigger with. One or two sprays on the chest will last you all day and you will be able to smell it for 10-12 hours easily with few sprays. Silage is also very decent, so be mindful not to choke people out.

Age-range is probably a bit more mature, but again due to the freshness and powdery, I could see someone in their 20s wearing this.

I would advise against blind buying, but if you love ouds, do check this one out! 8/10 as oud fragrances go.",02/11/20 11:02,ScentDane
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Always thought of this as the perfect blend of rose and oud.

I imagine this would be the smell of the oud soap you would find in a six star hotel in Dubai. It feels luxurious, deep,elegant but surprisingly zesty and clean for an oud fragrance.

In fact, my experience is so different from most of the reviewers here that I am left to wonder if I have a bad bottle, though purchased from a reputable retailer. For me, the first 45 minutes or so are near torture, with a loud sour medicinal note and some quality that I can only describe as urinous.

I have eclectic fragrance tastes and experience, and I read tons of Fragrantica reviews. I have never, ever had such a radically different experience from all the other kids on the block. Will definitely seek an opportunity to try from another bottle.",02/12/19 05:13,OtherWise
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"A very refined and elegant take on oud, which stands out from the crowd due to the finesse and subtlety evident in the blending. The opening is a fresh spicy citrus affair characteristic of colognes, yet made more unusual by the inclusion of an especially light and warm oud. The oud note seems to deepen, leading smoothly into a musky, leathery heart. Excellent longevity. From start to very long finish, this fragrance oozes warmth and sophistication. Very seductive and bound to generate allure. Without doubt, a good contender for a signature fragrance.",12/28/18 09:25,My5Scents
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,Wanting to buy an Oud Fragrance I looked hard at others reviews. This is the one I got and have no regrets. A Citrus too note when applying that fades away into a really nice leather and mellow Oud. Love at first scent. When wanting the best out of a fragrance you wish for one like this. One of my personal favorites for any occasion all year round!,12/04/18 08:53,Daddy D
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,This is absolutely unique! An exquisite blend of rich essences that seduces me especially since there isn't anything sweet in it. Something old and something new... Citrus notes and spices in shades of dark green. A gentleman from the countryside wearing tweeds while roaming the woods. Casually elegant. Manly and bold! A beautiful Indian summer or a misty late autumn and early winter morning.,10/17/18 08:34,Victor Lahovary
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"A well-executed and sleek Italian twist on the Oud concept.

To preface this little review, I don't get any Oud from this fragrance at all. I find it more revolving around the concept of Oud rather than using any of the usual Oud notes. Having said that, it's an excellent fragrance.

The opening here is gorgeous; though very contrasting and odd. It smells like a dark wood, with incredibly citric nuances. Imagine splashing freshly cut bitter oranges over some old, antique dark wood. It's a very distinct and nostalgic smell. To my nose, there may be a hint of lime, both the juice and the rind. There is a definite dark undertone to it all, musky and leathery. The composition has a very dry opening.

Interestingly, I don't find the fragrances progresses much. Over time, the citruses don't smell as fresh anymore, and take more of a backseat. I believe the coriander may give the illusion of citruses being strongly present throughout the lifetime of the fragrance. Slowly, the fragrance gets muskier, and drier.

I find that this is an extremely wearable Oud. It is not at all as conceptual and experimental as it sounds; it simply smells like very clean, bitter woods. In small amounts, it could easily be worn to the office (it's very strong).

Performance is incredible with this one. Longevity is such that it stays even after having a shower, easily lasting a full 24 hours. Projection is very heavy for about 4-6 hours. I personally don't need more than 2 sprays with this, though 1 would definitely suffice too.

All in all, a very Italian take on the Oud concept. There is no animalic facet, no barnyard smell, no sweet warmth. It's a cold, sharp and clean take.

An excellent creation.",09/05/18 14:51,kelkyang

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,It's like a Creed Royal Oud with citrus and it is fantastic. Wearable even during the summer. Must try.,08/17/18 18:30,FCM415
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Perhaps my favorite Summertime oud fragrance that I have enjoyed wearing since purchasing a bottle in 2014. Oud, leather and coriander blended with citrus is what I get out of Intensa Oud, and I love it. For those expecting a deep, dank or medicinal oud...move-on because you're not not going to find it here. Instead, you're going to experience a lighter-oud- along the line of Creed Royal Oud--that shares top-billing with leather and coriander.

Moreover, if you don't like coriander than you may not like this one since it is certainly noticeable. Offhand, I cannot see why more people did not vote for coriander as a more prominent note since it is extremely noticeable (front and center from top to bottom), but it is what it is. Personally, I love how coriander and citrus are used in Intensa Oud as they are combined to make a terrific oud fragrance that can be worn year-round, day or night and is classy at the office and appropriate for an intimate evening event.

Longevity and projection are both excellent, but not beastly. One can wear this fragrance into the office during the day and it remains on your skin for a terrific evening cuddle scent. As much as I love this scent, it's a definite try because it's just a bit out of the mainstream.",07/17/18 15:54,GodKing
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"What a fantastic scent!

Finally an Acqua Di Parma I'll be happy to wear! Being Italian I've always wanted to have at least one in collection but so far nothing from the Colonia line had worked for me, although the scents are gorgeous they turn out too soapy, flowery and granmotherish.

This one is rather PERFECT. Elegant, fresh but deep, refined, unique, sexy (the first sexy scent I smell from ADP) and a KING OF VERSATILITY! The more I smell it and the more I can imagine me wearing it in EVERY... I repeat because it's quite rare... E-V-E-R-Y kind of weather, season, time of the day or night, context or occasion.

The only fragrance it reminds me of JUST A LITTLE BIT is Zoologist Rhinoceros, but without the booze and that Vicks Vaporub feel that I found really weird and hard to wear.

It can be a signature scent without any problem whatsoever.

10 out of 10 fragrance, one of the best ever smelled. And can I say something surely unpopular: it's an Aventus killer. I don't mean it smells similar, it doesn't, but can serve exactly the same purposes perfectly, it's niche quality too and way less expensive.",06/22/18 04:44,torom
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"It's an EdC indeed because after 2 hours all the initial complexity (which I love) is gone.
What remains - sticking out like a sore thumb - is a single aroma chemical. It reminds of isopropyl alcohol, maybe by some perceived as ""medicinal"". Unfortunately that one note lasts well beyond the 8 hour mark.
Only a fool would expect actual oud oil in this but some form of oud accord would have been nice. In conclusion AdP Oud is about as much about oud as is WD40.

This is the type of fragrance that you want to smell on a lover, it's so comforting. It smells a little bit dirty, but mostly comforting. Nothing like most oudh based fragrances you'll find out there, it's a bit like the car of a very classy man. Leather seat covers, a mixture of strong, rugged and soft, fresh scents permanently afixed to the interior of said car. It's both something I don't want to smell of and something I constantly want to smell like. Not highly unusual, but maybe a try before buy.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"First impression is that this is super juice but quite an odd concoction, as it's almost a clash of 2 completely opposing scent groups, but mixed perfectly to form a wonderful frag.
I've never really liked ADP as a house but this has definitely encouraged me to explore them properly.
From the get go this reminded me of original Kouros, not the reformulated stuff, but with an added massive citrus blast and arguably the bets woody notes I've ever smelt in a frag.
And i'm no oud or Kouros fan at all but this just blew me away.

ADPCO is an incredible scent, it has room filling projection and lasts easily 24 hours on my skin.

I'm not usually a 'Buy it on first test' kind of guy but this and Black Afgano, which I think is arguably the greatest frag ever created, are two that I just fell in love with instantly.

EDIT: 29 Aug, The idea of mixing citrus with oud seems bonkers, we all know the myriad of floral/Ouds and spicey/Oud combos but citrus? Who'd a thunk it.....I think this is just keeps getting better and better and I can't think of another scent that even comes close to resembling this.",08/19/17 11:22,JamiesonB

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"This juice right here is the one. One of my current top 3. The top notes go on a little harsh with the strong oud and leather notes. But hold on, after 20 minutes of the dry down, it is phenomenal. I get leather, coriander and course oud without the oud being real strong. The oud sits there in the background letting you know its there without being the maim attraction. The citrus note really comes out without being to citrusy. Lasts and projects all day and I mean all day, with just two sprays. Great for summer and in dry and arid climates. Be careful not to overspray especially if you wear this during summer days in humid and tropical climates. Worth the $200 price tag.",05/24/17 15:42,kdubu
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"So normally I don't care for ADP and I find the line generic and underperforming mostly.

This. How the @&€# did I miss this!? It is no beast, but it does have acceptable performance. Better then sauvage and edition blanche and most of the other ""basic bastard"" ubiquitous scents out there.

Sweet oud, not animalic, very approachable, very rounded and polished. For most people, unless you knew it was oud, you may have a hard time distinguishing it. I feel like this was what Creed was trying to achieve with Royal oud and just failed miserably. This does it right.

I bought the big 6+oz bottle after one day of wearing a decanted sample. Worth it.

Scent: 7.5/10 it isn't an art piece but it is definitely signature scent worthy.
Projection 6/10 for 2-3 hours and a rapid decline to near-skin/skin only afterwards.
Sillage: 6/10 for an hour or so then a very slight train.
Longevity: 7/10 even on my skin, I get 7 hours of use which is amazing for an ADP.

Would I buy another bottle? Absolutely.",04/25/17 00:43,dmetzger
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"I am a fan of the Acqua di Parma line and I think they do very classy interpretations of notes. Colonia Intensa Oud is another good one in their line up and as long as you are not expecting a heavy, middle eastern type Oud Frag, chances are you will like this. I feel this is also a great starter frag for someone just beginning to get into Oud as you get all the good parts of Oud here, albeit synthetic, without any of the off putting barnyard stuff.

Top notes are a weird, slightly pungent combo of bitter citrus and Oud. The citrus notes fade and the Oud is joined by the leather and amyris or elemi notes and hints of mild, slightly sour spice from the coriander. This frag really starts to shine around the two hour mark when it turns into a beautiful, calm, slightly dry combo of leather and Oud and it stays this way all the way through the dry down, lasting a good 8 hours plus on me. Projects a lot in the first hour or so before settling down,but will give you a good 6 inch projection around you for most of it's scent life. Colonia Oud will work for most of the year except for hot summer months.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"After trying out AdP Colonia Oud in department stores for months and asking for samples ( managed to get 3 so far ) i finally got a bought a bottle while in France over the weekend.

Seriously, I think this is the most amazing perfume I ever tried. Hyper fresh and realistic citrus with a deep and warm oud and hints of leather. Its mysterious, sensual, classy and still very fresh. It scents high quality. There is no rose here like in most ouds. I have been trying out many of the ouds on the market, even bought a bottle of Versace Oud Noir but nothing is close to AdP Colonia Oud. It is simply magnificent. Other ouds are imo eighter to smoky, to sweet or to heavy. Most of them smell of roses and I do not like it. But this one is just something else.
I see that many reviews compare this one to TF Oud Wood. But I think they don't even come close. Yes, oud is the main player in both but TF is heavy and warm while AdP is warm and fresh.

Longevity is hreat, lasts all day. Be careful when applying, very little goes a long way.

Great in summer for a white shirt with rolled up sleeves as well as a thin wool sweater during winter.

Regardless to the rather high pricetag this masterpiece is worth every cent.
But do not blind buy, must be tested out first.
Chris says here below that he finds rose to be very dominant. Interesting how our senses work. No matter how much i sniff i get no rose here.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Cologne Intense Oud, is not a conventional and classic Middle Eastern Oud wood, dirty, floral and balsamic aspects but rather a leather-oud soap which also can be seen that sense of many Italian fragrances to give that feeling to go clean and neat.

Do not get that effect must have a good fragrance Oud, since for it is worth very synthetic chords and somewhat artificial soap attached to this aspect to Essenza as not paste on a Oud, losing much and failing to find within the specific aspects of this essence and that sense of naturalness that has this wood seems to me a search of the most fascinating by the rich nuances offered, and even a synthetic way you can offer better fragrances this even at a much lower price.

Out of this aspect, the fragrance is not bad, the balance is there and it is good also the projection is also very good, but those chords as soap in such synthetic oud not really know what it is, do not offer a good Odour end result and that is vital to qualify well to a good fragrance.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"This manly scent is an acquired taste, but one that is worth acquiring.

There are only a handful of scents whose openings I enjoy. Whether it's my body chemistry or taste or combination of the two, I don't know? So, I take it as par for the course that I will dislike the opening.

Colonia Intensa Oud is no exception: the opening is foul. The combination of ingredients produce a pungent flowery, rose, shampoo smell that is reminiscent of the oldest of old women. Not that I dislike old women, I don't, it's just not my vibe, is all. I can't abide rose in a perfume and although it's never listed as an ingredient for Colonia Intensa Oud, that's all I get for the start.

After half an hour has passed a new aromatic presence starts to overwhelm. It smells as though it's the 80s and I have mixed Denim and Aramis together and added them to the rose to create one of the nastiest concoctions known to man!

An hour, or so, after initial application and the good times begin. The flowery rose becomes a distant memory and the Denim/Aramis battle resolves itself into something quite exquisite. The aromatics settle down and I get a sweet earthy musk with hints of coffee, sandalwood and burnt tyres.

I find it quite hard to pinpoint specific individual notes as the blend is quite masterful, it's very much an olfactory chord. And this harmonious union just keeps getting better and better for the length of its life.

Fragrances tend to last long and project strongly on me. This one goes against the grain; I get about 5-6 hours of moderate projection. I also have to factor in applying it an hour before going out to avoid the unpleasant start.

In its pomp, Colonia Intensa Oud is highly masculine, it's a heavy hitting businessman wearing a tailored brown suit and a thick, heavy, gold wrist chain. It took me a while, but I've got to say: I dig.",01/08/16 11:08,Englishman

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma's Colonia Oud does for Oud what Colonia Leather does for leather--softens the main ingredient by adding some citrus, making it more year-round-appropriate. Whereas the opening was a bit harsh, this dried down into something very similar to Colonia Leather. I don't get much of a sense of the other notes--it comes off as mainly a blend of citrus, a little neroli perhaps, and the main oud aspect.

Projection and longevity are slightly weaker for the ""cologne concentree""--performance was somewhat better on Colonia Leather---so the value is lost somewhat.

This rounds out the concentree trio for me, and it's a very strong group overall. It might be worth trying Colonia Oud on one arm and Colonia Leather on the other, since they end up drying down similarly. Definitely a good exploration by Acqua di Parma---Oud, Leather, and Ambra are each worth trying.

این عطر رو با دوستان عزیزم که با هم یک تیم خرید اشتراکی تشکیل دادیم خریدکردیم

و باید عرض کنم که بسیار هم موفقیت آمیز بود

زمانی که رو مچ دستتون عطر رو اسپری کنید با یه رایحه ی فلفلی ، کمی شیرینی مشک و بوی چوبی خشک مانندی روبرو خواهید شد

رایحه مشک و فلفل تا یه چشم به زدن از بین میره

عود جزو ترکیبات اصلی این عطر هست ولی من رایحه عودی که میشناختم با این رایحه ای که در عطر حس میشه متفاوت بوده

کین عزیز هم اشاره ای به این قضیه کردند
این عود زیاد به ترشی نمیزنه ، زیاد تاریک نیست ، زیاد دودی نیست بوی تقریبا نرمی داره و اصلا شامه رو اذیت نمیکنه
انگار همین عود در حال سوختن هستش و گرمای سوزاننده ی اون رو میتونید حس کنید با این حال اذیت کننده نیست به هیچ وجه

بعد از فاز اول ، نوبت به نت پایه عطر میرسه که دیگه بعد از این تغییری نخواهد کرد
بوی چرم و عود و یه نت چوبی دیگه تا اخر شما رو همراهی خواهند کرد
این حالت یک رایحه
تلخ ، کمی دودی ، چوبی و چرمی داره

با این که بوی بسیار ساده ای داره ولی خاص محسوب میشه
و مثل سایر عطرای فقط تلخ نیستش که هیچ کاراکتر و روحی ندارند

فقط زود در موردش تصیم گیری نکنید بزارید حداقل 15 دقیقه با پوستتون عجین بشه و بعد تصمیم گیری کنید

و یه پیشنهادم دارم براتون

عطرای تند و چوبی و دودی رو در کاغذ تست نکنید
اینا رو روی مچ دستتون تست کنید

پخش و مانگاری بسیار خوب یهم داره
مناسب تیپ رسمی
برای فصل زمستان مناسبه
سعی شود در محیط های بسته مقدار کمتری اسپری بشه
برای بالای 25 ساله ها مناسب تره

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Smells pure quality! It is very unique and sharp I would say since I haven't smelled anything similar to this. The oud is definitely there but it is rather very soft. The leather is really heavy and I also notice a kind of soapy/minty note in this. Try it before you pay 200 dollars for a bottle!!

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"I generously spayed this on myself approx. 5 hours ago while in a department store... woah! As already mentioned it's a heavy-hitter in terms of sillage. You don't need more than two sprays.

Not sure what to think tbh. It's got a new leather shoe smell, but it's much much sweeter than AdP Colonia Leather (which is a very odd scent). So sweet in fact that, combined with its powerful sillage, it's often sickly and nauseating. I'd suggest not getting blind drunk with this on as you will be put off it forever with a hangover. Somebody mentioned YSL Les Nuit D'Homme which I personally despise due to its sweetness, but I can definitely see the comparison. However it's much more complex than that and doesn't have an astronomically high dominant note, instead, like a creme brûlée, if you crack through the nostril-burning intensity, you're rewarded with a deep, creamy, wood/leather scent that projects a modern gentlemanly class.

I'm not so sure whether this 'suits' me personally, and I may need to test it again with less on me. However I may go on to buy the 50ml bottle as it's definitely quality.",10/20/15 14:48,axlebart

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"I Have Waited A Long Time To Review This One!

This is a well balanced Oud. By that I mean that it doesn't lean to heavily on the Oud to define itself as a fragrance. I could honestly enjoy this as a room spray or a cologne it lingers in a very stately yet subtle way. The top notes of Citrus and Coriander rest atop the shoulders of Oud and Leather in such a way that it says ""Hey, I'm here. You know I'm here, but I'm not here to bother anybody"". Its friendly but not oppressive. A good starter for those that would like to get into the Oud's but are unsure.

I'm not sure if I can agree with those that have compared this to Tom Fords ""Oud Wood"" these two scents are too different despite the name and primary ingredient. Some have told me that the musk note is too much for their liking and I can understand that. Certain notes don't register the same with everybody.
What I will say is that these two fragrances differ greatly, though I am a greater fan of Acqua Di Parma. The scent resonates with me, its like one of those fragrances that I searched my whole life for. At the same time the Silage ""Projection"" of Oud Wood is higher. I guess you can just say that's because one is an EDP and the other is not. Yet I still love what it love. Acqua Di Parma, Colonia Intensa Oud.

UPDATE: THE MORE I WEAR IT THE MORE I LOVE IT!!! (09/17/15)

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"An interesting oud rendition. Very leathery, oily and quite sour at its heart. Starts with the usual blast of mellow rosy sweet oud note bordering on feminine which quickly gives way to almost Fahrenheitishly fierce leather, but never surrenders completely. Unfortunately I'm not sure they ultimately blend well together (even with the help of coriander as the obvious mediator). This frag definitely has got some character, but it's a split personality and while it's quite likeable on many levels, it just feels rather incoherent. Besides, I believe I get a bit of headache from it and I don't even know whether I should blame the rose (amyris) or leather for it, as both are the usual suspects.",09/05/15 07:40,dimsal

Its oud leather citrus very fresh and very masculine but has that bold oud smell i looked at this because its said to be better than TF OUD WOOD but i tend to disagree TF just does it for me its my favorite oud ive tried but this overall is a great must try, see perfume court and get a 1ml sample its worth a look but any men under 30 should probably think twice because this is very masculine/mature not a high school college scent.",08/28/15 08:28,jaretz
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Ok, time to review. This is the first Oud based Cologne that I own and have been using it got close to 9 months now. Verdict. Awesome. It wears nicely through the seasons. On its own, the scent is just captivating. Many women (from young to old) cannot but get caught in its note. I do not personally find it overpowering compared to Oud oil which I occasionally layer over. It works well with several of the By Killian perfumes which I have been experimenting with over the last month.

Verdict: Get yourself a bottle.",08/23/15 13:39,dr_unik

For me this is overpowering to the point of nausea. I like some oud scents, especially the Tom Ford series and M7, but this made me feel sick. It does last a hell of a long time though!

The flat texture ruins what could otherwise be a really nice scent. I've found that 777 2022 Homme has a similar odor profile but the sparkle and effervescence that is missing here. 2022 Homme is the much better juice imo, although much pricier per mL.",07/09/15 11:04,SculptureOfSoul
Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Three levels to this: citrus top(mainly fresh bergamot), resinous dark oud, and a hint of leather(like Tuscan leather). This is some pretty awesome juice. The oud is so intense that if you take a really deep sniff, it will burn the nostrils. It's definetely full bottle worthy and on my list for future purchase.

Edit: once the oud and leather wear off, it smells a bit like YSL l'homme with the citrus.

This is some magical juice.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,A fresh take on oud. Sampled this in-store last weekend in Chicago with very positive first impressions and now can't wait to get a bottle. Kept my test strip and have been coming back for whiffs multiple times a day. Seriously impressive performance for a cologne concentree and it's agreeable this could be used as a year round oud.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Italian view to Oud.

There are so many oud based fragrances are being lunched in 2014 and 2015. Acqua di Parma also followed the trend.

First of all, fragrance is Eau de Cologne but when you spray it on your skin, it is very oily. My opinion for this weird situation is, some of the raw ingredients oils they use in fragrances are more concentrated than other ingredients. Thickness of the ingredients make the oiliness of the fragrance higher.

Oud Intensa opens up with sharp citrus. There is also OUD. Big oud note is here for life time of the fragrance. Citrus stays with oud for 2-3 hours. When the citrus dies down, oud also gets close to skin and settles down. Very dry and quite.

I really didn't like the scent. Way they use the oud with citrus didn't do well together for my nose. Citrus is done wrong in my opinion. They shouldn't use citrus with oud as they didn't use citrus with their leather scent.

Performance is good. Lasted around 10 hours. But it didn't project very well. You can feel the scent but people won't. Projects well for 2 hours and projects close to body for another 2 hours. Later on, it is a skin scent.",04/16/15 05:40,buraktemiz93

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"I'm not an oud connoisseur -- far from it. The one time I smelled a ""true"" oud at Jamal Kazura in Singapore's Arab Street I found it offputting; maybe it wasn't a ""good"" oud, though I doubt the shopkeeper would put his stellar reputation at risk by stocking a substandard oil. I like Creed's Royal-Oud, though I've heard that it's a synthetic oud note and that it isn't comparable to a true oud perfume anyhow; I hate Bond's New York Oud (to me it somehow manages to smell like rotting daisies). But I love this AdP Colonia Oud. It's rich, sweet and woody, and lasts forever. I find myself smelling it JUST BECAUSE... and when I'm wearing another scent, I crave this one. Maybe that's a little crazy, but that's just how alluring this cologne is to me.

I tend to find oud rather unexciting when it's the dominating note (think Oud Wood). That's purely personal. But in this frag the citrus combined with the oud is what brings oomph to the composition. It's very unexpected.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Changing your usual rose/oud combo to citrus/oud in Acqua di Parma way and doing it very well. This is a fresh aromatic oud of high quality blend.

The oud is dry and clean, not the stinky kind. In the opening, the citrus accord pops and, while losing it's power gradually, still lingers in the background for hours. There is something aromatic in there which elevates the scent and makes it unique. A few hours in and I get the clean musky base that adds some sweetness. AdP has made a strong scent that works in every season (regarding how many sprays you use) and goes to the more wearable side of the ouds.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"ADP Colonia Intensa Oud - A different take on oud.

Colonia Intensa Oud is a very different rendition of oud, with a fresh yet heavy aspect to it. And by that, I mean more of a cool balmy scent.
Before trying this one out, I had a lot of curiosity about it as I knew it was an ADP release.
ADP as a house, is known for its fresh sparkly colognes and its variations on that theme;So, throwing an oud based scent into the mix made it a pandora's box for me.

Light, airy oud mixed with coriander, both sprinkled with some freshness, is what I get on my skin. The combination is pretty unique and well constructed and goes well on me.
In terms of performance, this one is beast mode. Lasts for ages, and literally refuses to die. Projection is also quite heavy and stays around for a good while.

However, I do not recommend a blind buy in this case, rather, it is a try before you buy kind of scent.

Respect for ADP, for stepping out of its comfort zone and trying something new, but at the same time maintaining its signature.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"According to Acqua di Parma's website, besides Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree, there is also a Colonia Oud version and it was awarded first place in the “Best Men’s Niche Fragrance” category at the 25th International Award of Accademia Del Profumo in May 2014.

Direct quote from their site, ""the fragrance opens with the purest essences of bergamot of Calabria and orange, a unique reference to the long-standing tradition of Colonia. This luminous start heralds a strongly assertive heart, where aromatic coriander blends with warm Amyris wood accents, developing through the magnetic notes of essential Agarwood oil. The fragrance continues with a surprising base, where the full and persistent character of sandal wood, the scent of leather and cedar wood, and patchouli meet clear and seducing musk notes, further valorizing the intense preciousness of Agarwood.""

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Artık hemen hemen tüm parfün markalarının Ud ürünleri var. Son dönemde giderek popüler hale geldiğini görüyoruz. Aslında Ud kokusuna biz Türkler yabancı değiliz ve bize yeni değil. Ancak popüler markalar el atmadığı için, ağır yağ yada salt Ud olarak kullanıldığı için genellikle ""hacı yağı"" sınıfında kalmaya mahkum olmuştu. Aslında oldukça karakterli ve güzel bir koku.
Son 1 yıldır bulabildiğim tüm Ud temelli parfümleri denedim. Batılı parfüm evleri de Ud'un sert ve ağır yapısını sevmiş olacak ki üretilen parfümlerin en az 2/3 ü yine ağır olarak karşımıza çıkıyor. Özellikle sıcak ve nemli ortamlarda taşıması oldukça zor olan bu kokuyu makul formda ilk olarak Acqua di Parma!da bulabildim.
Yumuşaklığı ise gül veriyor. Yani koku biraz yumuşasa da ""arap"" havasından tamamen kurtulamıyor. Bunu negatif anlamda söylemiyorum. Benim için şu ana kadar kullandığım en iyi Ud parfümü bu. Ancak yukarda da söylediğim gibi kültürel alışkanlıklar ve kokuların çağrışımını yaptığı ideolojik ve sosyal yapılar kişiden kişiye değiştiği için Ud'un bu hali bile birçok kişiye ağır gelebilir.
35 yaş üstü erkeklere kış aylarında yakışacak bir parfüm. Çok yoğun kullanmamak gerekiyor. Kalıcılığı çok kuvvetli ve her ortamda baskın olabiliyor. Bu nedenle fazla sıkmak (kullanmak) riskli olabilir. Eğer parfümlerim arasında Ud olsun diyorsanız bu doğru seçim olacaktır. Yukarda sözünü ettiğim kültürel yapının beğeni konusunu nasıl etkilediğini anlamanız için bu parfümü bir de Avrupalıların olduğu ortamda kullanın. Neredeyse tüm Avrupalılar bu kokuyu beğeniyor.

It is original and sophisticated

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"I'm really surprised to see the Coriander all the way at the bottom of the vote pyramid. It is so strong to me, I see it as the dominant note along with Oud and Leather. Because I despise Cilantro/coriander I have very mixed feelings about this frag. Sophisticated yes, but not what I was expecting. I have a 10 ml decant so I'll continue testing but After 2 full wearings I'm still a bit ambivalent.
Update: Slowly but surely falling in love. I'm going to have to seriously consider buying a bottle. Really is one of a kind.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"A great oud/citrus combo, quite unique and versatile for an oud based scent. I think the amyris note is a nice touch as well. Everything is well orchestrated from the freshness in the initial act leading up to a certain warmth and gentlemanly demeanour that begins to display midway through. The result is a classy and captivating fragrance appropriate for any occassion, any time of the year, day or night. I daresay it gives even the oft-cited versatility benchmark, Aventus, a run for its money in this category.

This was a blind buy online based on the reviews here and I don't regret it. I thank my fellow fragrantica members for once again being a wonderful source of feedback on scents that I don't have the pleasure of trying firsthand. That said, I do get a bit of the 'new shoes' vibe that some have detected as the fragrance develops. I don't mind it, but perhaps it'd be best to try this one out for yourself if you have the option before making the purchase. Some people seem not too keen on this fragrance on the whole, while others love it right out of the (shoe) box. I'm of the latter camp. The oud is handled very nicely here and blends well with the citrus notes in the opening, which according to the AdP site are orange and bergamot, revealing a smooth transition into the leather and musk in the drydown phase.

Now this may be a grower for some, as I found myself appreciating it more the longer I wore it. First wear was highly intriguing. I was teetering on the fence between love and a big question mark... but once I got accustomed to the slightly dry oud/amyris/coriander interplay it was a definite satisfaction. The second occassion was during a dinner at an upscale restaurant with a large group of friends and family, and not an hour into the meal I was already getting approval from the other diners.

It's classified as an Eau de Cologne concentree, but it outperforms some Eau de Parfums I have. The price tag may be steep, but based on the quality and versatility of this fragrance, coupled with fantastic longevity (12+ hours) and projection (2 sprays were enough to get people noticing), I believe it's well worth the price of admission.

I don't mean to make an already long review even longer, but I have to update my assessment. I'm loving this fragrance more and more with each wear. I'm also getting the ""rose-y"" note that others have mentioned, but I reckon this is a result of the oud combining with one or two of the other notes rather than an unlisted true rose note. In any case, it's masculine in its overall effect due to the woodsier undertones mingling with the citruses. It's truly a damn fine scent, and one of my new favourites. Mesmerizing and exhilarating.

Longevity: 9.5/10

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"One thing I can say about this fragrance is that isn't doesn't resemble anything I've smelled at least recently. The opening I don't care for bc it smells like those old skool number 2 pencils or the pencil shavings from a pencil when I was in jr high. The dry down is much more tolerable and pleasant to wear all year round at least for me its very versatile. Not a big oud fan although this is an oud you can definitely wear in warmer months.

My initial review below is fairly accurate as to how I feel about this fragrance...in a nutshell it's great smelling. I was convinced to fork out on it by my girlfriend, she absolutely adored it and as such was very persuasive.
I will have to correct my playing down of the Oud element in my first review, this scent has Oud in abundance but it's not at all rough or full on it's soft and very long lasting. The mixture of amyris & coriander with oud is quite a dizzying, sickly combo which takes a bit of getting used to but when you do it's great.",03/04/14 06:44,Houdini4

But I have also some powerhouses that can knock somebody down in the first few hours...Colonia Intensa Oud is great because I can still smel it six hours after I sprayed it. And it is still as elegant and beautifull as in the first minutes that I started wearing it. Great longevity with the perfect sillage. And most important: a great and very versatile smell.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"For those who say, no longevity...you must have a medical issue, or octopus skin. I couldn't get this off me while Im laying in a hospital bed getting IV'ed after 3 hours. Like it was getting stronger and stronger. This was the FIRST OUD experience I had at Neimanns and waited til this week to pull the trigga. My problem is...it's too strong, even after a baby spray, so I'm trying to find a frag to calm it down!!!

So far candidates on my arms and knees are: Mandorlo di Sicilia, Black Orchid, Chanel AHEB, and Terre dHermes. My nose can't take the initial blast. I'm a nooby but KNEW I needed something different...OUD was my choice over Amber or Vetiver right now. I OWN M7 Oud Absolute, samples and decants of MFK Oud, Velvet, Cashmere, Silk Moods, TF Oud Wood and coming from Kuwait..Ameer Al Oudh.

OUD is pushing me to Ambers all of a sudden. I can't take Tuscan Leather (DIRT) smell, Someone came into NMarcus and said it smelled like Cocaine. I don't get the Citrus, thats why I'm layering.

I like the smell of Oud and it is strangely intoxicating but I don't know what all the fuss is about really?
It's down to taste and what you look for.
Is it the notes that surround Oud that give a fragrance it's character or is it vice versa?
Well it depends...
This is typical of an ADP Cologne, stylish, classic citrus in the top and wonderfully fresh feel with nice, gentle Oud in the base.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"A very unique and interesting mix of citrus and oud. It opens as many Acqua di Parma fragrances do with a burst of citrus (I detect bergamot and orange). Things evolve and you begin to notice the medicinal oud from the heart mixed with spicy Russian coriander and warm amyris wood (I'm beginning to become a huge fan of amyris notes). I believe it is here in the heart that this fragrance truly shines. The inclusion of leather notes, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood and musk in the base is rather subtle to my nose, but all add more complexity to the scent.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"Today I put Tom Ford Tuscan Leather on one arm and ADP Oud on the other.

The ADP Oud is slightly more noticeable but IMO is a really lightweight oud. I guess it goes with the ""fresh"" image that the ADP line is known for. I do think it is a pleasant scent although quite tame. If someone new to oud fell in love with this they would have a HUGE wake up call when smelling other oud fragrances.

Unlike most of the ADP line this seems to be more durable. It is labeled INTENSA which means to me a decent EDT strength and that's just what I am getting from it.

Colonia Intensa Oud Eau de Cologne Concentree Acqua di Parma,"I don't usually do reviews but for this one, I have to comment that it's one of the longest lasting fragrances that I have ever tried. I have to wonder if people become anosmic to part of it after a while if they claim that it does not last.

Otherwise, it starts with AdP citric DNA and then the synthetic oud rears it's head. The rose from the AdP DNA combines for a short while to give a familiar rose/oud accord but that disappears all too soon. Soon after comes a woody, leather like ambience that ultimately adds some musk. Interestingly, the AdP citrus, rose freshness seems to come back and rest on top of the woody musk and it stays that way for a very long while. Ultimately, it becomes quite woody with leathery goodness remaining and if I strain, I can detect some more musk. Two showers and multiple scrubbings later, I still have to go without fragrance for a day because remnants of this remain on my skin. Two thumbs up for tenacity. I feel that I got value for my money.

Lily of the Valley Acqua di Parma,"Lily of the Valley is a run-of-the-mill citrus-led white floral scent. Nice quality, but utterly generic, it doesn't even feature a particularly prominent lily-of-the-valley note to my nose - it is a jasmine-led generic white floral.

LotV opens with fresh citrus notes, followed by clean but heady jasmine. Sweet and strong, it is lifted nicely by the citrus. As it develops, some green lily-of-the-valley emerges, alongside sweet magnolia. The lily-of-the-valley is just part of the white floral accord, not a focal point, and doesn't get a chance to shine as a result.

The base notes are really strong - it becomes very musky and woody as it progresses. It is a predictable progression of the white florals, but it goes a bit sour on my skin. It fades to a musky skin scent. Sillage and longevity are moderate, and it is a feminine-leaning springtime scent.

Aside from the sour drydown, LotV leaves a lot to be desired, and is nothing special or original. Given its price point, I expected more. Diorissimo it ain't. 2/5.",10/21/22 11:34,Enrium

Lily of the Valley Acqua di Parma,I used to love ADP but haven't been liking many of their new releases. I hoped this would be somewhat unisex but it's extremely feminine. I can't see any guy wearing this. The cedar and musk in the base reduce the sharpness of the citrus and floral somewhat but I was hoping they would work harder to mellow it out more like Bergamotto di Calabria which I love. But if you're a woman who likes florals by all means give it a go but I find it quite headache inducing.,05/03/22 14:05,PapaTLooch

Lily of the Valley Acqua di Parma,"Finally bought a full bottle. AdP is my favorite house but I'm not a huge fan of most of their recent signature collection (e.g. yuzu, osmanthus, Sakura), however, LotV is one of my favorites from the entire house. Feminine but I love wearing it and it lasts a long time.

EDIT: Realized I don't love this as much as previously thought. Adding this to the list of recent releases I'm not very impressed with. Still smells pleasant but the more I wore it, the more feminine and one dimensional it became. Wish it implemented more of the classic ADP bergamot we all love.",03/06/22 11:09,agonzony
Lily of the Valley Acqua di Parma,Gorgeous scent. I love it. It’s such a sophisticated cool and sensual take of different florals.

Very spring. 9/10.,12/03/21 15:46,Omniflowah999
Lily of the Valley Acqua di Parma,"Maybe I didn't try this in the proper weather, but it smelled very strange to me. Like half of the scent was missing. It was very light and airy smelling, but it still smelled like half of a perfume. I remember sensing something watery and aquatic about it too. I enjoyed testing it out, but my mind couldn't grasp the fact that it smelled like a gust of wind and not much else. Definitely unisex, though. Anyone could wear this. I really don't know why it was so weird. I would try it again in scorching hot weather, maybe that could help the top notes really sing.",11/11/21 05:52,sybilline
Lily of the Valley Acqua di Parma,"I grew up with the tradition of gifting Lily-of-the-Valley on May 1st, as it is a tradition in Belgium (and France). When I tested this fragrance, I was instantly brought back to those days. It smells exactly like a LotV, with notes of other flowers (jasmine, magnolia, and geranium). It is a fresh, green, and (white) floral fragrance, and although I think it can be worn at any point (except on cold days), I think it is the perfect spring fragrance for those who like floral scents. It is a slightly more feminine fragrance.

The performance is alright. It lasted on my skin for about 4 hours or so, and the sillage was a bit intimate. It is quite a bit pricey imo.

7/10. The scent is quite pretty (8/10), but the performance is left to desire (6/10).",11/01/21 14:23,JessVanEgg

Lily of the Valley Acqua di Parma,"I like this! But not on myself, to me this definitely leans feminine because of the sweetness combined with the white flowers. It's not overly sweet, not at all, it seems very well blended. It's a classy sweetness, combined with that typical white flower smell (my nose can't specifically tell apart the lily-of-the-valley/jasmine/magnolia yet). I think some guys could pull this off, it's just too sweet for my own liking.

Would love to smell this on a flowery lady with a dress waving around her on a spring afternoon in a beautiful city park.

Crystal Incense Acqua di Parma,"Well - seems like there are different interpretations of this one - so I’ll throw mine out there.

The opening kind of falls in line with what you’d expect from an acqua di Parma. Woody, spicy, citric. Even to the point where you’d think “oh, this is more barbershop”

However - once that opening wears off (and it does so pretty quickly) - you are left with straight incense and ginger. Think of a “spiced incense”

It’s definitely a nice fragrance - definitely on the mature side. No sweetness at all.

A really nice buttoned up take on incense and citrus.

EDIT
You know, after spending more time with this, I think the fella below has a good point comparing it to Creed Royal Oud. It’s been a while since I smelled it, but I’m thinking he’s right. Although I am certainly getting incense on my end.",06/13/25 16:32,picknenders
Crystal Incense Acqua di Parma,"TLDR This is primarily a cedar bomb, woody, slight spiced, very dry, dirty musk fragrance. This is not sweet at all. 100% masculine. IMO from the things I like, this is a 5/10, generally a dislike, but that could change in time. It is niche level. BUYER BEWARE, This is not an incense fragrance like the name would lead you to believe. No Interlude Man here.. Most incense fragrances have a sweet element, which is absent here. (An update changed my opinion to a 7.8/10 and a like)

Okay, so people out there super into the Royal Oud by Creed. I tried it at a boutique and thought it was slammed with the cedar scent - not really my thing. I bought this, blindly, because I thought it would be a slightly sweet, spicy, incense with some wood, but this is an absolute cedar bomb on the first spray with pepper and musk. It is a skanky musk, not of the clean, sweet variety. It smelled like a boy and I wasn't sure if I liked it or not.
After about 10 minutes, I'm definitely picking up more of the benzoin and olibanum, but I typically go to La Nuit De L'homme when referencing for cardamom, and I'm not getting much of that at all. The cedar is fleeting during the dry down, which I'm not complaining about. This strong cedar smell comes and goes, then comes back.
Okay, you know what this reminds me of? I was in japan and I went to Nara after another backpacker showed me a video of some people feeding deer, so I naturally wanted to go see for myself. I took a friend and spent about 13 hours walking around in the forested areas of Nara. At one point we stumbled on a huge wooden building and people were lined up to get in. It turned out to be the Todaiji Temple, the largest wooden structure in the world. This Acqua Di Parma Crystal Incense reminds me of being inside that building with all the people and the dirt and the smell of the wood and some light remanences of burning incense.
It is summertime and this was released last year, so I can't give a full judgement without wearing it in all seasons, but I would necessarily classify this as a primarily cedar, woody, slight spiced, very dry musky fragrance. IMO this is much better than the Creed Royal Oud which should be renamed to Royal Cedar.

Review based on a full presentation 100ml example.

Update... the more I wear this the more I like it. Its strange, because im not generally into wood chips smell, but there's something with way more depth at play here that is very pleasing for me. Upgrade to a 7.8/10.",06/10/25 12:35,timmybils
Crystal Incense Acqua di Parma,I love it! Has a certain lightness to it that I’ve come to expect from AdP. I love the choice of incense they used. Good solid male fragrance without the heavy used car salesman woody smell or too light lemon pledge smell with just enough oomph to make it interesting. Definitely office friendly. Possible year round but have to try it in winter first. If your body chemistry works with fragrances like Ganymede you will likely do well with this although it is not like Ganymede. In fact I can’t think of anything that is a good comparison.,04/18/25 17:20,Fragenthusiastic

Crystal Incense Acqua di Parma,"First review of someone who actually owns it!!......
I love what ADP do with the signature line. they take a specific 1 or 2 notes and just do them well.
Oud, Saffron, lime/oakmoss, vanilla etc.
They tend to be pretty unique scents in that they dont clone a popular designer fragrance or join a bandwagon (an ambroxan bomb/sauvage style/aventus style etc).
They arent usually overtly ""brave"""" but also have uniqueness that separates them from ""mass-appealing""
This is no different....
The citrus opening is quite fizzy & sparkling and could easily be mistaken for either orange, grapefruit or mandarin type citruses.
You can feel the ginger in there too.
The mid and dry down is an easy on the nose olibanum - not too smokey or astringent. Its softened by what I assume is the cedar and/or cardamom..


It's an excellent fragrance and performs well so far. dont let the olibanum or incense fool you into thinking this is a winter only fragrance - the citrus opening is bright and can be worn all year around.

What I find clever in this fragrance is the transition through the notes, the dry down has no resemblance to the top. If you only smelled the dry down on someone, you could never guess that there was a bright citrus opening - its evidently very well made.",04/19/24 07:36,Jonsalter

Iris Nobile Edizione Speziale Acqua di Parma,"At the first test it seemed to be a simple floral fragrance. Pleasant, but not ""AH""... but something prompted me to buy it. And I do not regret a bit!!! Very delicate and feminine fragrance. Iris is not particularly felt, in my opinion, more ylang-ylang manifests itself. It opens with a very warm and sweet flavor. I would say that this is a classic in its purest form. Nothing superfluous. The fragrance of a well-groomed lady with good taste. Men are crazy about it - tested on all my colleagues!!! In cool weather very beautiful trail, in the heat more sweetness and colors gives out.",09/02/11 10:06,AstaLaVista
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"When I first got it about four years ago, it was mostly just a dry, dusty myrhh with mediocre performance. Abandoned old wooden houses must have smelled like that, I thought.

It had a somewhat bright and promising resinous opening that quickly faded and turned dry and dusty within an hour; it stayed linear and soft, almost like a whisper that way throughout its remaining lifespan of about four hours.

It took a bit of imagination to perceive that lingering chalkiness as cocoa powder, but even that would be kind of a stretch.

Fast forward a few years to the present—it has likely undergone maceration and has become a rich, moderately sweet resinous amber fragrance with clear gourmet warm tones of vanilla and rich, dusty cocoa powder.

Its projection has improved to almost an arm length, while its longevity has stretched to about ten hours.

From a meh fragrance almost designated to becoming a layering fragrance for its base notes—evolved into nearly a powerhouse!

I guess I got lucky!",10/07/25 21:23,Digfigs
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Honestly love this stuff. ADParma very hit or miss for me. This, Essenza & Futura are great.

This is just smooth and a great cooler weather fragrance. I love Myrrh as a note and this is in my top 3 for sure, it's basic and a little linear but just right. For an ADC it lastly a decent while 4-7hrs, it's soft and has a nice bubble which I'd describe as fuzzy warm cookie dough(ish) ambery feel.
I'd imagine the sillage is very nice too.

I'm picking up another 180ml this week. I would love an EDP of this... a little deeper and bolder! Come on ADP!

Seriously on a cold morning few sprays behind the ears and BOOM! In my own Cosy bubble.

For me 10/10 for what it is. It's not an all rounder, somewhat versatile and nowhere near a beast. But! That's exactly why I love it. Simple, smooth, warm, gorgeous. Apparently discontinued, what a shame I will definitely get another bottle for a back up.",06/07/25 23:13,Crusader Smitty

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Mirra is a sophisticated and versatile fragrance from the Italian house’s Colonia line, blending the brand’s signature citrusy freshness with warm, resinous, and spicy notes. Launched as part of their Ingredient Collection, it centers around the rich, balsamic aroma of myrrh, elevated by complementary notes that create a smooth and calming experience.

Scent Profile:

Colonia Mirra opens with a subtle citrus burst, characteristic of Acqua di Parma’s Colonia DNA, likely featuring bergamot or orange blossom, which gives it a bright and approachable start. As it settles, the heart reveals a delicate spice accord with noticeable hints of nutmeg, adding a warm, slightly sweet, and earthy dimension. The star of the show, myrrh, anchors the base with its resinous, amber-like depth, creating a soothing and elegant finish. The fragrance strikes a balance between freshness and warmth, making it a refined take on an amber fragrance.

Performance:

Projection: Light to moderate. Colonia Mirra projects softly, creating an intimate scent bubble that feels personal rather than overpowering. It’s ideal for those who prefer understated elegance.

Longevity: Fairly good, lasting around 6-8 hours on the skin, which is impressive for an Acqua di Parma fragrance, given the brand’s lighter, eau de cologne-inspired roots. Reapplication may be needed for all-day wear in some cases.

Vibe and Versatility:

This fragrance exudes a calming, sophisticated aura, making it suitable for nearly any occasion—work, casual outings, or evening events. Its darker, resinous undertones, driven by myrrh, give it a slightly moody character that might feel heavy for hot summer days but shines in cooler seasons like spring, fall, or even mild winter days. It evokes a sense of timeless luxury, reminiscent of the discontinued Armani Privé Myrrhe Impériale, though Colonia Mirra leans lighter and fresher.

Comparison and Uniqueness:

Fans of amber-heavy fragrances will appreciate Colonia Mirra’s refined take on the genre. The nutmeg and citrus accents set it apart from denser amber scents, giving it a brighter, more wearable edge. Its similarity to Armani Privé Myrrhe Impériale suggests a luxurious, resinous warmth but with Acqua di Parma’s signature Italian finesse.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I wish they'd do an EDP for this one... ADP has been a hit or miss house for me. I appreciate there perfumes but some just ain't for me.

This, Essenza & Futura are my favorites...

Considering this is an EDC it lasts quite awhile... I would love a pumped up version of this. However, this is absolutely beautiful. When I first tried it i thought bleh, nothing special but it's not meant to be... this is just smooth warm cozy and that's exactly what it's made to be and it's excellent. This will not make your jaw drop but once you wear it a few times it becomes addictive.

Come on ADP do an EDP!!! Don't know if this is discontinued or what but I have a couple of back up bottles and it's available in New Zealand.

Anyway, this is a simple masterpiece for me.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Bought as sample 5 years ago. I wondered at the time, if my sample was stale. I didn't find citric top notes, or pachouli base note. It opened with a smell like stale iris and lavender, with a powdery quality that stayed the same all day.
I'm giving it another try today. It hasn't improved or worsened in 5 years. After a few hours, it's stinging my eyes a bit, with a cloying, spicy sweetness.
I found it 'meh' at first, and kind of boring. Hours later, annoying.
I'm obviously no expert. I don't know what myrrh is meant to even smell like. I don't know if my chemistry is incompatible with this fragrance or, like I suggested, it's stale.",02/01/25 08:27,Jim_Smith
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just got this, my initial thoughts.

Myrrh is one of my favorite notes, so I've wanted to get my hands on this. They don't smell completely alike, but as someone who loves Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense, this reminds me of a much less sexy, more casual, less soapy version of the Prada. If the Prada is for date nights in sleek, upscale bars and restaurants when you want to inflect a certain understated air of elevated but nonchalant ""cool"", then Colonia Mirra is for the following easygoing day, waking up, heading out to get a late breakfast and then a walk in the park. Overall, the blend here doesn't feel as ""special"" or ""interesting"" as the Prada. This is a lot more straightforward, but I wouldn't go as far as using the word ""linear."" This still has enough depth so that it doesn't get boring.

So far, this is a strong like for me, but again I'm a sucker for myrrh and oriental fragrances, so this fits right into my wheelhouse. I can actually see myself using this much more than my discontinued bottles of Amber Pour Homme Intense to conserve those. Will edit with a full review later.

Edit: The amber in this leans towards that synthetic kind of amber accord one often finds in modern day male perfumery (you know the aura I'm talking about, usually accompanied by ambroxan, though, thankfully, there's no ambroxan in this), and overall slightly ""cheapens"" the overall feel of this. It's surprising as my experience with other Acqua di Parma fragrances has been noting how natural they smell. I'm not saying Colonia Mirra smells ""cheap"", but it's just not as ""elevated"" as I initially thought off the first couple of wears. I do still like this though! Downgrading my rating from an 8 to a 7.5

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This is a real head-turner! Colonia Mirra is warm, spicy and definitely masculine. The initial citrus burst fades quickly into this rich amber and myrrh scent that lasts all day. It's sophisticated and perfect for evening events.",12/17/24 14:33,Steve198
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just a superb fragrance that many have overlooked but, this is a magnificent blending of citrus and smooth amber, myrhh goodness. A semi dark Oriental with an Italian twist that combines freshness up top with a spicy, semi-sweet near gourmand drydown and a near perfect mix of amber & Patchouli in the mid to end to give it a nice, well rounded light woods & earthy mix. Close to Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense but, none of the soapy like accord that Prada is known for nor a pronounced woods that Prada has with the Sandalwood & Vetiver. Just an Italian take on a spicy oriental that creates a magic from fall to early spring. This feels slightly more casual and laid back compared to Prada's version yet, can be worn just as easily as the latter in a work or professional setting. I just prefer Prada for that particular environment or scenario. But, for friends & family gatherings or that date night occasion in cooler to cold weather, this is simply stellar. Performance is quite good as well as I get 6-8 hours of duration with half a dozen sprays. For me I rank the brown bottled colonia line in this order; Colonia Oud Intensa, Colonia Sandalo Concentree and then this gem right here Mirra but, they are all super close for me. No losers in this bunch at all.

An underrated creation that exudes quality from the first spray and on. There are still some tester bottles and 180ml. bottles available for excellent prices. If spice & everything nice is your calling, this is your gateway to that occasion.",12/03/24 07:51,Apocalypse6vs8

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"A great day wearing Mirra. The trick is to apply with weight, confidence, and persistence. Then do it again.

Within 30 mins, the perfume has relaxed and settled into a lovely warm woody, resinous, soft patchouli fog that projects enough so that you can pick it up easily, wallow in it even. And yet it doesn’t overpower those around. Lasts all day and is enjoyable even after 12 hours. One of my favourite Aqua di Parma perfumes.",03/12/24 11:59,jwc001
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Lightly powdery and nutty amber dominant scent accented with fresh citrus. Very clean, but warm and cozy and perfect for the cold weather.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Top notes are a bit hard to decipher, but there is at least some floral and citric notes. They are very pleasant, but not very distinct and they evaporate in less than 30 minutes, transforming into saponin notes.
In the mid, nutmeg is prominent but the myrrh and other, warmer spices fills out the picture.
Base is solid, and nice with amber and discreet woodiness.

The AdP signature of citrus and soap is quite obvious although the profile has more to do with Eau Sauvage EDP – citric with a spicy and resinous base – than with the classic colonias. There is, however, not sufficient citrus notes to say that this is a ""hespéridé"" – leaning on citrus essential oils – and the top notes are not an important part of the overall experience in general. There is more spice and resinous notes and less soapiness compared to other colonia bottles from this house.

All in all I think that if this was a stronger concentration, I would consider replacing my Eau Sauvage EDP (2017) with Colonia Mirra. Autumn-winter-early spring office scent, but does not have sufficient performance to defend the price. Although I like discretion, even the skin scent phase is too weak after 3 hours on me.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,This is a wonderful fragrance. Lots of spice with very dark smoothness about it. It's not the run of the mill fragrance .,06/15/23 13:00,Tonymast1984
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"My first review on here, LONG time lurker..
Looking at some of the reviews below makes me question my own findings., but I found Mirra to be massively disappointing. It opens well, fresh whilst intoxicatingly reassuring and classic ADP, and the initial drydown is lovely. For the price I paid for it £65 - I thought I was on a complete win.
However - 20/30 minutes later and it's a skin scent on me. An hour or two and it's all but gone. So disappointing that I boxed it straight back up for a exchange, thinking that something had to be amiss. The second bottle was identical, so that went back too. Now I have ADP Oud, Leather and Ebano - all of which have good to great performance, so I'm not sure whether it is just my skin? The readily available, relative 'bargain bin' pricing does suggest that I may not be the only one being less than impressed though..",01/27/23 07:22,Vape
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Was lucky enough to get a 100ml for 65 bucks and damm this stuff is good… very warm and inviting, aslong as you go light with the sprays. a 10/10 from me. Brilliant stuff",01/16/23 07:50,isakasyv
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Just looked at my bottle and only have about 10ml left. This is a gem, definitely one of my favorite Myyrh fragrances.

I will be getting another bottle this year, possibly another for a back up.

9/10 loses a point because it's not a year round nor most versatile fragrance.

Love it!",01/08/23 04:43,Crusader Smitty
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Masculine, solid, linear (not a criticism - an observation of this range of single note emphasis colognes). Straightforward, brown/amber (if you find scents resemble colours, as I do). Easily wearable I can daytime/work situations, as evening ones. Safe for work, but definitely not a generic office designer scent.",01/03/23 06:39,Lwjm
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"On scent alone this is 10/10 just got it in today so will have to review performance but this is beautifully spicy warm and resoniius almost gourmand but not.The fragrance so far seems to be a moderate projector and gentlemanly in its silliage,one of the highest quality fragrance for the price point which is currently 55.60",10/18/22 05:23,Scentsibilities

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Since i made my first review I want to add one.
I love this one in the first place.
The more i use this fragrance I feel it is a one you can put into the realm of the ones who relate to the Arabian notes used in Oud and those very expensive ones you can find here.
The notes, as I said previous, are very distinct in their consistence and combination.

Wow this is so good and powerful and yet it is balanced and so sophisticated.
It does remind me indeed of the spice shop or market in India or the middle East but it has also that mystical smell typical for mire.
It has a long-lasting power for eau de cologne and makes you feel dressed-up for a nice diner or just for a good evening party on a sunny day outside.
What ever occasion, this is gorgeous and well balanced to wear.",08/21/22 01:17,osiris5
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Gorgeous fragrance from Acqua Di Parma!

I love this! Only just purchased a few days ago and it’s stunning! This seems to be a rather underrated not so well known fragrance from Acqua di Parma which surprises me!

Have seen several reviews of people describing this as a winter fragrance but I find it very very refreshing!

Like a walk through a pine forest on a sunny winters day!

True gem of a fragrance!

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Awesome and underrated smell. Professional and mysterious at the same time. A clean citrusy Myrrh that performs very well for an EdC. Smells much like Prada amber intense minus the soapiness. Also very similar to Eau Sauvage Parfum, and much cheaper if you go for the 6oz bottle. Versatile and office safe.",02/15/22 12:45,scottgiles86
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I learned to love Myrrh from Dior Eau Sauvage Parfum 2012 and Jo Malone Myrrh Tonka, but I'm just ok with this one. I'm not sure what to make of this one. Dark, warm, cozy, dry myrrh and other dark notes I can't pick out. It's nice enough but nothing pops out and grabs me.

Scent: 7 / Sillage: 8 / Longevity: 7.5

EDIT: My old notes at the beginning of my frag journey...
1st wear: Ok. Musky & sweet. Too sweet. 6-7/10
2nd wear: Too musky and sweet after 10 mins. 3 hrs later, def too musky. Pass. 5-6/10",02/15/22 09:05,chrisk252
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I'm a big fan of Acqua di Parma line up and Colonia Mirra is no exception to this. This Eau de Cologne Concentrée, despite lacking a bit in longevity, really pays off with a luscious, deep and layered olfactory experience. It echoes the seriousness of the original Acqua di Parma but with a completely different set of notes, though it plays in the same arena in terms of elegance.

The opening is quite dark, bittersweet (almost medicinal) and reminds me of dark cocoa powder; there are sweeter orange blossom nuances that bright it up enough to avoid it feeling stuffy and gothic. As the initial citrus sparkles fade, it becomes drier and almost powdery in a very pleasant way, like if you were smelling in a wooden cupboard where resins and nutmeg have been left for months. Myrrh provides the luscious bittersweet background that becomes more prominent 30 mins in, while nutmeg is more prominent at the beginning and adds a note of spiciness.

As soon as the base notes hit your nose, the warm ambery base makes the bittersweet smell of myrrh more akin to burnt brown sugar - this is no gourmand at all, but just really gives the idea of sugar taken off the stove right before it burns. At points it gives me the idea of being sucked into a black hole and, as much as it sounds like a negative comment, it is not in reality as it removes your focus from anything else surrounding it.

Colonia Mirra has such a dark, mysterious and alluring scent profile I can't stop smelling my wrist. This is a dressed up fragrance, good for your own enjoyment and amazing when you need to smell refined and opulent. Due to its low contration, longevity is not amazing - 3 to 4 hours, give it or take it, and that is expected; it effuses convincingly but not aggressively for the first hour before becoming a sking scent. Great for fall and winter, both day and night, rainy days and formal situation. Classic Acqua di Parma bottle (batch code 0260337), in dark brown glass similar to those of the discontinued Ingredients collection; a number of fragrances in the line have been moved under the Signatures of Sun line and became EdP concentration, but alas not Colonia Mirra although this one is still widely available at discounters.",12/08/21 12:56,skaccomatto
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I am a young woman, however I thoroughly enjoy wearing this fragrance all year and weather long. I see as a very complex, but easily wearable fragrance. For me it is a very cozy smell, therefore I tend to wear it on cooler days, however I see how it could be pulled of in a nice summery, flowy dress, sipping double espresso on ice.
The fragrance opens up to this strong medicinal smell, I get just a little bit citruses, more like sweeter orange peel/ blossom citruses (probably the orange blossom). However the myrhh, amber and patchouli is amazing. After 15 minutes on my skin, it starts to sweeten and then I get just a bit of that nutmeg. But it is not sweet as in candy sweet, it is a natural sweetness. It is somehow fresh, but warm and spicy at the same time. After a hour it becomes fresh for me. It is so mysterious, but familiar at the same time. I love it when my boyfriend wears it, I love it to wear it myself.
When it dries, it becomes quite sweet and aromatic, reminds me of dialed down Black Phantom By Kilian.
I got a 180ml bottle of this fragrance at TKMaxx for a fraction of the original price. I believe I paid 68 euros. I don't think I would pay the original price for this fragrance. It is not my favorite fragrance, but I appreciate it.",09/19/21 05:59,Todobien
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,This is my all time favourite scent. I don't know how to describe it apart from unconditional love. I just love this stuff,09/01/21 12:21,threedoubles
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Quite medicinal in the early spray. But changing to more pleasant after a while when it starts to polarize gradually. I think this is more masculine than unisex. Smells classy but performance is moderate. The myrrh is dominant here, and of the same nuance with JM Myrrh and Tonka. Expensive but worth the biggest size resides on my shelf.",07/24/21 07:01,klix27
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Wow. Just wow.... I'm in love with it, it's definitely got that brite, fresh citrus opening that after a half hour or longer absolutely settles down into this yummy, warm, creamy, delicious, nutmeg/myrrh/amber thing that gives it a sweet, brown sugary, gourmand vibe... of course the star is that creamy, smooth, warm, nutmeg/amber/myrrh combo. My god.. A woman with whom I had a romantic date with a few weekends ago was stuck to me like a magnet, afterwards later texting me about how delicious I smelled to her. I have Colonia Mirra to thank for such a nice compliment from her.... Now the downsides... It is only a cologne concentrate, which is so disappointing. This NEEDS to be an EDP or at least an EDT... But other than so-so performance and so-so longevity, this stuff is soooo beautiful and delicious. I absolutely LOVE citrus/amber/myrrh/olibanum fragrances. I need to discover more!",06/22/21 12:08,GialinosKosmos

It very close to tf noir
But it’s weaker and it disappears very fast

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Having tried most of the blue line from this house plus a handful of others in this line I haven't been overly impressed by most. This however I adore and love ALOT. It's not to say the others were bad, they were nice but not bottle worthy for me. Mirra is back up bottle worthy for me, I just wish it lasted abit longer. This smells rich, deep and opulent. Reminds me of the Myyrh in Zaharoff.

9/10",05/15/21 05:26,Crusader Smitty
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This starts off as a Pow to the senses then calms down to this nice mixture of amber ( and myrrh ) with other elements of the fall time ( although I wore this in the winter, it still fits perfectly )

I don't personally know or have smelled what Myrrh is but, whatever it is, this fragrance works and works well.

It's nothing explosively amazing to me, but just beautifully done and enjoyable.

A woman could likely pull this off but... it's not so obvious either way to be just for men or women to me.

Revisiting this for a moment, this does smell like a cookie... a well made gourmet type of cookie.",01/24/21 12:00,EauDeBaldy
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"@Nick68 I'm in the same boat, I saw the pricing error and jumped on it too. I've seen the same performance issue as you but at that price, I'm not complaining.
The box I received was in a plastic case but not sealed/stickered.
I like the fragrance itself but would be annoyed if I had paid full price for it!",01/03/21 18:51,jman316
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This is going to be complicated and I may even contradict myself on a couple of points.

I got this just after Christmas from a UK retailer who I think had made a mistake in pricing on their Euro site, it was a fraction of what they were charging in GBP and for what I paid it’s a fantastic bargain.

Putting the above aside I’ve got to say I like it but I don’t love it. I have Colonia at present, I’ve had a few other ADP fragrances in the past and have always been wowed by them, this doesn’t quite hit the spot.

The initial hit I get is of high cocoa content dark Swiss Chocolate, which immediately calms down into mirhh and amber. It’s got that ADP mark of quality all over it, but at the same time there’s just something missing to take it to another level where I couldn’t live without it.

I don’t get the longevity or projection I was expecting either. It arrived a few day’s ago and I sprayed it before bed on two nights and there was no hint of it in the morning, today has been the first time I’ve worn it during the day and after 6 hours I’m having to really search for any hint of it.

I think I paid around 1/4 of RRP so I can’t complain at that price but I would have been disappointed if I hadn’t got it heavily discounted.

It’s obviously quality and it’s nice but it doesn’t really stand out as anything special.",01/02/21 09:10,Nick68
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,5/10,12/13/20 00:31,mohsen95
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"At first wearing I quite liked this fragrance. A brighter, bit more light myrrh than usual, while still carrying the same dryness it's known for.
Something kept bugging me though and I never felt I really liked the scent. After smelling it a while I think I've realized what it is: a scratchy and strong synthetic woody amber, perhaps the old pal Amber Xtreme popping up again. This causes the fragrance to have a scent reminiscent of a more generic cheap masculine and, as my girlfriend describes it, causes it to ""go up the nose"" really much and hurts a little if you smell it too close. I would guess this is a way to boost the sillage of the scent, which unfortunately completely ruined it too.

It was launched in 2017 but is already discontinued as of 2020, so maybe other people agreed with me. If you like myrrh, there are just so many other scents around that I would recommend over this.",11/24/20 14:55,Borzoi
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,A discontinued masterpiece that is still slept on even now. There isn't much out there that is like this one. For me it is as good as or even better than Colonia Leather,11/17/20 11:29,BirkinSmell
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,i don't know what it is but this scent like many of the other Acqua di Parma scents smells cheap. Just everything about this radiates synthetics. I've tried a dozen or so of their scents after liking one of their Blu Meditteraneo scents and reading all of these positive reviews. I love resins and myrrh but this just doesn't sit right with me. It smells unbalanced with a largely vacant top note register.,08/31/20 07:59,patrick.herron
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"The top notes last relatively little, only a few minutes. Immediately appears the main note of MIR, and from now on the myrrh is the main player who will feel throughout the period of wearing.
Elegant, totally masculine, with a long longevity and medium projection.
To get an idea of how it smells, imagine the final part of Guerlain-L`instant and replace cocoa with myrrh. They are somewhat similar towards the end.",05/03/20 10:39,Ionut82

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Tested it on skin: a little disappointed after the high hopes that the paper test gave me.

I thought I had found the Holy Graal of Myrrh, but no.
Don't misunderstand me: it's a good round myrrh centred frag, but my previous impression in regard to the lack of AdP's signature citrusy opening and the drydown, that reveals to be even more vanillic than it appeared on paper, makes it lean very feminine imo. Projection is moderate at best, and the fragrance is short lived on my skin (disappeared after just 3 hours).

I think it may be interesting on a woman, but quite boring on a man. That said, today I also tested Guerlain Bois Mysterieux: THIS is the holy grail of masculine myrrh. Given the price tag similarity between the 2 frags, it's a no-brainer for me for my myrrh frag quest: AdP is out, Guerlain for the win!

Edit: Guerlain Bois Mysterieux is a masterpiece imo, but should you look for a frag totally myrrh-centered, I can't recommend enough Goutal Ambre Fetiche and Armani Myrrhe Imperiale. Really, imperial!",04/17/19 16:57,Andy the Frenchy
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"I beautiful take on myrrh. It's indeed pretty warm and round, and the typical AdP citric opening is a little less fresh than other frags of the same line. Myrrh is noticeable in the heart. Then it morphs to an ambery (resin/vanilla) drydown - for sure a little less interesting than its big brother, AdP Note di Colonia III. Colonia Mirra is overall sweeter and a little less refined than the latter, but also 2 to 3 times cheaper.

A win from AdP, but try on skin before you buy!

Mildly warm evenings, 30+",04/16/19 11:55,Andy the Frenchy
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,I found this fragrance more conservative that the version Oud or Ambra. I would list these three in the following order: 1.Colonia Oud 2. Colonia Ambra 3. Colonia Mirra being the last one a more subtle and more quieter than the first two. I would give a final score: 3 of 5,12/28/18 01:25,elchele1973
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"This stuff smells deep and rich almost like a cookie dough vibe, but manly. It will turn heads for a mature audience. I think people are sleeping on this one, modern and vintage. a casual and dress up fragrance that gets the job done.",08/02/18 18:13,c.davis
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma is such a classy brand.

From the moment you open the box you can feel the quality and the luxury. Colonia mirra delivers exactly what its name says. From the very start you are greeted with an ambery, sweet but steady myrrh note. This is for the elegant, dark haired gentleman over 30. Longevity is good but not excellent. If you genuinely like myrrh, give it a try. However, my myrrh obsession is already fulfilled by the 2012 version of Eau sauvage Parfum which has a bit more brightness IMO and better performance.",06/23/18 12:03,Leopold
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Spiritual, meditative, sensual, deep, elegant, masculine.

Perfectly matches its name as it's VERY resinous, which I find lovely.

However, the more it drys down the sweeter it gets and becomes a bit cloying. It's also not very easy to wear so although I fell in love with the scent at the beginning I won't be buying a bottle, I can't spend so much on something that's not 100% satisfactory.",06/22/18 04:57,torom
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma, my new favorite brand and a true master of blends.
All their perfumes are made of high quality ingredients and this one is no exception.

This perfume says: I enjoy being a man!

This creature is extraordinary, utterly admirable. Everything about this perfume is as it should be. Everything is in its place. Everything is balanced.
The notes come in, play their role in the light of a resinous myrrh and amber accord and slowly fade away with a goodbye kiss on your senses.

The opening is a little bit powerful, but just enough to grab your attention. Then the myrrh comes in and the beautiful, sweet, and boozy amber starts to play in the background. This is the main theme of the perfume and it will be like this until you can't smell the perfume anymore.
I've applied it 12 hours ago and I can still smell it on my arm. I actually sniffed my arm more than 100 times today.

Myrrh and amber are two of my beloved notes in perfumes and they always will be. So I have to say, this is one of the top 5 perfumes I've ever smelled in my life, maybe even the best.

Overall, a sweet lovely perfume, made of high quality ingredients, suitable for colder months with a not-so-casual vibe.

Thank you for making this gem!

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Mirra is the third one I have tried from the ADP Ingredient line after Oud and Leather and like those two, I love this one as well. This is a beautiful, powdery spice n Myrhh fragrance.

Top notes are a fleeting dash of citrus and the sharp spicy note of the nutmeg. This spicy nutmeg is joined by a very beautiful myrhh note. This heart phase is just lovely and then turns powdery when the patchouli comes into focus. The dry down is a blend of the myrhh, and powdery patchouli with hints of amber notes. All in all, very clean smelling for want of a better word. longevity is pretty decent, around the 6-7 hour range on me although projection dies down after the first hour into what I would call the ""hugging"" range. I get whiffs of it all through it's scent life so it does last.

In conclusion, I would say if you are a fan of the Myrhh note or of powdery frags in general, this is a good entry with the usual fantastic ADP quality in ingredients and blend. I would say this is Masculine mostly although a woman could easily pull this off too if she does not mind the spice.

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"After investigation, the originality of this frag is probably due to a component which is not stated in the parfume pyramid above, myrrh oil, which gives rise to some confusion or questions in the reviews here (honey? creamy? amber? ...).
Myrrh is present here in two forms: myrrh resin (a middle note) and myrrh oil (a base note along with a discrete patchouli).
It's this oily base note which is really dominant and long lasting in this frag.
I should have read the small booklet which is included in the 150 ml box I bought ! It tells it all: no amber as erroneously stated in the pyramid above, just myrrh oil.",08/02/17 09:01,orpailleur
Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Applause, what a well balanced and interesting perfume.
I didn't expect otherwise by this house of course.
How to describe this perfume is not easy. It is a compilation of different notes that are not natural easy partners to combine. This perfume is distinctive and also adepts to everyone who wears it.
The opening is a typical Italian based perfume with the the fusion of citric notes. But they are not overwhelming.
The aromatic raisins and nutmeg keep it in balance.
Happily the patchouli is of a good quality so it stays in the background, but gives also balance by its light sweet freshness to the strong fusion of the balsamic amber and spicy nutmeg notes.
This is really a nice perfume for a man who is distinctive but also modest.
When to wear? I guess its a four season perfume:)
Every note reacts different according the season you wear it.
This is a really modern perfume for one who likes class and style in a modest way. It represents in some way the Italian way of life like the Blue mediterraneo series really do.",07/22/17 05:57,osiris5

Colonia Mirra Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma masters the blending of aromatic scents, and here they've done it again! In Mirra we have the fragrant and sweet myrrh mixed with aromatic nutmeg and neroli on a pleasant amber base. The myrrh notes came out relatively quickly after the initial citrus blast, and gradually became sweeter over the course of the dry down. Just like any other ADP scents all notes are harmoniously blended. No harsh edges.

The performance is at least 7 hours, however the projection can be a bit shy on cooler days.

Arancia di Capri La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I found this acqua di parma maybe 3 weeks ago, and was really surprised at how good it performs and lasts compared to the older acqua di parma fragrances. 4 hours after spraying this on, I was still enjoying this smells it had on offer, walking the streets of the city.

On initial spray It gives lots of citrus and fruitiness, its very light and settles quickly to a more masculine earthy/woody mineral scent with that blood orange citrus smell remaining in the background. Amazing summer fragrance in my opinion.",07/10/25 23:59,Danoir.cologne

Arancia di Capri La Riserva Acqua di Parma,I’m a huge fan of FICO di amalfi and arancia di capri BUT this is without a doubt the best offering from the la riserva line. Juicy blood orange that absolutely sparkles in the high heat with salty mineral notes. Might be my new favorite from aqua di Parma. And don’t get me wrong the new fico di amalfi is still amazing I purchased that as well but something about this arancia di capri just does it for me as I live in Arizona and it’s so hot here. The fico di amalfi I say would be excellent for nights out during the summer as it is sweeter.,06/11/25 12:12,C_Teeezy

Arancia di Capri La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"had the opportunity to sample Fico di Amalfi and Arancia di Capri La Reserva before launch, thanks to my best friend that bought Fico La Reserva at her last vacation travel to Miami, she gifted me two 5ml decants that the sales representative gave her. I had great expectations for this one I can say this is the one I liked the least, its way different from the original, even tho the additional note provide more deepness I guess for my skin didn’t work well. On paper smells beautiful, like grabbing an orange peel an rubbing it between your finger, fresh, slightly bitter with a creamy sweetness. On my skin reacted totally different, it gave me the olfactive experience that Dior Fahrenheit also has, like smelling grease/gasoline but less prominent and slightly sweeter, it’s the mix with citrus and leather that might cause it. Definitely a more complex fragrance, It has a great performance tho between 6-8 hrs, and has a good sillage. I recommend to try it first before buying because it might not work for your skin (like my case).",05/29/25 07:12,RØD

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is probably the most wearable leather fragrance I've owned. I've owned many all the classics like TL, OL etc. I will say I LOVE Ombre Leather Parfum. They give me the same vibe and energy.

This is a class take on leather very much down the TL route albeit smoother, rounded and softer. This is an EDC after all and lasts a good few hours. The citrus & woody notes in here are very nice and set it apart from its counterparts. This is versatile for a leather perfume, im 6 foot, solid build etc and love TL but honestly I think this is better.

This and OLP are the best leathers, ADPL for winter/fall and OLP for spring/winter. I think this could be worn in summer in thr evening in a specific situation it would be 🔥

Is this mind blowing? No
Is this groundbreaking? No
Is this a standout perfume? No

Then what is it? Well its just a really great smooth take on this leather DNA. I don't find it harsh, ashy, dirty etc its a crisp clean leather with a slight edge to it. Its classy and refined.

9/10 - Losing a point for versatility (Not a complete year round perfume)
10/10 - Leather DNA, this is what you want to wear to be noticed but not choke people out.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"One of the best leathers around, and one of the fragrances that got me into fragrances.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Another masterpeice by Francois Demachy who gave us the most elegant leather of all time; Dior Homme Parfum. ✨👑 (and just liked the beloved DHP, AdP Colonia Leather is also discontinued 🙄)

AdP Colonia Leather is slightly fresher and lighter than the EdP version. But make no mistake is this is still a smokey primal brooding dark leather where the Paraguayan Guaiac wood takes center stage and gives you that dark smokey aspect of a leather accord. They both share the exact scent profile 💯 The difference is just in the intensity of the notes. ✨

It's a true leather fragrance where the leather is always present throughout the fragrance's journey with you. The famous AdP citrus is also here to give it that elegant freshness, preparing you for a dark descent into the primal dark journey of the rugged bold leather accord. This is such a well-blended formulation! The cedar gives it that alpha masculine sharpness. 😎

This smells like you had to do some hard decisions in your head. It is a very serious fragrance, which is why it's leaning very formal. 🤵

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I own both this and Tuscan Leather.
While Tuscan Leather is the new, designer made leather jacket, Colonia Leather is the jacket that went through a few motorcycle crashes with cigars in its inner pocket.

Imagine this: You are at the Italian coast, starting the aperitivo. The girls order an aperol spritz and the boys a negroni. One guy doesn't want either, and orders a whisky and lights up a small cigar. Everyone looks at him weird. He doesn't care and does what he wants.

THIS is how he smells. As you could probably tell from the length of this review, I am very passionate about this fragrance (and Acqua di Parma as a whole). Perhaps I am biased because I am Italian, but there is nothing quite like ADP available. How they go about their perfumery is pure art, and modern designers could learn a lot from them.

To start: I don't think this smells like Tuscan Leather at all, in the same way that a retro leather jacket is very different from a modern one. This one is more masculine, more rough. It's the perfect combo between that classy Acqua di Parma citrus and the animalic notes from the leather, woods and smoke. Like a man riding a sports bike in a suit :)

I'm not saying that this is 'a better fragrance' than Tuscan Leather, but damn, there is just nothing like this on the market. Tuscan Leather has a few alternatives like Godolphin and that one from Rasasi (they are all worse than TL though), but there is not a single fragrance that captures that Italian masculinity like this one. Besides, it is not redundant to own them both. I reach more for Tuscan Leather when the setting is outside/colder and more for Colonia Leather in warmer settings.

Moreover, I do detect a slight difference between the old Colonia Leather and the new black bottle (I have a decant of the new stuff). The new version has a slightly more prominent raspberry note, but I only noticed the difference when I smelled them side by side, and it would be impossible to detect the difference in the air. I am sure it is caused by the fact my old, brown bottle is from 2018 so it has aged a bit, while the decant is from the newest bottle. It is not worth hunting old bottles, unless you connect sentimental values to it.

Lastly, the fact that people think this is ""hard to wear"" and ""too smokey"" makes me even love it more. This stuff is Italian confidence in a bottle. 10/10.",09/10/24 07:53,sweetymasculine
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful fragrance.

For me I got 180ml for $190 AUD (off of a friend of a friend) which is incredible value, however I would still pay up to $400 for the size. This fragrance is a beast, lasts for ages and smells so unique. Strong, dark leather smell with a mix of oud and citruses. I blind bought this and I loved it, so I would say if you like leather and oud fragrances this one will be up your alley.

Would recomend picking this up if you can as im pretty sure these are limited release.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Now evaluating this fragrance with a decant of the ""Leather EdP"" version from 2019, which, according to my research, is exactly the same fragrance:

The leather note is incredible right from the opening; it is probably the strongest and most natural leather note I've ever smelled. This note is very animalic in its naturalism but not dirty like Kouros; it’s more reminiscent of well-tanned leather tools, sun-worn and rustic, rather than sweaty animals and other bodily odors.

From the opening, there is a quite smoky oud that brings similarities to the house's Oud & Spice and really consolidates for me that, contrary to what I previously thought, Acqua di Parma is not just about fresher, naturalistic, and minimalist (or barber-shop) fragrances, but also has some of the best dark and ""niche"" fragrances on the market.",06/05/24 10:08,danilodeathayde

Reminds me of the raw unfinished backing of leather than the more finished leather of Tom Ford's two fragrances. I used the word 'primal' in my Tuscan Leather review. It's much more appropriate with Colonia Leather by a long shot. You wear this, you are wearing unabashed leather. You ARE leather.",01/25/24 17:31,NorthByNorthEast

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is a widely well regarded and hyped leather fragrance. I've seen several YouTube videos where fragrance reviewers put this in their top leather fragrances. As a lover of leather, I had to grab it and see what it was about. Here's how it went;

Scent:
Opening is a shotgun blast of leather, with the orange, raspberry, and lemon hiding underneath. The leather note in this fragrance is very similar to the leather note in Tom Ford's Ombre Leather. In the dry down it's the same powerful leather, but the fruit notes have swapped places with the wood notes. I've also seen this compared to Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather, specifically in regards to the raspberry note. I've never smelled Tuscan Leather before though, so I can't give any opinion on that. But I can certainly understand when looking at the note breakdowns.

Performance:
Initial opening is very strong, easily fills a room. Sillage matches that intensity, leaving an easily noticeable scent trail. Certified nuclear. After a few hours, the projection was still around 3 feet and the scent trail was still prominent and easily noticeable. Even at about 6 hours I was still getting some projection and a modest scent trail. Altogether the scent lasted on my skin over 12 hours, making it certified eternal. However, when I took a shower about 24 hours later the water reactivated the scent and made the whole shower smell like leather. That's some performance.

When to wear:
This is a leather bomb, through and through. But I feel the other notes that accompany the leather lend it enough versatility to be suitable all year long, day or night. You could even pull this off at this office, just go LIGHT on the sprays.

Blind buy:
If you like leather fragrances this is definitely blind buy worthy. The leather note is SUPER strong, so that may turn some people off, but there's nothing particularly ""funky"" about it. The performance is stellar, so you won't be disappointed.

Final verdict:
This took a top 5 spot from Carolina Herrera's CH Men Prive as my favorite leather fragrance. I've smelled Ombre Leather before and I LOVE it. It is/was my favorite leather fragrance. I don't have it in my collection yet, but I think even Ombre Leather would have a tough battle beating Colonia Leather for my favorite leather fragrance. It's just THAT good. It's worth noting that Colonia Leather is discontinued, but the general consensus within the community is that Acqua Di Parma's Leather EDP is the same juice in a different bottle. I've smelled both and I can confirm that is the case. Bottom line; get this fragrance if you like leather fragrances. If you can't find Colonia Leather, go for Leather EDP.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,Very nice leather fragrance my favourite on the market at the moment. It smells clean classy expensive and it still manages somehow to keep the animalistic side of the leather. If you are a refined bad boy this is the best leather scent. Ombre Leather is the scent of a cowboy that comes out from the barnyard compared to this one. so it is up to u what a bad boy means. is it the ombre leather the bad boy the average joe from Hollywood movies that lives at the county side and while at home is working in the barnyard beats his wife and kids and goes to pub to get drunk and play pool or is it the refined mafia type of guy. this is how tuscan leather should have smelled like but it failed to do so.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"My Thanksgiving fragrance.
The great Colonia Leather by Acqua di Parma.

The leather, rose, cedar, Paraguayan petitgrain, Brazilian orange, a touch of that raspberry and even the honeysuckle is a tad noticeable but you mainly get the most mature smoke and leather in class. This smells like an aged man wearing a fuzzy sports coat at the airport after he finished eating a cigarette.

This works as a perfect Autumn in tropical weather fragrance but I think it can be pulled off generally in both chilly and warm weather.

I've always said a good fragrance paired with a good meal enhances the dining experience.

So after devouring all the couscous, lentil-stuffed mushrooms, mac, cranberry salads, sweet plantains, cornbread, pumpkin pie or whatever it is everyone eats, I'm glad to have this scent tag along with me on the back of my neck.",11/29/22 18:10,Garibaldi Avion

I'm a fully-fledged fragrance head; my top fragrances are CK Euphoria Amber Gold, Fahrenheit, Terre D'Hermes, Dior Homme Intense, Sauvage EDP, Chanel Allure Homme Sport, and Paco Rabanne Invictus...

I only bought this because it was so heavily discounted... but there's a reason why it was so heavily discounted; this is trash juice!!
I'd often wondered why there weren't many reviews on YouTube regarding this fragrance. It's because nobody wants it, due to it being an unpleasant mess. One that has absolutely no business being a ""fragrance"".
The day before my blind-buy was due to arrive, I was agonising over whether to keep it or cancel it before it was due to arrive. I opted to decline it at the door, by refusing delivery. The delivery lady expressed that that'd be a lot of work for her, so not wanting to inconvenience her, I kept it. BIG MISTAKE!!! I took a chance and failed, BIGTIME!!!
I rushed in, opened it, was impressed by the presentation, OF COURSE; It's Aqua Di Parma!
Then I sprayed it... my face scrunched up, and I was gutted, because I'd just wasted £100 on this mess, that is now unreturnable because I'd opened it. Yuck!
It smells like the leather interior of a new luxury car, with an antiseptic smell to boot...
Who in hell wants to smell like this!? Not me; I'm only 38 years old!! This stuff is old man. Not even a fashionable old man, an old man who has no clue about fashion or what works... Yuuuuuuuuuuck!!
My older lady-friend came over. She's so polite about everything, but she couldn't even hide her displeasure about how bad this smells; she scrunched up her face and shook her head, but said nothing...
Then I pushed her... ""go on, what's up???"" She responded, ""you smell like you've been to the dentist... this is not nice... this has to be your worst fragrance...""
One review I read, said that it also has a first aid box smell. I concur with that statement; it's horrible stuff! I regret this, enormously!

I thought to myself that I would use the sample to spray in my trainers in an attempt to remove the whiff. Before i did, I had a sniff of the sample bottle and didn't hate it it. Hmmm ........

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is THE leather scent for me, I tried it 5 years ago in a shop, tried it a year later and still I liked it.
I always thought it was to expensive for me and caved for the la yuqawam scent. That however has the prominent raspberry note. It's good but the raspberry is too much, here you get that tone too at the beginning but quickly it fades for a more citrusy and more real leather scent. When drying down you get the real leather with rose to get a very classy feel.

The Yuqawam stays raspberry and because of that more ashtray on me, I discovered that I realy hate the raspberry note if it's too much, it's also the reason that I gave my bottle of Rochas man away after a few wearings. The Yuqawam is only good for wearing outside for me because the raspberry gets overwhelming.

Now I got a good deal for around 110 euros for a 180 ml bottle of colonia leather so I could not resist it anymore.
The presentation, the massive 180 ml bottle and the scent give it a real sense of class.

The only leather that's close to beeing as good as this one, for me, would be Tom Ford's ombre leather.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"It's magnificent! The beginning is citruses, bright, but not too strong or refreshing. Almost immediately after you could smell very realistic luxury leather. In the dry down the rose and a bit of white flowers start to be more prominent, but leather stays till the very end. It is very refined, a bit shy but elegant, though people might find this sort of leather a bit too brutal and animalic. I see that people are change their opinions after wearing it for a bit longer, or being with a person who wears it constantly.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Blind buy. Smells similar to TFTL (not as harsh) and PDM Godolphin. Opens with smokey leather tar and dries to fruity berry rose (I don't get as much citrus). To say this smells just like a leather store is an exaggeration. I wish it didn't dry down to fruity rose because it makes it too feminine (and too derivative). However, the rose seems to be blended better than most, it is noticeable, but not sickening. Overall: FRUITY LEATHER, LIKE (not love), COOLER WEATHER, SEMI DRESSY, SLIGHTLY UNISEX/FEMININE (on dry down), POTENT.

Update 10.6.20 I underestimated the ADP DNA of this fragrance (citrus, clean soap) which for me, doesn't appear until the 2nd day of wear! It is definitely unique in its develop over the hours.

One of my top favorite / A niche quality Scent ****

Ingredient Structure:

- Head: Brazilian Orange, Lime
- Body: Petitgrain Paraguay, Rose
- Base: Leather, Guaiac Wood, Cedar

If you are into Leather scents, appreciate sophistication elegance luxury and can afford the price, then this is a must-have for you! But do not blind buy, this is an strong opinionated scent, you would either love or hate it :) just like TF Tuscon Leather fans camps!

I am personally not pro citrus DNA/opening makes, but if you know Acqua Di Parma DNA, you should be able to admire the formula in introducing a well-presentation citrus opening which it further launch the pleasant civilized smoky leather with a base with a woody green cedar landing which is not so prolonged.

My only expectation for this category and price would have been a better projection and longevity over 4 hours on my skin (which it might vary on other skin types ;) )

So, my final grade:

There is a hint of freshness in the opening, though this only lasts for minutes. The oud note in the background is detectable; but its only there to support the leather.

Of course, this being a leather note, it gets compared to other leather offerings from Tom Ford (Tuscan leather / Ombre leather). From the designer Realm, Gucci guilty absolute comes close to this.

Performance is excellent. Sillage is classy and not at all offensive, even if over sprayed.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Beautifully made leather fragrance. Bold, in the same league as Colonia Oud.
At this price point, one has to make decision, I opt for Colonia Oud. That said, Colonia Leather is a close 2nd.

Edit: I have both on my skin now. The leather is indeed similar to Tom Ford Tuscan Leather, but rounder and without the rasperry note. (I prefer AdP's over TF's). That said, there is rose showing up in the drydown, that brings it back towards the TL path.
The reason I opt for the Colonia Oud is that the drydown is similar to Colonia Leather, but without sweetness.
In summary: for me, Colonia Leather wins in the opening, and Colonia Oud in the drydown.

Edit 2: I have to edit completely my comment. Colonia Leather has a beautiful opening, that is a fresh, then shortly after, a bolder woody leather. Really great. The guaiac wood then leaves the stage to let the rose take over the supporting role, and that results in the drydown being a carbon copy of TF Tuscan Leather. Not really for my taste, and a little too ""in your face"" to be elegant.
Of AdP's Oud-Ambra-Leather trio, leather is probably the one that has the strongest projection, with a heavy projection in the first hour, followed by moderate in the following 2-3 hours, and softer projection for another 1-2 hours after that. That said, of these 3, it's the one who has the shortest longevity (approx. 8 hours), but still more than enough for what is needed for a long evening.
As for my preferences, I have to say that Ambra is now on top of the podium, with Oud as a close 2nd.
Unfortunately the similarity with TF's TL makes it a no-go for me, but for those who liked TL, it's a must! (better than TL imo).",01/26/19 06:15,Andy the Frenchy
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is not just another version of TL, in fact it is quite unlike any of the typical ""raspberry leather"" that I have tried to date which are TL, Ombre 18, Oud Saphir and La Yuquwam.
It is also not like Gucci Guilty Absolute, which is different than those styles also.

All these frags do seemingly have birch tar as their main leather note but that is the only thing in common with this really.

What this fragrance is about is smoothness. It is smooth and superbly blended, from top to bottom and because of that rather than leather it reminds me of an expensive suede.

It starts off with a very smooth creamy orange, with that same tarry leather note from TL/Ombre and the like underneath but far less pronounced. As it dries down the leather comes through more and some green notes too to finally leave a really well balanced orange leather and wood scent to enjoy.
It doesn’t project as heavy as the typical raspberry ones and feels more sophisticated and versatile for it.

This one is for the times you want to wear TL, but the situation needs a bit more class and elegant restraint. It projects but it is not a beast, it lasts but not forever and it is unique in its own right.


Of this line Colonia Oud is my favorite scent wise, but this is more wearable and so will be reached for more often.",01/21/19 17:06,SmellMyCheese

I got a sample of 9 different Acqua Di Parma fragrances and this is the first I tried. I love the original Colonia and I really like Leather too. When I first put it on it smelled great. I Initially I thought I smelled something a little like whisky but, I don't see it in the notes so its probably a combination of the leather and tree smells.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Leather may very well be the Goldilocks of the full-flavored leather fragrances. On one hand, I have Tuscan Leather, Golden Boy and La Yuqawam Homme that many consider too strong and too dark, while Cuir de Russie, Cuir Cannage and others may come across as being too weak or contain too many floral notes. Colonia Leather manages to strike that ""just right"" accord.

My issue (and imagine that I am not alone) is that I really love the strong/dark leather fragrances, but they are not something I wear often during the Spring/Summer months. That's what Colonia Leather does better than all the others...it's full-flavored leather; not too strong and not too weak; and it's a leather scent a man can wear proudly year round to include the Spring/Summer months. It is leather from top-to-bottom, with a fresh citrus opening and a bit of woods and floral (deep in the background) to keep things in check. It's that simple, and it's that elegant.

I really didn't have a ""go to"" full-flavored leather fragrance for this time of year until adding Colonia Leather to my Scent Armory. Sure, I could go with one-spray of Tuscan Leather, but men enjoy that scent more than women and, to me, it's extremely cloying during the warmer months. Moreover, while I enjoy light-leather frags such as Fan di Fendi Pour Homme, Vince Camuto for Men and Carolina Herrera CH Men...sometimes you just want to smell an full-flavored leather scent during the Summer months, and Acqua di Parma nailed this scent genre.

Anyway, AdP Colonia Leather is certainly worth taking a sniff if you're looking for a full-flavored warm-weather leather fragrance. It's the only one I own filling this niche category. Finally, this fragrance does not remind me of Tuscan Leather - but your mileage may vary.",07/17/18 16:12,GodKing

This fragrance reminds me of a profound,enlightened and elegant gentleman who is on an important mission.
Colonia Leather is a dark yet bright,sophisticated,classy, refined,citrusy,clean and woody interpretation of leather with an astonishing touch of divine rose and with a wisper of a bit green petitgrain.
Colonia Leather has some similarities to C for Men by Clive Christian and Tuscan Leather by Tom Ford,but Colonia took a bit different approach.I would say a more elegant,less playful,more classy,more illuminated,more refined and a bit brighter approach.

Longevity - 10/10(10+ hours)
Silage/Projection - 9/10(heavy projection and silage for the first 3-4 hours)
Weather -For more or less any time of year.I personally wouldn't wear this on a really hot summer days.
Age - 27+
Compliments - 9/10
Scent - 10/10

Main notes according to me -
leather,guaiac wood,rose,orange,lime,cedar.

The drydown is woody,leathery,smoky,a bit dry,bitter and green and I get some -leather,woodiness and petitgrain.

Emotions - elegant,enlightened,sophisticated,illuminated, classy,refined,profound,timeless.

Occasion -Perfect for special occasions,life defining moments,formal and semi-formal events.

This is the scent of a true gentleman.",04/18/18 09:15,Ivanus
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,This is one of the first clean smelling leathers ive ever smelled. It does have the tuscan leather vibe but this is just miles ahead in terms of classiness. TL becomes cloying while this one keeps getting better as you wear it. I think most wear TL to tell others they wear TL. This is also way more versatile. Buy a sample. Do it!,04/09/18 16:50,chrisarcarola75
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,I own La Yuqawam and have a decant of Tuscan Leather. I tried this one to day and I prefer this over the others. It's a more authentic leather wibe I get.,03/26/18 07:40,Agerskiold
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,This is one of the best leather perfume I have owned. This is on a league of its own and it not at all similar to TF-TL other than leather being a common factor. This smells so fresh and clean with the leather coming through from start to finish. The longevity and silage are also very good. I didn’t find anything similar to this yet.,03/07/18 11:58,Hareharekrishna

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Found a super deal for this one and read some reviews before blind buying it...

Almost immediately you get the leather note to it and it's absolutely brilliant! It's very classy and sophisticated but retains its animalic factor. It doesn't really evolve much on me, begins with a blast and very slowly fades into a very warm elegant drydown.

I say very slowly because this one lasts at least 12 hours on me. Worn it a few times now,mostly to office and it really makes me feel like Da Boss! I'm not really bothered about compliments or anything as I wear this for myself but I've only heard good things thus far.

I guess these types of scents are obviously aimed at those who appreciate leather notes but I really do think that the juice is versatile and has it's own mainstream appeal. End of the day, a 100ml bottle for MYR 150 (about 38$) was to good to resistand I'm really glad I took the plunge!

Scent - 9/10 absolutely brilliant leather
Silage - 9/10 anyone coming into proximity will notice
Projection- 9/10 at least 1 foot for quite a while
Longevity - 9/10 absolute Beast!

At least that's the way I see it

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,This is a smooth and refined leather. Comparisons to Tuscan Leather are welcomed but this is an upscale version. Sort of like a tamed beast. Strong sillage but not overwhelming and great performance. The leather here is not as rugged which makes this much more wearable when compared to other great leather scents. This is a home run while Tuscan Leather is an off the wall double.,02/18/18 21:36,Chicago Tony T

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Having a sample! wanting so much to try this one!
Classiness luxiourious italian leather!
Yeah nice fragrance, after few wearing, I recognize this one is a solid scent.
First, it start with a blast of rose and citrus leather. Then the leather took slowly the place on the drydown. To my nose, it's a mix of Potion Royal black with that rose note and the leather of Tuscan Leather without the cocaine vibe of it.
Longevity is great, got 8-10 hours even for a EdC concentrée (EdT concentration if you want to be honest)
not very versatile but formal and clubbing at night.
Fall and winther because of its great projection|

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I see the comparison to Tuscan Leather, but ADP is far more polished. This is the leather of the shoes of an orange-eating Italian businessman, rather than the leather jacket of a cigar-smoking cocaine dealer. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
SO smooth, SO sophisticated, ADP Leather is a beautiful blend and absolutely one of the classiest and most distinguished scents I've ever laid my nose upon.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I’m sure that everyone has that one fragrance in their collection that they would miss if it was discontinued. For me, it’s this one. I start to miss this if I don’t wear it every once in awhile. It is by far my favorite leather fragrance. I even spray it on the inside of my leather jackets and leather travel bags because they should smell like this. This is what leather is supposed to smell like.

I’m a leather guy though. I want leather seats in my trucks and cars. I prefer leather furniture. Yeah, I got my boots on. I used to leave my saddle in the back seat of my truck/car just so I could smell the leather when I opened the door and while on the road.

Leather is one of those universal items that belongs in and also connects so many different categories. From antique to modern, from blue collar usefulness to what transforms typical in to luxury, leather is a tie that binds. It’s one of the few things that a rugged biker has in common with an eccentric tycoon, and it keeps the cowboy from being too far removed from the city slicker; give us our leather.

And leather this is. A perfect leather. If orange peel was made out of leather, this is what it would smell like. That’s the vision I have anyway.

Just like the real deal, the durability and longevity are both fantastic. Sillage is just right, others will know you’ve been there but didn’t wear out your welcome. I would wear this anywhere, at any time, except for the beach.",11/22/17 12:10,Jbar1

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is fragrance is one of my lastest purchases, alongside with Pardon by Nasomatto (I'll get there after this first impressions review) and here's my initial thoughts.

Such a fantastic take on leather! It starts fresh, citrucy, juicy and, after the initial blast, comes a warm, classy and elegant leather note, like you were inside of a brand new Mercedes-Benz leather interior. The leather note is definitely the main character of this scent, followed with some woodiness, creaminess and a slight sweetness coming from the guaiac wood and citrus.

So far it seems to be a long lasting fragrance.

High quality and unique scent that deserves more attention.

LOVE IT!",10/30/17 11:24,FragranceForTwo
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Fresh leather. I never thought this combination of citrus, soap and leather could work so well but now I am hooked And its got like a oriental tea vibe. This has become my top leather fragrance. It is not animalic, dirty, smokey or synthetic. It is just... clean. Performance: it could be better, colonia oud is much stronger.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is truly exceptional, just exceptional!

The only similarities between this and Tuscan Leather are:
They are both leather scents,expensive, quality
blends and they come in brown bottles.

They don't smell the same, not even on the dry down, they are not even the same type of leather.
Never think you can substitute the one for the other, they offer different things, really. It makes perfect sense to have both, if you can!

I really love this one! AdP baby!",09/16/17 13:45,Thee Maestro
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I ordered samples of this and Tuscan Leather. I prefer the Acqua di Parma. It's a bit more understated, especially after an hour or so on the dry down. It smells ""expensive"", without being overpowering, like TL feels to me. It's fantastic. Suitable for special occasions or nights out. I was still able to smell it on my wrist after 8 hours.",09/09/17 10:06,pjganz

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Modern cutting fragrance that we could consider as a monolithic aroma.

The opening is citrus and refreshing rather brief, the petit grain leads us straight to the agreement of leather as a main and unique note, which feels predominant from the beginning.

The facets are nice and soft, in fact, although the duration is good, it projects smoothly and without fumbling.
This leather feels somewhat sweet and with a rubbery stitch as a kind of astringent rubber, the rose is placid, soft and powdery, feels good, but nothing dominant and softens that astringent note so powerful. On the other hand, the wood of guayaco and to a lesser extent the cedar give the smoked and dry facet contributing lightness. All very well balanced.

It seems to me a smooth work, elegant, masculine and neat (very Italian). It is also a great fragrance for daytime use.

Demachy has been here excellent since it fits the aroma very well with the spirit of Acqua di Parma.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"One word ""FANTASTIC"" dont be fooled by the cologne concentree this one is potent and last a very long time. I sprayed 5 heavy ones today 5 hiurs later i am still projecting like crazy and this is an honest experience. Performance wise falls into montale category despite the cologne concentree, smell wise awesome quality. Leather is the star of the show and youbwill get it, a very nice leather woody combination with a hint of freashness lurking. Overall a love for me on this one. Now to get the oud and ambra.

Side note blind buying this would not hurt at all if you are into leather smokey scents. Its not that cloying or heavy it's just right.",02/06/17 13:32,pjd1234

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I prefer this one far more than Tuscan leather by TF. This one smells more friendly, its not sweet, it's more elegant, and the leather smells cleaner.

It has the DNA of AdP of course, with the citruses and woods, with added notes of expensive leather.

I wish the projection and longevity were stronger though, it is weaker than TF TL.",01/22/17 13:45,GustaveTheNose

The initial blast is addicting, you get punched in the nose with a beautifully blended fresh citrus, green petit grain and delicately sweet rose...WOW!...yeah...it is magic, to my nose at least. After a while the leather takes center stage as the sweetness stands down only to knit a wonderful, slightly sweet base of smooth woods and leather. From start to finish, this is a winner. 10/10",01/11/17 07:40,noseyboysniffy
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"For me, this is far more of a straight-up leather served with a warmer feel than the comparison to Tom Ford Private Blend Tuscan Leather (although smelling reminded me that I should indulge in the latter more often).

For many, the decision point is more likely preferences:
If you want a very distinct, bold, and uncomplicated leather scent, the AdP Leather should prove very likable. For those wanting a more complex development with saffron and berry notes, Tuscan Leather would be more to your liking. Otherwise, everything you could say about longevity and sillage would be virtually identical for each.

Price, however, is a different story. Edge to the AdP for better value ounce-for-ounce. I honestly like each for what they offer individually. This is well-composed, so anyone wanting a no-nonsense leather scent, look no further.",12/02/16 15:46,Scentrist

After a short wearing causes an effect similar to a brain explosion!

And (oh my God!) - in this odd but subtle scent blossomed rose... Dark, velvety and tart! Citrus? ... What are you talking about?! ... Everyone need to try it!

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée by Acqua di Parma had been on my ""want list"" for a few months. To me, this scent is waaaaay better than Tuscan Leather. That's just my skin opinion, ok? With the top notes of Brazilian orange, Sicilian lime, the heart notes of rose and petit grain from Paraguay, then base notes of leather, Atlas cedar and guaiac wood from Paraguay, this scent makes me happy, comfortable, and artistic. It's like a calming drug, too. I can't sense the lime or orange in the opening, but everything is so very well blended and strongly reminds me of my old soft and worn out leather jacket with the faint smell of the array of perfume throughout the years still present. It does have a nice depth to it, not as dry as Tuscan Leather, but warm and dewy, in a comforting way. This is another of those true unisex fragrances that can easily go both ways.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"It is natural to compare this to Tuscan Leather - being what is considered by many to be the quintessential leather fragrance.

I consider the leather note in this fragrance to be indistinguishable from Tom Ford. However, that is where the similarities end. TFTL, by comparison, is a sweeter scent - like a spoonful of honey is viscous and sweet on the tongue, TL is like that on the nose.

This ADP does not share that sweet, sticky texture. It is a drier feel - like might be expected from a fragrance with a strong tobacco note. However, if you are as partial to leather in a fragrance as I am, then this is no less intoxicating.

I get only the faintest whiff of the woods when not trying to pick them, and hardly any citrus (despite some differing reviews - perhaps a failure on my part). I do seek out the leather in this though, so the rest may be purely atmosphere to my brain.

I would also consider this to be a good example of how TFTL is a unisex fragrance (which took me some time to accept). It is far clearer when compared to a drier leather like this one.

For any men considering TFTL but unsure about the price tag - this is definitely something to consider. It is not especially cheap, but it is, by comparison, cheaper.",04/11/16 02:17,Maddino

Colonia Leather has a very strange sour smell, maybe it was because of the citrus note maybe not, but Tuscan Leather certainly does not have this weird smell, Tuscan Leather mainly combined suede note with a light normal leather note and has a quite powdary and velvet touch, while the leather note in Colonia Leather is only sour and bitter.It made me feel very uncomfortable.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"A very feminine, simple and linear fragrance. You would be better served by a can of Impulse.

It smells like you're walking between the handbags and perfume counter in a department store.

Initial application gives white musk type flowery notes, citrus and leather. This is how it stays until the leather and citrus disappears a couple of hours later leaving only the flowery skin scent.

Uncomplicated, uninspiring and generic. I don't understand any comparisons to Colonia Intensa Oud as they are completely different animals.

Hard to say anything positive about this except the leather smells realistic whilst it lasts.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"1. I was relieved to find it dissimilar to Tuscan Leather (maybe after 4 hrs, or on paper).
2. I don't know if I can call this ""citrus"" at any point; it's like a lemon/lime without the zesty freshness nor the fruity sweetness, while not so bitter either... What is that?
3. It's actually quite smokey! Based on the notes listed I can only assume it's the guaiac wood, since there's no tobacco or incense.

Overall it's pretty well rounded; no sharp edge but not boring, easy to wear in most occasions, masculine and even dark and sexy (yet slightly refreshing); better than Tuscan Leather and its clones",12/13/15 05:45,Calvini

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Leather is the second chronologically of the Acqua di Parma concentree line, and the second I've tried, and is a very strong leather entry in the limited world of leather fragrances that I've sampled.

Comparisons to Tom Ford Tuscan Leather are more than appropriate, given the pairing of a traditional leather smell and the Colonia smell of citrus (I even get some neroli, though it is not listed in the note breakdown).

Colonia Leather is more citrus, Tuscan Leather is more of a varied fruity smell (i.e. berries), but Colonia Leather still has some sweetness of its own. It's worth to try both to compare, though admittedly, Colonia Leather is about half the price ($166 for 100ml on FragranceNet vs. about $300 for 100ml TL through most retail). Surely that comes down to price.

I'd argue that Colonia Leather might be redundant enough with Coach Leatherware No. 3, which is now discontinued but I managed to locate a couple of months ago, as even Leatherware No. 3 is a similar essential expression of leather with some citrus and woody aspects.

Performance-wise, it's certainly stronger than most Acqua di Parma offerings, both from the Colonia and Blu lines, and is probably the strongest I've tried in terms of both projection and longevity, on par with Colonia Ambra (I still need to try Colonia Oud). However, Colonia Leather isn't as strong as Tuscan Leather, and in that respect is a little easier to wear on a year-round basis.

Very strong, versatile leather fragrance. Highly and frequently wearable but also refined enough to dress up and keep as a fragrance for special occasions. I highly recommend trying this out, as despite lacking the Tuscan Leather reputation, I imagine that many will find this better.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"This is everything I was looking for in tuscan leather. It is just a stunningly beautiful fragrance.

I get this beautiful, smooth leather handbag at the opening. Whereas this is smooth and creamy, tuscan leather is harsh and brash! Not saying I dislike TL, i just find it too abrasive. This is softened by a citrus blend that takes it down a path that differs completely from Tuscan leather.

Then, the most interesting thing happens with this frag. When it starts to dry down I get his bubblegum feel to it? I have heard of a fragrance called bubblegum chic, I used to go wtf? Who would make a bubblegum fragrance and call it luxury?

Well this perfume's drydown makes me understand that bubblegum accord in a truly luxurious way! it is bizarre but rather beautiful! This is a masterpiece!

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"ADP Colonia Leather is a clean, soft leather. Mostly Citrus and leather notes with Guaiac wood. Projection is a bit on the softer side but then ADP frags arent meant for Montale type projection. Longevity is really good,around the 7-8 hour mark on me which is fine since I mostly use this for formal events in the night. Goes great with a dark suit and tie. Slightly on the expensive side but worth it in my book. You need a lighter leather like this in your wardrobe for the days and occasions when Tuscan leather, Godolphin, or La Yuqawam might be too heavy.

Personally though, as much as am in awe of this stuff, I think i prefer the smoky somewhat animalic pungency of especially La yuqawam and maybe T.F Tuskan leather.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"(THIS REVIEW WAS PENNED A WHILE AGO WHEN THIS CAME OUT.)

I've Been waiting to try this for ages! Took so long for stores to get it that I actually stopped looking and forgot about it to an extent.
The reason I was anticipating this so much was due to my love of leather fragrances and my hope that this would be the holy grail...and is it?
Well, sort of? It is and it isn't...
Reason being the opening was stunning, really great, rich, opulent almost dark, slightly smoky leather. When I say 'leather' I do mean an accurate and stunning leather note.
So far so good you might think and you'd be right it's worthy of praise but then starts to change into familiar territory.
By this I'm talking TF Tuscan leather and Clive Christian C complete with raspberry note and all...again not a criticism, C is one of my absolute favourite fragrances and I've extensively tested Tuscan leather (which I controversially said is not as good) so I like to think I know what I'm talking about here.
In fact I think this is less complex than C more toward Tuscan leather but still very complex and different to both in the most subtle way. It tightropes between smelling like an accurate leather, maybe even a hint of citrus, something slightly more soapy and cleaner then back to CC C/TF TL.
Now I have Oud concentree and that has epic longevity and obnoxious silage on my skin, almost to the point of it being too much even for me to wear and I was expecting the same from this juice.
Don't get me wrong here the performance of this juice is very good and way, way up there. Silage and trail are pretty massive for the first few hours but doesn't quite have the godlike longevity status of Clive Christian C....nor is it as heady and complex, magical or even 'harsh' for want of a better word.",10/25/15 15:25,Houdini4
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Oh man...this is one of those scents that hits my olfactory system just right and renders me stupid with pleasure; the pleasure I derive from this scent feels almost criminal. That's my subjective experience. More objectively, this stuff smells like leather, delivered to the nose with a texture that's somehow both tart and velvety. It shares a lot of similarities to Tuscan Leather, but lacks TL's histrionics. TL smells really, really good; Colonia Leather makes me rapturous and weak in the knees.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful!

But tricky sillage. I find that it stays VERY close to the skin in cooler temperatures. When my skin warms up, the scent comes back. A bit softer than I'd like it to be.

Some people have compared this to Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather, and I can see why. There is definitely a similarity here, but a little toned down. I also find it sharing similarities with La Yuqawam Homme. But Colonia Leather is on a slightly higher level. Just a bit more character and certainly a MUCH finer presentation. Colonia Leather comes in an exquisite satin lined box with faux hinged lid, and the bottle itself exudes luxury. More so than Tom Ford, IMHO.

I'm not in a hurry to buy a full bottle of this, though. I'll have to live with it for a while longer, but for the time being Yuqawam Homme has enough of the same accord to keep me satisfied.",04/23/15 13:43,cytherian

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather is one of my favorite scents. It is listed as a unisex fragrance, but personally I find it very masculine. Colonia Leather, to me, is like a unisex Tuscan Leather. It has that rich and pure leather smell that Tuscan Leather has, but the mandarin and rose really add a softness that I think makes this more appealing to more people, where Tuscan Leather seems more like a love it or hate it kind of fragrance. It also gives it a more unisex touch. I love this scent.

Also, I didn't think I could wear a rich leather scent on a hot day, but this worked beautifully. The citrus adds a freshness to it that also makes it kind of a more versatile Tuscan Leather.",04/13/15 17:42,mhaddad88
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"I decided to try Acqua de Parma leather....this juice is UNBELIEVABLY all leather.

The woodsy base of guaiac gives this juice depth which is untouchable making it ABSOLUTELY SEXY.
Longevity and Silage is excellent lasting over 8hrs...you can pick up the aroma about 2ft away.
Finally thoughts,
I've tried several different version of leather frag's. The top two which I enjoy is either Tom Ford or Acqua de Parma leather. If you want a real attractive leathery blend this juice is worth it.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Eau de Cologne Concentree? EDT? Or maybe lasting power of a parfum but projection and silliage of a cologne?
Marketing ploy? yeah probably the latter.
Anyways the scent.
Since I've smelt and worn TL I've been on a quest to find a similar scent without the raspberry note of TL, it ruins it for me. My wife said it best about TL ""It's like I went out for the night with a man and got so hammered that I came home with a woman""
So this was next on my list. It is very nice, it's the exact same leather as TL but fresher and not so heavy. This can be worn year round easily. But as this dries down something is still unsettling to me. It might be the rose, something is giving me a ""first Aid Kit"" type of smell in there.
Shit.
While I like this better than TL for sure, it's still not my luxury leather scent. On to Montale aoud leather next.

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"The notes that Fragrantica mentioned aren't really all the notes in this fragrance.
I do own a tester bottle and notes are listed behind of the bottle. Let me give everybody the actual note breakdown in this fragrance.

Fragrance Family: Aromatic Leathery

Top Note: Brazil Orange Oil, Lemon from Sicily, Raspberry Accord

Heart Note: Hungry Red Thyme Oil, Honeysuckle Accord, Paraguay Petitgrain Oil, Rose Accord.

Base Note: Leather Accord, Morocco Atlas Cedarwood Oil, Paraguay Guaiac Oil.

My honest review:
This is very nice fragrance first of all. Opens up with some citrus, sweet citrus that almost gives you fruity feeling. Leather opens up at the first spray but It gave me a suede scent feeling and I noticed that it is because of the citrus. Citrus made it feel like suede. After 10 minutes, citrus gone away and leather became more dirty as I like. This fragrance carries Raspberries as the Tuscan Leather does but I can feel the raspberry more in this one comparing the Tuscan Leather. Following overs, it doesn't chance alot and keeps this fruity leather for 10 hours. Longevity is great but projection is bad, After 2 hours it gets close to skin. But this factor makes this fragrance more versatile. Dark fragrances like this can not be worn all the time but because of it is close to skin, it is great for every time wear.

Comparing to Tuscan leather and there are many more fragrances that is similar to it. They can be compared by longevity and projection maybe even price point. This is a good one at the price point of $220 retail. The quality you get is almost the same as Tuscan Leather. You spent more for TL and get 50ml comparing to here 100ml.

This is my opinion after all. This is a buy for me. All the way...",02/08/15 17:11,buraktemiz93

Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Leather - Chic Fresh leather

Having tried their colonia oud and loved it, I had good expectations from colonia leather. And Acqua di Parma surely did not disappoint.

What I love about this frag is that they've combined the elegance of the colonia dna with the ruggedness of leather.
This is the sort of leather I like - both fresh and dark, with an overall softness yet being full bodied in its nature.
It is utterly chic and smooth in it's approach and represents the class of ADP.

Fresh Citrus-y opening with a floral leather behind it. Screams quality from the first sniff. It feels quite airy and transparent at first, which then becomes a little heavier with the leather creeping up. It feels like a wet fresh leather, with some woody undertone - the overall result is truly splendid. The elegant leather then takes centre-stage and the little florals linger on in the background.. this is what remains till the end.

If you ask me, I love it's overall structure.. neither too harsh nor too soft, very sophisticated and alluring in it's demeanour. I also get reminded of the core of colonia intensa (their colonia ones) which is what supports the overall notes.

Great performance, around 10 hours with 3 sprays.. a nice scent bubble around you without being too heavy. This isn't as beastly as the colonia oud, but it packs a good punch in itself. In terms of versatility, one can wear this all year round, preferably so during spring and autumn.

Marvelous creation ADP! Can't wait for the next release in this series.",01/25/15 23:23,Me.Teejay
Colonia Leather Eau de Cologne Concentrée Acqua di Parma,"In the same vein of the Oud, Acqua di Parma has created a fresh leather. While it might sound unusual pairing leather with citruses, the result is very nice.

In the opening I get a minty accord that goes with the citruses. The leather is there, shy at the first spray, but becoming stronger and stronger by the minute, and the overall feeling is of an airy and bright leather. Like how they did with the oud, the leather is clean, not stinky. The end of the fragrance brings the woods to the surface and, in the AdP style, this is another classy gentleman's colonia.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Fragrantica says this resembles Eau de Magnolia, but in truth, smelling this feels much like looking at a photograph of something you once loved—recognizable, and equally distant. To my nose, the citrus here is clearer and more upfront, but it sorta lacks that kinetic, almost windswept quality which is precisely what makes Malle’s feel so alive.

And the magnolia: it's silky, smooth, a little milky, and admittedly pretty. But pretty in the way a quiet, careful kind of portrait, one that never dares to unfold beyond safe, clean lines, is—pretty indeed. But not yet beautiful. Here, you aren't appreciating at the type of magnolia which catches fluid beams of sunlight in its buttery petals, not the type with fresh air moving through its crisp yet lush green leaves. Rather. You're simply observing one feels like it’s been plucked and resin-coated for display, glossy but not creamy, preserved in its aesthetics but motionless beyond the surface.

It’s nice. Completely inoffensive, and a much better alternative to the same house's Magnolia Infinita. Look for magnolia in Nobile, and it'll manage you a decently crafted one at the very least. But hold a bloom with true purity, true presence, and you'll find yourself struggling to settle for something that only mimics it.",02/06/25 21:33,luvoxlixir

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Citrus Cologne-Like & Creamy-Waxy Magnolia...

First Impression: now this would be the type of magnolia scent I would expect from Acqua di Parma - citrus-y magnoiia with a strong cologne vibe. Opens with a bright & sunny citrus burst featuring citron, but already the white floral tones are coming through with a cologne/perfume-y vein running through. The magnolia here has a waxiness that falls short of marshmallow or bubblegum, and leans more to Sunlight bar-soap mixed with perfume (it's also more faint than I would have liked, but this might be improved with a stored/aged full bottle). Earthy & woody tones in the base serve as anchor points for the bright bouquet. The citrus if very forward here, and tilts the composition to a citrus-cologne-tinged-with-magnolia, more than a magnolia-tinged-with-citrus, although this spin fits the Acqua di Parma branding. I just have a tester but the performance is slightly above average for a citrus-floral, and it's a gorgeous citrus-cologne & magnolia scent. This may not have been the magnolia I thought I was looking for but it's become a favourite, and for what it is, it's a love for me. Enjoy!

Contrast to Splendida Magnolia Sensuel Bvlgari:
This is brighter and more citrus-cologne forward than Splendida Magnolia Sensuel Bvlgari, although they've been compared and have a similar vibe of citrus-magnolia, going through similar gyrations, with some patchouli in the base.

Update: I've come back to this one and it keeps growing on me... so much that it's probably my favourite magnolia right now... creamier & fluffier than my first impression, with a bit of sparkle in the citrus top notes. Totally addictive.",02/12/24 17:09,suzanne_ronald
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"very citrus-heavy with an undertone of floral; i'm not really getting any vanilla. it's definitely quite fresh but also a very standard scent; i feel like i've smelt it before in other perfumes. although i enjoy it enough to think it definitely smells good, i don't think it's particularly sophisticated or complex in its DNA. it's somewhat similar to elizabeth arden's green tea; both are a bit soapy. i can see this being a beautiful summer beach scent or even a post-shower bedtime scent. i'm not sure if i would repurchase and it's not worth the price for me personally, but it does smell like something a rich woman would wear; i bet it's a compliment-getter for others",02/02/24 09:34,marshmallowmami

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Magnolia Nobile is another excellent floral scent from Acqua Di Parma. I was very taken with Rosa Nobile, and can appreciate Peonia Nobile, despite it not being my thing. Magnolia Nobile is, predictably, magnolia-dominant. This creamy, sweet-but-fresh flower strikes a lovely balance between light and lush, but is too often relegated to the background. Here, it is firmly centre-stage, but complemented to perfection by other well-chosen notes.

MN opens with magnolia, initially slightly aquatic. There is a lovely lemon note up top, complementing it to perfection. In this way, the freshness of the magnolia flower is showcased initially.

As it develops, the floral heart emerges, with the other notes serving to complement the magnolia. Powdery, clean jasmine and soft, dewy rosewater-like rose are evident alongside the increasingly lush, creamy magnolia. I don't get any tuberose. Some patchouli adds a little earthiness, predictable but pleasant.

There is a soft woodiness to the drydown thanks to the dry vetiver note. A hint of powdery vanilla adds subtle sweetness to the tail end of this scent, and it becomes sweetly musky as it fades to a skin scent, remaining transparent. Sillage is moderate and longevity is long-lasting.

A fresh, citrus-led floral with just the right amount of sweetness, MN is an elegant, feminine spring/summer scent. Unremarkable on the surface, it is beautifully composed magnolia-centred floral made with good-quality ingredients. Effortlessly elegant and an easy reach on warm days, this is a cut above the myriad safe fresh floral designer offerings on the market. 4/5.",06/29/23 15:07,Enrium

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Undoubtedly a beautiful scent on my vegetarian skin. A citrus opening but with plenty of magnolia as well. It rings like a beautiful olfactory bell. Bright, vivacious and very classy. A shame about the slight chemical like backdrop.
There is something very Annick Goutal about this lovely. Expensive and very Continental.
Well blended but there is not much depth to it.
One to wear on days when you want to feel special. Your best outfit on.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"As another reviewer has noted, this reminds me of 5th AVenue, only prettier and more about magnolia than lily of the valley. It has a lemon-magnolia opening and then a perfume-y-white floral theme. The perfume-y bit seems to me lovely but less desirable than my ultra favorite in this category: Jessica McClintock! If Magnolia Nobile is a soliflore with other flowers in the base, J. M. is her younger, less serious sister who is not a soliflore! I like 5th Avenue, but it goes in a soured lily direction on me. Jessica Mcclintock does not. She is stunning, as is Magnolia Nobile. Nobile's take on Magnolia immediately strikes me as a mature white floral which is also classic. If I were to compare it to JM, it seems older. Both are classics, however, and both appeal to those who like 'perfume that IS perfume'.

Not recommended as a blind buy but a true delight to sample. <3",04/26/23 11:09,drugstore classics

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Today is my first day of wearing this. I am very pleasantly surprised. I've been looking for a good magnolia that includes a bit of lemon. There are lots of magnolias throughout the world, (note the number of pink blossoms in the photos) but the one I grew up with is the huge, creamy white blossom with a hint of lemon at the center. It's been very elusive as a perfume. Magnolia Nobile is very close. I love that it opens with an array of citrus notes. I wish the middle notes were stronger on magnolia, but the floral blend is pleasing, nonetheless. I have to admit I have resprayed twice today before I fully allowed the base notes to develop, so I can't really speak to the transition. I hesitated to wear this today because it's very cold outside. I shouldn't have worried. This is a great cold weather perfume. I can see it turning into a year-round favorite.",01/03/22 08:27,Ticketgirl
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is nice, but a bit too proper and composed for my personal preferences. It has a particular rich person out for the day doing nothing in particular kind of vibe, but not in a fun or carefree way. I do like the way this has blended floral and citrus, it has an interesting progression that oscillates between citrusy and flowery and overall it hits perfectly in between citrus versus floral typing in a very nice way. I think you could wear this comfortably going out with your coworkers or extended relatives and be sure to make a good impression and not offend anyone’s scent preferences.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"A lovely, nice, feminine frag from Acqua di Parma. I am a fan of the house.
It is an elegant scent, very feminine (very different from Iris Nobile!)
Starts off citrusy & fresh - very pleasant, to discover a warm heart of Jamsine and magnolia - a note that i don't particularly love but here it is not too overpowering.

The best in this scent is the creamy/woody drydown, very cozy, very feminine.
A perfect, classy scent for fall-winter.
I wish it had a tad more of staying power, though, seen the price they sell it (and it never goes on sale).

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,Timeless elegance in a bottle – the zesty opening settles into a velvety floral-vanilla and everything is so so mellow.

The result is a magnificent fragrance that never fails to garner compliments.,07/10/21 09:43,FabulouslyLazy
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"At first, it is a fresh and floral feminine scent, full of magnolia and citruses. As time goes on, I can smell the tuberose, vetiver, and hints of vanilla. It’s such a pleasant smell for anyone who’s a fan of floral scents, but beware, at first it is strong and I, as someone who is not huge on flowery smells, thought it was overpowering.

The sillage at first is fairly moderate, and it smells strong. The longevity is of about 6 hours. The value tho, is not that great. It’s overpriced. 150 USD for 50 ml? That’s too much, even if it smells good, as after 3 hours, the sillage is fairly intimate.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"My fragrance journey has started late in life, and after years of wearing D&G The One almost exclusively, I've started changing it up. The idea of mimosa and citrus was very appealing, and the rave reviews here made me choose this as one of my first experiments.

Let's just say that I don't get it. Maybe I got a bad bottle? It smelled like straight chemicals on the first spray, very biting and sharp. Then it was pure raving citrus, no florals, and after about an hour, no smell at all. On the second try it was much the same, and still no florals to speak of. Today is my third try, and it was less chemically, but still nearly pure citrus, and almost completely faded by the time I made it to my desk downstairs.

I'm shocked, and I'm going to have to try a tester somewhere now that I can go out again because my experience with this doesn't NOT match up with any of the reviews here.",05/25/21 09:10,Polly Esther

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"After finishing a sample of this and then really missing it once I'd used it up I ended up buying a bottle, this is the second time in 2 years that I've had a real craving for a scent like that so this really did make an impression on me.

Magnolia Nobile is a happy scent, its sophisticated and grown up without feeling heavy, stuffy/mature and without feeling immature at the same time. The opening is citrussy and bright with citron, bergamot and lemon popping out initally before starting to settle down to a citrussy magnolia musk, I can detect some patchouli for the first 30 minutes which then subsides, a wonderful vanilla/sandalwood combination is also present in the background which adds some creaminess to the drydown and takes away some of the sharpness from the citrus notes.

This really puts a smile on my face whenever I spray it on, it reminds me of a strong boss lady, but shes kind, caring and happy but at the same time when she means business, she MEANS business and will not suffer fools gladly, so whilst this is a happy, summer scent it really does have some backbone and makes me feel pulled together. This would be excellent in an office, formal spring/summer events as well as for casual wear during the warmer months. It kind of reminds me of a longer lasting version of Clinique Happy.

Longevity is excellent with 7hrs of wear from 3 sprays and a moderate silage which is pleasant but does not intrude or offend (unless you're really heavy handed on the sprayer, in which case anything can become offensive and harsh)
100ml repurchase worthy, signature worthy, a PERFECT scent!",04/17/21 05:34,GinCatsBooks
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"On dry-down this scent reminds me of the North Woods in the early summer. Linden and birch trees. It's much less heady than I anticipated and sharper. I see some mentions of lemon below and I understand why - it does have an almost bitter (NOT unpleasant) edge to it. I got good longevity but poor sillage. In any case, since this reminds me of late spring/early summer by the lake, it will be a keeper as a scent memory, but not sure I'd want to smell like this as my scent.",04/08/21 02:28,CindyLouHoo

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,I absolutely looove this perfume! ❤️ Anybody who looks at my favourites and perfumes that I own can easily figure out that I relly like fresh citric scents and this one is just like fresh Positano lemons in a bottle!

Beautiful scent!,03/28/21 11:24,Mademoiselle B
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This one embraces the same classical, floral-centered spirit you can find in the other ""nobile"" offerings, yet, it seems to have a distant linkage with the ""colonia"" range for its notable citric-herbal (underline the word herbal), and slightly woodsy cologne background. It's mature and classic, and I also find it fancy. It could be elegant during the summer days along chic sundresses or shirt dresses, especially for tranquil personalities. It could also work as a successful mother's day gift. The Magnolia begins waxy and posh, but ends up in the last dry-down phase to soapy and mild when it's dying. Beautiful indeed, with acceptable performance.",03/14/21 01:24,perfume_infatuated
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"So so beautiful! It's not a soliflore so if you expect a true magnolia you would probably be disappointed. It's very lemony but not too fresh. More like the rind of lemon, paired with pretty magnolia notes. It has a heaviness to it, something with weight, maybe vetiver? Very natural. Luxiourious but effortless. It's very grown up but imo would smell wrong in too serious settings. I would personally only wear this in warm weather and dressed in my most feminine clothing, otherwise I wouldn't feel comfortable. To me it has quite a sillage for being a citrus-floral!",03/12/21 08:02,astrakan
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,This is so pretty. My grandmother had a magnolia tree in her backyard when I was growing up. It is probably why I love magnolia. This starts with an intense blast of citrus but give it a minute and this beautiful magnolia comes out.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I try not to read the spoilers when I have a fragrance to test. This one had the word magnolia in the name, so it was hard to avoid expectations. Therefore I was a little surprised by an initial impression of spice and bitter citrus. This is not a simple sweet floral - a big plus for me, especially now that the weather is getting cold.

The citrus remains strong on dry-down, but the gentler magnolia also comes to the fore. It's a really interesting and unexpected combination.

I don't get any of the soapiness or bright lemon other testers mention. The citrus is less bright than bitter (in a good way) to my nose, but I can't really pull out any one citrus note.

After a few hours, all that is left is a very light magnolia scent.

I like it, but I'm not sure when I would wear it.",12/08/20 09:01,RhodeC
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I’m not a fan of citrus dominate fragrances, but this is cute to me. The magnolia in this kind of reminds me of toiletry items or maybe even lotion. The bright and sunny citrus stops it from fully going into that territory. I feel like i have to be in a smiling mood to wear this. It really is like a magnolia lemonade.

I think how one wears this determines if this is a mature scent or not. This would be totally appropriate on someone wearing southern prep aka Lilly or going to a garden party. It would smell elegant, but youthful in those situations. I think in a dark business suit it would come across more mature. I only feel that way because this is not a serious fragrance",09/08/20 12:52,danygurl06

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Trying out a small sample of this perfume right now. I've worn it all day twice now, before making my mind up to write a review. This scent embodies the words ""beautiful"" and ""elegant"" for me. It reminds me of something my mother would wear to church or for special occasions. My mother is beautiful and she always smells absolutely lovely, but I'm not sure I want to smell exactly like her. I prefer fresh, energizing, uplifting, clean scents. This is rich, grounded, and, as other reviewers mentioned, somewhat opulent and quite old-fashioned. Gonna give my sample to my mom and if she likes it (which I am almost certain she will) may get her a full bottle. It is definitely full bottle worthy--but more something she can always keep in her collection and wear for those unique occasions.

For me: maybe 3/10 (lovely, but just not my style)
For mom: 8/10 (a great fit)

P.S. When I say ""rich""...I really do mean rich. Two sprays of this is filling the room up right now, and as much as it is a beautiful scent, I'm kind of getting a headache. So be easy on the nozzle.",05/11/20 10:57,nisha2988

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I chose this for a frag subscription. My thoughts:

While the Magnolia in this isn't what I would necessarily call ""True"", it is unmistakably Magnolia. I think it blends nicely with the other notes, and remains present throughout the entire wear.

This is THE high society southern belle, in a bottle.

Ultimately, not for me. I'm not her. I will hold on to the 7 ml I have, and probably wear it someday to see my Grandma, at church. Otherwise, I have no clue when I would be moved to put this on, even though I think it's very pretty and classic.

***Edit:
welp, I found the proper occasions for Magnolia Nobile. I recently wore this for my beloved Grandfather's funeral service. It was perfect for the occasion, and I found it even comforting. Even received a compliment from my auntie. ;) Glad it was there to reach for, that day.",02/25/20 12:22,TxTizzy
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I originally dismissed this fragrance as a bit ""meh"" - kind of smelt it before or not my taste. I do this a lot with samples. But then months later I'll come back to it and smell it in a completely new light. That's what happened here.

I'm not a fan of magnolia as a singular note (Frederic Malle's version is just too naturalistic for me). This is why I think this fragrance blend works so well. I love the crisp lemon and balance from the other florals.

It is by no means just delegated as a summer scent because of its heavy citrus, this can be worn all year round and would be quite exquisite in winter.

There's something incredibly elegant about it, it is the white floral-citrus mix I've been after for so long - usually this kind of perfume is ruined by orange blossom but there is absolutely none here thank goodness.",01/07/20 16:03,marinaw90
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I grew up in Mississippi, ""The Magnolia State."" I played in old civil war era magnolia trees as a child. Trust me, I know this flower. Magnolia Nobile captures SOME of the magnolia essence but not all. They nailed the lemony, watery elements. However on dry down, it lacks grounding and depth, and should be more indolic.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"It may be the middle of July, but I think I found my summer fragrance! This is so fresh and zesty from the citron and lemon, but still soft and romantic from the magnolia. I get bits of vetiver that keep it on the greener side as opposed to the waxy aspects of magnolia, and just a touch of sandalwood in the base that keeps the fragrance grounded. It is definitely sophisticated, and true to its Italian heritage. I think it's ageless and easy to wear, though it might feel more appropriate to those over 25 and a bit more worldly. I think it is an excellent choice for those who have decided to break away from some of the achingly sweet gourmands out there and want to move on into a more adult fragrance. It's a love and will be trying her jasmine sister next!

EDIT - Oh no!! After wearing this for a full day I discovered that I am not getting any of the longevity others seem to be getting! Less than 30 minutes after spraying generously, the scent had all but vanished. Curious to see if I was experiencing some anosmia, I asked others if they could smell it on my, and they could only detect a faint trace when sniffing hard on my wrist and neck. I need to find a way to make this work for me! It is just too beautiful to not wear, and too expensive to respray every half hour!

On me it´s very delicate, beautiful, ellegant, soft, pure and more sweet than citrus notes appear...some girls complained that they felt too much citrusses, I don´t feel any - but my ph does it always with fragrances :)) on me everything smells sweet, event the freshest colognes, that´s why I must be careful about too heavy vanilla fragrances...but this one is just beautiful...like home..like love...like romantic evening with the hint of wind colored by magnolia...
I wish it could last longer, cause for that price it deserves it...",10/03/18 04:21,Stella Bu
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"As a rule, I'm not very drawn to white florals - I have nothing against them, but they just don't excite me: especially now that my collection has grown enough to make priorities indispensable, even the ones I admire a lot very rarely make it onto my wishlist after sampling. Magnolia Nobile falls into that category as well: I enjoyed my sample very much, more than I thought I would, but it doesn't make my heart beat any faster, so I doubt I'll ever need more of it.

It is a luscious scent, though, so happy and mellow! Another reviewer on this page calls it a Goldilocks kind of fragrance, and that's exactly right: it's extremely well-balanced, super comfortable. It's not too much of anything: not too unsubstantial or overwhelming, not too sweet or too bright, not too soapy or too powdery. Classy! The lemon note especially is lovely: delicious and soft, with a little sweetness to it that keeps it from making the magnolia too sharp or too sour. I had to use more sprays than I usually do, but when I did projection was just right as well, at least for a couple of hours. Longevity is about as good as can be expected from a composition like this.

I only wish I had tested this in spring, because I'm starting to long for fall and sweeter scents after this long summer, but that's neither here nor there really. All in all, I'm impressed as always by Acqua di Parma.",08/30/18 10:35,dsty
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Yes, this is acceptable. Of all the free samples I got today by chatting up salespeople in John Lewis, this is probably the least insufferably boring. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not outstanding, but the blend is very finely balanced and (on my skin) the citrus really sings through the petals in a way you don't often encounter. Nice summer scent, not overly sweet.",07/25/18 14:21,kayqin
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Like many others, I wish that this was longer lasting. I haven't lived near a magnolia tree in years, but this instantly transported me to the smell of them in full bloom.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Citrus accord? yes; but be patient, the citrus calms down just a little within aprox. 30 min.

This is exactly how magnolia grandiflora smells (citrus note included.) Go outside, find a grandiflora tree. Yes the one with the big white flower! You'll see... this is simply GORGEUS.

I know it's price is high, but so is the quality. I find Magnolia Nobile has much more projection/sillage (in my case moderate) than for example: Guerlain's Aqua Allegoria line, Prada's Infusion line, or Hermes' Jardin line.

It also has more longevity (in my case moderate). All other fragrances just mentioned, except Infusion d'Iris, turn into a skin scent for me rather quickly, in about 2 to 3 hours. While Magnolia Nobile continues to project approximately 4 to 5 hours, and it lives longer as a skin scent.

So, I say enjoy it! This to me, is the perfect spring/summer fragrance.",05/20/17 21:40,anilinam
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Amazing quality. A full blast of magnolia combined with richness, creaminess and something pleasantly green and real to tie the delivery together.

Wonderful floral, that magnolia is so soft and sweet. This is a really motherly scent, it reminds me of summer at the end of my mother's bed, massaging her feet with the window open and the smell of flowers coming in with the cooling breeze. It’s really something personal here, very nostalgic. There are citrus notes too, but they are light and overall the perfume unfortunately fades quickly. 8/10",03/22/17 13:27,bintTapputi

So it's not a magnolia solo- who cares? I can't believe there are negative reviews of this perfume. It is not my go-to, but how could anyone dislike this? it is the freshest, zingiest, yet softly floral marvel of a perfume that smells nothing short of a glorious no-clouds-in-sight summer day in Capri! It is the best pick me up for those dull days when you think, why can't I be done with this day already.

at the beginning the bergamot and lemons explode (with elegance, I must add, this is no cheap scent), then the flowers seep in from both sides.if you are patient, you will be able to pick out all the gentle flowers that follow.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I came upon this one at Saks by chance, liked it in the bottle, then liked it on paper, then loved it on my skin. I walked around the mall for several hours to see how this fragrance aged on my skin--still loved it, and bought it. I've never made a perfume decision that quickly.

The citrus top notes mix beautifully with the white flowers beneath. The jasmine is divine. Like umsultan below, I also pick up the lily of the valley.

It smells like my parent's green room when the orange flowers and jasmines are in bloom. This fragrance is not soapy, not very sweet, not musky. Nothing tacky and overblown in this composition. It's tasteful. I just love it.

Update: The more I use it, I'm finding that I'm conscious all day of a heavy licorice-like note, and the citrus that I thought I picked up when I first tried it is no longer a note to my nose. Still a lovely floral scent.",03/19/16 20:00,Stella-Maris2
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I just got my mini sample of this. impression: Love at first sniff. i Love floral perfumes. but its hard to find the perfect floral these days, floral perfumes are either soapy or candied. this one, although many says its more citrus-y than floral. i dunno! yes, its fresh like summer fruits. but to my nose first thing i smell is magnolia then tuberose. and on my skin i can even smell lily of the valley!(although its not written there) its so fresh and i can tell this is made with high quality ingredients, the notes blends very well. this is my first experience with Acqua di Parma perfumes. I cant wait to test other perfumes from this brand.",01/31/16 06:53,umsultan
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"The opening of Magnolia Nobile is indeed very lemony, which fits the 'cologne' aesthetic of Acqua di Parma. The lemon is not aggressive to my nose. It feels kind of powdery, but not dry or overly juicy. It's almost like fine yellow crystals shimmering in the sunlight.

The magnolia languorously enters the scene. At first, it's mingled with the citrus, as the later enhances the watery lemony aspect of magnolia. Later on, as the citrus gradually steps aside, the magnolia takes on a slightly waxy texture while remaining transparent, as if I'm sniffing the redolence among the fleshy petals of magnolia.

The fragrance eventually becomes a silky skin scent of white floral after about 5 hours. Except for a faint trace of tuberose and jasmine, I'm unable to discern other notes clearly, especially the base notes, but I'm sure that they help to ground the white floral discreetly, unlike some overwhelming white musk.

The sillage is relatively soft and the longevity is around 9 hours. Magnolia Nobile is arguably quite simple in structure, but executed beautifully. It may not be the most realistic rendition of magnolia, but both the watery lemony and waxy aspects are present, and it's more like an artistic representation of magnolia, bright but not blinding, as if the magnolia is seen through a pale gold lens. Classy, elegant and feminine, yet in an effortless manner and somehow laid back, I'd definitely recommend it as a versatile citrus-floral fragrance.",07/30/15 13:57,StellaDiverFlynn
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Fresh, light, lively, crisp and juicy citrusy white floral! Great for summer and heat. The first blast and you get tons of citruses, then magnolia, then it settles into classy white floral. The citrus stays noticeable to the end. This one is high quality, well blended with freshness, sweet and bitter notes and juicy citrus. Compared to Acqua di Parma Acqua Nobile Magnolia EDT this one has much better sillage and longevity.",07/26/15 09:50,oks-oks
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I've tried Magnolia Nobile quite a few times now. My experience with this perfume is so different from everyone's that I'm not sure what's going on... but I get a big, big magnolia straight from the beginning. This magnolia is not sweet, but loud. I also smell jasmine and strong tuberose which makes it even more floral. Citron is light, and to my nose it doesn't blend well with magnolia. No rose, no vetiver.

This whole fruity flowery mess dries down to a shampoo/hairspray type of scent on me and is not very attractive. Longevity is a good 7 hours and projection 2-3 feet. From the pungency of scent I assume this is a high quality perfume, but it's a bit too much and I feel like I'm invading into other people's personal space when I wear it. This is disappointing because I love Iris Nobile and thought this would smell as great. Good that I only have a 20ml spray.

Pichola by Neela Vermeire is a perfume with similar style, but much better development on me. I recommend checking that out too if you think Magnolia Nobile is your cup of tea. I like Pichola, but Magnolia Nobile is sadly a pass.",06/03/15 12:21,pepperoniann
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is not the magnolia I was hoping for. Rather than smelling fresh and creamy like a true magnolia, this is a syrupy fragrance, spiked with a heavy-handed dose of lemon and citron reminiscent of household cleaning products. I love jasmine, but here it overwhelms the magnolia, and the lemon + rose combination makes this almost more like a geranium fragrance, only heavier and not as herbaceous and fresh. If you are searching for a magnolia soliflore, keep looking. Magnolia Nobile has too much going on to do justice to the flower it's named for.",03/25/15 11:44,hbomb9410
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I've waited too long to review on Fragrantica, a website I love!

Came upon this fragrance during a 2012 trip to Epcot Center in Orlando. Stumbled across the display at the Italy or Venice area and was over-taken...immediately in-love. Do you know that heady, over-whelming, wonderful olfactory sensation one experiences when entering a high-end parfumerie or a unique & spell-binding candle-shop in a tiny European town or Big American City? THAT is what got me...those fragrances...that fragrance...it was instant love.

Magnolia Nobile begins with loads of citrus, which I normally dislike...I do not like fragrances with strong, opening citrus notes. After settling in and simmering down a bit, the magic of Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile begins! The more this fragrance settles down and remains on the skin, the finer it becomes! Staying power is great...silage is super, too. A little does the job. Over-doing the application can be over-powering. This is a HUGE perfume, a BIG one...not for the shy or meek!

Again, thinking I would dislike such a ""floral"" and citrusy scent, magnolia is dominant; yet the mixture of citrus (lemon & bergamot), floral (rose & jasmine) and woods (amber, musk) make this perfume truly unique.

IMHO, this perfume is very feminine but not trendy or juvenile, not hip or lively. While this doesn't smell like the top drawer of grandma's dresser, I would call this a more mature and ""lady-like"" fragrance...not a fun and playful one. I like the fact that Acqua di Parma does not make dozens of ""trendy"" fragrances; the perfume maker chooses to perfect, develop and modify the ""tried and true"" base and basic notes.

As the Acqua di Parma website states, ""this perfume DOES have a distinct structure that is enriched with surprising notes."" There are opening notes of bergamot, lemon and citron that develop with rose & jasmine. The dry-down is sandalwood, patchouli...a hint of vanilla.

I absolutely love this stuff! It definitely ties as #1 with my other ""go-to"" fragrance, Frederic Malle Musc Ravageur. Completely different fragrances but similar in so many ways",03/13/15 18:34,tonileefiore

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Usually I prefer more complex scents, but this one impressed me to the point that now it`s on my wish list. It opens with citron, and during some 5 or 10 minutes it`s only citron, nothing else. But then the magnolia builds its way in, next come the tuberose (am I the only lucky one here who detects the tuberose so clearly???) together with the jasmine and rose. That`s when it becomes amazing. Sure the citrusy notes remain dominant all the way, but they are so nicely sophisticated floral citrusy notes. It`s fresh but sophisticated, floral but not heady or overwhelming, simple but noble. Sometimes I get tired from all the complex scents I have in my collection, and I wanted something less complex, but it was hard to find something that would satisfy me. This frag = BINGO!

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is a gorgeous gorgeous fragrance. A true magnolia, I checked! Based on the precious magnolia tree my dad brought back from England years ago. I didn't like Iris Nobile but this is another story for me. Just plain gorgeous flora, citrus, a fresh and invigorating scent. Very expensive smelling ( well it does rather reflect its price tag) and the most true magnolia scent I have come across yet. I get a lovely picture and breath of beautiful lush, sunny meadows or woodlands when I first spray this on, then it becomes softer but always stays around, a waft of it drifting up to my nose slowly and languorously every few minutes to reassure me of its longevity. Like other reviewers have said, it starts of rather loud and perky citrus, then mellows and becomes a milky magnolia, tinted with sandalwood. A golden scent from a golden liquid. Just beautiful. I am loving this very much.
I am wearing this for the 2nd day in a row, something I'm not inclined to doing usually as I like to have different scents daily or even during the 24 hours. That shows how enthralled I am with this scent. It's right up there on my upper tier of ""loves"" along with only a select few even though I embrace different types of scents.

The beginning was a bit too sweet for me, and this is not what I look for in a fragrance. I would only wear this in spring/summer, as it is very bright and citrusy, whereas Iris Nobile I can see being worn in the colder months along with the Colonias. Magnolia is gentle and pleasant, the kind of scent that would make you curious if you were sitting next to someone wearing it.",04/06/12 18:25,sunlover

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"DIVINE. This fragrance has nothing but personality. It is multifaceted, and meant for a woman who is the total package. It is exactly what you think it is, and yet not even close. It is interesting. This perfume unfolds various aspects of her personality depending on her mood, the weather, the time of day, the rate of her heartbeats. Sometimes heady and woody, sometimes wet, languid blooms, other times clean, simple, naked, and unapologetic. Lemon tart at high tea? Yes. A bed drenched in blossoms, bruised, raw, and feisty? Yes. Meeting a lover in the fallen leaves of early October? Most definitely.",01/08/12 19:20,stephaniearianne
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"First 15 minutes is all about citrus - then it gets airy and soft and nice flowers appear. This is not a loud scent on my skin but its there all around me. After one hour deep roses appear with a nice splash of patchouli with a hint of vanilla. Next person have to stand close to smell this wonderful grownup flowerscent (not sugarsweet as many modern scents). Sober and classy, I think.

Första kvarten är citrustonerna dominanta, sen blir den luftig och mjuk och blomtonerna kommer fram. Detta är ingen högljudd doft men den finns runt mig. Nästa person behöver stå nära för att känna denna vuxna mjukblommiga doft. Efter en timme framträder rosdoften och en aning av patchouli och vanilj. Inga sötsliskiga dofttoner.

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma MAGNOLIA NOBILE opens as a very high-quality fruity floral, with a strong citrus component, which smells mostly like grapefruit to me. Eventually magnolia rears its delicate petals, but the floral aspect of this composition is heavy on roses and quite light on magnolia for most of its life. In fact, according to my nose this might be better named ROSE NOBILE. Well, except that with the fruitiness it doesn't seem all that noble, either. I certainly would not take issue with the quality of the individual notes, but their synthesis has a pretty familiar ring to it here: inoffensive fruity floral.

All in all, MAGNOLIA NOBILE strikes me as a fairly mainstream creation. But I'm confident that it would make regular wearers of fruity-floral fragrances very happy indeed because it smells, well, swell!",12/05/10 21:01,sherapop
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Such a pretty perfume!

Don't get me wrong - this mid-weight, translucent fruity-floral perfume isn't striking, unusual or radical. But it is so well made that it is simply a joy to wear.

The start on my skin is a refreshing lemon with a distinct peachy note & a fizzy cedar all blended to perfection. A bright & sunny start without being too sharp or too sweet, too light or too heavy, too heady or too weak - a rare, Goldilocks scent!

As the scent settles, the light florals flounce in & out of a damp, dappled wood with a wet patchouli & vetiver base. Magnolia is the star but there is more to this scent - it has a juicy, fruity feel & a playful spring in her step.

It fades out, rather quickly, to a still-water, powdery, gentle soapy-floral waft.

Those who enjoy cheery fruity scents but seek a little class in their scents, or those who are trying to find a citrus-floral that won't cause headache or offense should give MN a try. Jolly nice little pick-me-up.",11/30/10 09:28,sky76sky
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I adore this fragrance. First burst smells really fruity (nothing excessively lemony on me, though),than the magnolias fold.

After an hour it becomes really sexy when the creamy magnolias blend with the vetiver and woody notes.

It is not the loud girly sexiness to attract every male around but the one that is only meant for those we want close.",10/29/10 07:16,adrienn99
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"The first thing that came into my mind when I received the sample tester, was ""wow, a Latin name, I really hope the smell of this one is going to be as great as the name is""

The thing is that I find it like a Mediterranean scent, at the beginning it smells like citruses, lemon or other citrus and some spring flowers. Magnolia Nobile makes me think of my long dreamed of vacation in Italy, a wonderful spring day, sitting on the grass under a magnolia tree and drinking some lemonade and reading some Italian classic writers or poets. Kind and gentle as the balmy Mediterranean wind, Magnolia Nobile is just too quiet for me, too floral. I don't know but this is one of the scents that makes me think of those innocent pretty girls.

A perfume good to wear when you go to the park or the Botanical garden.

The thing is my hair smells like Magnolia Nobile every time I wash it. That is why I don't find anything spectacular in this one.

Nothing original and striking here, nothing loud, nothing too much, nothing too little but it is just a floral fruity scent. This is the smell of me after taking a bath. Unfortunately I don't think that the name fits the fragrance.

For me, the name, the scent itself and even the bottle have to be the same as the concept or the idea that stands behind the perfume, and here it is not the case.",10/29/10 05:32,poison
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Goes on sweet bright citrus, with a sugared lemon effect. Definitely a floral blend with strong citrus notes. Cedar-like metallic notes make it seem a little purple. Might be nice enough as a summer scent but it isn't quite what I expected as there isn't a lot of the creamy lemon magnolia I've come to expect from sniffing true southern magnolias. Nice but not what I'd hoped for.",10/02/10 12:25,tessture
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I really like this perfume. I love the lemon, it is sharp, mouth watering and delicious. The magnolia is soft and gentle, too much magnolia can be headache inducing for me. This perfume has just got it right. I also find this perfume fresh and very uplifting, very good in hot weather. Also good in winter puts a spring in your step. I would regard this perfume as different and not old fashioned. There is a quality about this perfume and it is very Italian.",08/11/10 03:01,cherubkiss
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Magnolia has to be my number one top note in perfumes. It has such an incredibly beautiful, etheral feel to it. Exquisite, surely this is how heaven must smell.

The magnolia here has been PICKLED in lemon. It upsets me no end. Who could *do* that to a magnolia???

Ah, but nevermind my histronics, I am just sulking because my plans to scent the world with heavenly magnolia have been thwarted yet again.

Even though I am soon vexed by the relentless lemon note which endures the entire length of the journey, initally it is an enjoyable perfume, clear & sparkling. If you love lemon as a solifruit (yes, I made that up) then you will love this. Just don't come to this fragrance looking for the magnolia love of your life - you will be heartbroken.",08/11/10 02:11,Catbiscuit
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I'm not sure what to make of this one! For the first few minutes, the citrus is definitely dominant- but on me, it seemed to skip the mid-phase notes, quickly devolving into vetiver! I never got the sense that I was wearing a floral scent at all-

My overall impression is that it is a sharp-edged fragrance more geared towards men than women. I only smelled it for about 3-4 hours, but perhaps I applied it too lightly- about 1/3 ml ... ?",07/16/10 09:25,pansylady
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,This would be a beautiful perfume if not for that lemon note- I can tell something is very lovely underneath but the lemon cleaner smell ruined it for me. It's not the heaviest dose of lemon but it is always present and seems to clash with the composition on my skin.,06/17/10 01:45,adele l
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I was beyond excited to try this fragrance. I almost dreamt about it.

Magnolia Nobile does indeed start out citrusy and alcoholic, however the more it settles on the skin the better it becomes.

The magnolia is obviously a dominant note in this composition, however the lemony finish tends to override it ever so slightly. I was disappointed that the rose and jasmine were not as prominent. The woodsy notes tend to be the main focus in the heart and drydown.

I was honestly enjoying this delightful, Summery take on magnolia until it suddenly transformed into a big, strong, bathroom air-freshner type scent. Please don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, it's just not to my personal tastes.

The scent is very feminine, just not very young or lively. For such an expensive price tag and a niche label, I really did expect something a little better, perhaps more floral and rich.",06/11/10 01:23,missk

Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I smelled this today for the first time and I was very impressed! It smells absolutely delicious! Since first sniff I could say the excellent quality of this fragrance. It's so well made and raw material has to be the good stuff! It smells great both on paper and on my skin.
It starts very lemony, the best true lemon. Then a full cascade of magnolia and other flowers fell over my head. It smells like being in a garden full of trees in full bloom, both magnolia and hesperids, if any such garden may exist. It stays this way for about 1 hour and 1/2 and then it gradually and slowly fades but the drydown is longlasting. It's a joyful fragrance that makes me feel like in summer shaded by plants under the sun. It's a floral fresh kind of scent, not too complicated, rather complex. A very classy citrus floral. It's also quite a little sweet and I'm happy it is not foody! Magnolia plays a big role here, but at the same time it stays calm, like a reserved white lady who knows her value and doesn't need to show up feistly to prove her existence.It remotely reminded me of Carnal Flower. No mainstream.
After 3 hours someone told me it smells like baby talcum (I smell no powder here!) and someone else told me it smells a little like flour! Is it ever possible since I don't like baby powder or flour smell? Weirdness of smelling sense.
The bottle is very beautiful and elegant.",11/06/09 14:16,Mellyhelly
Acqua di Parma Magnolia Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I tried Iris Nobile and it's powdery, old fashioned perfume.
Magnolia Nobile is... should be called Citrone Nobile instead. Yeah, I get the floral Magnolia note, but I had to wait for hours until I detected it.
Top note is lemon like it is. It sings divas part (diva is late.. ^^)in the show and performs with more excitement than diva herself. It just smells like real lemon that I cut in pieces and add to tea. This fragrance has the most actual lemon scent I ever smelled. Thank goodness, it's not candied!
After hours it develops and becomes subtle floral. And there's that shy noble magnolia! Not very intense, but beautiful enough. I can't really separate the notes well, because the scent is pretty weak- I can point out rose and vetiver, but those are more like picture frame.
Try this if you liked Mediterraneo line.",09/18/09 06:36,Trvevil

Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"My nose cannot compete with the previous reviewer, in fact with most of the reviewers. I can only say how sophisticated and special this scent is. Acqua Di Parma's other fragrances while nice(especially the unisex one, created in 1916 for both men and women which is refreshing)they are basic and at times loud due to heavy dominant top notes that give way to nothing. It is a mystery to me as to why it is rarely carried at the finest of stores. Neiman Marcus used to carry it, but no longer, nor Saks and Barneys is hell-bent on have so-called unique fragrances ie: resolutely Modernist packaging being of the highest order to their buyer(s).
Boy did I digress? If you have not sampled this scent I would urge you to do so.
The body cream is divine as well as rich and moisturizing as opposed to Chanel No.5 cream, which is well scented but not moisturizing.",06/04/19 12:49,Slim5555
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I've had this for a while now, & every time I wear it I like it more than on the previous occasion, and it seems to reveal a bit more of itself that I hadn't noticed before. I wouldn't really care to venture exactly what the correct notes are; but I am very curious, because I find this fragrance so very inscrutable! Is it woody, floral, gourmand ... what? It just sits there so poised between those categories. I'll make a bid for a bit of lemon, a bit of orris, some woody component, and a generous helping of that trademark Acqua di Parma shimmery musk; but beyond that I bid not. And I hedge about even what I have just bid. It's so very inscrutable.

Now I'll go and read the other reviews properly, and see what folks say the correct notes-list is.

Didn't do too well! Bergamot and peony I can clock now that I know they are there. I wouldn't have thought there was labdanum and vetiver and patchouli in it. And I still maintain there's some orris in it - to me that certain soft luminosity bespeaks it. I'm reluctant to say the colour of a fragrance when it's actual colour is so conspicuous ... but I really do think this is a yellow fragrance.

I get the resemblance to Mitsouko now that I'm giving that fragrance an outing, but I would say it's a lot sharper than this one. Not surprising really, given that oakmoss is the chief-voted ingredient in it.",07/17/18 23:41,YYY_Delilah
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"As some people have already mentioned here, the list of notes is incorrect and incomplete. According to Acqua di Parma themselves, the notes includes: damask rose and jasmine petals, patchouli and vetiver, as well as notes of sandalwood and musk.

Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"A perfectly orchestrated classic chypre, holy grail material for the chypre lover. It's the best version of Mitsouko I have smelled and it's not even Mitsouko. And I love Mitsouko. I have it hoarded. But when I smell this I think ""yes, this is it"". It is impeccably balanced, and it's much easier to wear so if you ""almost"" love Mitsouko but can't get along with the dusty and peculiar aspect that makes it challenging for some, give this a try. It's like being transported in a time machine. It smells authentically vintage but like a fresh batch. It's as good as just about any chypre on the market.",12/16/16 14:43,christianne1

Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Ever since my trip to Italy in 2011, I have been longing to find that juice that I smelled in many places I have visited there. In my search, I went through Bottega Veneta, Acqua di Parma Profumo and finally a french perfume by Sisley, Eau du Soir. I have to say that I was expecting a lot more from Acqua di Parma considering the hefty price tag. I don`t smell what is so special about it. Yes, it has a classy feel but no particular signature in my honest opinion. This is not, at least for me, a perfume that I would easily recognize on someone else. Consequently, I will stick to my Sisley Eau du Soir for the time being. However, if any of you have been to Italy and know what I am talking about here, I would really appreciate any suggestion of perfumes to try.",11/16/13 06:31,tredan01
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Classic PROFUMO,, maroon packaging. Yes, most definitely opens like Mitsouko, but without the dark edge. Being aware that smells play mind games, this turns into a sweet gossamer entity, with intermittent flora fluttering around it. Evolving and unfolding, it breathes warmth and softness that seems to be lit from within. And how it persists! For a good eight hours I was enveloped in its protean beauty. Whereas Mitsouko reigns over sepia shadows, Profumo holds sway over a sun - dappled domain. Just marvelous!

See how it reacts with your chemistry, then by all means splurge! Btw, maroon packaging is hard to come by. I love the reformulated version too.",06/11/13 22:41,Naji
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I recently ordered a bottle of Amouage Jubilation 25 which other reviewers have put into the same category as ADP Profumo. Naturally I had to see what I was missing so off to Saks I went.

One hour has passed since Profumo was sprayed generously onto my wrist.

Basically I get a heavier more floral version of Colonia>Colonia Assoluta. Although classy I feel that it has that typical ADP citrus/floral thing that runs rampant in their collection. Another twist on Colonia is maybe a better way to explain it.

It's a heavy scent with very little sillage and more FEM than MASC to my nose. It stays heavy and close to the skin.

They now offer smaller 1.7oz sizes for traveling purposes..roughly $200+

Somewhat interesting but NOT NEARLY as fascinating as Jubilation 25 or Mitsouko.

Try before you buy.",01/11/13 09:32,ThatMakesScents
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"A truly wonderful scent, the price is justified and money is well spent when you get so much in return. Better just one bottle of magnificence than a thousand bottles of mediocrity. This is what I said to myself to stop my credit card guilty feelings.
The scent is wonderful as I said, it comes from an age when scents were made with passion, dedication and art. Wearing it today is a hommage to good taste and the hope it has not completely gone lost.
In certain moments it reminds of Mitsouko, maybe only for being a chypre but I would also add also for being a masterpiece that stands the passing of time without wrinkles on skin. Buy it if you like lovely scents that lasts a lot, if you like wearing something special, if you despise those modern scents which smell all the same.",07/17/12 04:59,Henriette
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"When reviewing this, it must be made clear whether you're talking about the vintage or reformulated version, because as someone else mentioned before, the list of motes for the vintage would not look like the notes listed above. The vintage has an old-school chypre structure, complete with citrus in the opening and oakmoss peeking it's head out througout the middle and the drydown! I'm wearing it now and it is nowhere near a powdery white floral. The vintage version is so cloes to mitsouko that if you like Mitsouko, you'll love vintage Acqua Di Parma Profumo. It's terribly hard to find in full bottles,and when you do, it's more expensive than the reformulated version, which I've seen for as much as $250 or more! but there are lots of 5 ml minis avalable on ebay.

Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I think Fragrantica editors need to look at their notes on this fragrance more closely; they list it as a woody chypre (that fits) but the notes listed are pure florals, no mention of top notes and no basenotes. Confusing. ""Playful composition""? Are we talking about the same fragrance? This is one serious perfume.
This opens as a powerful, somewhat masculine fragrance on me. Some sharp notes from bergamot or similar, then I start to pick up the florals. They're lovely and rich but not really sweet. Overall, this fragrance goes into overdrive in the woody-mossy-patchouli department rather quickly, and I reveled in the richness for many hours. Very long lasting. Very strong, use sparingly. Definately a unisex fragrance in my opinion.

My later research into this perfume house indicates that this frag was geared toward men when it was first released, around 1912; later, it was reformulated to appeal to women as well. Other fragrance sites list this as a unisex fragrance.",03/28/12 18:25,dlane1953
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"i got a sample of this as an extra swap gift ( thanks for Kittycat63 )
my 1st impression was OMG this is strong for my taste ! Profumo is a sophisticated composition for women who embrace timeless elegance , kinda aromatic scent is comprised of heady citrus top notes .. iam surprised not seeing lemon listed up notes in here , i can smell it obviously then a burst of spice smoothed by base notes of precious woods and amber.
a perfect perfume for those who love classics this is a truly classical chypre. If you like Mitsouko you may love thisas its very complex woodsy/incensey chypre to my nose as i see Mitsouko By Guerlain .
the long lasting is more than perfect . 12 hrs on my skin .

with no doubts its a master piece but not for me . Sorry Profumo !",09/28/11 00:52,Rouu
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Had this for years and surprised to see here no note of lemon listed. Enticing very natural lemon, especially in the opening, which is never screechy sharp or pointy. Lemon fades quite a bit but hints of it peep through for a while, and continue to faintly color the experience throughout the remainder. While the heart and dry down remain fresh, the composition soon becomes more dry, it never turns sweet or rich. It becomes slightly powdery- iris? the orris? A noble fragrance, it may come close to getting soapy but thankfully never reaches or crosses that line. I would not call it sophisticated - too false, I'd say noble. Clean or fresh seem too simplistic unless said in context. It is a graceful fragrance.",06/02/11 00:28,puppynose
Acqua di Parma Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Right away it’s a round, smooth, comfortable-feeling chypre, like iris-scented whipped cream flavored with a little rose and plum. It’s not too powdery or overly floral, just perfectly balanced. Love at first sniff! And how could I not love it? This EdP perfectly evokes the luminous, tender, heady quality of being in love. It may have been reformulated, but it truly is a classic scent.

As it dries down, it develops that wonderful frothy, mossy, slightly musky quality that’s found in the best of the classic chypres. With moderate sillage and amazing longevity (more than 12 hours on skin), it’s an all-around winner. Soft, sensuous, and glowing, AdP Profumo is the ultimate floral substitute for those who hate florals. It’s a must-try for those who love classic chypres. I don't buy full bottles, but just might go for a mini or decant of this one.",03/24/11 09:09,Doc Elly

The one thin i do not understand is the high price as I do not find this to be something extremely special. Ok, it's good, has some wonderful chypre qualities and it's extremely elegant, but yet fresh, but as I said - not special enough to pay for 1,7 oz more than for example, bottle of Montale.",12/06/10 03:04,Cereza

It's complex, smokey, mature, elegant, but unique as well. Most people will not be smelling of smoked spices with leather, and this will definitely invite curiosity with its unusual and mysterious projection.
Though it is prominent, it is not aggressive. This is because of its mature, base note heavy presence.
I love it, and find it to be best for cool/cold evenings.
Nothing skanky but not citrusy either.
Smokey, spicy, and a touch of sweetness....",10/31/25 10:37,Katusatya

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is born like stories woven from the threads of time: the first breaths from a luxurious Italian leather bag, exuding the scent of the ancient craftsman pouring his soul into every thread and stitch.
It is not just a leather scent, but a sensual poem that begins with light and completes in shadow.
From the first spray, the Mediterranean Sea breeze rushes through a wave of Sicilian lemon and Brazilian orange, illuminated by red raspberry as a playful smile at the start of the journey.
The freshness here is not superficial; it is a quick light that gleams before the colors shift toward a warmer and more mysterious depth.
At the heart, a hidden garden blooms: soft rose, wavering honeysuckle, and green bitter orange shining like morning dew, while the sound of red thyme rises like oriental spices whispering warmth.
Here, leather appears for the first time, neither harsh nor loud, but warm and soft like the page of an old notebook wrapped in a leather strap, blended with flowers and herbs in a harmony that amazes.
As for the base, it is the climax of the story: a rich, luxurious note, deep and evocative, blended with smoky guaiacwood and the steadfast Atlas cedar.
It's as if you are wearing a new leather jacket that smells of the remnants of a distant winter's fireplace smoke, or as if you open the door to an old library holding leather-bound books pulsating with memories.
It is a fragrance that combines frankness and softness, featuring luxurious leather that harmoniously blends masculinity and femininity.
Performance: long-lasting for many hours, with moderate to strong projection, making your presence felt even after you leave.
Mood: evokes a sense of quiet strength and dignity mixed with elegance, like someone wearing a dark suit and carrying an Italian leather bag on a refined winter evening.
And if Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather is loud and rebellious, then Acqua di Parma's Leather is the polished, aristocratic, quiet voice that doesn't need to shout to assert its presence.
This perfume is the companion of cold evenings and formal nights, where its deep, leathery features shine most splendidly.
Ideal for high-level business meetings, a luxurious dinner at an elegant restaurant, or as a finishing touch for a man who knows how to balance strength and refinement.
In summer or hot weather, just a few sprays are enough to give it space to breathe without overpowering.
Leather is not just a scent to be smelled, but an experience to be told.
It is a statement of luxury, a personal signature written with leather, citrus, and flowers, leaving an indelible mark.
It teaches you that true luxury does not come with noise, but with a deep calm that remains in memory.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Annoying that it’s just leather — they all seem to enjoy diving into this cheap, basic leather variation, banking on the idea that this is exactly what people like. So far, only Ford has done this well with Ombre; the rest of the good ones are primarily proper compositions, not leather lollipops like, I guess, Leather Patchouli or Guerlain’s leather take, etc. As I understand, this is some EDP version of a scent already known in the ADP?",07/18/25 05:37,korngoldo
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"It is NOT a dirty leather.
What it does smell like is a rich leather couch ina gentleman's smoking room.....there is a beautiful smokiness like an expensive cigar or cigarettes, mixed with a bouquet of spices such as black cardamom. Floral trails of oriental bouquets add to the aura of an exclusive gentleman's club with expensive flower arrangements.
I could wish for greater projection, but then again, a gentleman never shouts his presence.",05/11/25 02:24,Katusatya
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The bottle is beautiful, AdP is renowned, and I honestly bought this fragrance because not only am I currently into leathery/smoky/spicy scents, but because this particular perfume has been discontinued, I figure it'd be a sought-after collector's item one day. Unfortunately, as a fragrance, it's not tops on my list in this genre. The opening is rough and unappealing -- it's a mix of leather, used cigarette butts and a little bit of burnt rubber. The mid is a bit more mellowed out and yet still rough because of the over-prominence of the leather note. At that point, it smells sort of in the vicinity of Maison Crivelli Oud Maracuja, but not as smooth, fruity (not that I consider OM to be that fruity in the first place) or strong in performance. The dry down comes much faster with AdP Leather than with OM, which is the longest-lasting cologne I have ever used. When this fragrance finally smells at its best, it's too late -- by then, it's almost a skin scent. It would have helped if AdP had added a vanilla accord, not to make it gourmand but to tamper down the leather / cigarette ash smell a little. AdP Leather isn't bad per se; it's just not that great as a scent, and its arc doesn't properly align with its lifespan.",02/03/25 06:45,UGAMark
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Another masterpeice by François Demachy who gave us the most elegant leather of all time; Dior Homme Parfum. ✨👑 (and like the beloved DHP, AdP Leather is also discontinued 🙄)

AdP Leather is a smokey primal brooding dark leather where the Paraguayan Guaiac wood takes center stage and gives you that dark smokey aspect of a leather accord. 🌫️ 🖤 🌫️ 🖤

It's a true leather fragrance where the leather is always present throughout the fragrance's journey with you. The famous AdP citrus is also here to give it that elegant freshness, preparing you for a dark descent into the primal dark journey of the rugged bold leather accord. This is such a well-blended formulation! The cedar gives it that alpha masculine sharpness. 😎

This smells like you had to do some hard decisions in your head. It is a very serious fragrance, which is why it's leaning very formal. 🤵

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Leather EdP is a clean, masculine leather fragrance. Regardless of the listed notes, I get immediate leather and essentially nothing else in the opening. The far dry down has a little woody scent appearing in addition to the leather. This is strictly a clean leather. Not a hint of band aid smell and does not come across as strongly animalic. Overall leather scent is smooth, clean and classy. Seems pretty versatile; would work for formal or casual wear, any time of day, and day of the year outside of very hot days. I have not tested any of the Tom Ford leathers, but will be doing so soon. Should be interesting to compare. Longevity good - about 8 hours for me with decent sillage and projection the first hour, becoming a closer scent bubble after that.",10/27/24 14:46,Smirky

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I own both this and Tuscan Leather.
While Tuscan Leather is the new, designer made leather jacket, Colonia Leather is the jacket that went through a few motorcycle crashes with cigars in its inner pocket.

Imagine this: You are at the Italian coast, starting the aperitivo. The girls order an aperol spritz and the boys a negroni. One guy doesn't want either, and orders a whisky and lights up a small cigar. Everyone looks at him weird. He doesn't care and does what he wants.

THIS is how he smells. As you could probably tell from the length of this review, I am very passionate about this fragrance (and Acqua di Parma as a whole). Perhaps I am biased because I am Italian, but there is nothing quite like ADP available. How they go about their perfumery is pure art, and modern designers could learn a lot from them.

To start: I don't think this smells like Tuscan Leather at all, in the same way that a retro leather jacket is very different from a modern one. This one is more masculine, more rough. It's the perfect combo between that classy Acqua di Parma citrus and the animalic notes from the leather, woods and smoke. Like a man riding a sports bike in a suit :)

I'm not saying that this is 'a better fragrance' than Tuscan Leather, but damn, there is just nothing like this on the market. Tuscan Leather has a few alternatives like Godolphin and that one from Rasasi (they are all worse than TL though), but there is not a single fragrance that captures that Italian masculinity like this one. Besides, it is not redundant to own them both. I reach more for Tuscan Leather when the setting is outside/colder and more for Colonia Leather in warmer settings.

Moreover, I do detect a slight difference between the old Colonia Leather and the new black bottle (I have a decant of the new stuff). The new version has a slightly more prominent raspberry note, but I only noticed the difference when I smelled them side by side, and it would be impossible to detect the difference in the air. I am sure it is caused by the fact my old, brown bottle is from 2018 so it has aged a bit, while the decant is from the newest bottle. It is not worth hunting old bottles, unless you connect sentimental values to it.

Lastly, the fact that people think this is ""hard to wear"" and ""too smokey"" makes me even love it more. This stuff is Italian confidence in a bottle. 10/10.",09/10/24 07:48,sweetymasculine
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Yes, it is in the Tuscan leather lineage but on the lighter and slightly brighter side with a prominent citrus note
Highly wearable and classy",07/06/24 16:30,Vitriol08
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The leather note is incredible right from the start; it is probably the strongest and most natural leather note I've ever encountered (even more pronounced than in the Leather Colonia). This note is very animalic in its naturalism but not ""dirty,"" reminding me more of sun-tanned, rustic, and bronzed leather tools than the smell of a sweaty animal and other bodily odors, as in Kouros.

Edit: It seems this version and the Leather Colonia are exactly the same fragrance. I haven't compared them side by side, but one really reminded me of the other, with strong impressions right from the opening.

From the start, there is a quite smoky oud that brings similarities to the house's Oud & Spice and really solidifies for me that, contrary to what I previously thought, Acqua di Parma is not just about fresher, naturalistic, and minimalist (or barber-shop) fragrances but also has some of the best dark and ""niche"" fragrances on the market.",06/05/24 10:09,danilodeathayde

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The opening felt challenging where every note seems to fight and scream against each other but the dry down is where the magic starts to happen. ADP Leather calms down and starts to exude a slightly sweet, Chinese herbal smelling leather. For me, this herbal quality can also be interpreted as medicinal and also smoky.

This perfume is actually more similar to Gucci Guilty Absolute / Kilian Dark Lord in its presentation compared to Tom Ford’s OM/TL. GGA/Dark Lord also has this herbal/medicine note, but they are less sweet and go for a smokier, dryer and even more herbal route. As a result, GGA/Dark Lord can smell flatter with less depth compared to ADP Leather which has more of a body due to the more balanced sweet + herbal.

Personally, I don’t correlate GGA, Dark Lord or ADP Leather to be a “leather” scent. I feel that TF Leathers are more leather-like to my nose.

Regardless, ADP Leather is a good alternative to GGA/Dark Lord with its more balanced profile. Make no mistake - this leather is still not mass pleasing but it is certainly less harsh and aggressive compared to GGA/Dark Lord. If you want mass pleasing, this perfume is not for you.

This perfume is good value as it can be found for good prices at discounters. It’s certainly an acquired taste which I think GGA/Dark Lord enjoyers can appreciate.

Longevity is similar, if not slightly behind GGA and Dark Lord. ADP leather is a long lasting fragrance. It feels like it sits close to your skin but actually the projection and silage performs well.",01/17/24 04:05,Torky
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"***Blind Buy Review*
Well, after reading all these reviews, and ADP being my favourite brand, I had to blind buy this, it was on sale and felt like missing out on the deal would be a crime.

When i first sprayed this onto myself, i felt that its different, but i did not really liked it.
It is deeper then what I usually use in cold:
darker, more agressive, far from my safe (most of the time synthetic) sweet choices

This feels like taking a long walk somewhere on the countryside on an autumn or winter dawn, it’s dark outside and really frosty, the wind is feeezing cold, people are burning wood to keep themselves warm in their houses, you can smell it in the air.

You get home after your mind has been cleared on the “fresh air”.You became calmer and ice cold inside and out, the leather jacket which suits you so well wasnt warm enough for the occasion, you take it off and while you are trying to put it onto the hanger with your frozen hands.

You Catch a smell…….
Fumy and Rigid smelling shiny black leather, smells like you’ve made some hard choices in your head outside, it is okay, thats the reason why you feel sharper and more pleased with yourself, dont worry you deserved this already.

Unique and natural smelling leather at the same time.
Wear it for harder days, or for a special occasion, maybe when it is windy and cold outside.
10/10 scent with great Longevity and an okay sillage, which could be better but you would probably choke someone out.
I recommend it, but dont blind buy if you expect something uplifting.🙂",01/12/24 14:18,Filepp

What i get is a linear, animalic, sweet leather with a touch of citrus and raspberry...great performer too!",11/27/23 15:34,Andre_p
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is a great fragrance, but I have trouble actually discerning the leather. Everyone says it’s an amazing, realistic leather fragrance, but on my skin, it’s so well blended in with the other notes that I struggle to discern an actual leather note. On the other end, however, I have no trouble sniffing out the rose, raspberry, petit grain, and citrus, as well as some of the thyme towards the back end, and that smack in the face of smoky Guaiac wood which prevails for the first couple hours. Because of how it sits on my skin, I only get about 5 hours of good projection, and it isn’t full bodied enough for it to be a go-to for winter in cold climates, but it’s great above 45*f and under 90*f for me, which makes it pretty versatile. Once you’re safely in the dry down and out of the smoke, I’d say this is office friendly and would definitely distinguish you from your colleagues. It’s mature, sophisticated, and yet still current - it exudes confidence and intellect and it’s just as good on a night out as it is at the mall, in the office, or on a drive through the mountains, so long as you don’t intend to go clubbing

On a side note, this is definitely not a sporty fragrance, I wouldn’t suggest you wear this to the gym, hiking, biking, or even golfing, this is definitely a more dressed up fragrance which requires a well dressed man for it to be at its best

For me, a 7.5-8/10

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Leather Eau de Parfum (EDP) by Acqua di Parma is a leathery, floral and woody fragrance.

Unlike the opening of the Leather Cologne Concentree (CC) where the citrus shines and gives it an air of a classic leather cologne, in the EDP version we have a more intense opening in something that seemed to me like a chocolate truffle with one or several fruity notes and leathery tone, almost like shoe polish cream. As time goes by, the rose note increases and comes to the foreground, leaving the leathery aroma as its companion. After more than an hour, a wood base remains with a touch of animalic musk, while the rose and leather remain present.

Leather Eau de Parfum is elegant and formal, perfect for events or special situations and preferably for use between autumn and winter.

Its longevity was good for me, a little more than 8 hours, although the sillage was average.

There are some differences between the EDP and CC versions, mainly in the presence of citrus, which is almost absent in the black bottle version. They are both very good fragrances, but I think I like the Cologne version a little more because it is a little more versatile.",09/23/23 09:08,caifan

When I noticed that the bottles had changed to black, I tried it to make sure it hadn't changed, but unfortunately this is not the Leather I'm used to...

The opening note honestly smells like fish. I've tried it in several different stores in 3 different countries to confirm that it wasn't just a bad batch. Nope. It smells like a fishmonger's leather apron.

Whatever ingredient they've changed, they need to reverse their decision as soon as possible. Once the fishy smell has faded, it does start smelling like the original fragrance - but I'm not sure why anyone would subject themselves to the initial smell.",02/19/23 09:47,zpgnbg
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Heaviest of the batch, oily, fruity faint floral flowing above some brown-ish ‘leather’ as a starter, not animalic at first. Quickly fades into the ‘Tucsan Leather’ category. A distinct flowery but bitter rose note is lingering for long to pull it back from getting a ‘powdery’ impression. Then you can tell there’s a strong core that’s yet fully exposed. Roses step down and only embraces the leather from afar, the lather note, here a thick dense raw leather is projecting even bigger and louder!
Some creamy woodiness lasts to the end.

Had to spray it on skin to experience it though, so don't trust the tester strip in this instance. The leather accord is similar to that of la yuqawam, but the raspberry note is less prominent, making it less sweet.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Just because fragrances have the same notes doesn't mean they smell similar or the same. This doesn't smell anything like Tuscan Leather.

This is a smokey dark rough leather fragrance that some might find hard to wear, especially with the opening. However, to me, this is a rich elegant fragrance.

In the opening, you will get a strong but classy smokey dark rough leather with a toned-down raspberry note that doesn't smell sweet or sugary. People that aren't used to rough or strong leather might think the opening smells a bit animalic, but I agree with people that say this smells like a well-conditioned leather seat in a classic sports car.

The scent stays a predominantly leather fragrance through its lifespan but it's tamed down as it develops. To me, you don't get a recognizable rose note but you get the feel of a rose petal. Giving this leather a silky feel, the same as feeling a silky rose pedal.

With the mid and base notes of honeysuckle and cedar along with lingering citrus top notes, this scent dries down to a tame semi-fresh woody leather.",12/02/22 07:53,...Pleasehold

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Leather EDP is a scent that definitely makes its presence felt! The leather announces itself immediately - a dry, dark, slightly dirty leather that crackles with an undercurrent of smoke. I definitely get some BBQ vibes in the vein of Patchouli 24 which gives it a savoury edge. Not quite animalic to my nose but a little rough round the edges, something that may take a while to get used to.

It starts to soften several minutes in as the layers begin to develop. We get a delicious fruitiness from the raspberry, tartness from the orange and lemon and a soft, floral patina from the rose and honeysuckle. Each of these elements adds colour to the leather experience, imbuing it with depth and richness. One gets hints of scents such as Russian Tea and Godolphin.

Leather is a scent that may initially overwhelm but ultimately charms one over with its tapestry of olfactory textures. Projection and sillage are moderate on me but longevity is decent, things eventually moving to an aromatic woody base. It leans fairly masculine and works best in cooler weather. A solid offering from the house.",09/30/22 19:12,nkapped
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I don’t understand how people are getting raspberry and citrus fruits from this. It’s just pure, dark, smoky old leather; and it’s vile.

It’s less intrusive on the dry down but still old and smoky. Not a scent I’ll be associating myself with any time soon.

I prefer Ombré Leather which has the primary cardamom scent with floral notes but the leather is evident. It’s more intriguing.

Edit; 3 days later. I DO get the orange and raspberry scents. The problem I was having was that I was sticking my nose in and smelling it. You need to let this sit and all of the other fragrances come out over time and as it weakens.

Quite nice actually. Still maybe a bit old fashioned for myself, but quite nice.",09/24/22 06:30,Steparko23
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is divine. I love it as it changes a bad mood to a better one. It smells great and performs amazingly. I have Parfum de Marly's Godolphin, but I would not say that they smell alike.",09/16/22 10:57,itsallaboutmega
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Imagine the brown broken-in interior of a properly kept luxury car from the 80s polished with leather conditioner, warming under the sunshine and a touch of petitgrain and tart fruitiness entering through the window.

I much prefer this to both Tuscan and even Ombre Leather, because they feel very much like high fashion leather, jet black shiny leather. On the other hand, AdP Leather feels rounder, more complex, and has a certain depth to it, while still screaming ''leather''.
I find this one is best enjoyed when spraying conservatively, because too much of it has an overwhelming effect. Spraying once or twice max. allows the leather to kind of loom around you and reveals a lot of nuance in the mix, tart, spicy, woody, and herbal facets just kind of radiate through the dense leather and it comes off less jarring and aggressive. The leather also flickers between a smoky incense-y almost charred wood like effect which I personally enjoy.

This is one of the few fragrances from AdP that I thoroughly enjoy and this comes from someone who avoids leather fragrances in general. This one is undoubtedly top of the line for me.

p.s. This is pretty much identical to the brown Colonia Leather flanker. You could honestly just see which is cheaper online and just pick that up without any reservation.",08/24/22 16:50,derby2169
Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Dry smoky leather...hints of raspberry and rose, but overwhelmingly smoky leather. I get the burnt smoke others mention, but I also feel it's pretty smooth, despite the hints of ash. I'm not a leather or dark frag person, so not for me and I'm probably not the best judge of what a leather frag lover would like. It's certainly not for those who are not into smoky leather, but I can see somebody enjoying this...maybe a Harley rider in black biker jacket with a marlboro hanging off his lips. It certainly captures the vibe of stern, Harley riding smoker, but in an upscale way.

Scent: 6.5 / Sillage: 8 / Longevity: 7 (8/8/2022)

UPDATE:
Revisiting my thoughts and it's pretty spot on...dry smoky leather. Hints of Fahrenheit gasoline notes. Still not exactly my style, but pretty great for classy, natural, leather lovers.

On me- I really love the opening, I smell burnt charcoal that was just poured over with water, leather, and raspberry.

And- I cant see myself liking this on my girlfriend, so there's that as well.",04/06/22 14:21,~PotatoGuy.

After testing some leather scents I found out they're not for me. Still this smells great!

And my lord, this stuff is eternal, can still smell it faintly after two days and two showers?! Cra-zy.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Thus far I have limited myself to only reviewing fragrances I've used on my skin, as those are the fragrances I have the most familiar impressions of and can authentically comment on after having used them during different times of day, throughout different seasons, and sometimes across different climates. Today, I have broken this rule.

I came across Leather in my adventure of finding new fragrances for my partner. The notes and the description were pleasantly intriguing enough that this ended up being one out of three fragrances from Acqua Di Parma I decided to smell in-store. And oh how wrong I was, because today, I can finally say there is a fragrance I hate. This went straight to the base notes and was a horrible cacophony of strong hard leather and incense smoke.

In my country, the burning of joss paper (or incense paper, or to the Western world, ""hell's banknotes"") is a ritual in our ancestor worship. It is not uncommon to see people burning joss paper in metal cannisters on the streets - mostly in residential areas. I was walking back home with not a care in the world, when all of a sudden I started to smell Leather. I was alone on the escalator ascending a footbridge, and was obviously quite confused to be bombarded with this horrible smell. This was also through my K95 mask. As I started walking along the footbridge, in the distance I saw a man burning joss paper. And that is what Leather smells like to me.",06/12/21 01:26,bergamotted

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Acqua Di Parma Leather EDP opens with a moderate to a strong projection of leather, woody, faint fruit, and floral accords. The opening is mature, intense, bold, but not harsh, elegant, and refined. The leather is by far the most noticeable note, a natural leather, polished, with a suede touch, elegant, not pungent or animalic, and without that combustible or gasoline vibe found in leader prominent fragrances. A step behind is the guaiac wood, a woody smoky, and leathery note. Several steps behind are the raspberry, orange, and honeysuckle, adding a very shy sweet fruit, and white floral accord. The rest of the notes are there to provide support but don’t have any significant participation. The fragrance is linear, all featured notes come up as soon as the fragrance is applied and continue into the dry down. One Acqua Di Parma Leather EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a moderate to a strong projection, leather, and guaiac wood fragrance with faint fruity, floral and spicy accords.

Its great to layer with other fragances due to its simplicity, but be advise, is not shy, it can actually overpower it. So far I've tried it with D&G the one edp and Versace Oud Noir. Brilliant layerings.

Leather Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I dunno. Other than being a leather dominant fragrance, I’m not seeing the comparisons to tom Ford Tuscan leather.

Acqua di Parma Leather is beautifully intense - the Leather note almost comes across as a petroleum type smell - with the most subtle kick of sweetness and tangy-ness buried in the background.

I think Tuscan leather and acqua di Parma leather certainly compare when you consider the fact that they are both “harsh” leathers - but in terms of actual smell similarity...I just don’t see it.

I find this to be one of the more unique leathers I’ve come across - and its oddly satisfying. The opening is distractingly harsh - not a “that smells awful” type harsh - more of a “oh shit - maybe i should’ve spayed it once.”

Within 20 minutes or so, the smack in the face wears off - and you’re left with a pleasant, slightly citrusy leather. I would also clarify, that although rose is listed in the notes, it’s not prominent. Again, I would think of a heavy “petrol” type scent when trying to compare this to others. There was one by histoiries de Parfums called Petroleum that kind of reminds me of this. I sold it a long time ago...it was definitely more rugged and less refined than this - but same ballpark.

If you’re a fan of fairly rugged/masculine heavy leathers, I can see this being appealing. To me it’s a very nice Alternative to the standard “Tuscan leather” type scent. I’m a big fan",08/20/20 12:37,picknenders

This Leather is darker and thicker, and the rose that added a playful contrast in Colonia Leather is far more distant, while the citrus takes higher precedent.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"I have a sample and have now worn this twice to get a sense of what I think about it. I should say as context that I am not familiar with the Acqua di Parma brand and find its vast and complex range a bit overwhelming. I also typically wear niche perfumes, so anything like this that comes from a classic house, with a classic vibe and personality, is unfamiliar to me.

This one begins for me with a very strong, mildly unpleasant scent, evocative of leather car seats, James Bond, and the Mediterranean. Like many strong openings, this one would be definitely too much for the first 30 mins in most social settings. The smooth bitter orange, varnish, leather, oud smell is interesting and very European.

Within 2 hours, I can barely smell it. It fades into a non-specific, mildly ozonic oud-leather scent. Most of the citrus is gone. It definitely smells like ""cologne"" not any specific natural note.

Overall, it's too subtle yet too off-putting, too innovative yet too classic, and ultimately too varnish-y dark for my specific sensibility. I would want my ouds funkier and longer-lasting, and my citruses brighter and more refreshing, and the combination of the two seems intriguing but ultimately didn't work for me. Still intrigued about the brand though.",10/27/25 16:42,50yoGWM

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,This is a great cologne. Makes me feel confident. My only gripe is the lack of projection and longevity.,11/10/24 14:23,armando2021
Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"I'm not a big fan of Acqua Di Parma, so this caught me completely off guard. This is a clean, fresh, woody, and spicy fragrance with oud supporting it all the way. smells of quality and stays smelling like quality throughout the wear time.

Open: It hits you with citrus and oud. Not a harsh oud, nor a bitter citrus. The Oud stays for the whole lifetime of the fragrance, but the citrus dies down over time little by little (as most citruses does). It's a Very pleasant and well balanced combination of oud and citrus and has an addictive scent.

Mid: The spice, dry cedar, leather, and a clean musk starts to really shine underneath the Oud, and what's left of the citrus. It now reaches the ""clean out of the shower"" stage. This is where the musk really starts to give cleanness to the fragrance.

Dry-down: Pretty much the same as the Mid, but the citrus is all but gone. Has a hint of sweetness, probably from the leather accord. Less projection, but still detectable in the air.

This is an all year round, any time of day, any scenario and occasion type of fragrance. I can't think of an occasion where this wouldn't work. Suit or t-shirt and flip-flops. either way works. I would also say any age, as long as you don't prefer sweet gourmand fragrances. Leans very masculine in my opinion.

I personally like western oud over eastern. This is not cloying or overly sweet. Its perfect. Its masculine, its clean its amazing. The drydown is a super creamy and smooth leather / sandlewood type scent, but it has an accord I just can;t describe. Its smells of such high quality. 9.5/10. Never smelled anything like it.

Simply a fresh oud. Not suitable for hot summer days.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Oud epitomises the combination of classic Italian perfumery with clean, contemporary western oud. It opens with a juicy burst of bergamot and orange, alongside a refreshingly spicy pairing of amyris and coriander.

This is soon followed by a clean-cut, modern, synthetic oud which is smoothed round the edges, and mellowed to match the continental style of Acqua di Parma. Combine this with a soft leather, backed up by sandalwood and cedar - and you’re left with a scent as fresh and invigorating as it is dark and brooding.

This fragrance stays true to the heritage of the original Colonia, utilising darker notes to take it that step further. It’s great for casual everyday wear as well as formal occasions, and would work very well as a signature scent for a classical individual.",10/02/23 05:02,RGH01
Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"This is interesting. Takes a nice leather note, much better than the note in ADP Colonia Leather, and mixes this quality leather in with an oud accord and a crisp citrus note.

The odor it’s elegant, it immediately hits you at the opening, in a good way I mean it, and it keeps stronger on middle notes, be careful with not over spray it.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"I was expecting a stinky oud, but this is actually very classic and approachable. There is a medicinal touch to it that is specifically reminiscent of the dentist.

But all in all I do prefer something a touch sweeter in my ouds.",11/01/22 11:18,elledeelee

On the dry down, the leather really takes over and works well with the Oud, accompanied by a soft amber scent.

Not bad.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Oud is amazing but will not suit everyone, the opening is very sharp and oudy, beautiful but you can love it as much as someone else can hate it.

All I can say is this is the closest match I have ever found in a clone, both in terms of notes and longevity, projection and sillage. There is a subtle difference in the sharpness of the opening, but not at all chemical or uncomfortable. And I get a bit less coriander while approaching drydown. Otherwise these two are twins.

Acqua di Parma is famous for their sparkling citrus colognes, made in the Italian tradition. With Colonia Oud, I really went in there wanting to find something in this scent to love, but there is none. There is no brilliant opening, nor is the dry down really oud-y or spicy. The inverse of Acqua di Parma Oud and Spice.",02/20/22 00:58,VETTIVAER
Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Smooth, vanilla, ambery, soft, friendly oud with a hint of sweetness. Not a funky or animalic off putting oud but a very friendly approachable oud. Love it for winter and colder fall weather. Think it'll be too dense and cloying in hot weather. Great date night scent.

A bit of a Classic acqua di palma opening with some wood in the background, but lots of balsamic notes. A touch sickly sweet . The mids are gentle oud, slightly medicinal but not harsh with a very slight hint of rose, then sweet leather takes over backed by a gentle powdery soap.
The end of the dry down is sweet and woody, very smooth and leathery, just a hint of soap left.

Everything is very rounded. Smooth and soft. I'd like a little something to cut through, maybe a touch of bitter orange.

Good afternoon scent on a warm autumn day.",05/24/21 04:35,Thedon81
Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"The notes are masterfully blended with this one. The projection is really good for older bottles, don't know about the newer bottles but it should be similar going by the quality of this house.

I absolutely love, love, LOVE this fragrance.🤪 My mom loves it, my co-workers love heck it even my doctor loves it. Nearly every single time I wear it I get complements. It's long lasting and, not to to over powering. I now own close to different bottles of cologne and, Acqua Di Parma Oud is my all time favorite it just reminds of the smell of fresh cut exotic wood. A few years ago I was killing time at my local Bloomingdale's department store before a job interview, and I stumbled into the men's fragrance department. I randomly picked up the large dark brown 6 oz. bottle of Acqua Di Parma Oud and, at first spray I feel in love with it except with the price the 6oz. bottle cost well over $250 US dollars😦just this past Spring of 2020 I I finally purchased my first bottle of Acqua Di Parma OUD online at a discounted price and, out of all bottles the fragrance house of Acqua di Parma makes to me this is ranked number #1☝️ 👍

Note: For those of you reading my review if you want this fragrance to last even longer try moisturizing the area you usually spray (neck, wrist, inside of elbows, lower armpits) with FRAGRANCE FREE lotion or non scented oil FIRST. I tried this and the fragrance lasted all day.👍

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Does anyone smell something resembling honey?

I do! 🍯

Its accords remind me of the most natural and strangely attractive honey with propolis.

•

From the opening, I don’t get an “in your face” citruses. Just enough to lend the Acqua Di Parma DNA to the perfume.

Instead, it dissipates very fast, giving room for the beautiful oudy-honey-propolis smell that I talked about, with a rich floral background and a leathery touch in the dry down.

Because of this honey-propolis vibe, Acqua Di Parma Colonia Oud presents a slightly medicinal type of oud.

But it has to be said: it’s not overwhelming at all. In fact, it’s amazing the way it is.

•

Acqua Di Parma Colonia Oud is very linear, not in a bad way. It’s blended so perfectly, that its consistent oudy-honey-propolis smell remains until the end. And when I say end, it means a loooong time after you spray it.

I’m talking about 8-plus hours of longevity and at least an arms length projection in the first 2-3 hours.

If you close your eyes and sniff it deeply, you’ll notice a floral note standing up, not as a main player. It’s Amyris. 🌼

It’s fantastic how this floral note gives richness to the perfume, despite being so sutil.

Another thing you’ll notice is some “brightness”. Probably it comes from the coriander seed. As in gastronomy, coriander seeds confers some “brightness” or “freshness” to the recipe.

(Just a little digression: you would be surprised how gastronomy and perfumery look alike)

The leather only presents itself in the dry down.

•

Unlike most people here, I don’t think this is a fragrance more appropriate to the night. It’s “brightness” match perfectly with the day.

I would recommend Acqua Di Parma Colonia Oud for the cooler days of spring 🌱 or for the autumn 🍁. But if you, like me that live in Brazil, use to face hotter days, go on and enjoy the fragrance. Just go easy with the trigger. 😉

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"A unique soapy fresh western oud. If you ever wonder what oud soap might smell like give this one a try.You get the soapy fresh elements of the acqua di parma DNA with the inclusion of civilized clean oud in the base. The fragrance picks up some spicy and creamy undertone as it dries down. The transitions are gradual and the fragrance lasts a lifetime on my skin. Niche quality as the price suggests of course.

I imagine this would be the smell of the oud soap you would find in a six star hotel in Dubai. It feels luxurious, deep,elegant but surprisingly zesty and clean for an oud fragrance.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Wealthy middle-age man essence...

Harsh strong opening of dark woods will hit you just after spraying this on. Synthetic blast to your nose that will take its time to calm down. Then an oudy-leathery accord will dominate this fragrance. It feels mature, straight to the point, not hiding any subdued nuance in the background.

To me this smells wealthiness. Nothing sexy here or even elegant or classy. It's like a big golden watch used to show off power and position, but without any hint of good taste or refinement. Do not get me wrong, this smells good, but the important thing here is the message and the power this message is communicated: ""I am a big fish and I want everybody to see it""

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"I tried Tom Ford Oud and Creed Royal Oud before I decided to buy AdP Oud.

Tom Ford Oud is a well crafted Oud, but on my skin, it starts developing floral notes throughout the day, which makes it too feminine for me—I don't mind unisex but floral notes are a turn off for me.

Creed Royal Oud is fantastic to smell because it's more herbal. It feels like if you're walking in a forest, right in front of agarwood. I loved it but not to wear as a fragrance. Also, it made me feel I'd only wear it on a rainy Sunday in Fall. Very special. For anybody in search of oud fragrances, give it a try.

Now AdP Oud was just a wow. I'ts definitely an oud fragrance with reminiscences of sandal, a layer of leather (for some too leathery but for me not at all if you compare it with Tuscan Leather) and a layer of burnt match which is oddly addictive. It made me feel I could wear it each time I wear a suit or want to impress.

Complex, different and appealing. Great longevity and medium projection and sillage. That's why I bought it.",11/25/19 09:15,goldfilm

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"lets talk about class and sophistication. It's elegant, masculine extreme classy scent. I believe only gentleman can put this on. Its the best version of oud where it is not overpowering and dirty yet very existing and sexy. Despite the fact it is cologne concentration. This master piece last for ages and when I say for ages i really mean it.

Normally most of perfumes does not last on my skin at all, but this stuff is amazing, what else can I say that I wore it today 7:00 am in the morning and took two shower through the day and it is still on my skin the only thing sillage is not big and that what you want because oud is very rich and strong so if it is loud it will annoy people around.

A signature scent that will grab you tons of compliments, boost your mood and make you recognisable. Furthermore, it worth every penny you spend on it specially if you do the maths and buy 180ml, at least you are 100% confident no one will smell like you.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Unique! I have been trying and discovering some wonderful scents from this house including this one. With it being summer I’ve been enjoying the citrus’s present in many Colonia fragrances which I possess. Colonia, Pura, and Essenza to be specific when I began to gauge the costs of full bottles. That’s when I spotted it. Colonia Oud in a huge 6 oz bottle. I had heard of this scent but never had a sample before. On sale for about 150 bucks. I began to research until finally deciding to blind buy it. Figuring I love the others, I Love Oud! Let’s see what this talk is about when you combine the two. As always, I am glad I did. Not only do I have a great scent in a huge bottle to turn to in the days ahead but I also expanded my knowledge and experience on this fragrance journey. While I can say that this was not what I expected, some bring about comparisons to Creed royal oud while others mention Oud Wood by Tom Ford, I’d say that this is very Unique and that I get the mentioning of those as this juice is of the finest quality as they are.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Oud satisfies that craving perfectly.

Admittedly, I didn't enjoy the fragrance at first, but it quickly became the one sample I kept returning to. The word that comes to mind every time I sniff my decant is ""juicy."" The bergamot and orange are almost edible in this fragrance; coupled with the oud and elegant leathers, you have a masterpiece of a fragrance. Arguably the best AdP has ever produced.

I'll add finally that this is most appropriate for business-casual to formal attire. You'll definitely smell sophisticated with this one.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Smells like a particularly cheap urinal-cake, with lots of really unsettling chemical notes. Don’t really know what else to say. Very very strong and headache-inducing. Don’t understand the hype one bit.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Adding to my previous review:

On my skin, I get average/good projection in the first hour, moderate/low projection in the following 3/4hours before settling as a skin scent. Good longevity, as I can still detect it after 12 hours and a shower (as a subtle skin scent). That said, unlike previous reviewers, it is no beast on my skin, and doesn't perform better than Colonia Ambra.

The opening is a little disappointing, as I get an impression leather (despite there's no leather accord - the pyramid is inaccurate) and the usual wet wood note (a little amped up) supposed to give an impression of oud (no real oud oil here, probably just cypriol, like in Colonia Ambra), like in other designer oud frags, with an added supporting orange note. Then it transition through an elegant musky/soapy stage. The drydown is much more interesting though, with a woody/musky drydown, quite similar to Colonia Ambra (rounder in Oud, since there's no ambergris tincture).
To me, the opening/heart seems like a fine-tuned/high-quality version of Versace Oud Noir (or should I say the opposite, since Versace ON has been released 1 year after this one). It wouldn't surprise me if the same -unknown- perfumer authored both.

Whichever you choose - Colonia Oud or Colonia Ambra - you can't go wrong with either. They are definitely of the same family: indeed, of the 9 olfactive notes of Colonia Oud, 6 are shared with Colonia Ambra. The latter is fresher and more casual, while Oud is woodier/warmer, and maybe a little more formal. Personally, I chose Colonia Ambra, as it's a little funnier and interesting imho, even if more linear than Colonia Oud.

As always, try before you buy!

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"An unbelievable masterpiece of perfumery, Acqua di Parma's Colonia Oud smells like nothing else out there. It's a dark citrus-oud combination with premium ingredients like Calabrian bergamot essential oil from Italy as well as amyris essential oil (West Indian sandalwood). Usually oud fragrances pair the oud with rose, vanilla, patchouli, or amber, but this goes a unique direction by pairing the oud with Italian citrus, sandalwood, and leather. This is another masculine power scent, akin to the feeling I get from smelling Creed Aventus or Mancera Cedrat Boise (but not smelling anything like them at all). I can't really describe how it smells too well since the ingredients are blended so well, so one would have to simply smell this for themselves. Colonia Oud is one of my favourite fragrances of all time. Projection is moderate leaning strong, while it also has the best longevity out of all the Acqua di Parma line, projecting well for over 5 hours. Overall this is the greatest thing Acqua di Parma has ever released in my opinion (along with the minty green Colonia Club, another of my favourites).

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Tested on paper strip. Beautiful oud.

Fall/Spring evenings, 30+


Edit: I retested it on paper. Unfortunately, I made the mistake to stop by the booth of MFK just before that, to smell MFK Oud (both the EDP and the Extrait de Parfum), and that killed the show.
Of course, one can tell that AdP costs half of MFK... but there's barely any oud in AdP's Oud Colonia. It's a nice fragrance taken in its own, that keeps the fresh original Colonia vibes, a little more leathery. If it's and oud-centered fragrance you're looking for, pass on that one!
That said, the non heady oud and citrus freshness make it one of the few (if not only) oud containing fragrance that could be worn in Summer evenings, assuming it's not extremely hot.

Edit 2: tested on skin. Very elegant, good projection. Will buy a full bottle soon.

Edit 3: testing it again today. No Oud in this one (other than the usual oud-like wet wood note found in any mainstream designer oud frag), but it's not a dealbreaker, as I find the leather/patchouli heart followed by the sandalwood/musk drydown beautiful (better than Colonia Leather's drydown).",12/14/18 08:20,Andy the Frenchy

Clearly they are both similar but the new formulation lacks the freshness of the old. The leather in the new one is slightly more creaky with the toned down freshness. I subsequently returned the bottle. My advice get a batch code with 6/7 digits ignore the 4 digit ones which are the new formulation.

Finally an Acqua Di Parma I'll be happy to wear! Being Italian I've always wanted to have at least one in collection but so far nothing from the Colonia line had worked for me, although the scents are gorgeous they turn out too soapy, flowery and granmotherish.

This one is rather PERFECT. Elegant, fresh but deep, refined, unique, sexy (the first sexy scent I smell from ADP) and a KING OF VERSATILITY! The more I smell it and the more I can imagine me wearing it in EVERY... I repeat because it's quite rare... E-V-E-R-Y kind of weather, season, time of the day or night, context or occasion.

The only fragrance it reminds me of JUST A LITTLE BIT is Zoologist Rhinoceros, but without the booze and that Vicks Vaporub feel that I found really weird and hard to wear.

It can be a signature scent without any problem whatsoever.

10 out of 10 fragrance, one of the best ever smelled. And can I say something surely unpopular: it's an Aventus killer. I don't mean it smells similar, it doesn't, but can serve exactly the same purposes perfectly, it's niche quality too and way less expensive.",06/22/18 04:51,torom

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Fragrance -Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma
Bottle from - 2016

In my opinion,this fragrance is one of the best oud-leather combo on the planet.
Colonia Oud opens on my skin with a fresh,elegant,clean and citrusy oud with dominant bergamot and with a hint of spicy,green and a bit woody and resinous coriander laying on top of a fine leather.
Soon enough,during mid development,coriander becomes stronger,more spicy and more woody with a strong presence of clean oud and fine leather and with a nice touch of a bit rich,woody,balsamic and well-known fixative amyris(amyris-often referred to as West Indian Sandalwood, due to its similar aroma- it is a practical, less expensive alternative to Sandalwood essential oil).I can detect a hint of divine rose,but it's not listed in the notes.
This all leads into a woody,leathery,musky,a bit dry and oudy base with dominant oud,leather and cedar and with a wisper of musk,sandalwood and a bit earthy patchouli.
It has some similarities to Colonia Leather by Acqua di Parma.

Longevity - 10/10(10+ hours)
Silage/Projection - 9/10(heavy projection and silage for the first 3-4 hours,than sits closer to skin for the duration of the scent's evolution)
Weather -For more or less any time of year.I personally wouldn't wear this on a really hot summer days.
Age - 26+
Compliments - 8/10
Scent - 10/10

Main notes according to me - oud,leather,coriander,amyris,cedar,bergamot.

The drydown is woody,leathery,musky,a bit dry and oudy and I get some -oud,leather,musk,sandalwood and patchouli.

Emotions - sophisticated,classy,refined,profound,elegant, distinguished.

Occasion -Perfect for special occasions,life defining moments,formal and semi-formal events.

This is the scent of a distinguished gentleman.",04/29/18 08:39,Ivanus
Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Sold my Colonia Intensa oud bottle last year and bought a bottle of Colonia oud for a reasonable price and what can I say. I did like colonia intensa a lot but I thought it was too good to use in school or at work and I never really used it except on one wedding in a relatively warm autumn evening (not the best time as it was a winter scent). I was kinda missing the luxury smell of colonia intensa and I got an opportunity to buy a bottle of colonia oud (very similar to intensa according to fragrantica) and to my surprice, it is identical to colonia intensa oud. I dont feel any difference at all. The oud is really nice and modern with some minty notes.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"This has one of the best opennings I've experienced in a long time.
I will be ordering a bottle as soon as I finish my review.
Great first impression!
Some have said they can't wait for the citrus to settle? I think they are great in the opening, well blended with the darker notes, and you get such an enjoyable burst of contrasts.
I like the smell of a strong oud, but sometimes they can be too heavy, this is bright and wearable, a daily driver someone described it on YouTube.

Atelier Colognes have a philosophy of making their fragrances fresh and cologne like, even their heavier frags like Oud Saphir. This also still has the original Colonia Intensa cologne freshness, with a vague synthetic oud and leather. It does not smell of high quality notes like TF Oud Wood, but they crafted a very pleasant and wearable fresh oud frag.

I am selling my M-7, to get a bottle of this. I have M-7 Fresh also, this is warmer darker, smoother than M-7 Fresh, but it's fresher and fruitier than M-7. M7 is a much better fragrance, a true oud, but I am more into fresher frags now.

Some Oud lovers I heard say this is their #1 Oud, or top 3. After Creed Royal Oud, this is my #2. TF Oud Wood is richer, and amazing scent, but it's not nearly as wearable, comfortable as Acqua di Parma Oud.
This wears like a rich cologne or reminds me of a fougere, yet it has those beautiful darker notes of oud and leather.
There are some slightly sweet woody notes, maybe the Elemi resin ( tourchwood).

There is a bit of powderiness to it, I don't like powder, but it's nice here, just makes it soft and ads to the wearability.

PS: On second thought, I may not get this. The opening burst of notes was great, but then it quiets down too much, and becomes more of a nice aromatic. So performance and quality of notes not too high. This is only cologne strength, not edt or edp.

Well I did find a good deal and pulled the trigger, it is very wearable and pleasant. Not much oud though, once you get past the openning, it's more of a soft leather, with warm and fresh spiciness, citrus.
Projection is softly moderate, longevity average.

The Intensa Oud is not more intense, it is the same frag.
This is over priced for what you get performance wise. I guess I'm used to finding better discounts, this is not discounted much. It should be around $100 for what you get.
For the great scent alone it's worth a bit more.

PS: I ended up selling my bottle after a few day. I think it's over hyped, not much oud, or leather that you can pick out,
an indistinct synthetic mishmosh.
I purchased Oud Saphir, a high quality fresh Oud and leather frag. It's discounted from $250 retail for $108. on Amazon.

Colonia Oud Acqua di Parma,"Many are lukewarm about this juice, as it seems that anytime a house these days prints the word 'Oud' on a bottle the chips are not stacked in favor of the house for a welcome reception. The word 'Oud' is clearly overused by the industry as a whole, but that is the topic of another post.

The opening of bergamot and orange peel are the primary kicker here and follow this all the way to dry down. ADP do the bergamot orange peel dance very well, all be it in a straight forward manner. Any 'Oud', whatever this rather vague word means, is to be found in a smoky backdrop that informs the orange peel; supports it I suppose in a most lazy sort of way. I use this liberally during the summer months, as i find this scent just forward enough to present a certitude that I find missing from most, if not all, aquatics or citrus bombs that littler the market. Interchange one for another these days, but I digress.

Tom Ford's Oud Wood does this ADP oud's job much better in nearly every way.

Is there something I'm missing here?",08/11/16 10:27,dmetzger

Not a go-to for me; this is a report after finishing a 2 ml decant. I picked it up to compare with my all-time summer favorite (Dior Homme Cologne) and a shoulder-season staple (Bergamote 22).

BdC smells great, especially if you like citrus (I do). It is less “iced lemonade” than Dior Homme Cologne and more like the whole fruit.

TL;DR: A photoreal take on an Italian citrus most of us have not smelled in person. Bright citrus-green opening that settles into a light woody-musky hush. Polite, easy, pleasant, but likely to underwhelm on performance, especially projection.

Rating:
Opening: 4.1/5
Drydown: 2.8/5
Overall: 3.5/5

Opening
Fresh-cut bergamot on a board. Knife through peel and pith, oils mist up with a green-bitter spritz. The interior is ripe enough to read a touch sweet. Sweet, acidic, and green at once. The blend is seamless; I do not see edges between the citrus, ginger, and bergamot. Together they paint a convincing bergamot portrait.

The issue: despite smelling fantastic, it lies flat on my skin. Detectable at about two feet, but it does not seem to want to be smelled. Where Dior Homme Cologne leaps off my skin, this is reticent and almost apologetic.

Heart
No distinct heart notes on me; it stays linear. At about 90 minutes I am still getting that beautiful bergamot, just closer to skin.

For a fresh scent, it is oddly dense, like the aroma is bound up in the fruit’s oil and cannot quite escape.

Drydown
The opening thins to skin level around 3-4 hours. By about 4.5 hours it is a soft, slightly creamy (benzoin?) skin-musk.

A faint musk trace sticks around 6-8 hours, but only with your nose on skin. Nice to wake up to, but no one else will notice.

Performance on me
This gets dunked on online for atrocious longevity. On me it is not atrocious, just not great. About 60-90 minutes of a modest aura, then close to skin. 3-4 hours of practical wear on skin. It is a liberal respray fragrance, and because the musky base is light, you can reapply a few times a day without issue.

Versatility
Wearable anywhere because it is so understated. That same understatement means I will not reach for it often, and it will not justify a full bottle. Too flat, too little projection.

Use cases
Patio brunch where you want to smell nice on the first hug. Business meetings where you want to be pleasant but not noticed as the cologne person. Around home when you want a quiet scent for yourself.

Vibe
Crisp white tee, rolled-sleeve linen, top down on a windy coastal road in a posh red roadster. Polished, sunny, approachable.

Blind-buy safe?
If you like citrus, yes. If you crave projection, no. This is about scent quality, not horsepower.

Comparisons
- **Dior Homme Cologne (2020):** More acidic up top, the famous iced lemonade vibe. BdC smells more like an actual fruit. DHC projects better in the first hour; BdC sits closer but can linger longer as a skin trace.
- **Bergamote 22:** Similar green-bergamot aura, but B22 is brighter from grapefruit and offers a proper second chapter with its vetiver-forward drydown.

Overall take
Bergamotto di Calabria smells wonderful up front, juicy citrus that reads like the whole fruit: bitter skin and sweet juice. It is sheer, not a statement. You will smell pleasant; people around you may not notice. The rub is not just longevity, which is average for a citrus, but the flat projection while it is there.

I like the scent, but with Bergamote 22 and Dior Homme Cologne on my shelf, it is redundant. I would love a cheaper replacement for B22, given it begs liberal resprays.

Context: Four sprays on a warm day (two wrists). Indoors in a warm room, likely less projection and a slightly longer tail. Sprayed on moisturized skin.",09/11/25 13:13,joelajackson
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,Divine lemon opening. More floral and unisex drydown but still beautiful scent. Longevity and projection are not notoriously bad as some people say but the truth is you have to overspray which is not a very big problem as you can get a big bottle relatively cheap. The only downside is that you can get some whiffs of synthetic cleaning product smell from time to time but it is not offensive. Other than that quality is great. My first aqua di Parma and given that is not the most popular i can’t wait to try more. 8/10 easy !,08/11/25 05:43,Ikg90
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Can AdP make a mediocre scent? I think not. So far Mandorlo di Sicilia is the least liked AdP I have smelled, and that is a pretty nice scent. Coming to this scent, bergamot is such a common note yet there's a lot different smelling notes. Anyway, BdC (Bergamotto di Calabria in this review, not Bleu de Chanel) is a scent I really liked. It is quite similar to Mancera Lemon Line, which too I like. The big difference is that Mancera lists lemon but no bergamot, yet smells suspiciously similar initially. The Mancera lasts longer, but the BdC smells nicer, more natual.

Now there's a host of products from insect repellents/bug sprays to floor disinfectants to room freshers that have a similar smelling perfume component so many might be put off by those less ""luxury"" oriented products having similar odor - but if you're willing to see, or smell, past that, this BdC is a beautiful scent.

Longevity is okayish being an EDT concentration scent. Projects well initially, but seems like a skin scent in 2 hrs or less, nothing unusual as that's the case with most EDTs/EDPs from the past 20 years or so.",07/27/25 09:32,Icyspicy
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Today, I'm diving into the final sample I possess from Acqua di Parma's Blu Mediterraneo collection: Bergamotto di Calabria. Based purely on its name, I'm anticipating that bergamot will be the undeniable star of this olfactory journey. While I certainly appreciate bergamot—it's a widely utilized note for very good reason—it's not typically a note I actively seek out in fragrances I ultimately acquire. However, with it poised as the focal point here, I'm hoping for a truly exceptional representation of the note. Will this offering surpass my experience with yesterday's Arancia di Capri? Let's get into it and find out.


Opening:
The opening is a luminous burst of radiant citrus, crisp spiciness, and invigorating freshness. The primary notes that immediately greet my senses are bergamot, citron, ginger, and musk. Bergamot and citron are the undeniable protagonists. The bergamot, as one might instinctively imagine, is the commanding presence in this initial accord. It delivers a citrus vibrancy, underscored by that hallmark aromatic spiciness one expects from a bergamot note, though perhaps not quite as pronounced as some other iterations I've encountered. Following closely is the citron, which amplifies the citrus with a distinctly brighter and zestier character, also carrying with it a subtle hint of rindiness. Next, ginger and musk join the composition. The ginger presents itself as a fresh and invigorating spicy accord, artfully counterbalancing the abundance of citrus-forward notes. Lastly, a whisper of musk lingers in the background, offering a fresh, almost fuzzy tonality, reminiscent of that clean ""fresh laundry"" essence musk can sometimes possess.


Dry Down:
The dry down continues the journey, evolving into a composition that is still predominantly citrusy, distinctly aromatic, and gently woody. The primary notes I discern are bergamot, citron, vetiver, and musk. Bergamot and citron remain the highlights in the dry down. The bergamot still commands attention, retaining its core citrusy accord, but it has become noticeably more aromatic and spicy than it was in the opening. The citron continues its supportive role to the bergamot, offering the same bright and zesty citrus quality, though it now feels rounder and smoother than in its initial presentation. This enduring citrus heart is then joined by vetiver and musk. The vetiver subtly emerges in the dry down, providing a delicate woodiness, beautifully accentuated by a hint of that ""fresh grass"" accord that vetiver notes sometimes carry. Lastly, the musk continues to provide a touch of clean freshness in the background, echoing its presence from the opening.


Performance:
The initial projection is moderate to strong, extending its aura approximately three to four feet. Sillage mirrors this, leaving a scent trail that is certainly noticeable but never overpowering. However, by the three-hour mark, the fragrance had largely receded to a mere whisper on the skin. There was a faint, almost ethereal projection and scent trail, but not enough to truly register.


When to Wear:
Bergamotto di Calabria, as its character suggests, is undeniably a spring and summer fragrance, ideally suited for daytime wear. It possesses an effortless, easy-going vibe, making it a perfect companion for casual outings, any activity enjoyed under the sun, or even a refreshing choice for the gym. Due to that casual nature, I wouldn't consider it appropriate for anything formal or for typical office wear, where a more refined presence might be desired.


Blind Buy:
If you are a devoted admirer of bergamot or simply appreciate bright and invigorating fresh fragrances in general, Bergamotto di Calabria would certainly be worth exploring. Just bear in mind that its fleeting nature means you'll likely need to reapply it if you wish to enjoy its charms throughout the day.


Final Verdict:
What can I truly say about Bergamotto di Calabria? It was, without a doubt, a fresh and vibrant fragrance, with an emphasis on its namesake note. As I've expressed before, bergamot isn't a note that consistently sends me into raptures, and I honestly don't feel that the bergamot in this particular fragrance did anything radically different or groundbreaking compared to other iterations I've encountered. It smells undeniably pleasant, yet it offers nothing particularly special or memorable. My significant disappointment, however, stems from the fact that this fragrance suffers from the exact same Achilles' heel that plagued Arancia di Capri: its performance is notably lackluster. By the time I truly settled in to appreciate the nuances of its dry down, it had already receded to a mere whisper on the skin, making it challenging to discern the individual notes. At least Arancia di Capri, despite its brevity, left me with a truly captivating opening. Needless to say, this is not a fragrance I will be considering for a full bottle purchase. Next on my agenda is the celebrated Colonia line from Acqua Di Parma. It's a collection that enjoys considerable recognition and discussion, and I am earnestly hoping it leaves a more impactful and lasting impression than my experiences with the Blu Mediterraneo line have.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"One of the best smelling fragrances and best bergamot scent ever. There is always a trade off with natural smelling notes and performance. Being the best smelling scent in its category will have the obvious trade off of non-beast performance.

That said I believe most people go nose blind to fragrances early on, it doesnt last ""30 minutes"". I get 6 hours of a soft projecting heavenly scent.

Generally speaking natural notes have weak performance, it has to be enhanced by synthetics which will change the scent so its a compromising battle between the 2.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I have such an ambivalent feeling about this one it's even hard to explain. Lemon and bergamot are in my top 5 notes as I simply love citrus smell, with this one in the opening you get a Mike Tyson KO, jaw-breaking punch of both, it's beautiful.

It starts to dry down and that's where it disappoints a little, the citrus is barely there, flowers kick in with a hint of cedar and ginger. It goes from mascilune/unisex to unisex/female fragrance at this point.

My problem is, you put a bergamot in a name of the fragrance and you get a minute of it, I think the more fitting name would be 'Fiori di Calabresi'. The second thing I noticed, at one point between citrus punch turning into flowery base it smelled like lemon diswashing gel, I think this is why people say it smells 'generic' and 'chemical', it's just a brief moment but you notice it.

It's weak with intimate sillage, it's overpriced, I could get better ones for less value...

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Nice, but underwhelming. I’m surprised at how simplistic this is, given the complexity of Fico di Almalfi. I was expecting the same sort of brilliance in blending.

Opening is a bright citrus with a touch of ginger; it reminds me of this lemongrass soap I have. Very pleasant, but as a personal fragrance, kind of “meh.” The citrus disappears quickly, and I’m left with a fresh, woody floral. Again, lovely, but nothing really unique to set it apart from similar fragrances. Eventually the fragrance dries down to a skin scent.

Performance is abysmal. Stays very close to the skin, and lasts no more than a couple of hours.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"the whole house does italian citrus style like no other. the bergamot here is so lovely.

i agree with the longevity however this is misunderstood as pointed out. stop calling things ''generic''. just a dumb lazy buzz word at this point. like what exactly is generic about it? its a citrus scent, we know. but after you go thru 100 fragrances you might just end up with 3 to 4 with a take on bergamot exactly like this. the note was always a top note. but you are able to enjoy that top note for longer than you usually would albeit it doesn't have any complexity or longevity. it does what it does in the name. try to look past that. fragrances like this have a place in the world. they're meant to give this feeling of refreshment that heavier compositions cannot offer you. even if it was slightly based out more. it wouldn't give you that ultra fresh feeling. these southern italian's know their climate.

it's for when the sun is trying to burn you alive. it cools you down. the heat will give a scent bubble that will come to life and soothe you like angels flapping their wings on you!

but no i 100% get it. it's not worth the money just for that. the blu line are perfect gym scents tho. because of the poor longevity and scent profile. it will make you stand out in that environment like nothing else. and it'll be so comfortable to wear for you and those around during your 1-2 hour work out. the right tool for the job!",09/02/24 11:07,fragrantlyenhanced

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"After having this on my wishlist for a VERY long time, I finally bought this but unfortunately am somewhat disappointed.
First off, I got a 30ml bottle and I hate it. Instead if having the proportions of the larger bottle, it is kindof tall and narrow and abit disappointing. Even the small samples in the discovery kit are the same kindof wider proportion so I don't get it. Anyway, not that important if the fragrance actually performed.
So the fragrance is really nice, I mostly get the bergamot and ginger notes on my skin. It is PERFECT for summer, so refreshing, I tested it out on a hot day in Sicily. However, the performance is where this falls short. It has near to zero projection, pretty much turns into a skin scent after 10 minutes, and I cannot smell it any more after pretty much 1 hour. How they charge such extortionate prices for such disappointing performance is beyond me. It's a pity as I really really REALLY think that if this has more sillage and better lasting power, it would be my go to summer scent. Worth the money? No, I don't think so.
I currently have Mirto di Panarea from the same collection as a tester and will be testing it out soon as apparently it has better staying power, will have to see, but for now I am surely done buying from this range. My next freshie to try shall be Pomelo Riviera from Atelier des Ors.

EDIT: I am trying this again on a hot day (I believe it's like 30degC) and I OVERSPRAYED a little. I am about 1 hour in and I still smell it on me and do not feel the need to reapply.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"It's the first EDT i have brought from this collection, when i was in Doha airport trying to find something suitable for every day fresh scent and i got two suggestions from the counter lady: Fico & Bergamatto then my journey started with the top notes: citron and bergamote then ginger.
This combination gives the fresheness and the zest with a slight sweetness required from happily starting your day for 20-30 minutes- i really hoped if it can stay more longer than this on clothes- then it becomes a skin scent due to Musk and disappering.
scent: 9/10

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance really does citrus so well. This was a blind buy for me, and I’m very satisfied. For me, some citrus’s can come off really screechy and headache inducing, but this is blended very smoothly. I probably wouldn’t wear this unless it’s the summer, but that’s why I bought it, to take with me on vacation and to deal with the high heat.",01/23/24 13:25,Jesse101

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"We are in the midst of a heatwave here in Ireland, so I sprayed this at a department store on a hot day. There is a wide range in the Blu Mediterraneo collection, and I suspect that they are all freshies of some description. I picked this one up at random. Bergamotto di Calabria is a straightforward citrus cologne with a woody-spicy base. It is simple and traditional in structure, perfectly unisex and serves its purpose well - it is very refreshing. However, it is also very fleeting.

BMBdC opens with a radiant citrus accord, zesty and fresh. It is aptly named - bergamot is the dominant note, but there is a hint of lemon. I get a hint of spice, and a soft woodiness emerges as it fades. It develops and fades to nothing extremely quickly though - it is one of the most ephemeral scents I've come across. Sillage is intimate and longevity is very weak.

Pleasant but pretty generic, this is let down by its abysmal performance, and is overpriced for what it is despite not being too expensive. Just buy a big bottle of 4711 EDC instead and be done with it. 2/5.",09/07/23 12:58,Enrium
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"#194 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""

Fleeting, ephemeral, evanescent, fugitive, momentary, transient, transitory, passing so quickly as to make apprehending it difficult. Translation: The performance totally sucks. Seriously. It won't last long enough for you to tie your tie. I've long since learned reviewers on here really tend to overrate the fragrances. Everyone who gave this lemon water a higher rating than 2.00 would probably give five stars to a bottle of BODman. Are you kidding me? The performance here is ""Yachtman"" bad, but at least with those scents you're only out like $5.95. I have now tried every AdP ""Blu Mediterraneo"" scent and I'll save you time. ""Blu Mediterraneo Mandorlo Di Sicilia"" isn't a complete waste of money. But you can go on Gift Express, sort on price, buy any scent that's under $10, I guarantee the performance will be as good or better than this Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto. Adidas, Jaguar, Cuba Paris. Okay, maybe not every Cuba Paris, but ""Copacabana"" at least works as a bathroom deodorizer.",08/05/23 05:54,JusttheFactsMan

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Probably one of the weakest perfomers out there even for Blu Mediteranneo standards. That said it's very clean, lemony and a no-brainer for summer if you don't mind the performance. Opens with sharp and almost alcholic bergamot, then it settles for ginger and vetiver. Can't detect florals or the cedar. Surprisingly, I get wafts of it during the day and in the gym, but it is as faint as it gets. Safe to overspray as it is so light and borderline undetectable, but in the end it settles for a nice lemon-candy-esque smell. I also get whiffs of lime every now and then.

Got mine from a discounter and the price for 150 ml was a steal, so I'll let it macerate a bit, perhaps it will improve with time.

I detect a slight resemblance with Fico di Amalfi in the dry down that I suspect is benzoin. Sadly the worst performing fragrance out of this collection I have tried, and the collection is not exactly known for good longevity and performance. If you wanted to smell like this all day, you would have to reapply every 30 minutes for your fragrance to actually be detectible in the air and not only sit on the skin.

It could possibly be a cheaper option that would satisfy me as this is not cheap, especially being an EDT - the bergamot sparkles but doesn't last.

Opens with realistic bergamot, dries down becomes a very relaxing smooth vetiver with some flowers and the remaining the bitter juicyness of bergamot from top notes.

I got very weak performance. 1 hour of good projection with bright and clear notes then quickly transform into smooth super close skin scent and completely disappear in 3 hours.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I own, if not all, then almost all, the Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo line of fragrances and this one has become my favorite of the bunch. Reasonable projection (sillage) for a citrus, especially in the first 30-60 minutes––at least this seems to be the case for me in warm weather, as summer is the only season I've had the opportunity to wear it in so far. An invigorating citrus, though subtly, artfully tweaked by just the right balance of just the right selection of secondary, underlying scents (e.g., ginger, cedar, floral). To my mind, this arguably makes it something of a minor masterpiece. One way I enjoy it is applying it in the last couple hours of my late night work shift on top of almost anything I put on earlier that day, which, by that point, is pretty far into the drydown stage.

[Side note: When it comes to longevity, citrus scents are typically weak, and often very weak. It just comes with the territory. If you're buying a citrus fragrance––any citrus fragrance––don't do so for longevity. The easy solution, however, is just reapply every couple hours and enjoy that just-like-the-first-time application all over again.]",08/16/22 21:36,MidwesternGothic

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I like this fragrance, I've now worn it multiple times to get a better sense of it: the opening is a strong citrus blast, it feels like someone just squeezed a lime into a cocktail, it's very pleasant though and not at all artificial feeling.

When it settles down the citrus smell remains but becomes more muted, after a few hours I'm left with a very fresh, clean smell. Almost like someone used some imaginary super-high-end laundry detergent that doesn't actually exist but I wish did. In the final stages it smells quite similar to Mirto di Panarea but just a bit lighter/fresher.

Longevity is questionable. What turns me off most about this fragrance is that I definitely sense that it’s more feminine than unisex, most likely due to the heavy floral mid-base. It does remind me of one of my female friends in high school who would basically douse herself with heavily floral fragrances every morning before class, and her smell would make me gag once she was within a 10-foot radius from me.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Regarding the issue of poor longevity I have noticed that if you spray on your clothes it actually lasts a long time, and with decent sillage (I think, I don't really understand how you're supposed to know that yourself, and with a lack of friends to ask I just have to guess). You have to spray around 5 times though, and have an undamaged sense of smell to get to enjoy this lovely smell for a long while.

I have read quite a lot of reviews of perfumes I own myself where people complain that it's gone in an hour when my experience is quite different, which makes me wonder; could it be that some people are so used to strong and in-your-face synthetic scents (like for example Invictus, the smell of that literally makes me sick) that their noses get damaged to the point where they simply can't smell softer and - in my view - lovelier scents like this one.

The performance sucks a bit, however. It lasts for about 3 hours and the sillage is somewhere in between intimate and moderate for the first hour, then it becomes very intimate. This makes the perfume a little bit overpriced imo but if you don't care that much about the value, the scent is worth it.

it does not remind me of bergamot, but of citrus scents in general. like a bit Sicilian lemon- watered lemonade and then ginger, spices, maybe a hint of cypress far far away...but citrusy, above all.
very light, discrete, but above all, fresh and clean. it is the kind of scent I wear after a bath, on a hot day, to feel clean.
it is unissex and definitely not the type of fruity - sensuous type of fragrance that we smell everywhere these days.

An update two years later. I love the scent, citrusy, fresh, self explanatory. It doesn't claim to be something it isn't. Perhaps the longevity.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Alright let's talk about the elephant in the room first. As you can see from votes and reviews, the longevity on this sucks.

I own and have smelled lots of citrus fragrances, and this is one of the best and most natural I've ever smelled.

The only way this makes sense is if you get a BIG bottle and you get it for cheap. I paid 50$ for 5 ounces. You will need an atomizer to carry in your pocket or purse.

I think of this like an Italian Sports car.
It's not practical, it's got no room for groceries, it gets terrible gas mileage, and it breaks all the time.
However, it's beautiful, people love it, and when it's not broken, it's a blast to drive!

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,Love the cirtucy smell but its too weak.I barely could smell it after i smelled other fragrances of the blu line.I think its the weakest.Too expensive for what it is.I would buy it only for me to smell it for no reason when i am at home :P.,07/16/21 14:01,sk_99
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"My absolute favorite ADP. This one is all about the beautiful lemony, musky, powdery, soapy dry down that is so warm and clean. Although I wouldn't describe it as gourmand it does very much remind me of a creamy lemon sherbet. It’s the kind of smell that just feels soft and comfortable. Everyone complains about longevity but I find a few extra sprays gets the job done nicely. But yes, it's certainly not the best performance and I do wish it was stronger.",07/14/21 20:19,PapaTLooch
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I live in Atlanta, and this is perfect for the VERY humid and sticky summer here. It does EXACTLY what I want, and while many others criticize it, what they find to be vices, I consider to be virtues.

I have moved almost exclusively to niche fragrances, and to my nose, this doesn't smell like ANY of the designer fragrances out there. It has the best, most NATURAL citrus scent I have EVER smelled (and I am 60 yrs old). Here in Atlanta in the summertime, the morning may start out cool to warm, but by afternoon the weather has changed to humid and hot. When the air itself feels like an extra layer of clothing, I want zero scent, it's just not needed. So with this, I spray on my neck and back of my head, then when I get dressed I spray more on my shirt (upper chest, shoulders), and yes it does move to a skin scent within a few hours, which is what I wanted as the day gets warmer, and what remains on my shirt hangs around and informs the rest of the day. So while others don't like the way it performs, I love it. The smell is very fresh and light, perfect for humid days.

If you're hesitant, get a sample, but honestly, this is a really great citrus scent for morning, office or casual environments.",06/24/21 13:42,Gabriél_de_ATL
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I like this but wish it had more backbone for better performance.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Absolutely stunning scent. So fresh and natural smelling. Smells exactly like a lemon lime sorbet to me. It is a light fragrance but not so light it’s not worth purchasing. I managed to acquire the 150ml bottle for a great price and so don’t feel bad spraying heavy.

Also, got compliments from this a couple of hours after applying - so it has some longevity and projection.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Super natural lemon and bergamot smell without any of that synthetic background noise. Quite alcoholic and sharp in the first 10 seconds, but very pleasant overall. It's a real shame that while they use real bergamot in this, it does not project at all and is gone in i kid you not, 15 minutes. As someone who never has longevity issues it was honestly surprising given that ADP usually last 3 hours minimum on my skin. What a shame, I might need to overspray.",03/08/21 21:13,Kloppo
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"This is one of my favorite fragrances of all time. I love citrusy fresh fragrances. The opening is bright, juicy, zesty. I don't feel it smells like lemon cleaning products at all. For me this is one of the longest lasting citrus fragrance I have ever tried (which is saying something because I have tried many, and citrus fragrances typically have poor staying power). I could get a probably 8 hours out of this one which was amazing. Unisex but does not smell ""masculine"" for you gals out there who haven't tried this.",01/30/21 11:08,fragrances-fanatic

Uplifting and joyful , opens with the radiant freshness of Citron and Italian bergamot , combined with the vibrant notes of ginger , cedarwood , the preciousness of vetiver , musk and benzoin.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I like it enough to finish the whole bottle but no matter how many spray or how close to my neck I apply it, I can barely smell anything after 2-3 hours. It is a refreshing but fleeting fragrance.

the opening as expected is citrusy bergamot with notes of woodiness and slightly herbaceous. If you like Aesop Tacit, you might like this for some days when you want something more breezy and easygoing. Wears well in hot climate, doesn't turn acidic on my skin. It's a no-brainer inoffensive fragrance, so I usually pack this for my business trips.

Personally I find it rather overpriced for its' performance. It lacks character and uniqueness. It's pleasant enough for one bottle commitment but honestly after finishing, I won't replace it.",12/04/20 07:26,fragrancemusing
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"One of my favorite smelling citruses ever. It's seriously amazing. However, it's one of the weakest fragrances I've ever tried. If you buy this, you have to understand that this is a true eau de cologne, meant only to be fleeting and subtle. It might leave a light, pleasant scent on your collar. It is not meant to be loud or to project or to leave a trail at the office. This one is for your enjoyment only.",10/20/20 07:26,agonzony
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I love this fragrance but it's so weak! When you first spray it onto the skin, it's a sparkling, uplifting citrus, like a cold lemonade on a hot summer day. It's brigh and sunny to the point where you want to bathe in the thing. :) It dries down quickly to something I can't put my finger on (maybe the cedar?). And then it just disappears. It's almost gone in less than an hour. So sad, I really want to buy this full size but can't justify the price as I will most probably finish a whole bottle in a week.",09/15/20 01:50,MaquiLab

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"On my skin after about an hour or so, this literally smells like paper money 🤔 does anyone else get this impression while wearing it?

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I remember testing this fragrance at Bloomingdales where the salesman took me on a tour of Italy by way of the Blu Mediterraneo line. This one is nice, but the real standout to me was Chinotto di Ligurio. I don't have a ton to say about this--it's soft and gentle, a bit like freshly washed clothes in lemon detergent. I applied at 8:00 am or so and now at 10:00 am it's little more than a wisp and I'm straining to pick up the notes. Seems like a good inoffensive fragrance for setting a sunny mood for some weekend household chores, but not enough of a knockout to convince me to buy a whole bottle.",08/14/20 08:05,beamkath
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Squeezed bergamot

This is not just the oil from inside of a bergamot. It's the whole fruit plus it's leaves and even the tree itself. The sourness and bitterness from the green leaves and bergamot is obvious.
After an hour flowers, musk and cedar goes hand in hand to fill the place of bergamot and citron and make the perfume a bit sweet and deep.
Unfortunately (for me) it has a soapy cleanness which I think was not necessary and because of this feature I think there is an unnecessary pumped up sweetness to this fragrance which could be more toned down and it could lead to a more natural scented fragrance.

It's suitable for every and each occasion in summer and spring. It doesnt last long but it is enough and the sillage is normal and acceptable for such a fragrance.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance smells fantastic! The best-smelling bergamot fragrance I have come across. However, the longevity is DISMAL. This fragrance does not even last for one hour. I could just about justify the price when I first bought it 1 1/2 years ago. At that time, it cost $105. Since then, in less than 2 years time, the price has gone up by $15 to $120. No way is this fragrance worth $120 when it doesn't even last 1 hour. $105 was pushing it, but $120 is a ridiculous price for such a poor-performing fragrance. When I finish my bottle, I will not be repurchasing even though I adore the scent. The longevity just does not justify the price of $120.",04/26/20 04:44,Cloudburst2000

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I absolutely adore the smell of this fragrance for those hot summer months. A nice zing from the bergamot and citron with the ginger and woody notes peeking through. This is favorite type of citrus fragrance. However, like everyone else has stated, the last power is pretty abysmal. It lasts about an hour on me and that is with multiple sprays (six or seven). I was willing to pay $105 for the 50ml bottle but even that was a stretch since the fragrance is so short-lived. Well, the fragrance has apparently gone up $15 since I bought it two summers ago. No way in heck am I paying $120 for a fragrance that lasts one hour, no matter how awesome it smells. ADP needs to get their heads out of their rears. Yes, the fragrance smells superb but hardly anyone will buy it for that price considering the poor performance. They should either adjust prices accordingly or figure out how to make the fragrance last longer.",02/23/20 15:52,Cloudburst2000
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Perfectly pleasant scent, however for me it smells like citrus candy and old ladies.

The Bergamot is front and center and does smell delicious, but reminds me a bit too much of candy. And then there are some notes in the background that for some reason immediately remind me of my dear old aunt - may her soul rest in peace.

Nothing wrong with any of this of course, but for me as a 39 year old man I really don't have any interest in wearing it and smelling like this.",02/06/20 12:24,Tamlin
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"I keep searching for a great bergamot scent but this one won't be it.

I absolutely love bergamot and when I first smelled this I thought I had a winner. Kept smelling myself on my way out of the store... a few minutes later and it started to vanish. After 30 minutes it was gone.

The opening was so good that I decided to give it a second try. This time it was warmer outside. I got only slightly better performance - again less than an hour!

It's a shame but I can only see this working on really warm weather. At its pricetag it's definitely a pass.",09/12/19 09:45,FloidnScotch
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Took this perfume with me on my holiday to the south of France as my only scent for 2 weeks.
Absolutely the most beautiful bergamot fragrance I've ever smelled. Such a shame that it doesn't last at all!

It does have some projection the first 15-30 minutes but after that, it gets really close to the skin.
You will have to overspray this before anyone else with notice you got anything on. Sprayed 10 times one day before a road trip and it didn't clog up the whole cabin. Actually had my family in the car and for any other fragrance they would have kicked me out for having to much on, but this time they didn't even say anything about it. And that should tell you more about the poor performance than the smell.

Won't be buying a new bottle after my 30ml runs out... and it will soon, as I need to use so goddamn many sprays every time, just for it to perform a little.

EDIT: Finished the bottle as we had some warm days here in the late spring. I can not stress enough how good I think the smell is. It also performs a little better when it's not super hot outside... But it still sits very close to the skin.",08/15/19 14:14,SebastianSmellsGreat

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Nice bergamot, realistic. As for the smell, this one is very unisex, round. Unfortunately I confirm it has poor performance, unacceptable for the price it retails. (a simple summer days eau de cologne shouldn't cost more than $50 for 100ml at online discounters)

For these reasons, I cannot recommend this one, and for a more masculine take on bergamot and a big step-up in terms of quality and performance, I would suggest to go for Zegna Italian Bergamot (the new EDP, not the discontinued EDT). Obviously, it's also a step up in terms of pricing, but with a bit of patience, it will show up in 1-2 years at discounters.

If you don't have patience, I would suggest to go for Zegna Acqua di Bergamotto or Guerlain AA Bergamote Calabria instead, which both do the same job (with similar poor performance) and both currently retails around $30-40 for a large bottle online.

For a more feminine take on Bergamot, I cannot recommend enough Atelier Cologne Bergamote Soleil.

In summary, AdP Bergamotto di Calabria: good, but overpriced compared to the competition given what it delivers. A pass for me.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Opening with the most amazing bergamot note you will ever experience in your whole life, just to disappear 5 minutes later.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,The opening is such a realistic Bergamot it's quite incredible. 100% for the hot weather when fragrances are amplified by the heat. The longevity issues are REAL with this one.,03/29/19 06:44,RWF
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Treat this like an eau de cologne and you may not be as disappointed as you otherwise would have been. It is bright, happy and juicy. Quality is there but you have to weigh the pros and cons.

Pro: As a lover of bergamot it hits the spot. It's the only citrus scent I crave more of and want to repurchase a bottle of, nothing else delivers on the promise of fresh, happy, bright citrus like this.

Con: The bottle goes very fast as a result of poor projection and longevity. I used up a full 75 ml bottle in under a year, which is unheard of seeing as most of its play was seen during summer. It needs to be sprayed at least 6 times per use to be worth while. Reapplication is necessary throughout the day.

Pro: Quality ingredients and natural scent, it is such a pleasure to wear. It's not piercing or synthetic like other citruses can be. It's light enough and perfect for high heat. Love the bottles too.

I adore this fragrance. I wish it stuck around longer, but I trust Acqua Di Parma know what they're doing. Compared to other brands who push edc's for roughly the same price, Acqua Di Parma is winning in my books. They're a classy brand who don't rely on bells and whistles to sell their products, they just make good perfume on the basis of quality and simplicity. I'm a big fan.",03/22/19 16:37,Swedelish

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"This is a citrus bomb on my skin with a hint of ginger but no other notes. It lasts in cold weather (50 degrees) at least 6 hours on my extremely dry skin and has a nice scent trail for several hours. I live in the Arizona desert so it is hot most of the year here. I’m unsure how this fragrance does above 90 degrees but I bought it in November when we were still in 90s and it lasted about 4 hours as strong skin scent. I love it! I plan to buy the lotion and shower gel to increase time it lasts. Not sure why other reviewers had bad luck with it.

This is unisex and a safe blind buy. I receive compliments and zero complaints on scent. FragranceNet.com sells samples which is how I tested it first before buying it on sale.",01/05/19 16:42,Dawnfiller
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria is a citrus aromatic. It projects with a stingy zesty citrus accord, between bergamot and citron. It's awakening, invigorating, and has a touch of candy-like sweetness to it. Not sure what the concentration here is, but the aroma dies down hard after the opening, and shortly after is very hard to pick up (unless presumably you have a virgin nose).

I think this one had so much more potential for greatness, but possibly Acqua di Parma is playing hard ball here, and doesn't wish to cater to the underlying problems of people. Instead, they might be taking a page out of Ralph Lauren's book, and are seeking to force people into finding a more effective solution for their problems (in the sense of some olfactory rejuvenation therapy). Although the formula here is a bit simple and linear, the fragrance is so good that it would probably be well worth the effort. That's just the classic style of Italian cologne.

You could always bathe in it I guess, but not sure how popular that's going to make you with all those sensitive noses out there amongst the crowd. I really enjoy this one for its style and flare, and would suggest just wearing it on the skin, so that you can freshen up regularly without it becoming overbearing to anyone.",12/10/18 00:28,ReapThaWhirlwind
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Citrus fizzle. Looks like it's unanimous then - I smelled this without reading any of the reviews here and had exactly the same experience. Soaringly gorgeous, bright, zingy, tingly, sunny, fresh-air bergamot, exactly that delicious tang that makes good Earl Grey tea so refreshing. Just beautiful. Puts a smile on your face and makes you think of clear blue skies. Perfectly unisex, utterly charming. And this after I've had a string of failures with other AdPs which looked great on paper but turned too cheap / butch / aftershave-y to work on my female skin.

Drawback: lasts for an hour, at most. Aaaargh! Che fiasco! In a perfect universe maybe I'd buy a one-litre bucket of this and spritz myself with it hourly. In this one, AdP have scored an own goal making Bergamotto di Calabria, because it's persuaded me I really need a bergamot perfume for summer 2019 and I want to explore the note further, but I know for sure I won't be paying out for AdP's take on it.",11/01/18 16:40,trabuquera
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Yes it smells good, Its a go if you like bright crispy scents..

The bad, the performance is just bad, doesn't last. Maybe a 30 minute blast of citrus, ginger and cedar, then nothing at all on the skin. You'll have to spray every hour .

I wanted this for the longest time . It's pricey and honestly, a mockery of a perfume.
Water with a few drops of bergamotte oil . Divine, zingy, sublime, for all the 30 seconds it lasts . After that it changes into a skin scent that lasts a little more, and then it vanishes without a trace . Even on clothes is gone in no time.
Absurd, and I was so expensive. I am really pissed off for wasting my birthday money on this . If I was the perfumerer who creates this , I'd be embarrassed . Seriously, not even worth $20, as for what I paid for it is simply obscene . $156 Ripoff. I am never buying another Blue Mediterraneo Edt, Never.
That being said, the smell, when you can actually smell it, it's the most natural lime and bergamotte you could dream of. I have a bottle of essential bergamotte oil next to me, they are very similar. Except that the oil was one tenth of the price of the perfume. So I guess I'll need to mix this edt with some essential oil and hope it becomes strong .... what a pity. It could have been the perfect summer fragrance . And keep in mind that I usually prefer not so strong fragrances.
My recommendation ? Don't buy . I did and I regret it. Swap anyone ? 150 ml bottle, with box, booklet, everything .",05/27/17 06:35,Happyme2009

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"If only this (and many others from this house) worked on my skin, I'd be a very happy man.
I get very little from this beautiful fragrance. Very little at all. Spray, sniff - gone!

It's a recurring annoyance for me with the house of Acqua di Parma. Classy and wonderful as most of them that I've tried are, I am always left feeling somewhat disappointed.
I love the smells but the strength is wasted on me.

I have tried all the Blu Mediterraneo collection and (most of the) Colonia collection too and none of them last more than an hour on my skin giving me practically no projection / sillage. I mean, like nothing.

Sure, I get the amazing smells and adorable flavours they permit but they are nothing more than a skin scent on me. Maybe it's my DNA, although I have seen other similar comments.

It's for those reasons that I find them far too expensive and over-priced for what they offer you as a buyer. I've spent a small fortune buying some of these fragrances but sadly, I simply can't afford to justify making the same mistake again.

Yes, I know many people will strongly disagree with me and mention that we shouldn't expect all fragrances to be powerhouses, sending passers-by into an olfactory frenzy; but I definitely want something more to show for my money than what Acqua di Parma have offered me to date.

Yes the performance is certainly not the best, but this is one of those rare moments for me when the overall effect of the fragrance makes up for it's performance woes IMO.

It does remind me slightly of Sel de Vetiver but only briefly. It also reminds me of Dior Homme Cologne to some extent, but it is better to my nose than the Dior. It reminds me of many fragrances in part, however none capture the magic that this possesses for me.

This is what I might have imagined Grace Kelly to waft of in ""To Catch a Thief"", though I realize the movie was in Nice.

The staying power is horrendous, which i am assuming is due to the bright opening which never really goes away. I'm not sure how anyone can justify paying the price of this fragrance for such lame longevity.

I will say if it lasted longer and has better performance, I would have to give in and buy it.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria is a very pleasant citron scent with some bergamot and lime which sits next to the skin. As the lemony notes mostly fade away after an hour or two, it becomes a very gentle woody musk. It's very delicate but it does last quite a long time, around 6 or 7 hours before it starts to vanish properly off the skin.

Bergamotto di Calabria is the nicest of the Blu Med range by far. It's flexible in that it works day or night and any time of year and for any occasion. I like the bottle and the packaging too. However, I do think it is overpriced. The Blu Med range feels more like a marketing gimmick by AdP to get the cash registers ringing. The revivification of the company in the last twenty years has led to lots of new lines but very little of genuine top class merit for the money. BdC is a genuine unisex perfume and you could use it straight out the shower, getting back from work, going to bed, just about anything you want that relies on subtlety and discretion. If you want to make an impression or just smell your perfume after an hour, then it's not the one.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria is a straightforward lemon and bergamot fragrance on me. The citrus is aromatic and gently sweetened.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Amazing..!! The Acqua di Parma line is incredible and a “best kept secret” for fragrance perfumers…

I was reminded this morning of the clean and fresh feeling of wearing Acqua di Parma’s, Bergamotto di Calabria. This juice is good..!! Out of the bottle, you get the initial blast of bergamot notes followed by the dry-down into an extraordinary blend of citrus, ginger, green, and a whisper of vetiver notes. Somehow, I have managed to accumulate nine (9) of the Acqua Di Parma fragrances – each unique and amazing in their own identity, but all share a common citrus DNA. While Bergamotto di Calabria (BdC) is geared toward Spring and Summer wear, it does offer great flexibility during this timeframe – from casual outings to more formal events. I find that BdC lingers close to the body and unfortunately, last only about four (4) hours on me and clothing. But during that 4 hour window – whoa, this juice is good stuff.. Given the brevity and low sillage of the fragrance, I would suggest that BdC is “office safe” and will add that based on the note composition, BdC is totally unisex.

My final tally for Bergamotto di Calabria is 4.0 stars out of 5.0 stars. It is classy, refined, and will leave the wearer feeling clean and fresh. If this fragrance only had greater staying power, definitely a Top 5 fragrance. Based on my increased confidence level while wearing today, BdC comes with a solid recommendation to add to your collection and is a definite “love” in the fragrance community…

Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…",06/22/15 15:05,OCNBreeze7
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Bergamotto di Calabria Acqua di Parma,"Bergamotto di Calabria embraces the semi-bitterness of the eponymous bergamot note, which stands out above all else and is mainly paired with a musk base.

I haven't tried many fragrances that rely solely on bergamot, not coupling it with another citrus or top note, but this is almost a refreshlingy bitter take on a citrus-heavy fragrance. Its opening only is slightly saltier and more acidic than its dry down. Longevity and projection are on par with most other ADP fragrances, good but not great.

Most reviews cite similarities to Dior Homme so I'd have to try that to compare, but as it stands, this is a pleasant warm weather day fragrance. Still debatable if it merits the Acqua di Parma price, cheaper designer options notwithstanding, but something that I imagine most men and some women could pull off in the summer especially. I probably wouldn't opt to buy this as I get a similar-enough experience from the cheap, grapefruit-based Elixir White by C.O. Bigelow, but some may find ADP BdC more compelling.

Unfortunately, this is all that one can appreciate, as the accompanying notes are so far relegated to the background as to be nonexistent. I am only able to note subtle nuances of ginger far into the dry down, which does pair nicely with the intense citrus. Rose and cedar are lost on me. Lastly, barely perceptible vetiver (here capturing its lemony and woody facets) is noted several minutes after applying. Like most other citrus based fragrances, its tenacity and sillage are weak.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"THREE

I went on a mission this summer to try neroli-forward traditional colognes. I hoped to find something fresh that fits a casual T-shirt vibe for Westside LA. I grabbed 5 ml decants of Neroli Portofino, Mandarino di Amalfi, Colonia Essenza, and Colonia Pura and wore them throughout the heat. Pura ended up my favorite of the bunch. The twist is that the whole “neroli cologne” lane ended up reading formal to me. Pura is less formal, which leaves it in a tricky spot. When I want a dressy cologne, I would reach for Mandarino di Amalfi, and for truly casual, I would go outside the lane. I’m sure I’ll finish off the decant next summer, but won’t re-buy.

TL;DR: Easier-going Essenza energy with an ozonic, airy opening, then a smoother floral-citrus where orange shows more than expected, finishing in a clean woody-musk that sits close. Clean, modern, polite. Casual feel in a traditionally formal genre. It does evolve from opening to heart to drydown; not wildly, but enough to feel like a journey. Probably a good wardrobe piece for someone who likes this scent profile, less so for me.

Rating:

Opening: 3.1/5
Drydown: 2.8/5
Overall: 5.9/10

Opening
Early ozonic hit. Petitgrain pushes a clear soapiness on my skin, stronger than I prefer. I had hoped that skipping neroli would avoid that effect, but petitgrain plus white musks and airy florals creates the same “Cheap McDonalds Soap Dispenser” vibe (how my nose reads heavy neroli). It feels like a softer, friendlier Essenza that stays in the classic cologne mold, just airier. As the soapiness settles inside the first half hour, a gentle orange facet unexpectedly comes forward.

Heart
From about 60 to 120 minutes, it is an easier floral-citrus that is smooth and tidy, with a light herbal thread. The coriander note blends with the florals and reads greener than Essenza. It is pleasant and feels purposefully “traditional cologne” while clearly offering a unique take.

Drydown
By hour 5, you are in a clean woody-musk of cedar, soft patchouli, and white musks. It does not project much, but it has more presence than the airy opening suggests. Quietly masculine and easy to carry into evening. The core trace lingers to about 7 hours, mostly at skin level.

Performance on me
Polite, but strong for the genre. About 1.5 to 2 hours of aura, then close to skin. Roughly 5 to 7 hours total, with the last stretch as a subtle skin scent. I’d catch scents of it through the day if I applied it to my wrists if I was hand talking.

Versatility
High in theory and trickier in practice. The DNA says formal, but it wears casual on me. I would use it for a T-shirt-and-shorts creative meeting, although I still prefer other summer picks for that slot.

Use cases
Office days, client coffees, brunch where you want the first hug to smell clean. School events and travel days, anywhere conservative etiquette helps.

Vibe
White tee, good jeans, fresh haircut. It’s clean and modern, but not “too cool”. This is the well dressed guy who's wearing a white t-shirt tucked into jeans with a crew cut. He looks good, smells good, but doesn't have too much main character energy. The cooler dude with messy hair who may be stealing your girl is probably wearing Neroli Portofino.

Blind-buy safe?
No. I think this whole genre requires testing. Won’t perform well enough for some. Florals won’t land for others. Too mature for yet others. Give it a decant if you want a clean, modern feeling cologne that replaces some of the “Floral!” with ozone and aldehydes.

Comparisons
Colonia Essenza: Sharper, dressier, more neroli-forward snap and more obvious soapiness. Pura is softer and airier, a modernized take.
Tom Ford Neroli Portofino: Louder orange-blossom soap. Next to NP, Pura reads less soapy and more airy and orange-clean. Less floral, more white-musk and ozonic.
Tom Ford Mandarino di Amalfi: Juicier mandarin and grapefruit with *mint, basil, and thyme. More sparkly and aromatic in the heart; less overtly soapy than **Pura. Dries down to light citrus-aromatic over musks and woods, while Pura turns cleaner and more white-musk polished.
Dior Homme Cologne (2020): Brighter “iced-lemonade” citrus and better early projection. Pura trades fizz for tidiness.
Le Labo Bergamote 22: Greener, grapefruit-tinged bergamot with a diffusive *musky-woody* halo and a clearer vetiver and cedar second act. B22 radiates more, while Pura stays closer and cleaner. It still has a three-phase evolution, just subtler.

Conclusion

Colonia Pura threads the needle between classic Italian cologne polish and modern, low-key cleanliness. It was my favorite of the group, yet it is the least “me,” because it lives between dressy and casual. If you want that perfect just-showered aura without orange-blossom drama, this nails it. If you want sparkle, volume, or a signature flourish, reach for Bergamote 22, Dior Homme Cologne, or Mandarino di Amalfi. For hot days when you want to look put together without trying, Pura delivers exactly what it promises.

I think it's within the unisex range, but the sweetness is high pitch, so someone taking a cautious first step toward sweet instead of rugged probably should start elsewhere. Like many freshies, Colonia Pura doesn't last. To its credit, it's not a repeat of everything. The fruity mixture moves beyond citrus, so it smells more like an oceanside farmer's market. Thus, the bright open is a bit green, ozonic, and marine. The brief later phases are floral, then ozonic again, and woodsy. In addition to being short, the journey is all over the place, if pleasant and evocative. There are two catches: First, this is sweeter than my favorites, so I wonder if I'd find it cloying after repeated wear. Second, the short jasmine stage was potent, so I'd only wear this when staying in instead of risking trouble for people with allergies. Still, if you're looking for something uplifting, brightly sweet, and slightly romantic that might surprise you, I'd give this a try.",12/22/24 12:30,JimmyMisfit
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Imagine relaxing in a Private Yatch with family and friends during summer, that was the image that came to mind when smelling this fragrance. To Describe in One word, this Scent is Rejuvenating. Opening with a Bright-sweet-juicy Begamotte-Orange note, accompanied by the ozonic notes which give "" Light airy"" quality that that gives it a subtle radiance touch, It dries down to this smooth Powdery Floral shower gel scent that further dies down to this woody musky base. In my humid and equitoral(burning hot) climate, Longevity i get 4-5 hrs, projection is Moderate for the first 1 hr, before drying down to somemore intimaite, though i still get wiffs of myself occasionaly around the 2-3hr mark.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Such a fresh and citrusy fragrance with some floral aspects to it, though not so floral that it leans feminine but also not too masculine in the dry down.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Went to a store a few days ago (galeries lafayette) and was surprised to see AdP and even more surprised to see that some of their perfumes were available for testing !

Short story, I've been trying to recreate an amateur homemade version of Colonia Pura for years now without pulling of something good. I have quite a few chemical and essential oils to do so. And by essential oils I mean real ones : bio ones from France and Italy. After years of searching, reading and learning the marketing of AdP about this one.

What a deception.
First : this is a two stages scent, citrus for 1 to 2 hours and then soap at skin scent range.
Second : fake, chemical citrus here. Not bergamote, not orange and definitly not petigrain. Having all of them (really good, pure essential oils quality), the opening of Colonia Pura is none of those. Just a disapointing generic chemical lemon, like candy lemon without the sugar.
Third : marketing bullblabla. There is no narcissus, jasmin (who I recognise immediatly for the real essential oil, very strong and amazing, and expenssive. So just Hedione ?), cedar (not atlas, not virginian, not others, so just Iso e super ?), and definitly not patchouli. I don't say they are not here, just you can't smell of feel them. Just soap.
Final : the dry down, after 1 or 2 hours of chemical lemon, just the soap is remaining. Good or bad it is up to you but on me, just a generic hotel lemon soap. The in between is ok you get the soap through the citrus fast but there is nothing else here. No ozone, no flowers. Soap. And after 4 to 6 hours it is turning bad on my skin, almost yuky.

Happy not to have blind bought this one !

Tldr, what a deception for a cologne at that price and marketed so fresh and with some naturals. Not good and definitly not natural, just lemon soap.",10/29/24 03:03,fragrangc
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"ADP should be put in the category of those cheap fragrances because they are so bad in terms of longevity and projection and too expensive for their quality, we only pay for the brand name and the presentation of the box, and as for the smell, it's ok, just don't last longer than 10 minutes...",10/12/24 11:32,googlex_33
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The opening of this is wonderful, the ozonic note really elevates the citrus, but sadly this pleasant phase lasts maybe 15 minutes. Then nuclear jasmine kicks in, overpowering everything else. Despite having very different body chemistry and preferences, both me and my partner experienced the middle notes as extremely unpleasant and a bit sickening. The jasmine is really persistent and long lasting, I had to wash it off and could still smell hints of it after. I didn't get to experience the drydown. People who have issues with jasmine turning bad on them should stay clear of this.",10/04/24 13:39,twojtrener
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I love this scent. It’s summer. It’s classy. As always with ADP bottles it looks the part too.

Observations about longevity are not unfounded, it’s steady, you need to reapply before lunch and mid afternoon if you want to keep the thing alive, and it isn’t going to fill a room, but it will ooze classy and rich summer vibes to those within your sphere, and that’s ok with me. It will always be in my arsenal, I love it, and those in my life do too… and that’s all that matters. You could reach for this after the gym, at the poolside, on a summer night… it’s an all rounder. It would never be mistaken for generic in my view, it’s too classy and sophisticated for that, too expensive smelling, but it’ll never offend and never let you down…

In terms of the profile, it’s citrusy but has an undercurrent of earthiness and jasmine… it’s vibrant and playful in a way, but really elegant. Others have commented that it’s a chinos and yacht kind of vibe, and I whole heartedly agree with that, and who doesn’t want to smell like they’ve just egressed their yacht?!

Overall, a respectable 8/10, if it projected a little more it’d be a 9 or more, but the score is like the scent, decent, worthy.",08/23/24 15:32,NickTheGreek1
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"#803 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""

I will never understand why anyone spends more than $35 on a citrus freshie and this scent has not changed my mind. I tried every one of the Blu Mediterraneo line. Performance is always terrible for any citrus freshie but those set a new low. Absolute waste of money every one of them. Performed like an $8 Cuba Paris scent. Hell, the Nautica's, Chrome's, Ferrari's, even Adidas performed better. This scent far outperforms those AdP blues, but it's still just a ""me too"" among the hundreds of citrus freshies on the market.

Of the scents I've tried this reminds me of MFK's very disappointing and ridiculously overpriced Aqua Universalis Forte (when they have ""water"" in the name, believe them). You get nothing from this scent you won't get in a bottle of John Varvatos Artisan Blu, a $27 EDT. Projection-wise, by mid-morning coffee break no one will know you're wearing this, though it's a skin scent for 6-7 hours. It's certainly car pool, elevator and office safe, as is every citrus freshie since they're all too mild to offend anyone. But I don't see what you get with this scent that you don't get with a $35 bottle of Chrome Aqua, or a $23 bottle of Armaf Ventana Marine, other than the AdP rep, which based on the nine AdP scents I've tried to date I would to say is undeserved.",08/17/24 07:50,JusttheFactsMan

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This stuff is divine. For what this fragrance does and how it makes you feel in a tropical climate you really cannot go wrong. I first smelled this at Epcot of all places in the Italy pavilion. If you are familiar with the park, then you would know that several of the countries feature fragrance brands from their respective countries of origin. At first sniff I was in love with this juice. It is not crazy complex but very sexy, alluring, and masculine although generally a unisex smell if that makes sense. The retail price is not terribly out of touch, but the price you can get this at on grey market retailers is insane! I got my 100ML for around $62 and I can't see how that could've been a better deal. This fragrance is very adult though in my opinion. I can't see a teen pulling this off. Im in my early 20s and I still feel a little out of place when I wear this sometimes. It's just so sophisticated and grown rich man smelling. This is like all of the best aspects of sunscreen fresh type fragrances but made a little more well rounded with different accords. As far as when to wear this, I would say anytime spring or summer. There's not really a casual vs. formal scent to this. More of a who are you as the person wearing this type of vibe. This is white linen, suede summer walks, and cream colored pants type of vibes to me. Longevity is great but projection is not. People will need to be close to smell this on you, but they will be able to smell you at least 6 hours after application. Fantastic performance for an Eau De Cologne concentration to me. If you can get this for sub $80 and are into what I described above I would say just grab it. You really can't go wrong with this juice. It might even get you a new love interest if that's what you're looking for ;).",06/24/24 22:11,FloridaFrags33
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura by Acqua di Parma is a cherished part of my fragrance collection, embodying both elegance and modern sophistication. From the moment I first encountered its vibrant opening, I was captivated. The blend of bergamot, lemon, and orange greets you like a warm embrace, instantly uplifting and refreshingly bright. It’s not your typical citrus scent; it carries a touch of regal freshness, reminiscent of stepping off a yacht into the sun-drenched Mediterranean.

What sets Colonia Pura apart is its seamless evolution. The heart of the fragrance reveals jasmine, dancing gracefully with narcissus and coriander. This floral bouquet adds a layer of complexity, transforming the initial citrus burst into something more refined and harmonious. The jasmine, in particular, stands out, lending a sophisticated charm without overpowering the composition.

As Colonia Pura settles, the base notes of patchouli, cedarwood, and musk come forward, grounding the fragrance with a warm, earthy elegance. This balance between brightness and depth is what makes Colonia Pura truly special. It’s a modern take on the classic Colonia, paying homage to its heritage while introducing a contemporary twist that feels both timeless and current.

In my experience, Colonia Pura is versatile, suitable for any occasion. It’s invigorating enough for daytime wear, yet sophisticated enough for an evening out. I appreciate how it adapts to different settings, always maintaining its elegant presence.",06/20/24 22:22,zeeworldoffragrance
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The opening is much more floral than the others in the line. The narcissus is quite defining, with jasmine providing a slightly powdery yet very fresh background. The aldehydes curiously give me an aquatic sensation, similar to the aquatic flowers in Eau D'Issey, especially the feminine one.

It's probably the furthest from the original Colonia and has the most modern tones. There's something metallic as well, reminiscent of the metallic-aquatic, fresh, and floral side of Hermès H24.

Over time, the white musk appears and reminds me a bit of the dry down of Dior Homme Cologne (one of my favorite scents). It is the most unisex in the line, leaning slightly towards the feminine, and like the entire line, it is delicious.",06/05/24 10:03,danilodeathayde
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"My impressions after going through a 2ml sample:

The opening smells like spraying Acqua di Sale once and lemon pledge twice in the air. It’s scary how close the cologne dries down like Acqua di Sale and its baby sister Fiore dell’Onda. About 70% there with less of a tangy seaweed note, replaced with a generic citrus scent you’d find on those hand wipes they give you at a fish restaurant.

Pleasant cologne overall. One could say it’s overpriced but considering the overall quality of the juice and lower proportion of aroma chemicals compared to its peers, it’s a well concocted fragrance. Inoffensive, leans feminine but you could totally rock this if you’re an extroverted, happy fellow.",06/04/24 02:37,SmellyBoye
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Fresh laundry hanging under a citrus tree, while someone is peeling an orange next to you. Nothing impressive, but No one around you are going to complain about this scent (unless they hate clean cloths and citrus...). Longevity and projection is pretty good on me. 2 sprays are blasting of my skin for 3 solid hours, until i got wet and dried of with a towel. After toweling off, it's 8-10 inches of the skin projection. Enough to leave an ok scent trail. Pretty good for a fragrance like this.

This is Very Italian perfumery. Soapy clean and refreshing, a hint of spice, and loads of citrus, florals, and woods. Perfect when you want to freshen up, dress down and relax, or dress up in style.

Personal score: 8/10. What's not to like? Citrusy, floral, and woody, is one of the oldest and most loved combinations of fragrance. This has a classic style and a classic scent. Exceptional versatility.",05/31/24 10:33,ZeaMoore4

I certainly don't despise this, and if it were from another house, I'd probably go to the ""like"" vs ""ok"" rating, but this is in no way what I expect from AdP. I can't say old fashioned on this, as I am a fan of old fashioned frags. This one just comes off as a bit dated and irrelevant.

My review is as effete and apathetic as the fragrance and I'm not going to get into my personal experience with this. The notes listed on this Fragrantica profile are 80% correct in their depiction save for waxy musk, wet rocks and the slightest tinge of fish.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,Its nice but it's probably my least favorite from the Colonia line up that I've tried. Opening is an orange blast. Very nice quality citrus which unfortunately doesn't last. The ozonic and florals take over rather quickly. The ozonic notes overpower the citrus. It's ok but I'm not crazy about the ozonic notes. Goes alittle soapy which muddled everything to some extent. Something about how the ozonic motes mix with the florals isn't for me. There's also something slightly sour in here. Acqua di Parma does citrus aromatics like none other. This one unfortunately isn't for me. I much rather prefer Colonia Essenza and Intensa. It's fine but not great. I'll finish off my sample but probably won't get a full bottle.,04/20/24 17:22,3ak
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I’ve been wearing this for the last 3/4 years during spring & summer. I liked it because it got away from your typical citrus freshies. The more experience I have with this, the more it moves into one of my favorites.

Opens ozone, slight citrus, and w/the narcissus note (this is the main note on me throughout). Very light and airy. As it continues to dry down the musk note adds depth.

Longevity and projection are average…5/6 hours. I overspray to increase both.

I am never disappointed when I apply this. Certainly one of their best IMHO. Saying that, this is very different than ADP’s fragrances….I certainly would sample and wear for a day or two before going all in with full bottle.",04/11/24 05:33,MNadz
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,The house is among my favorites for a reason. Cannot imagine a summer without one of their colognes.

The base is light woodsy and somewhat mineralic to my nose.,03/28/24 15:34,stetina1

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Taking into consideration the countless perfumes I have tested, this particular one smells unbelievably amazing.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura by Acqua di Parma:
This is a very airy, aromatic and green fragrance centred around an almost powdery and somewhat chalky white floral note.

Due to its very airy profile performance isn’t the best but it’s a very pleasant warm weather scent.

Middle notes: Corriander, jasmine, narcissus
Base notes: Light musk and cedar

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"More of a chalky-musk rather than powder.. There is a calm & smooth citric sweetness here mixed w/ the musk that makes me think of Pez candy. I think it may be sweet patchouli creating the slightly strange scent.
@Discardedandroid said- ‘fun dip candy’. Yes the chalky simi-sweet white dipping stick!
As much as I absolutely hate Jasmine- the blending, harmony & softness of notes is extremely pleasing. Care-free vibe 🍃.
Spring time banger. Unisex. Casual.
Soft citrus, ozonic, dewy, soapy-sweet florals that doesn’t smell feminine.

Edit: 3/4/24
So I bought a 100ml.. this batch differs slightly from the sample I had.
It’s more green- specifically petitgrain smelling.. because of this, it isn’t as smooth & sweet. It’s more like a herbal citrus soap.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This is the most ""modern"" of the Colonia flankers i have tried (I have not smelled them all). It's very fresh, airy and floral and to my nose 100% unisex. It's always nice when fragrances try a new route and do things in an unexpected way. If I had blind smelled this the first time I tried it I would never have guessed it was a AdP Colonia flanker; there is nothing of the familiar DNA in Pura.

This is a very pleasant and fresh scent for the summer but it took a little while before I could put my finger on why I didn't like to wear it as much as the other Colonias. I then figured out that it's the jasmine that puts me off from wearing Pura. I prefer to smell jasmine on women, not on myself. Pura is to jasmine heavy for my taste. I asked a few female friends to try my sample and they enjoyed Pura a good deal. It's a nice and fresh fragrance for the warm weather, but just not for me.",07/30/22 08:35,Grensfall
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Hmm, definitely the weirdest of the Colonia line I've tried yet. The added ozonic notes to the Colonia formula make me think a little bit of some kind of powdered candy from when I was a kid, maybe it was ""Fun Dip""? Either way it's surprisingly sweet and the ozonic notes behave the same way violet does in that the fragrance becomes very smooth. It's an interesting twist on the original Colonia but for me the twist doesn't pay off. It's just okay.",07/03/22 05:39,discardedandroid
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The deliciously divisive commentary below is hilarious.

Back in 2008 I wore the original Colonia when it was just creeping back onto the radar, and, to echo @Leftofcenter below also felt like Cary Grant himself when I wore it. Despite not usually being a fan of citrusy fragrances, I've always loved ADP's sharp, lemony opening, but not how it evolved on my skin.

Last summer in Rome, I tried Essenza and nearly bought a bottle, but after trying it once more in my native Paris, found it incongruous. Today, I popped into the Paris boutique and spritzed Essenza on my left arm and Pura Colonia on my right and I have to say that Pura is the more intriguing of the two, at least here. The citrus quickly let the aldehydes and ozonic notes forth and they're fascinatingly blended with the musk, to feel both fresh and salty yet cosy and skin-like all at once.

I could see how this could be too adolescent on men, but on this woman it's a wonderfully different fresh summer scent.",06/15/22 09:22,ephemeral
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Summer, Scent: 6,5/10 Opening is citrus, smells like lemon peel. Smells like Turkish kolonya. In the dry down however it gets a bit warmer, perhaps its the cedar. Silage: 3/10 Longevity: 2/10",06/07/22 15:01,SNKIOP
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura was my first ever encounter with the Colonia line from Acqua Di Parma and while it was the first that I tried and fell for, it was Colonia Essenza that I first purchased (I'll review that later, it really does deserve a piece), Pura is fresh, cool and has a really unusual metalic/ozonic quality which to me, makes it a bit more interesting.

The opening is brisk, ozonic aldehydes fizz while bergamot, mixed with orange begin to emerge, it sort of reminds me a little bit of cloudy lemonade with ice. The thing is with Pura, the ozonic notes seem to stay throughout wear, the ozone/aldehydes give the florals; jasmine and narcissus, some real pop and along with a small touch of coriander, theres an injection of extra depth. The ozonic florals lace together in the base with white musk and cedar which wraps up the entire composition beautifully, giving a freshly laundered t-shirt/just out of the shower vibe.

The longevity is good for an EdC, I get 6 hours with a moderate silage. I honestly can see this working well on women as well as men, its perfectly unisex and I think if you're looking for a scent for someone that doesn't generally like wearing scents, this could be one to try. It'll work well for the office, casual wear and I really can't wait to try this one out at the beach too. Personally, I feel due to its light nature that Pura is better reserved for the summer months and I do think that while its well made, it could be a little bit more reasonably priced.
I would repurchase, and I'm glad I got a 100ml bottle since Mr Gin also seems to like this one as well.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Well, Colonia Pura is definitely a different take on the AdP barbershop genre. It both corrects some of the things I don't really like about Colonia, and introduces new oddities all its own. The word ""Pura"" might make you think this is a ""back to basics"" fragrance. Ha-ha, no, not at all. This is like a ""virtual reality"" fragrance. Interesting, but definitely not natural.

That soapiness in the original Colonia is replaced with a sort of robotic ozonic quality. It definitely smells clean, but less of a ""just showered"" clean and more of a ""just got my car detailed"" clean. There are floral components somewhere in the mix, but they are sort of mystery white floral ""accords"", as opposed to a more specific lavender scent in the original Colonia.

For me, this is a ""like"", not ""love"" fragrance. I think it smells really good, but also rather fake. It seems to tickle my throat and make me cough a bit. Not sure what component is doing that.

It's like the ""auto-tune"" version of Colonia. It can be fun, but I wouldn't want it every day, just as I wouldn't want auto-tune in every song. Acqua di Parma, feel free to use these synthetics as a tool for effect from time to time. But don't think you can replace the old ways entirely without anyone noticing.

Anyway, it's worth a look if you are into fresh, masculine, citrus, herbal (or robotic) fragrances.",03/22/22 19:24,S_Mazza

The sweetness + the ozonic note is nausea-inducing. My fiancé also felt nauseous from the scent, which is crazy to me!

I actually thought I had bad juice, but I got it with the body wash and deodorant. Since these 3 products smell the same, I am assuming the juice is not bad.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I love the Acqua di Parma Colonia range but there are several different variances of it so it's confusing to know which is which. Each of them are subtly different from one another but all are very nice. One of them is my favourite but I haven't tested it in a store for 3 or 4 years and can't remember which one it is! Maybe this one. Next time I get to test the range I need to make a note of it! Anyway, the one I favour is almost as beloved by me and almost rivals the now, tragically, discontinued Tuscan Soul so at some point I'm going to get myself a bottle! The Colonia range is definitely suitable for men and women, although I'm sure some women may not find them 'sexy' enough for them to wear. I'm a Gemini though so I'm more than happy to wear unisex fragrances and 'different' fragrances and, thank god, don't have a preference for stenchy, nausea inducing stink bombs!",10/18/21 12:29,Kittycat63

I like it a lot because without forgetting its family DNA it is different and balanced, a magnificent fragrance for heat or temperate climates, but even in autumn it can give play.

Would not recommend, unless you want to smell like toothpaste.

Opening is fantastic. Bright realistic citruses and aldehydes. Drydown retains some citrus and adds some semi soapy creaminess with musk.. Excellent versatility. Not a great performer, but not as bad as I was expecting. Smells great on skin and clothes. I got about 4 hours sweating in brutal Texas heat.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"For hot, sunny goes at adult life, Colonia Pura is tough to beat. It doesn't smell juicy or even squishy at all to me, it smells dry and firm, unripened, but so beautiful that Colonia Pura would be worthy of buying a nice even number like 4 and leaving them on the sunny part of the counter for a few days to get into later even though they still don't seem ripe, but this Airbnb is only here a few more days and you wouldn't want to get the car all sticky in case the Colonia Puras surprised you with ripeness the second you remove them from the air conditioned accomodation. Whatever, just bite one. It's not ripe enough. Whatever, just get in there and eat it. Then you eat all 4, you remember what that much citric acid does to your esophageal tract but don't feel guilt because you're radiating citrus, granting those nearby +2 antioxidation. Colonia Pura smells like that, mixed with an authoritativeness one might not be able to back up. On me, it smells like I'm the disappointment.

Not soapy (like Colonia or to some Essenza) but still retains the classic DNA.

Niche quality fragrance that if you look around is available also at good prices (even major outlets run discounts, I wouldn't trust Ebay or alike).

It is one of the best of the line and the Narcissus flower is just beautiful. If you are looking for something more masculine then Essenza or Intensa would be the best ones but as a man I still enjoy switching to this one from time to time.

That's what this fragrance embodies. It smells like a mild suntan lotion with a citrus zest;
the smell of the ocean lingering on the horizon.

Almost like a day's temperature at the beach, when this fragrance stays mild it is truly wonderful stuff. However, as the hours pass the scent intensifies and it becomes a little too much, bordering on annoying.

In my opinion, this isn't a blind buy. This is the definition of a unisex fragrance. Once the citrus notes fade away and the floral notes come to the forefront, the scent becomes quite feminine. Definitely try it out first to see if the beach life suits you.",05/02/20 13:37,LukeS
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"The first time I smelled Colonia Pura I didnt like it much and, probably because I focused on its metallic dimension, I found it quite artificial.

Obviously the 'metal' feeling was still there but I ended founding it quite comfortable and appealing.

The smell is dominated by aldehydes and floral notes which makes it quite unisex, the citrus notes are nothing like obvious and coriander and patchouli are definitely there though measured out perfectly. The whole is bright and transparent, appropriately named Colonia Pura, and has a surprising tenacity, staying almost the whole day with you.

Disclaimer: personally I dont like colognes with so much longevity, 5-6 hours is enough for me, if I am comfortable with the scent I prefer re-aply it, too much longevity may be sometimes a bit tiresome and this is happening to me with Colonia Pura.

I’m not sure this would be a standout for me, if I was a man. It does hold some of the generic characteristics of a men’s citrus cologne.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Pura is an aromatic fougere. The opening is lush with aldehydes, brazen on the classic Colonia DNA of barbershop botanicals and musk. An Old World aroma—with its legendary complexity that's so easy to get lost in.

Neroli, orange flower, lavender, and vetiver—laced atop a deep, heady musk which begets the flagbearer of masculinity. Classically this was done so alongside an accord of citruses—which seem entirely missing in this formula.

Odd that the Colonia fragrance is so renowned amongst men, as I personally always had the creeping feeling that the botanical aspects were a bit uncomfortably feminine, and the citrus and musk just attempts to cover this up.

The addition of aldehydes here certainly doesn't do anything constructive for this. It blends with the floral aspects to give the fragrance an immensely greater feminine aura. The musk however is still very prevalent (and anything but feminine), so this is still not something that I could recommend for women.

Something intriguing—I noticed that the aldehydes seem to get quickly cannibalized, and don't retain their standing very long in the formula. In a fresh bottle their presence is almost overbearing throughout, but in just a little time, it's hard to detect them outside of the opening. There's only a noticeable glaze atop the oversoul of the fragrance.

Not sure what difference that makes for the orientation, but I guess that would make this a very high-maintenance fragrance to keep for whoever it might appeal to.",10/27/19 18:40,ReapThaWhirlwind
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I have been debating purchasing a decant of this for a long time. Acqua di Parma is my favorite house, but the reviews below made me hesitant. When I finally pulled the trigger and smelled it for the first time, I was surprised. This is unlike any other Colonia flanker. First, this feels like the first Colonia targeting a younger crowd. I can see anyone between 18 and 30 pulling this off really well. Of course, anyone older than that can also wear it. Secondly, this is their most mainstream, ""designer-like"" Colonia to date. Thirdly, this somehow retains the Colonia DNA. I can smell the trademark AdP citruses in this that connect it to Essenza and the OG.

It is very pleasant to wear and I think I would love wearing this in the summer heat. It's simple and elegant. Unfortunately, I already have a fragrance, Dior Homme Cologne, in this exact category of fragrances and which accomplishes the same thing. Imo, owning both would be entirely redundant, even though they don't smell the same.

If you are looking for a signature scent for the hot summer months, I highly recommend considering a citrus/musk combination. Compare AdP Colonia Pura and Dior Homme Cologne and see what you think. They're both fantastic.

It's an orange-driven fragrance with an aquatic, aqueous sort of sheen and a cooling herbal edge which I interpret as mint despite the fact that it's not one of the officially listed notes in the pyramid. There are some light floral qualities and that clean, bitter-soapy citrus embellishment of the petit grain, giving it a slightly formal, ""white button down,"" impression, reminiscent of more classic eau de colognes . But overall, Pura is an easy wear, and something that can be thrown on casually or feel right at home in a more dressy situation. In fact, it seems like something that would be great to wear to a summer wedding, when the the thought of dutifully sweating it out in a tux keeps you from reaching for those heavier, darker fragrances. Performance is solid, with about 5-7 hours of longevity with good projection for 3. What I enjoy about Pura is its focus on orange, which is a nice departure from the more common citrus notes--it conveys the mandarin with a confident, unapologetic presence and in turn gives it distinction. Paired with a cool, green, herbal quality resembling mint, we're left with a fragrance that is both refreshing and relaxing to wear. Thumbs up and worth sampling. For now my rating stands at 8.5/10.",06/12/19 05:18,Buysblind

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I keep a mini sample in my bag. It's nothing special. I won't buy a bottle.
Clean, fresh, safe, versatile, and contemporary. Citrus, aqua, flora, wood, and soap. Sort of a pop-pop bubbly/fizz/soda thing, but that's subtle. I get about an hour out of this scent. Seems to be hit-or-miss with the crowd.

Description on the sample card:
A radically fresh fragrance, delicate and bold, which embodies the most modern side of Italian lifestyle. The spicy notes of coriander are combined with the classic citrus notes of cologne. In the heart, sambac jasmine and petit-grain meet with the facets of Narciso Absolute. In the base, hints of musk and patchouli characterise the depth of the composition.",05/03/19 06:00,KooKills

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I tried this on my skin today. It is a clean and mellow scent that overall gives the impression of a pleasant soapy note. I think it's jasmine and petitgrain on a soft base of musk that creates this vibe. It is a nice scent but I feel like I smelled this theme before (e.g. vaguely reminds me of some of the Prada scents).

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I'm going to start by saying that I do like this fragrance, although there's nothing revolutionary in it.

It may not smell niche, it may not be unique, I totally agree on that. However, I feel that it's been formulated in an interesting way, as it kind of smells metrosexual to me. I can definitely see it being used by a lady as well, but it's got that feminine note that actually works on a man too. A modern re-formulation of the original Colonia, just like some say.

Love the citrusy/floral notes, of which I'm generally a big fan. It's a spring/summer fragrance only, I would say. Very fresh and clean.

To me, it smells a little spicy on the opening, but it gets very pleasing on the dry down.

There is a strong citrus smell I would expect from a Colonia. Then there was a smell I just could not name. I guess that is the ozonic smell. It kind of makes me think new car. It's not unpleasant but, not really good either. I has a very syntheic almost plasticy kind of hint to it. I'll give it another sample sometime but, this really is the only Acqua di Parma I would recommend avoiding.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"While sampling Byredos the lady at Neiman Marcus was quick to give me a sample of this new release. I wonder what the commission is? Aldehydes and the Acqua Di Parma citrus; a little musk. I get a hint of white florals, a slight soapy vibe and a metallic touch. Pura smells like a modern take on the classic Acqua di Parma concept

Average projection and sillage; lasted about seven hours before becoming soft. Just fine for work and not really sexy. I'd say it's unisex leaning masculine and for hotter weather. This isn't horrible but it smells like too many designer scents out there; not very creative. The aldehydes are almost headache inducing for me. The quality is decent but I know you could find a similar smelling scent for much cheaper. I want my Acqua di Parmas to smell like they're from the early 20th century not the 21st.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Review of EDC:
As a long time fan of ADP and having sampled practically their entire range over the years (including soaps, shaving foam, shower gels etc.) my initial emotions after trying this were disappointment, followed by sadness and then something bordering on anger.This is a lovely scent, it just doesn't last!
I mean that sincerely, the longevity is very poor and when you consider the price of this, it's actually outrageously awful.
I'd place the original Colonia is my top 10 fragrances, even though I wear it less and less these days, it's still a scent I hold close to my heart and so I was of course, attracted to this new offering and intrigued to try it out.
I remember the days when nobody in my circle had heard of of ADP and I felt like Cary Grant himself when I wore it. Slowly but surely, the range increased and then the rate of productions progressed to the point whereby I can barely keep up (or even care to). What was once an indulgent and gratifying online purchase (i'm in UK not Italy) only to be found on the unobtainable shelves of Harrods and Selfridges suddenly became omnipresent in stores such as John Lewis, overnight ADP was a mainstream scent. So what? Now it was easier to obtain and once i'd overcome my snobbery, I could only see the positives.
Sadly, the quality and innovation seemed to drop off as I made my way through the new issues from this house. I could forgive the Blu Mediterranean range as some of them smelled nice (Mandorlo Di Sicilia for one) but they kind of left me unimpressed with their variations and longevity.Then came Oud, Leather and others in the brown bottle which i cannot recall now and they made me question the price to quality ratio for the first time. The only ADP i've found to have substantial longevity / projection are Colonia (original) Intensa, Essenza, Quercia and perhaps Assoluta, although I never gave that much of a run as i found it too feminine for my tastes and sold it on pretty quickly.
As much as I love this house, I have to admit that I don't hold it in as high regard as I once did.
I sampled Colonia Pura and Quercia at the same time and although I liked both, I loved Quercia and so plumped for that one. Rightly so I feel, as that one at least gets through a day and it a much more complex scent.Still, I couldn't resist the shower gel of Pura when I saw it at a decent price, the writing was already on the wall and I was forced to confront my denial. The shower gels have never been anything but a brief and expensive indulgence, they don't really carry any scent once out of the shower, but at least I know to expect that. Considering the retail price of Pura, i'd expected more and would never plump for a full bottle, despite the fact I like it, simply for the fact that it's not superior to the original Colonia in any way and is one of the worst performing scents from the entire range. The reviews below claiming 9 hours longevity are laughable and extremely suspect. I'm about as far from an ADP hater as could possibly be (I even considered their bathrobe at one point!) but sometimes you just have to say it like it is and put aside personal bias.This is weak..pleasant, but oh so weak.",07/06/18 01:30,Leftofscenter
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This Fragrance is very different from the other Colonia variances. It is not as powerful and explicit as the others and more just a fresh summer cologne. That is why it probably will dissatisfy a lot of ADP users.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"With each new release, Acqua di Parma is committed to producing products of lower quality each time. With the classic Cologne reformulated and a lot of pitiful launches (for me, Essenza was already pretty bad), now this? Was it really necessary?

This looks more like an Invictus fresh flanker than an AdP. Loose, synthetic, insipid. With a performance that makes the classic colony look like an oriental perfume. Little more I will comment. Yes, the price, well ...

If this is done by Paco Rabanne as flanker of Invictus, he fits perfectly and everyone who is involved in the forums of perfumes, then give him sticks.

It has about 15 initial minutes that can be pleasant, mixing citrus with a sweet / aquatic note, but the perfume dilutes absurdly and after that phase, there is hardly anything interesting, except the typical synthetic and totally generic white musk.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Pura is manifestly modern. A brilliant effervescent take on Colonia.

As expected of an AdP release, Colonia Pura opens with that typically magnificent citrus accord. Here though the citrus is light, lurid and very unlike the original Colonia; the orange and petitgrain are sharp and acidic but transparent as if carried by a cool sea breeze on a scorching day. I suspect there are aldehydes at play here, lending that transparent and slightly metallic edge to the citrus. Coriander too imparts a cool sharpness that carries through to the middle.

In the middle, Pura really comes into its own, omitting any floral/herbal similarity to Colonia. Jasmine sambac and narcissus, both typically heavy and heady, are rendered less potent as petitgrain taints them green. This green floral accord sits atop the still spicy coriander and airy aldehydes of the opening, though the aldehydes are more distinctly metallic now than before. As patchouli and cedarwood begin to form the base, white musk again lifts the composition to airy heights when it might be expected to go the other way.

Very pleasant overall. Colonia Pura manages to be fresh, sharp and natural without ever veering overtly sweet or cloying as some Colonia flankers can. This is sure to be a spring/summer staple in my wardrobe.

Longevity is moderate at 6-8 hours, sillage is moderate also.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"DNA of the original colonia, but with less flowers like rose. Pura is salty and the citruses are natural like fresh pressed limes. I also get a minty note in this one, but its not listed. It may be another green note, but the perceived smell to my nose is mint. Reminds me alot of a creation from atelier cologne actually. Or if you have tried Renaissance from Xerjoff, Pura is similar but lighter, especially on the mint note. This is sharp and crisp vs the original plus essenza which are more smooth and round with a little sweetness.

Not much more to say. Very nice sparkling citrus freshy with good quality ingredience. Actually one of the best citruses I have tried.

Light citrus mixed with admittedly pretty florals. Nice, transparent and light and ultimately very safe. Maybe the oud or leather offerings are the ones I need to give a fair chance.

It's more versatile and enjoyable than classic colonia that is, in my opinion, more serious, for special occasion, not really young.
The only cons is that is not very long-lasting. But it regain strength just wetting a bit the skin with few water drops. But it's a EdC, I'm quite surprised that someone complains about that on their reviews, they should be aware of that.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"Being an impulsive fraghead and a sucker for bargains, I ordered the 180ml bottle after I did a single testing from a department store and liking it. After several wearings over the weekend, I agree with philball that this is a mediocre release and with Bluslippers that there are better ones in the Colonia range than Pura (Essenza for instance).
Using 6 sprays, performance is less than 3 hours on my skin in mostly hot outdoor setting but surprisingly getting whiffs of it every now and then even after 5 hours which should be coming mainly from my clothes. What I get is a pleasant, unique enough soapy scent that leans masculine which should have been more than Ok if it actually lasted for at least 6 hours. Oh well, my only consolation is that it cost me around the same as a discounted 100ml decent designer bottle and it will serve its purpose as my first full bottle of ADP in my collection.
Will test this in an air conditioned setting these next few days and will update this review. Will do as much spray as needed to make it work. I got the 180, remember?

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"In response to Amen Corner, I tried this fragrance for the first time this week and I felt quite disappointed. To my nose, it was fairly generic; a light, nondescript citrus with a dash of spice - aimed at a younger crowd. Certainly not offensive but far from outstanding either. I would call this fragrance safe and commercial - okay for the cheaper, designer end of the market but not worth the AdP label or price.

However, what was most disappointing was the performance. Barely there once sprayed and completely gone in little over an hour. An over-priced tonic water and AdP's weakest fragrance yet. I know it's a cologne but for £100 a bottle, I really would expect more.

It's probably safe enough for a blind buy but it doesn't step far from a well-worn, mass-market appeal, path so don't expect too much. Personally, I think the new Dior Homme Sport is better than this, it certainly performs better and it's cheaper, although, even the Dior isn't anything overly special.

I was so looking forward to trying this, after seeing the note breakdown above and owning several AdP fragrances myself. Oh well, I guess that's what happens when a conglomerate gets its hands on a fine-perfume house and I shouldn't have expected anything more!

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"It starts with brief citrus. Nice. But very brief citrus. Then nothing. No original Colonia-style herbs, no lingering neroli like in Essenza. Then some weak, indeterminable florals appear. But not strongly enough. Then a dosage of 90s-style, aquatic aromachemicals, presumably the ozonic accord. One tiny step away from calone! (Eek!)

Then it's shifts to a smoother, ambroxan-type accord (or what I thought was ambroxan) but which must be the musk. It starts off a little sickly for me, to be honest, but then mellows, and aside from the fleeting citrus is the best bit.

All in all, it smells suspiciously to me like an aquatic - citrus, woods, watery aromachemicals. They could've called it Acqua di Parma Acqua or Eau Fraiche.

Unbearably unisex. No dominant floral or woods. Chance would be a fine thing. No real smell. A mere suggestion of a scent. Perhaps they're aiming for the younger man or the teenage market. It's a country mile away from 1Million though.

All they need to fully mess up their heritage is to do is a gourmand version. Yuck!

Seriously, I do worry that these guys have taken too much of an advantage of their recently (re-)found success in the market - one scent in nearly one hundred years since 1916 - and then waaay too many flankers.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"I wore this a few times and must say I love Colonia Pura. A perfect MODERN cologne of a high quality. A 100% Demachy style. I always praise him for this ability to catch the trend and he did it again.
Colonia Pura is a journey from the bergamote / bitter grapefruit peel to the oceanic salty molecules on a slight ambroxan base. Despite the salty elements the fragrance doesn't smell as Heeley Sel Marin or something like that; it's still of a citrusy genre and the oceanic part gives it contemporary vibe.
I emphasized the word ""modern"" as Colonia Pura nothing like the regular Colonia or Assoluta/Intensa/Essenza. So do not expect it to be a lighter version of Colonia. On other hand, Colonia Pura has been done for the generation of Le Labo Bergamote 22 lovers, that beautiful grapefruit/bergamote/ambroxan concotion. And I do find a big resemblance to Bergamote 22; a 2,5 times cheaper Bergamote 22 with salty elements added. That's a dream of those who are looking for cologne of nowadays!",08/09/17 10:51,antonpan
Acqua di Parma Colonia Pura Acqua di Parma,"This opens with a beautiful, full-bodied, zesty orange note with a dash of sweetness. I'm not sure if it's the aldehyde notes, or the sharp bergamot, but something gives the citruses in this an effervescent quality, very fizzy. It's very pleasant. The base seems to consist of light musk and florals. The citrus aspect never completely fades.

This seems to be a bright citrus in the opening, drying down to earthy florals. It's not blended quite as well as Essenza or Assoluta.

Now, it reminds me of a few fragrances, I can't put my finger on what exactly, but it's quite strongly reminiscent of Chanel Allure Homme Sport to my nose.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Assoluta Edizione Speciale 2011 Acqua di Parma,"I had heard the Assoluta was a bit stronger with better longevity than the base Colonia, so I started looking for it. I'd never buy AdP fragrances from mainstreet retailers, because some terrific discounted prices can be had through other channels. Before I pulled the trigger on a 100ml bottle of Assoluta, I managed to spot this limited edition version, which I thought was simply the same fragrance in an ""alternative"" bottle design. I got a 180ml bottle for the price of a 100ml of original Assoluta. But I discovered afterward that the ingredients list is noticeably different between the two.

How is it? Very pleasant, lush quality citrus lavender. Something about it is similar to Essenza, with just a gentle shift in the balance of notes. Whereas Essenza is drier and less floral, Assoluta is a little sweeter and more citrus-floral, almost like a succulent lemon drop. And then... about 1 to 2 hours later I sniffed my hand again and the prominent notes had receded quite a bit. I had to bring my nose close to detect it.

What I discovered is that it does get absorbed by the skin, but in cool weather when your skin warms up it will radiate back again. Longevity is a little disappointing. I tend to get about 2~3 hours before it completely descents into a skin scent, which trails on for about another 4 hours before vanishing.

This is a very good quality fragrance, no doubt about it. But given what it delivers, it's really targeted for those who don't mind plunking down $200 for a bottle of this every few months and spraying it on liberally. Ah.... there are certain privileges in life, that's for sure. And owning a fine Acqua di Parma Colonia fragrance that you can use indiscriminately is one of them. :-)

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"ADP, one of my favorite brands, can't seem to catch the mainstream, so instead, it's relying on fake and/or bought reviews written by ChatGPT. So embarrassing.",11/13/25 06:20,agonzony
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"The packaging is exactly what you’d expect from Acqua di Parma - it's refined, substantial, and luxurious. The bottle has great weight to it, and the marble cap is a beautiful touch that feels intentionally crafted rather than cheap and solely for decorative purposes.

On the first spritz, the fragrance opens with a soft citrus brightness, immediately followed by a rich, subtly earthy undertone. It’s not overly warm, sweet, or floral— It lives in the space I love the most for my personal fragrances - depth that’s hard to neatly define. It has character without being loud or overpowering and complexity without being overwhelming.

The performance is fantastic. I’ve worn it multiple times and consistently get 12+ hours of wear. It evolves gracefully and subtly throughout the day, lingering in a way that feels effortless rather than overpowering, leaving a soft trail of something intriguing.

I can absolutely understand why this is considered a unisex fragrance. It definitely has a chameleon-like quality where it adapts to each person wearing it, smelling slightly different on each individual’s skin chemistry. I would describe it overall as confident, bold, and yet still understated and elegant.

Overall, Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia is a fragrance that's sophisticated and magnetic. One of those scents you keep thinking about long after you’ve put it on, and one that people will stop you to ask what you have on.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,This was my first time trying this perfume on! I have been wearing it for almost over a week and I am in love with this scent. It smells very luxurious.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Okay, this scent is grown woman energy. It’s warm, a little spicy, and has that fancy woody amber vibe that just smells like confidence in a bottle. It’s floral.. think jasmine after the rain, mixed with a cozy touch of amber and woods.
I swear, it gives “clean but expensive” energy. Definitely not your typical sweet perfume, more like something you’d wear when you want people to wonder what luxury scent you’re wearing. received this as a part of an educational promotion",10/25/25 06:48,Liftglam
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia by Acqua di Parma is such a beautiful and complex fragrance. This is a unisex scent that can be worn by anyone. The first thing I noticed was the bottle and the cap. A thick, strong glass bottle with the black porcelain topper. All packaged inside a vibrant yellow box. Spraying the perfume, I was immediately greeted by notes of lemon and cardamom. Upon dry down you get floral jasmine and woodsy cedarwood and sandalwood. Somehow it’s a creamy, floral, bright, woody gorgeous scent. It reminds me of walking through a garden where you get a mix of a bunch of different scents. This fragrance lasts FOREVER thanks to the high concentration of perfume oil. I never thought I’d be a niche fragrance girl but here I am raving about how delightfully beautiful this one is. I did receive this product as part of an educational promotion in exchange for my honest opinion.",10/24/25 22:22,Ahenn911
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"This is such a beautiful fragrance! It opens with a slightly spicy, clean burst from the cardamom and Italian lemon. The jasmine emerges quickly, and it’s such a fresh, cool, somewhat green photorealistic jasmine. As it settles, the orris, black tea, and myrrh introduce a slightly powdery, smoky richness, adding depth and a touch of mystery. The woodsy base notes give it depth, balancing everything out perfectly without being too heavy. I love that it’s an extrait de parfum- it’s strong but smooth and not overpowering, and it lasts for hours on my skin. To me, it’s perfectly unisex- not too masculine or feminine, not too light or dark- just beautifully balanced.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I received Gelsomino A Freddo Ambrosia by Acqua Di Prama as a part of promotion campaign from beautytap. I have not tried any of their fragrances before from this brand.. As soon as I smelled it I instantly fell in love with it. It's a empowering scent for woman and even for men I feel. Its the type of scent that it lingers with you for a long time. Its definitely in my opinion unisex scent. My son smelled it who is 15 and fell in love with it. Uses it daily now. The notes I smelled I felt are fresh, citrus, woodsy scent with a little added spice in it and let's not forget the jazmin as well. That was my favorite about this scent the jazmin! Next I would like to state how when I wore this I felt sexy and classy even rich! I also liked the design of the bottle its very elegant and the case for the perfume was also a great idea. Very good first date type of scent! I will keep using this probably every day now that I have it.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I am a Beauty Enthusiast that loves
fragrances. The newest perfume that I have been using is Gelsomino A Freddo Ambrosia by Acqua Di Parma. This Parfum comes in a 50 ml /1.7 fl oz glass bottle with a black top. This is my first time trying a perfume by this brand. This parfum has a very unique scent profile. Its key notes include Cardamom, Frankincense, Italian Lemon, Jasmine, Myrrh, Cedarwood, and Sandalwood. The scent is both warm and sensual. The packaging and the bottle of this parfum is beautiful.The first spray of this parfum is very strong in my opinion. However, the dry down is much more subtle and calm which is definitely nice. Now talking about the longevity of the parfum, it's definitely long lasting as it lasted for a couple of hours on me. To conclude I enjoyed using this parfum and would recommend others to try it as well.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma's Gelsomino a Freddo is a surprising twist on a classic floral. The initial burst is intensely bright – a near-photorealistic jasmine, but instantly cooled with a noticeable hit of citrus and mint. This isn't your grandmother's jasmine; it's been given a modern, almost icy edge that makes it incredibly refreshing.

The ""freddo"" (cold) aspect is what sets this fragrance apart. It's not just a fleeting top note; it permeates the entire composition, keeping the jasmine from becoming too heavy or cloying. The supporting notes of lemon and mint create a sparkling, effervescent quality that's perfect for warm weather.

While jasmine is undoubtedly the star, the other elements keep it grounded and interesting. It's a sophisticated, yet easy-to-wear scent that manages to be both elegant and playful. If you're looking for a unique take on jasmine that's perfect for summer, Gelsomino a Freddo is definitely worth a try.",10/24/25 03:10,Helloitsdzeni
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"This was my first time trying this brand so I was very excited to try it. I don’t own many unisex fragrances either but I was intrigued by the notes in this one. The packaging was beautiful and so was the bottle, it’s very elegant. I could tell that this was a good quality fragrance. This
is a Woody Floral Musk fragrance that could be for both men and women but in my opinion it leans for masculine. You can definitely smell the notes of Cardamom, Frankincense and I especially smell the Italian Lemon and then that sandalwood and cedarwood which does give it that masculinity. The first spray is a bit strong for my
liking but the dry down is more subtle which was nicer. This isn’t something I see myself wearing often because I tend to wear lighter fragrances and I didn’t get any floral notes on me which is what I like but I will experiment with layering this fragrance. I think this would be a really nice gift for someone! This review was collected as part of an educational promotion.",10/24/25 02:37,Lillie15
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"This perfume was love at first spray. I was a little scared that the myrrh and frankincense would smell very church-y, but this is one of the most beautifully blended fragrances I’ve ever used. It opens with spicy cardamom and citrus before the jasmine peeks out (unlike any Jasmine I’ve ever smelled, not narcotic or tuberose-y in an overwhelming way, but a soft, spicy floral). It dries down to a luxurious, creamy, not at all pickle-y sandalwood. To say this is a holy grail is an understatement. I love for the scent trail this leaves on my clothes. I can’t stop sniffing the sweater I wore when I first tried it. It’s the perfect summer to fall transition scent and smells just as luxurious as it should for the price point and size. A true stunner.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"A spicy, resinous, slightly powdery floral composition on a sandalwood bed that would be better suited as a sophisticated home fragrance.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia opens with a warm burst of cardamom-citrus: it's smooth, bright and inviting. Doesn't take long for the jasmine note to emerge, keeping with the heavenly theme these petals are whispery soft, warm and fit in well with the top notes - unexpectedly. Sandalwood rounds out the first act giving it a lived-in, cozy yet elevated nuance. If I sniff long and hard, I can VERY faintly pick up on the myrrh note - it's well moderated and doesn't give the feel of a Catholic church.

The notes remain cohesive with depth throughout making it a positive experience from a fragrance blend point of view. Lasts over 48 hours on fabric, or 5-6 hours on skin - pretty underwhelming given the price point.

While the fragrance is perfectly unisex, to me personally is more of a candle scent. High-end/luxury cool weather home fragrance to give a nice ambience to your living space. Not your person.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia is a rich luxurious fragrance that captures both warmth and sophistication in a bottle. It opens with the crisp scent Italian lemon and pink pepper carried with the spicy cardamom. As the fragrance settles in, we are then introduced to a nice blend of jasmine and black tea that is then grounded with Cedarwood and Sandalwood. Although the scent is genderless, I would say it leans to more masculine. The scent is perfect for me whenever I want warm cozy woodsy vibes that is not too overwhelming. It lasts about six hours throughout the night for me and it’s perfect for date night because it leaves a long lasting trail. I will be leaning towards this scent for the fall season.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I really love this fragrance! The scent is warm, woodsy, and sexy. It lasts for hours, maybe half a day. But it's not so overpowering that it leaves a long trail of scent as you walk away. I like to spray it near the bottom of my neck and walk into it like a mist. Any more than that (such as on the wrists) might be too overpowering for my taste. This fragrance is more of a night scent in my opinion, but I enjoy wearing it during the day as well. It has a nice amber base to it, which is one of my favorite scents. So warm and relaxing. The high-quality yellow bottle that it comes in very beautiful and luxurious. I will keep it stored in its box in case it protects the fragrance from aging (not sure if that's a thing, but it looks good too). When I'm ready to start dating again, this will definitely be my date-night scent. I'm so glad that I can add this to my collection of fragrances. It's definitely near the top! I wouldn't change anything about it. ***I received this as a part of an educational promotion***",10/23/25 21:13,missabelle13

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I finally tried Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia! The packaging is beautiful and unique. I love the experience of a beautiful box to unopen. At the beginning the scent is strong, spicy and zesty, which feels a little too strong at first. After it smooths out beautifully into jasmine and tea, and it seems like walking into a garden of jasmines. After a while it becomes ao warm and cozy, but not heavy or too sweet. If I’m honest though, it doesn’t last as long as I expected for an extrait. You definitely need a travel size to re spritz. The first impression is dramatic, then it fades quicker than I thought. I want to add that I’d not pick rhis fragrance for men, too soft and floral for the men vibe. I received this as a part of an educational promotion.",10/23/25 20:18,Fioreviewer

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I have fell in love worn this perfume! I knew that this perfume was gonna be an amazing perfume, but I did not think it was this good from the moment that I opened it up and sprayed it. I could immediately smell all of the beautiful notes that it has. The packaging is just stunning first of all the yellow bottle and the way it is stored it it's just elegant and so luxurious. Let's go to the smell. The smell is absolutely heavenly. It's a mix of fresh, but also a musky strong. It is a very strong perfume, but I love, strong perfumes, and this one just tops the cake. The compliments that I have been getting on this perfume are actually insane. It lasts so long that I sprayed it on my shirt a couple days ago maybe like a week ago and I kid you not the next week that I reword shirt it was as if I had sprayed it on freshly. It is so worth it to me. It is just a beautiful luxurious perfume. The longevity is truly impressive. I can spray it in the morning, go through a full day, and still smell it clearly on my skin and clothes in the evening. Even after washing my clothes, I sometimes still get little hints of it. I have never owned a fragrance that stays around this long in such a beautiful way. It is not overpowering, but it fills the room with a soft, elegant trail that people notice. It makes my whole space smell inviting and luxurious. The notes are blended so smoothly that it feels like a single wave of scent rather than separate layers. The jasmine is the star, but there is something creamy and slightly amber-like underneath that adds warmth and depth. It is elegant, romantic, and comforting all at once.",10/23/25 19:32,Ridaxox

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review and for educational purposes. Rich, dense, and vibrantly alive, Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia is an elixir that feels both luminous and grounding, shimmering like sunlight on cut crystal while carrying the depth of polished wood.

It opens with a sparkling burst of Italian lemon softened by the resinous glow of olibanum and the gentle spice of cardamom, immediately drawing you in. Keeping radiant intensity kindled, every inhale lingers, revealing a harmony centered keenly, carrying unique facets that unfold gracefully with time. Soon, the heart reveals itself in waves of jasmine enfleurage, tea leaves, orris, and a touch of shadowy myrrh, a perfect balance of brightness and mystery. The dry down lingers warmly, blending sandalwood, cedarwood, vetiver, and guaiac wood into a base that feels smooth, steady, and reassuring.

To me, this fragrance feels like autumn afternoons in a sunlit café, winter evenings in a velvet armchair, or even late summer nights at an outdoor concert, moments when you want something that feels both elevated and intimate. With its richness and balance, it works beautifully for evenings out, cozy gatherings, or simply when you want to carry a quiet aura of elegance throughout your day.",10/23/25 17:59,ojackso2

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Upon the first encounter, the Italian lemon makes a striking entrance, not as a simple citrus note, but as a sun drenched zest, sophisticatedly countered by the spiritual depth of olibanum and the exotic whisper of cardamom. This opening is a vibrant tableau, setting the stage for what's to come. The heart unfolds with a jasmine enfleurage extract, a technique that speaks volumes of Acqua Di Parma’s dedication. Here, the jasmine isn't just a floral note; it's a living essence, deepened by the contemplative notes of black tea, the powdery touch of orris, and the ancient resonance of myrrh. This heart is a complex dance of light and shadow, a narrative whispered on the skin. The base is where Gelsomino A Freddo Ambrosia finds its grounding. Sandalwood offers a creamy embrace, while vetiver and cedarwood provide an earthy foundation, completing the fragrance's journey. The composition's starring jasmine enfleurage essence comes from a precise technique where delicate jasmine flowers are layered purified shea butter multiple times under the supervision of a master perfumer, ensuring every nuance of the olfactive molecule is captured, preserving the flower's natural complexity and richness. It's a fragrance that doesn't just sit on the skin; it evolves, tells a story, and leaves a lasting impression. I do want to note that the floral and spicy is what I get most of in case you aren’t a spicy flower lover, but Acqua Di Parma has crafted a fragrance that is both a nod to tradition and a step into contemporary perfumery.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"A floral and spicy delight!
ACQUA DI PARMA Gelsomino A Freddo Ambrosia Parfum is a scent that is enticing to the senses. The scent of ambrosia is heightened from the Zafferano Ambrosia that is at its essence of purity. The scent is floral and spicy that makes one want to keep smelling the scent. It is unique and eclectic. The notes throughout the scent include orange flower, Jasmine, Ginger, Bergamot, amber accord, and vanilla. This scent is luxurious in all its beautiful notes. The patchouli is light and not overpowering in the overall scent. The Amber and Jasmine are prominent in the overall scent. This is an unusual combination to have against scents like vanilla and/ or patchouli that sometimes can be overpowering. The packaging is simple and classy just like the parfum. A vibrant yellow encloses the bottle that is eye-catching. Overall, this is a beautiful well-balanced seducing in a luminous and luxurious way that lingers to be unforgettable.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"When I read the notes for this perfume, I was hoping for something like Nest “Indigo"" with a little more spice, and some woody depth. But Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia is something very different that somehow skews into oud territory. The packaging and bottle are beautiful, luxurious, and elegant (as they should be for the price!). The atomizer is top notch. Upon first spray, the cardamom hits strong, and I picked up a little frankincense. There is a citrus element present that brightens the whole thing up, but make no mistake, this is not a citrus-centered affair; warm spice is the star here. As it dries down, the tea and woods start to become more prominent, with myrrh keeping things warm and spicy. This has moderate projection but a more intimate sillage. I didn’t get too much of the floral elements listed, so if you’re looking for a jasmine tea kind of situation, I don’t think you’ll find it here. This is earthy, spicy, warm and woody. I'd categorize it as unisex skewing masculine. All in all, this is a fragrance I *should* love, however...there’s something in this that comes across as thick and cloying to me. This heavy thick scent reminds me of oud wood, so maybe it's the guaiac wood? Some here are comparing this to ""Oud Gardenia."" I've never smelled that fragrance...but based on what's happening here, I bet they're right. I can still smell what I'll call the ""oud-factor"" 6 hours later, although it's pretty much a skin-scent at that point. It’s a beautifully blended and unique fragrance, that’s likely to get some positive attention, especially if you enjoy oud.

It is my first time trying this brand and the experience feels fancy from the start. Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia parfum is made in Italy and comes inside a beautiful yellow cylinder. The bottle itself looks like something I’d keep on display forever. It is sleek, minimal, but with that Italian luxury touch that just screams elegance.
The scent opens up to a clean and uplifting vibe with that hit of italian lemons and a little spice from cardamom. As it develops, I get that warm feeling from jasmine and after a while the woods (sandalwood, vetiver, and cedar) start to come out and dominate giving it depth into a more masculine scent but in a very addictive way that men and women can enjoy.
Overall, the perfume isn’t too loud. It provides a sophisticated feel but in a quiet and effortless way. I'd wear this for special events, date nights, or when I just want to feel expensive and polished. It is definitely a luxury treat for this upcoming events and holidays.",10/23/25 14:51,KarlaM
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I would like to start with positives. This scent lasts five ever. In my first test of this, the one spray i placed on my wrist lasted overnight to the next day. I was hoping for more cardamom in this scent but I picked up frankensence and generic floral. I didn't find this scent has anything unique that I would be able to sell people on. This was just meh. And for the price, it's not for me. I feel like this has a clingy earthen smell mixed with drugstore air freshener. It's not totally inoffensive either due to a sharpness to it on first spray.",10/23/25 14:31,Danagreencar
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"This is a very lovely fragrance. In my opinion It definitely could be a unisex fragrance. It’s not overly strong, but the sandalwood is very noticeable when it’s first sprayed. It reminds me of the No.4 Bois de Balincourt from Maison Louis Marie. I tend to lean towards woody/spicy type scents, so I was thrilled to try this. I think the sandalwood, cardamom, and frankincense stand out the most. The floral notes don’t really stand out to me. The packaging is unique. It is classy and bright, the bottle is glass (which I’m a fan of). The scent last for a while on clothing, but given the price range I feel it could be better. Overall I feel this is a nice bold fragrance to add to the collection. I will say I would like to try more from this brand now that I’ve tried this product.

It lasted on my skin for a good amount of time and I received compliments wherever I went. It is not over powering and it is also not so weak. It was the right amount of strength for me and I enjoyed the notes of this fragrance.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Eau de Parfum truly feels like luxury in a bottle. From the first spray, it gives a refreshing burst of clean citrus mixed with a hint of spice that immediately feels elegant and sophisticated. As it starts to settle, the jasmine begins to unfold, not the overly sweet or powdery kind, but a smooth, rich floral that feels modern and refined. It blends beautifully with warm amber woods and subtle smoky undertones, creating a scent that feels balanced and effortlessly chic.

What I really love about this fragrance is how it melts into the skin and becomes more personal the longer you wear it. The notes don’t fight for attention; they flow together in harmony, transitioning naturally from bright and fresh to warm and sensual. The projection is noticeable but not overpowering; it’s the kind of scent that makes people curious enough to ask what you’re wearing without filling the entire room.

The bottle itself is simple yet luxurious, with its clear glass showcasing the pale golden liquid inside and minimalist design that perfectly matches the fragrance’s refined personality. Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia feels timeless and versatile, fresh enough for daytime wear but with enough depth to make it perfect for evenings or cooler weather.

Smelling directly from the atomizer I smell tea, some spice and hint of jasmine. When I initially sprayed it I was hit with a strong blast of cardamom, citrus and alcohol and I thought it was a very masculine scent that I could not wear. As it dried down I really loved the tea and jasmine notes and the spicy cardamom became more subdued but still there. I would say this is definitely unisex but leaning slightly masculine.

When it comes to the scent, it is exactly the scent that comes to mind when you think of 'old money'. My description is refined, effortless, warm and powerful. The specifics of the scent form my POV is the jasmine is crisp and cool rather than too sweet or overpowering.This fragrance gives off a relaxed kind of luxury (I know I keep saying luxury) but it's almost like you’re on a yacht in a light linen shirt, the sun warm, the sea breeze gentle, and everything feels perfectly in its place.

It is so much richer and deeper woody notes, that come through later.

To me, this fragrance leans a bit on the masculine side, definitely not sweet or powdery, but still wears beautifully as a unisex scent. I actually love that about it. It has that confident, elegant vibe without being too heavy or overwhelming. The blend of jasmine, black tea, and woods feels smooth and modern. The dry-down is where it really shines for me, it settles warmly, and slightly smoky, which makes it perfect for colder weather. I received this perfume as part of an educational program.",10/23/25 08:31,thee.ology
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I had high hopes for this perfume, but it turned out to be a bit different from what I expected. The scent leans more on the masculine side — bold, woody, and slightly spicy — rather than the soft, feminine floral I was anticipating. The opening hits strong with woody notes blended with cardamom and a touch of zesty lemon, creating a striking first impression. However, despite that powerful start, the lasting power is surprisingly weak and fades faster than I’d like.

It’s a fragrance that works better for evenings or cooler weather when you want something sophisticated and noticeable, but it doesn’t quite fit my personal taste for daily wear. While I appreciate the experience, it’s not one I see myself reaching for again. I received this perfume as part of an educational program.",10/23/25 04:57,Honestlynur
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I’m a fragrance enthusiast and this is my first fragrance from this brand. I am loving the Acqua di Parma Gelsomino A Freddo Eau de Parfum, it’s refreshing, warm and sophisticated that beautifully captures the essence of jasmine with a modern, vibrant twist. The glass is clear, showcasing the pale golden liquid inside, and the label and cap are minimalist yet luxurious .The perfume opens with fresh citrus notes. Definitely getting another bottle before this runs out. The packaging looks luxurious. I received this product as a part of educational purpose.",10/22/25 21:47,Zoya1997
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Eau de Parfum is luxury in a bottle! The way that this fragrance develops and becomes a part of you is a special experience. The fragrance is distinct in an alluring, head-turning kind of way, but as it wears, it melts into the skin, forming a unique bond with the wearer. While it is vibrant, the scent does not enter the room before you. Rather, the sillage invites others to ask, “Who is wearing that amazing fragrance?!” I love how the fragrance develops right under your nose. Upon first spray, it envelopes your senses and takes you on a scent journey through the fragrance notes, starting with the bold frankincense, dense cardamom, and zesty citrus, to be immediately and pleasantly greeted by jasmine and white florals, leading to a symphonic finale of deep amber woods. I like how the notes are balanced and maintain their consistency throughout. This may be controversial, but I like how the fragrance softens, and even though it has a lot of what can be considered “intense” notes, it is not abrasive to the senses but a sensual, refined delight.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Review of Acqua di Parma Freddo Ambrosia Eau de Parfum

If you’re looking for a fragrance that truly captures the essence of summer while remaining sophisticated, Acqua di Parma's Freddo Ambrosia Eau de Parfum is a must-try. From the moment you spritz it on, you’re greeted with a refreshing burst of citrus that feels invigorating and uplifting. The top notes of bergamot and lemon create a bright and zesty opening that instantly transports you to a sun-drenched Italian terrace. It’s the kind of fragrance that makes you feel alive and ready to embrace the day.

As the scent develops, the heart notes reveal a beautiful blend of floral and herbal elements. The inclusion of lavender adds a calming touch, balancing the initial brightness with a subtle depth that is both comforting and elegant. This transition is where Freddo Ambrosia truly shines; it evolves from a lively citrus into a more complex and refined scent that feels perfect for both day and evening wear. It’s versatile enough to wear to the office or for a romantic dinner, making it a great addition to any fragrance collection.

What sets Freddo Ambrosia apart is its longevity and sillage. The base notes of cedarwood and amber create a warm, inviting finish that lingers on the skin without being overpowering. You’ll find that even after hours, there’s a delightful softness that remains, reminding you of the fragrance without overwhelming your senses. Overall, Acqua di Parma Freddo Ambrosia is a beautifully crafted perfume that embodies elegance and freshness, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to elevate their scent game. If you appreciate high-quality fragrances that tell a story, this one is definitely worth exploring!",10/22/25 15:36,Gossipgirl122
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I’ve previously tried a fragrance from Acqua di Parma some years ago and I loved it but this Gelsomino A Freddo Ambrosia is on another level. This fragrance is a complete statement maker and it projects like crazy!!! At first when I sprayed it, I immediately get the crisp lemon brightness, it is enveloped in the jasmine that somehow felt both fresh and deep. By the time the woods get settled in, I knew I was wearing something special. It’s refined, distinct, and perfect for when I want to feel a little elevated. There’s a whisper of cardamom and frankincense that gives the scent a quiet sophistication, like jasmine vines stretching in the evening air beside a flickering candle. There’s also an unexpected note of black tea and orris in the middle that keeps the fragrance from becoming too traditional. Even though it’s floral, it is not soft or simple.
What I love most about it is the balance. It’s bright but not sharp, woody but not too heavy. It feels unisex in the best way. Such a refined and polished scent overall!
I received this fragrance for free to test but my thoughts are completely unbiased.",10/22/25 14:40,Paradize
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I recently tested Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia by Acqua di Parma, and while it opens beautifully, it ultimately left me disappointed. The first impression is a bright lemony freshness that strangely reminded me of gardenia, even though that note isn’t listed. It's possibly due to the combination of jasmine, orris and sandalwood that gives off the smooth velvety gardenia like scent. It’s elegant and uplifting, but quite strong at first, so I applied sparingly to my neck and wrists. Unfortunately, the scent faded within just a couple of hours, leaving almost no trace on my skin or clothes. The packaging is stunning, and the fragrance itself is lovely at the start, but given its high price and poor longevity, I can’t recommend it overall.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"A dose of sophistication in a bottle! It smells like a timeless memory, a vintage room somewhere in Europe. Not too floral, not too woody, not overpowering, but charming.
As much as I am a fan of French parfum houses, I was very pleasantly surprised by this Italian brand and the craftsmanship of this fragrance. The jasmine notes are very subtle, and patchouli brings warmth yet not very prominent. I haven’t gotten any “powdery” feel at all, it is more warm and sensual. This is a very balanced scent combo in my opinion, the one that stands out and very replicates in the market. It is long lasting!! For over 4-6 hours. The craftsmanship level truly depicts luxury. Nothing about this fragrance smells “cheap”. If you are looking for a unique scent that’s not too seasonal, I would give this fragrance a try.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Extrait de Parfum is a strong and long-lasting fragrance. When I first opened the gorgeous orange box, the first thing I smelled was dill. There’s a certain note in some fragrances that smells like dill to my senses. That scent lingered on my skin until it dried, then I smelled the smoky, woodsy jasmine. The scent projection isn’t that great. Only a few people said they could smell it on me. I only need to use a few spritzes for it to last all day. I received this as part of an educational promotion.",10/22/25 06:41,Justgigi

There’s a beautiful balance between floral elegance and a soft, almost creamy sandalwood warmth that lingers on my skin for hours. It feels refined without being overpowering, perfect for both day and evening wear. Every time I wear it, I get compliments and questions about what it is.

It feels very refined and comforting at the same time. The packaging is simple but so classy, with the golden liquid that looks beautiful on my shelf. What I really like is how long it lasts; I can still smell it on my skin hours later, even after a busy day. It’s the kind of scent that makes me feel confident and put-together. My husband actually noticed right away and told me I smelled really good — which made me love it even more. Definitely a luxurious scent I can see both men and women enjoying.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I received Gelsomino A Freddo Ambrosia by Acqua Di Prama as a part of promotion campaign from beautytap. I have not tried any of their fragrances before so I was very very excited. I have heard mixed reviews about their fragrances, but if you ask me about this particular fragrance, I am simply in love with it. Its such a sophisticated, vibrant and alluring scent. Its the type of scent you want to smell more. And good thing it lingers with you for quite a long time. Its a truly unisex scent and anyone can wear it from what I have experienced.For me its a fresh, citrus, woodsy scent with a little added spice in it. It opens with fresh and citrus notes of lemon mixed with little spice from cardamom. With time it becomes even spicier and little floral when there is addition of Jasmine notes. Best part is dried down where you can enjoy sandalwood for quite a bit of time. Packaging is simple but elegant and I love the card boxing. Although its quite highly priced fragrance, but I think it pays for your money as the fragrance speaks for itself. Definitely a worth buying scent.",10/20/25 13:40,Annienabeel
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance smells like the coolness and calm of early morning. The jasmine is not sweet or heavy, but fresh and pure, as if it has just bloomed at dawn after a rainfall. At first, there’s a light touch of citrus — like a thin ray of sunlight breaking through the mist. Then the soft, transparent jasmine unfolds, surrounded by green notes and a gentle breath of air.

On the skin, it wears quietly and elegantly, without demanding attention, yet leaving a feeling of refinement and inner harmony. This fragrance is not about passion, but about calm, clarity, and light. It’s the kind of scent you want to wear when you need balance — when you just want to breathe and feel at ease.",10/20/25 11:45,Anna Fedoryshyna

It’s not overpowering, but it definitely makes an impression — clean, sophisticated, and timeless. I love how it transitions from crisp and cool to gently sweet as it settles. Perfect for spring mornings or cozy evenings when you want something elegant yet comforting.

It grabs your attention and I love wearing it.",10/20/25 10:20,Torikreviews
Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"The first spritz is crisp and green, almost icy, before the jasmine unfolds softly beneath it, delicate but alive. It’s a floral scent that feels balanced rather than powdery, with that clean, dewy undertone Acqua Di Parma does so well. There’s something quietly confident about it, elegant without being loud, like silk in perfume form.

As it settles, the fragrance warms slightly, and the florals become smoother, more golden, while still keeping that cool, refreshing brightness. I like that it feels different from typical jasmine perfumes, lighter and more contemporary, with an almost meditative calm to it. The longevity is impressive too, lingering softly throughout the day without ever becoming overwhelming. It’s the kind of scent that makes you feel polished but not perfumed, like it belongs on skin that’s just come in from a morning breeze. On gray days, it adds a touch of clarity, and on bright ones, it feels effortlessly in tune.",10/20/25 07:06,what-smells-g00d

The frankincense mixed with the other notes creates a really mature scent that makes you have to sit and think about it. It’s almost like it tells a story. It’s unique and will make you stand out from any other person wearing a perfume. As far as the product itself, scent aside, I do enjoy the packaging that it came in. It added to the experience of the fragrance and didn’t feel cheap. The bottle is beautiful as well and sets itself apart from others. If I had to change just one thing, I’d prefer if the scent lasted longer and lingered more. It’s such a beautiful scent and the extra punch and the lingering of the scent would be incredible together. That would show an even bigger message.

I’ve been wearing it for about five hours now, and it still smells just as rich and captivating as it did when I first applied it, which proves how long lasting it is. I’ve already received multiple compliments, and even my daughter’s teacher messaged me to ask what perfume my daughter was wearing because she loved it so much. That’s how noticeable and memorable it is! I can confidently say this fragrance has earned a permanent spot in my collection, and I’ll definitely be repurchasing once I run out.

Gelsomino a Freddo Ambrosia Acqua di Parma,"I grew up in a family where everyone adored perfumes and had many different fragrances.
So for me, since then, buying perfume is almost a sacred ritual. I know I’m depressed when I stop wanting to buy new scents. But thank God, this time I feel different — I’m meeting this autumn in a completely new way because I’ve found new love: a perfume whose scent can be described in one word — luxury. You’ll never mistake this scent for anything else. It stays on the skin for twelve hours and more — and on clothes, I won’t even start, you can still smell it days later. I can't clearly sense the citrus notes, but the amber and woody tones give it depth. The iris is simply fantastic — I’m experiencing this combination of aromas for the first time.
These are the perfumes that captivate and envelop you from the very first breath. When I wear them, I feel like I’m returning to myself. They are forgotten pleasant memories, especially of my trip to India, and that means a lot to me.
Its not ""easy"" combination, but perfect for evenings and especially for cold time of the year.",10/15/25 15:01,katerynavorobets

The open and mid were not outstanding, especially considering the price. But man the drydown was great. Maybe not 340 for a 50ml great, but pretty nice. Performance was good too which is what they were aiming for. That and to try and grab some cash from the extrait craze. I'll update again after further testing.

Acqua Nobile Magnolia Acqua di Parma,"I actually like this almost better than the Magnolia EDP- yes this has many more notes but it literally floats likes a refreshing citrusy and flowery cloud around me when I first put it on. The citrus keeps the Magnolia which IS noticeable to me from getting this sort of decaying undertone that many magnolia note scents have on me- so I'm happy! It does remind me of sitting on my Great Aunt's wraparound porch in a little town on the border of Texas and Louisianna, as a child. She had two big magnolia trees and there were lemon and lime bushes planted around the base of the porch intermingled with Jasmine- so maybe this is why I ADORE and love this scent so much. It never fails to get compliments and never fails to lift my spirits and give me a little bit of the warm comfort at the same time. Its hard not to think of sitting on a big white chair with my feet dangling drinking sweet tea and lemonade with my grandparents and my great aunt. Everyone's chemistry is different and I have been looking for a good magnolia scent forever. This is the best I've found for MY chemistry.",12/27/18 14:26,amy.yasuda@gmail.com
Acqua Nobile Magnolia Acqua di Parma,"To me, this doesn’t smell like magnolia. The opening is a generic white floral, mixed with bitter lemon and musk. The white floral aspects smell like freesia and lily of the valley (both are problem notes for me - freesia is often high pitched and screetchy, and lily of the valley is often too powdery and dated.)

It opens with prominent lemon, and then dries down into a slightly watery magnolia. When I compared the two side by side, Acqua Nobile Magnolia smells softer and slightly less floral than Magnolia Nobile, and it also gets a bit more dry during the 4th and 5th hour. But I doubt I'd be able to tell the different when sniffing them separately.

The sillage is soft and the longevity is around 6 hours. If you'd like a slightly less floral and more 'cologne'-like take of Magnolia Nobile, I think Acqua Nobile Magnolia would fit the bill.",07/30/15 14:34,StellaDiverFlynn

A bit of Ylang 1st press, then lacy orange blossom and sambac jasmine are woven throughout add understated complexity never smothering the Iris. A very restrained and light woody base of locust and birch frame this magnificently tailored garden in flawless, relaxed ease. No excessive sweets outside of what the natural florals bring. A touch heady, but not indolic in any way. Not much in the way of oily greasy orris and low on the powdery spectrum to my nose. Subtle frankincense and wood mitigates it with beautiful balance.

Iris Nobile Sublime Acqua di Parma,"Powdery Citrus WhiteFloral.

This is potent stuff, just as the original EDP. I sprayed on paper and it fills the room. All the Nobile perfumes I have tried, even the Acquas last all day on me, with quite substantial projection.

I do appreciate that some fragrances are stronger and last longer than others, but longevity experiences are jolly subjective. Dependant on body heat, skin oils, weather, season and what a person is normally used to wearing. If you are used to wearing veritable beasts every day, all else is going to feel a bit light!
I don't find Iris Nobile Sublime to be a light scent.

Reminds me (obviously) quite significantly of the original EDP and EDT, in fact I was hard pushed to tell the difference at first sniff.
But on comparison, this one is cooler, slightly less sweet (fruity spicy violet vanilla woods), less funky chypre, to the original. In that respect, it could be perceived as a bit lighter, airier in character. Less Iris. I can still detect the star anise. cannot for the life of me detect birch!?? maybe something salty, which is perhaps a bit suedelike, but suede/leather is probably more likely from the iris. And I am getting some likeness to the metallic cool white florals in Jardins de Bagatelle EDT. And something that smells very like gardenia.

Anyhow, all the Iris Nobiles I have worn are gorgeous, and if you like one, you might like them all, as they are of similar essence. White florals (with plenty of orange blossom and citrus oils sitting atop a smooth rooty iris), with that sweet spicy Francis Kurkdijan & Caron's perfume pizzazzery.

I like this more than Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile, as it has a star anise note that is really not my favorite, while this one doesn't include anise. Yet on my skin, this is the only one of Acqua di Parma's fragrances that just has poor longevity. On me, it becomes a skin scent about 2 hours after application.

Such a pitty! given that this is my favorite fragrance from this house. I even get better performance from Acqua Nobile Iris, which is an EDT. Still, I will continue to purchase this beauty. It will always be in my wordrobe. That´s how much I love this.

FYI, duration on my skin:
-Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile EDP: 4 hrs of moderate projection + 2 hrs as skin scent, and can live on my silk scarves up to 2 weeks.
-Acqua Nobile Iris EDT: 3 hrs of moderate projection + 2 hrs as skin scent
-Iris Nobile Sublime EDP: 2 hrs of moderate projection + 4 hrs as skin scent",08/16/19 16:52,anilinam

Iris Nobile Sublime Acqua di Parma,"I'm surprised at all the votes for medium silage and longevity.

For me this perfume has been a top performer in both aspects, and I don't have a great nose so unless a perfume is strong I probably won't notice it beyond the first half hour or so! INS is strong and projects - I can even smell it on yesterday's clothes from a foot of distance. Even on my skin it lasts several hours, which is a feat since my body chemistry seems to neutralize the vast majority of perfumes within 30-60 minutes.

In terms of fragrance, it's a beautiful, elegant, feminine sweet floral with some 'gravitas' to it. It's womanly, not girlish, and it's got a certain thickness to it...It smells 'liquid' or 'silky' to me, rather than 'airy' like a lot of perfumes do. It's primarily iris and orange blossom with an ever-so-slight spicy/woodsiness in the background that gives it that extra oomph.

Iris Nobile Sublime Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile Sublime, on me, smells quite similar to Iris Nobile EDP, mainly an orange blossom flanked by smooth iris. I'm not sure whether I can easily tell them apart if I smell them seperately.

But when compared side by side, there are a few noticeable differences. Iris Nobile Sublime appears more floral, less woody and more transparent, although it's still unmistakably elegant like the original EDP. The comparaison also helped me to pick out some more discreet notes in the original EDP, such as mimosa.

The sillage is moderate to soft and the longevity is around 8 hours. Although I find them too similar to own both, Iris Nobile Sublime is still a sophiscated floral and a solid offering from Acqua di Parma. If you happen to find Iris Nobile EDP a tad too thick, I think the Sublime version might work well.",03/03/15 13:44,StellaDiverFlynn
Iris Nobile Sublime Acqua di Parma,"Absolutely heavenly !!! Acqua di Parma really knows how to create fragrances. Not only do they smell natural and of highest quality but also they have a certain elegance and richness to them that some others houses just can't quite establish. I am impressed by the entire iris. Line , EDP is amazing , rich full and elegant like no other iris scent out there. Now with the addition of sublime this iris line is even better and it is gourgous change to its original perfume. Very similar in my opinion. At this point I need to wear them both side by side to add the difference between them to my review. Which I will do in the next few days ! So far I feel it is as round and smooth and elegant as its sister :)
After wearing both I am loving both but they are quite different. The orig EDP is deeper, louder and intense. It's my favourite of all perfumes as of late. The sublime is muted , smoother and the birch makes it suede like , it not as loud and its softer and a tat less sweet. As mister chaz mentioned ,it almost feels transparent. That's a good way of putting it. Both fabulous !!!!",03/31/14 15:32,Germany
Iris Nobile Sublime Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is amazing and its been in a cosmetic bag with other samples. Im surprised at Acqua di parma because their line is usually wears as low in sillage.

Iris Nobile Sublime Acqua di Parma,"Gorgeous!! But what can I say...I love iris and orange blossom and this is the best of both worlds. Out of the bottle the neroli is beautiful and lends a gorgeous damp honey note. Not damp like musty but damp like dew on the petals of the flower. Like they were picked at the perfect moment.

Soft, elegant, ladylike...a slight hint of powder but ever so slight before the iris politely invites herself to the party. The iris begins to shine and radiate without making the other notes obsolete. A light touch of jasmine. Like you just brushed up against a beautiful blooming bush in full bloom. This almost has a musk like quality. No heavy woods and no detectable patchouli. The ending is as beautiful as the beginning. I sampled this earlier today and just ordered a bottle.

Iris Nobile Sublime Acqua di Parma,"Thanks to lovely MrsLetterO I am wearing a sample of this today. All I can say is that so far is that the opening notes are very promising and it smells gorgeous to me.
So, after wearing this little beauty for 8 hours, this is what I think...opening quite sweet, almost like a cross between Tom Ford Violet Blonde and Balenciaga Paris which is quite strange as there are supposedly no violets here? The drydown is a bit soapy and a bit powdery, somewhat similar to Iris Nobile but less woody. The scent would be suited well for a cold rainy day, just like today, as it is a lovely warm comfort scent which slowly turns into a 'nuzzle' scent.
One thing I will say is this though...shame it only comes in 75mls size and shame it's soooo pricey.",09/20/12 23:02,smelling_gr8

Acqua Nobile Rosa Acqua di Parma,"[AUG. 2021]
This was the kind of rose I wanted for quite a while!

Most non-niche designer florals tend to be too sweet or too bright and they usually make my nose invert itself but the 125ml Rosa EDT is exactly the pretty, light, dainty and surprisingly natural smelling tea-rose I've tried. Even Jo Malone didn't cut it (PS: I love Bronze Wood and Leather.)

I've had real rosewater and AdP's Rosa is a wearable version of that with none of the musky damp smell or pond-water inclinations of other ""dirty"" / naturalist roses (my exception for this genre goes to Paestum Rose, Olene, Florence Iris, Prive, Narcotic Venus, Feminite Du Bois, La Panthere Parfum, and Oud Royal.)

Has that beautiful rosewater smell very similar to Serge Lutens' Santal Majuscule but the Majuscule's cocoa-rosewood powdery sweetness got too cloying for me after a prolonged use of time. (Ironically, I still can't get enough of the milk-incense of my Carner Palo Santo because its that delicious! I guess for Majuscule it was both too bright and too heavy. Also sold my Creed Acqua Fiorentina after a while because if I'm getting this and Narcotic Venus (or Roja 51 Essence), best to send off Fiorentina to a more caring home!)

Regardless, with 125ml and a beautiful stand (the base of its box) and large bottle for this price this was a pretty good deal for me! Sometimes I might be anosmic but people around me can definitely pick up my Rosa. Quite like a 4711 but less body-tonic, more like perfume: light and multi-use with added body and detail thanks to Rosa's supporting cast of well picked spring flowery notes!

If you loved Perfume Workshop's Tea Rose (1977) this is the bang-for-buck upgrade you're looking for - - goodbye to itchy alcohol sensations and eye-wateringly thin and sharp emulations of roses. (Also consider for a wonderful time with quality florals: perfumes by Dawn Spencer Hurwitz, Patricia Nicolai, and Amouage! If this is your favourite genre of florals please enjoy Amouage's Love Mimosa!)

PS: The others are right, its very Magnolia flower smelling! This is probably why I picked Rosa EDT over Magnolia Nobile, besides price tag and the Magnolia Nobile's ""yes, yes..."" milquetoast agreeableness.",08/29/21 00:26,MannyOyson
Acqua Nobile Rosa Acqua di Parma,Pretty but nothing to remember or groundbreaking. It could be a safe gift to buy,01/09/21 16:31,Green.colver
Acqua Nobile Rosa Acqua di Parma,"Another beautiful bright rosey fragrance. In the Acqua Nobile tradition of splendidly blended florals, on a slightly sweet, creamy base. I often prefer to wear the Aqua EDT versions, the top and middle notes are uplifted and more able to escape the more dense/intense EDP base notes of this line. I barely detect the citrus.

The freesias and pepper feel very present to begin in this cool weather testing, alongside a soft fruity edge. Salty sweet skin, of amber and musk. And of course, the main players, a full blooming bushel of roses. I could have done without the freesia (I just don't enjoy freesia note in perfumery) and cyclamen notes, but they're not too much of a pair of intruders to the mix.

It reminds me somewhat of With Love by Guerlain, but i prefer Rosa Nobile, as it's easier to wear, brighter, more rosey, a more sweet amber dry down, without the sharp, slightly chalky ""florality"" that is so present in floral perfumes from early 2000's.
La Colle Noire also springs to mind, even Aerin's Rose de Grasse. Depends what you are looking for in a rose. This rose is pretty, modern, clean, quite simple, but not boring.

EDIT: this has really quite a powerful scent to my nose today. esp. for an EDT. It's been a few hours, it seems to intensify with wear.",09/04/20 03:02,Angeldaisy
Acqua Nobile Rosa Acqua di Parma,"Sometimes you find cheap perfumes that smell expensive (the best kind!) and sometimes you find expensive perfumes that just don't live up to the pricetag. This is the latter for me. The top notes of this are a loud, obnoxious, very typical ""perfumy"" smell that I feel like I've smelled hundreds of times before and didn't like it any of those hundreds of times either. Once you get down to the pretty little rose that's been buried, suffocating under all the top notes, it's so quiet and exhausted from all the weight that it's barely detectable. I'd have to spray too much of the part I don't like to smell the part that I do like, and that's a no-go for me for sure.",01/24/17 11:44,Black_Swan

Rosa Nobile is like a warm hug.the rose is accurate and perceptible but it's a clear scent, not heady. But I Guess peony and violet help on that.
Undoubtedly I would purchase this fragrance, it's extremely nice and attractive. But perhaps it's my mind playing emotional blackmail to my senses.

The sillage is moderate to soft and the longevity is around 9 hours. Acqua Nobile Rosa is as pretty and modern as Rosa Nobile, just slightly more citrus and lighter. But I'm not sure it stands out among other similar but more affordable modern rose fragrances.",07/20/15 14:13,StellaDiverFlynn

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"After seeing all the trends—the oud, the sweet gourmands—it's fragrances like Colonia Il Profumo that remind you why the classic formulas always shine. Sometimes, simplicity and quality are truly all you need.

This is such a bright, uplifting fragrance that just puts a smile on my face. It follows that classic structure: sparkling citrus in the top, some floral middle notes, all resting on a clean, woody-aromatic base.

What keeps it from being boring is the subtle creativity in the blend. The notes of pineapple, verbena, and ylang-ylang add a touch of uniqueness that makes it stand out from typical citrus colognes. It's unique enough to be interesting, but still familiar enough to feel comforting. A solid release that proves classic style never fails.

You can absolutely use it every day, even on autumn-winter, but it’s more suited in the day for these seasons. I personally feel it has too much depth for a high heat summer day, but you may be able to get away with it if you like stronger fragrances, for this case I would definitely go with Essenza. Duration is good but not great or beast mode, absolutely worthy of trying this fragrance.

To me, it starts off with very sharp and unappealing citrus, then dies down into a mishmash of deeper notes.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Il Profumo is a citrus, herbal, and woody fragrance.

Its opening has excellent citrus and herbal notes, as is customary with Acqua di Parma. Bergamot and lime are the most noticeable, along with herbal notes of petitgrain, basil, lemon verbena, and neroli flower. As the minutes pass, woody notes, oakmoss, vetiver, patchouli, and a leather accord vaguely reminiscent of Parma Leather increase in presence, but in this fragrance, the aromatics dominate.

This new version of the Acqua di Parma cologne line is ideal for daytime wear in any season and occasionally for evening wear during the summer. Perfect for office work, formal, or casual situations, as it provides a good degree of elegance.

The longevity of this fragrance was not bad for me, lasting up to 8 hours. With a good scent trail for the first two hours, it's moderate to weak throughout its development.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"It's that type of scent very appealing to me. Here we have nothing new for sure but this parfum is very nice. So nice that i bought a 180ml bottle. basically it's the original colonia but more modern, deeper, denser. This and buongiorno are very solid releases. Regarding the performance, i have to say that my 180ml bottle has an inferior performance compared to the 100ml tester bottle of the store. The difference is quite clear to my nose. So this is the only down side, i hope the maturation of the juice will help me. However the smell is fantastic but the price is a bit too high considering the performance (at least with my bottle).
Bellissimo profumo, è la classica colonia ma un po' più moderna, più densa e interessante. Se vi piace il genere è un amore scontato. L'unica cosa deludente è la performance: la mia bottiglia da 180ml ha una performance nettamente inferiore a quella del tester del negozio. Quello della profumeria mi è rimasto tanto sulla pelle mentre quello che ho comprato dura molto meno. Che sfiga.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I do like the Colonia line very much, the original, pura and essenza. Saying this is tried this out in John Lewis last week and it’s amazing and bought a 50ml bottle on the spot. Fresh, quite fruity citrus, not too sweet. Relatively long lasting and natural citrus too, maintains the same dna of the original Colonia so if you like that it’d be hard to not love this. Everything feels updated with more advanced ingredients . A bit fruiter and a more long lasting dry down, projects for a couple of hours and dries down to a slightly fruity, soapy neroli.
If you have the money to burn it’s an easy, impossible to hate, blind buy especially for aa more mature man/woman who likes citrus and pettigrain/neroli. Either way do yourself a favour and seek it out to sample next time you see an Acqua de Parma stand.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I had posted a review of this fragrance in the past, when I sniffed it at a store and couldn't get over how good it smelled. I am happy to report that I was able to get my hands on a 100ml bottle of it and wear it a couple of times. I still stand by what I said a long while ago. This is an absolute banger of a fragrance.

This is a quite complex fragrance. The opening is pretty much bright, fizzy, very strong, almost bitter citruses with some sweetness in the background. Most of the very strong citruses wear off in around an hour or two, leaving behind the sweetness and introducing some floral notes. This sounds very feminine, but the sandalwood (and maybe leather too?) slaps it right back into the masculine zone (or unisex at the very least). Definitely not a super masculine fragrance, and I can imagine ladies being able to pull this one off without too much of a problem. The dry down lasts around 7 -8 hours on my skin which is really really impressive for this kind of fragrance. In total, the fragrance lasts for around 8-9 hours on my skin. This is not a weak fragrance by any means. And if this somehow still doesn't satisfy you, you can apply a bit of it to your clothes without having to worry about them getting spoiled. Just make sure you apply from a distance and avoid applying on pure white clothes. This is easily a 3 season special occasions fragrance for me. Every now and then, I just keep on reaching for the bottle, and sniffing the cap. This fragrance always brings a big wide smile to my face.

I also got my hands on the OG colonia, and now I can actually see that they are quite a bit different from each other. Il Profumo is definitely the modern version of the OG colonia. If I were to talk in audiophile terms, ADP took the OG colonia, bass boosted it (made it sweeter), and treble boosted it (made the citruses stronger), and made it louder (project more and last more), and named it Il Profumo. The OG colonia does not have this much sweetness or brightness. It is for sure a timeless scent, but the Il Profumo, however, might not be considered as a timeless scent. I do prefer the Il Profumo, not just because of the longevity, but also the scent. Overall, I would rate this fragrance 10/10 not taking the high price point in consideration. Just the scent itself and its performance is absolute perfection.",06/24/25 09:23,manpahul_singh

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Opens masculine with a really fruity and clearly pink, not black, pepper (pink peppers are fruits), brightness and citrus.
When the mids come the rose gives it some sweetness and it starts to lean unisex.
Once the florals disappear it dries down masculine again. I get vetiver in the dry down most prominently but it is not out of balance like I find a lot of fragrances with vetiver.

I sampled this along with PDM Castley (which is beastly) and this clearly performs worse than that but I would not classify this as bad performance. I think it has normal/good performance.

This is a banger and my current favorite from ADP.",06/06/25 21:43,vanillivanilli
Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I'll Profumo opens sort of like a trybrid of the OG Colonia, the greatest Citrus Aromatic ever Dior Eau Sauvage EDT, and maybe Chanel Pour Monsieur. Really nice. My invoking those three comparatives is based on memory, even though I have bottles of all three in my collection. I did spray the 1916 Colonia original on blotter to compare while wearing Il Profumo though. The Il Profumo is modern, while the OG is of course a more vintage DNA. And I think the OG is smoother, and the classic vintage scent profile is classier. It gives me vibes of a luxury soap in an Art Deco luxury hotel in Hollywood of the 1920's. I can imagine Cary Grant wearing it in the 1930's, which he did. Thats the advantage of the original Colonia for me. Il Profumo has more of a scratchy, woody texture due to its cedar, vetiver, and petitgrain. It also dries down to go its own way, so it's not entirely redundant to the others. It's beautiful, make no mistake about that.",06/04/25 18:37,JmThms

But it does have the staying power. However after a few hours it’s more of an intimate affair. I always find that with scents like these, when you spray them is the best most uplifting part. I don’t mind reapplying if I can. It’s that burst of freshnes that is mood lifting and refreshing. And for those that have it, during the mid and base you get wafts of Dior’s Eau Savauge EDP.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Modern interpretation of the classic however personally I prefer the original.

Colonia has a timestamp on it, it feels of its time and timeless. Part of the reason I enjoy it so much is to think of all the people who have worn it through the years and how it was the scent in the air during periods of history.

This opens much the same to my nose and stays similar for the first hour or so but when the soapy citrus notes begin to drop off your left with a very modern woody base which could be any number of modern perfumes. The original settles into a feeling of quiet Italian confidence where as this just loses that in my opinion.

It’s nice but it doesn’t scratch the same itch as the original. It’s a product of it’s time and the fact that the general populous want everything to last forever and project heavily, some things aren’t meant to.",04/03/25 03:46,Tacoscent

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Aloha all,
I can’t get away from this. I wrote a review on Reddit and a version of it is:

This cologne is Earnest Hemingway driving a limited edition convertible Porsche, with a 24 karat colored orange-yellow-brown supple leather interior, highlighted with a French Ultra Marine Blue trim. The exterior can be whatever color you like most: heather Grey, Black, Warm Dark Blue, or Silver?

The motor was made by three well-dressed, sun-kissed Italian engineers, on loan from Ferrari, who took their time to pay homage to both Porsche and Ferrari ethos, while they perfected this smooth, efficient, quietly elegant rumble of a beast machine; adding several inches to the front, back, sides, and roominess; they also made sure not to deviate too far from either brand. A Porsche on the outside; a Ferrari on the inside, and a unique updated Porsche emblem.

This Earnest Hemingway edition Porsche only drives during balmy weather and when the sun is glowing orange warmth, or is it that this car simply changes the weather to be as such whenever you are near it?

Earnest drives from one town to the next. Stopping at restaurants along the way that overlook the Mediterranean. You warmly wave to him when his silage hits you. He’s not arrogant, at all, and smiles back. He never speeds, so you can see his face, but if you’re unaware… he might pass you before you smell him.

When he stops to eat. Waiters bring him some fresh cheese, olive oil, and a small portion of healthy protein. He stays briefly, and is served an espresso which he drinks in and enjoys for what seems an eternity, yet quickly gets up and reads aloud to everyone his latest vignette he dreamt up while driving to this meal. He’s gone and you are left wanting more, but fully understanding a novel within minimal words. Like his prose, this cologne is: simple, succinct, and to the point.

I have been cheating with this. It’s a near 9.6; however, it does not last as long as I’d like, and I have added some Molecule 01 to my travel bottle along with decanting some of this cologne into it, and I love it! Definitely helps!

I also have molecule 01 + patchouli and molecule 01 + black tea. I just layered the M01 + patchouli, let it dry, and then applied my five sprays of Colonia il Profumo (one behind each ear, back of neck, chest, and shirt & neck - just after moisturizing with hyaluronic acid). This is my normal routine with this; however, you could go 7 sprays and if so, this is what I’d recommend if you’re going out out:

Shower. Moisturize with Hyaluronic Acid; special attention to back of neck and behind ears.

Spray behind each ear, one back of neck and hair, another moisturized undressed chest, one back of knees (squeeze close together), one spray into each crook of your elbow, held close to your body with your shirt now on (so some overspray hits your shirt), and then you’re done. Normally I’d only do five! This cologne needs five sprays, and possible refresh of three sprays several hours into your day.

3-5 for school, work, or day to day, and seven if you’re going out out.

I think layering it with the M01 and patchouli is ingenuous! I already know the M01as a base helps. Tomorrow I will try two layering sprays of the M01+ black tea plus 5 sprays. I am afraid to derail the original, but I’m after longevity here and I am convinced the M01 helps.

One small caveat is: the ylang ylang seems to bother my eyes until it dries down. I am a little sensitive to some things but not a lot, but I noticed this each time I wear it. I will push past this, because that is how elegant this scent is.

For what it’s worth: I KrUsH Acqua Di Gio Profundo and just got the Elixir (and love it), most days of the week. I also appreciate Armani Code, Le Labo Tuberuse 40 & Santal, but my running top five are:

Molecule 01 layered with: ADG Profundo.
ADG Elixir (thus far - a little too new to tell - this might drop down one).
This! And, layering is still being fleshed out.
Molecule 01 layered with: Acqua Di Parma Amalfi.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I’m glad I sampled it. This fragrance starts out great but immediately this takes on to different direction that doesn’t quite resemble the colonia DNA. Not really classic soapy but more of a modern citrus and woody. Resembles of many modern designer colognes. A safe blind buy. But disappointed by the absence of “Colonia” profile.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I don't understand people who write about durability for several hours. I bought 180 ml for $250 hoping for durability, but I got 10 minutes of rich citrus, which is similar to lemon candies when you just opened the package with them. Then it disappears and sandalwood or moss appears, which is almost elusive, unless you sniff very hard and closely. But after an hour, it is gone altogether. I look at the name ""Profumo"", then in the mirror at a person who could buy a simple cologne for $50 and understand why. The biggest disappointment of 2025. I can conclude that the reviews here are written in the interests of the company. Be sure to buy a sample or decant before buying a bottle.",03/12/25 00:56,Vladyslav1389
Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"At last, what all the Colonia fans have been waiting for. A parfum of the beautiful fragrance that will last. Unfortunately this is not it. I have the original Colonia, which is amazing, but wears off quickly as we know. Then I purchased Essenza hoping for something that lasts longer (which it mildly does).Then I accidentally found out that there was a parfum drop of the original. So I received a bottle for my Birthday and was super exited to try this version out. Four good neck sprays and one on each wrist reveals a nice lemon and Neroli scent and that’s about it. Hasn’t got the nice soapy/powdery trail of the original and dries down just as quickly to nothing within an hour or so. It’s a pretty basic scent that you wouldn’t mind spending £25 on but not over £100. So after waiting a long time for this release and I’ve used it everyday for a week now and have to ask other people ‘can you smell it’?, to which the answer is “barely”.
So overall way too expensive for a generic fresh scent that won’t last. A disappointment I’m afraid.",03/08/25 10:09,Jim Bobs
Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I messed up by smelling it at a store the other day. Now I am desperately waiting for it to hit discounters......If it doesn't hit discounters by 3 months or so, I will just buy it full retail. I am just taking the benefit of the fact that this is a summer-ish fragrance and right now it is full winter.

This was my first time smelling anything from Acqua Di Parma. My initial reaction to it was something like: ""It feels like somebody squeezed a lemon right inside my nose"".....in short, I didn't like it. However, I took the test strip home along with many others that I smelled at the store that day. Colonia Il Profumo grew on me like bamboo. And I can easily say that this would last a really really long time on the skin since i could still smell the perfume on the strip 3 days after.

To me, this is the freshest smelling fragrance that I ever put my nose on. This one would easily be a ""special occasions summer fragrance"" in my collection. I would easily rock it during the day and even night.

Honestly, my nose isn't developed enough to be able to make out much of a difference between the OG version (Colonia EDC) and this version. The only difference was that this one smells a little more strong, a little more on the lemon which I can easily say is just because it has more fragrance oil. I am not buying the EDC because everybody says that it doesn't last more than 4 hours. I am only waiting for the Il Profumo because of the longevity. Otherwise I would say both are quite similar and I don't have a preference for one over the other.

And yes, this is my first Fragrantica review EVER. I just had to start with this fragrance. I am absolutely in love with it.",03/04/25 08:56,manpahul_singh
Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"I agree with what @chemdar is saying a couple of messages below. I does inscribe itself in the colonia line (no surprises there). The pineapple is maybe the one note that sticks out. Once it dried down I found the neroli to really come forward and to make Colonia Il Profumo to smell a lot like Essenza.

I don't know for the longevity if I would say it's greater than anything else in the line. It seems to be alongside Essenza and C.L.U.B. but I would need to try a few more times to be sure.

Overall a pleasant experience, but I will wait until it hits discounter sites before considering buying it. In the meantime, I'll stick to Essenza to get my Colonia fix.",03/02/25 05:05,Cheksa

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Got a sample a week back, totally fell in love with it!

The original Colonia was a signature scent of mine, but after sampling the new. Well it has changed.

Colonia profumo still has the same DNA as colonia, but made it modern and up to date. Not as sharp, smoother, more lemony opening and last longer. Florals lingering in the background. Due to it being an EDP the EDC has a larger projection.

Colonia Profumo is a signature scent for the well groomed, stressfree man who knows his own worth!

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Have smelt this today and I am not impressed. This iteration smells like a marketing product (which factually it is if you check the website and all the very expensive accessories presented with the launch of this eau de parfum) because it lacks personality compared to the original and as such will please the largest common denominator, which is LVMH politics nowadays. Leans more feminine too.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Smells fantastic. Fizzy, warm, masculine. Very nice citrus, as is to be expected of ADP. Performance is mediocre, at best. Price is just too much for an ADP, regardless of concentration. I know some will disagree. That's ok. I tested it, and despite it smelling good, it neither blew me away nor performed in a way that could justify the high price.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Stunning. Did I say stunning. I only purchased Naxos last week (which I am trialling) but if you love citrus and really sweet and powerful citrus, this is for you. This is far stronger than Naxos - it shares similar notes but it’s much more powerful. This is very sweet and almost takes you into Gourmand as some how it is super sweet on my skin - the lemon and orange are candied and also fresh - it’s not bitter at all. I think the blending of the florals and the pineapple give this its sweetness without me smelling it as a note (not being a fan of pineapple in fragrance - I’m really happy about that 😊). One squirt and I was hooked. This is my first in this brand - and now I will definitely try many more.",01/26/25 05:41,elizabeth.grayton
Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Firstly, this is a very AdP style fragrance, that doesn’t veer off a well trodden path so fans of the house will be pleased. I’ve only just got it so will update more once I’ve worn it properly. However, first impressions give me a very bright, fizzy citrus opening that’s strong and potent. As it dries down, the florals come to the fore and this stage actually reminds me more of pre-reformulated Essenza, which I had many years ago. It has that soapy clean, floral musk. Fortunately, I don’t find the florals too feminine and this can easily be worn by anyone. I’m not a patchouli fan but fortunately I don’t get much in the base. It’s very reminiscent of Colonia overall but with a more modern vibe.

Performance seems decent although not a powerhouse but certainly more potent than many of their fragrances, lasting throughout the day with a good amount of projection for a few hours before lingering as a more intimate scent. I find it perfectly unisex and this will be a stunner when the summer arrives.

Fans of AdP style fragrances who wish for better performance will find this super appealing. They’ve stuck to what they do best rather than taking it into completely different territory which is a big win for me. The big trick they’ve pulled off very well, imho, is maintaining the essence of Colonia but giving it a slight update so it doesn’t smell so dated, whilst increasing performance which is always a good thing. I could imagine this becoming very popular. Gorgeous fragrance, bravo AdP.",01/24/25 09:06,philball
Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Yes! This is what I'm talking about! Colonia is my favorite fragrance of all time so I'm very excited to own this. I've been wanting ADP to put just a BIT more emphasis on performance to make the house more relevant, and I'm glad this is how they begin. All that's left are some new modern Italian standalone fragrances (i.e. not a Colonia flanker or ingredients/Mediterraneo/signatures of the sun collection).",01/23/25 07:11,agonzony
Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Wearing this as I type. The original, whilst classic, had a slight fustiness for me, this is colonia brought up to date. It’s very clean and warm. Well put together, classic even. Im looking forward to this one in summer, but for a fresh lift and post shower clean feeling, it’s lovely in winter too.

So let’s get into it. I get the pineapple but literally the faintest of faint. The ylang ylang gives a nice floral touch but not overly feminine, especially as it’s balanced out by the neroli. The musks are gentle, clean, almost suedy.

Look, I could go on, but this is much more than the sum of its parts. I think it’s a beautifully crafted fragrance. Longevity seems fine. I liked it after sampling so I hit the 180ml bottle. This is going to be a great weekend go to and daily up-lifter. It’s classy, it’s clean. It’s elegant. Don’t expect fireworks, but expect to feel well put together when wearing this.

Colonia Il Profumo Acqua di Parma,"Sampled this in store today. Faithful to the original, however it does feel stronger and longer-lasting. I pick up more florals, giving it a slightly more modern feel than the orignal. I really didn't pick up any pineapple, thankfully.

Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This amber is salty. Truly, undeniably so. No sweetness or bubble gum, no smoke, as might be expected. No, there's a certain fragrant dryness as sensed in pencil shavings and oily graphite, orris root, ambrette and clay. But most of all, thick ambergris the way I imagine it without having smelled the real material. Seamud, deep and rich mineralic smell, crossbred with the original Colonia's bitter-floral orange blossom. It seemed force-fed into the fragrance at first and I can imagine it's obligatory for all AdP fragrances to contain it in small amounts; but it surely gives a certain familiar soapy barbershop angle to the saltiness, a bit of light in this glowing dusk of a fragrance.
It is salty ambergris, yes, but taken out of the sea, inhabiting it's own space between storms and cozy homes.
Ambrarem by Histories de Parfums renders a similar salty amber accord, pairing it with equally elemental oud note. It is more dramatic and somber at the same time, like a gothic driftwood from a Frankenstein movie (love it).
Here, thanks to the Acqua di Parma lining, a strange but acceptable balance, or contrast, is achieved. Despite the raw unsweetened nature of the material, it can easily serve as a regular cologne, too",04/08/25 13:26,iris

Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Blind-bought because of the sandalwood-ambergris combo and I am not disappointed. It has an intense, slightly aquatic, slightly animalic ambergris that gives the entire fragrance a pop, a somewhat leathery--or dark wood--backbone, a smoothness from the sandalwood, and an uplifting rose. It smells quite masculine, but in a mature way. It gives off the mission in sf vibes. Color-wise, this fragrance is chocolate brown, cerulean blue, and magenta colored. If you've ever smelled an ambergris candle or match, this fragrance smells like that but with added depth. I don't get crazy projection or longevity--and the juice isn't thick like a perfume would be. That said, I got mine for pretty cheap, so I am planning to spritz the hell out of this.",12/03/24 20:12,mtshc
Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Such erratic creation. I think this is huge advantage of this fragrance. It is multifaceted from the beginning to the end, and brilliance of these facets change from vegetal to mineral, floral to animalic. At start there is tense oily citrus wave mixed with loud, slightly powdery rose of the heart. The green, vegetal note sound with I think cypriol in the core too. Together with musk from the base those three might be quite mischievous, as it reminded me of stable smell at one stage of the evolution. Sweet (sweaty) hay/horse coat, earthiness. Not dirty but not clean either. However, this weird sensation lasts only for a minute as the fragrance settles and projects as slightly powdery, musky-ambery, soapy even, perfectly balanced with hint of imitating leather woods. It's never loud, yet it is very long lasting, leaving a tray of oriental sweetness with hint of ambra fused in animalic tone. It is not fresh in anyway, but it does splendid job in the cloudy morning as revealing. I agree with the Baltic Sea connotation. It's not a happy scent. It is somehow raw and primal, yet soft and refined. As it's purpose is to be just beautiful, not easily descriptive, ephemeric idea of a perfume.
In 2024 I sadly attended two funerals, in the mid spring and mid autumn, I was closely involved. AdP Ambra was my shield and tribute. As precious balm for both body and soul. And I am not even sure that I like it. Surely I respect this creation. I recommend to try it for the certain unsettled mood, serious occasion, somber weather walk.

My only issue is that for some reason it dries down very quickly on me. I wish I had more of the gorgeous opening notes last just a bit longer. Nevertheless, this will easily be one of the top fragrances for me once I buy the full size of it.",03/10/24 13:44,Charlieinthesun

I saw a tester on sale, I went through some reviews, it was pretty mixed received. Decided to to Blind it solely for the fact Adp has always been quality and also I was able to get it at a very cheap price for a tester without box from a trusted reseller.

This definitely has pretty much legit Ambergris in it because if you know how Ambergris smells like and too much of it, it's almost there. However the typical dna/vibe of an Adp that exist in their range like Sandalo, Oud and Leather, it's there. However if you were to blind fold me and ask me to guess it's brand, I'll also think it could be a Guerlain PL or Dior PL.

The sandalwood is there at the beginning as well with the mixed cirtrus which isn't the typical fresh cirtus. Somehow it also reminds me abit like Amber Nuit Dior with heavy Ambergris. After 15 minutes or so this does smell similar to something I have, but I cannot exactly remember which but it seems like a Hybrid between Guerlain Encens Mythiques and Santal Royal, possible but I'll need to get back to do more sniffing.

The Amber is there, the rose patchouli is there, some muskiness and incense like smell from the labdanum, pretty strong sandalwood, somewhat smoky as well. For new noses and inexperienced noses, this scent may not be easy for your nose. It took me a good 10 minutes or many constant sniffs to get my nose settled to the sourish saltiness blend But Ambra is pretty well blended with the rest of the notes rather equal and I don't get an over prominent smell of certain notes.

I'm wearing this for myself now so I do not know how well received this is or will I get any compliments. I think I'll like it enough with a few more full wears. Decent projection and silage and very good on the skin. Easily 6-10 hours skin chemistry dependent.

Definitely a sophisticated and elegant scent for users.",08/26/23 20:44,JasKiew
Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I smelt this at the airport both on the way to my destination and on the way back home. Testing it on two separate occasions gave me the impression that I love it. I ended up buying a 100ml bottle once I returned home only to absolutely hate the way it smelt after 30 seconds or so.

The initial opening is a soft citrus but then you’re immediately hit with this burnt and bitter rubber note which completely ruins the fragrance. I assume this is the Cypriol Oil as I love the remaining notes in the composition. Unless the way in which the perfume has been blended is the reason why the burnt rubber note appears. Either way, I can understand why people dislike the fragrance.

It’s a real shame as without this bitter note, the fragrance is absolutely beautiful and would honestly be a masterpiece from Acqua Di Parma.",03/12/23 11:37,Knightsbridge9

Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I got a free sample of this and i can understand why the sample was free. Don't get me wrong it smells really pleasant, clean and fresh. Kinda like a health clinic or a spa. But there's nothing special about it.

Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Absolutely enchanting. Ambra shares the AdP Oud DNA but is more salty marine. It's the ambergris. By all accounts this has real ambergris in it, and it certainly doesn't smell like ambroxan. It's dirty-sexy, aquatic-animalic, intoxicating, get-outta-here-if-you-don't-like-it boss man smell. Ambra EdP is powerful enough to survive swimming and a shower, so a little will go a long way.

Beautiful creation and a dividing line: either hang out with the ambroxan bombs in the mall, or walk this way to smell life at it's richest.",05/16/22 14:07,Made by Kouros
Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Reading reviews you would think this juice is going to be horrible but I find it very good! I don't get any gross out vibes but there is Ambergris in this and I don't think many people have smelled real Ambergris.

Ambergris on its own its disgusting, but mixed in here its a fixative and gives some real depth. It's also got some really nice woods & musk. But IMO the real star is the labdanum. Smells very classy and would pair perfectly with a suit.
There's some resemblance to Sandalo, Oud EDP and Colonia leather DNA.

Is it my favorite signature of the sun ADP?
No, I think I might still lean towards Oud EDP but this is a close second.
It's actually pretty similar to Oud EDP but just add Ambergris, cypriol and petigrain.
7.5/10 for me.",08/07/21 18:45,The Wolf
Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I love most of Acqua di Parma fragrances.
I am not getting the reason for low reviews. Probably chemistry may be off-putting for someone.
This is definitely not the classic oriental amber that someone may have in mind. For me is a masterpiece. I cannot smell fish or paint or animalic, but a cloud of classy fragrance.
It is very difficult to describe notes, probably because I have never smelled real ambergris(?). It is mainly dry and pungent.
I would love on my husband, although the performance is close to skin scent, something more intimate.
To me this is heavenly. Test before buying. 4/5",03/12/21 05:20,clemmy
Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"At first I thought that it might just be my skin that won't let go of this wet dog vibe, but it appears that a few reviewers below have also experienced an unpleasant animalic aroma. Somewhere near the 6th hour, when most other notes have faded, you are left with what I can only describe as 'Wet dog after a swim in the ocean'. You should try it for yourself and see how it works - on skin, not paper! The first six hours were actually quite pleasant, if a little harsh.

The Oud and Leather remain the undisputed kings of the Signatures of the Sun line.",12/30/20 01:54,Bergamet

Ambra Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I disagree. I did a side-by-side comparison. First I spritzed this new one on, and thought I could tell the difference from memory. I remembered the old one seemed to evolve quickly to a considerably creamy drydown, this one seemed sharper. Since I only seemed to remember the drydown of the old, I then decided to do it properly and ran to another shop that still carried that brown bottle. The quickest way to explain the difference is, that this new black Ambra bottle to me feels like it has more oud-like (dark woods) and black leather feel, where the old one is more like brown leather, w less if any wood. It's like the leather accord these siblings have follow the leather accords changed in the namesake black vs. brown, respectively. I don't own none of these (I did test all on skin) so this is first impression basis. Which is best? I personally feel the brown is more sympathetic. The scents are similar, I suppose what matters is where that smell association takes you. That is the best thing with AdP, they always take you somewhere!",09/12/19 07:42,tikander

Just for the record, in Spain the price appears to have been hiked by 15 euros for a large bottle. Also, Leather and Ebano were missing from the very extensive concession I visited - I was informed that Leather is being discontinued, at least in Spain.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Today I'm staying with the house of Acqua Di Parma, but moving on to their Blue Mediterraneo collection. Up first: Arancia Di Capri. Now I don't know much Italian, but I know enough to know that arancia means orange. With that being the case, I'm expecting this to be a bright and vibrant citrus-forward fragrance. Will the Blue Mediterraneo collection strike a better chord with me than the Signatures of the Sun collection did? Let's get into it and find out.


Opening:
The opening is citrusy, fresh, and green. The primary notes that envelop me are orange, mandarin, petitgrain, and bergamot. The orange and mandarin are the undisputed stars of this initial accord. As kindred spirits from the citrus family, they naturally share a radiant quality. However, their individuality shines through: the orange presents a distinctly rindy and tangy facet, while the mandarin offers a juicy, inviting sweetness. Together, they paint a photo-realistic and natural portrait of a freshly cut, sweet, tart, and undeniably succulent orange, beautifully reminiscent of the vibrant orange notes found in fragrances like Louis Vuitton's Afternoon Swim or Météore. Next, the petitgrain and bergamot arrive. The petitgrain imparts a clean and crisp green accord, adding a much-needed balance to the predominantly citrus-heavy opening. Lastly, the bergamot layers in a touch more citrus, but with its characteristic spicy, aromatic, and subtly bitter edge, providing depth and nuance.


Dry Down:
The dry down is citrusy, fresh, and musky. The primary notes I continue to experience are orange, mandarin, petitgrain, and musk. The orange and mandarin remain the focal point in the dry down, still offering that wonderfully realistic orange accord, though now it is much more subtle and reserved, like a memory of the initial vibrancy. Following closely are the petitgrain and musk. The petitgrain retains its familiar fresh and green accord from the opening, but in a significantly softer and quieter manner. Lastly, the musk gracefully rounds out the dry down, imparting a gentle and clean ""fresh laundry"" accord that feels comforting and understated.


Performance:
The initial projection is commendable, reaching a notable six feet. Sillage mirrors this strength, leaving an easily discernible scent trail. However, by the three-hour mark, the performance had considerably softened. The projection became quite intimate, settling to about arm's length, and the scent trail was only faintly noticeable. The fragrance ultimately receded to a skin scent by the fourth hour.


When to Wear:
Arancia Di Capri is undeniably a quintessential spring and summer fragrance, tailor-made for daytime wear. This is the type of scent that truly shines for casual sun-drenched outings, perhaps a leisurely day at the beach or an invigorating session at the gym. However, its casual character suggests it wouldn't be the most suitable choice for office wear or more formal occasions where a more commanding presence might be desired.


Blind Buy:
If you find yourself drawn to vibrant, orange-forward fragrances akin to the aforementioned Afternoon Swim or Météore, this could very well be a safe blind buy for your collection. Just bear in mind that its delicate nature means frequent reapplication will likely be necessary to enjoy its full charm throughout the day.


Final Verdict:
I'll begin by stating this: the opening of this fragrance was downright beautiful. The photorealistic juiciness of the orange, interwoven with the crisp, green essence of petitgrain, perfectly captured the very soul of a quintessential summer fragrance. It's not often I encounter a fragrance I can genuinely compare to such heavy hitters as Afternoon Swim, but Arancia Di Capri was, for a fleeting moment, punching far above its weight class. Unfortunately, that magnificent burst of life was extremely short-lived, and the fragrance became a mere skin scent almost before I could fully savor its dry down. Had Arancia Di Capri maintained that captivating opening and offered even average performance, this would have been an absolute knockout; a fragrance I would have immediately sought to acquire a full bottle of. Sadly, that wasn't the case, and this experience ultimately proved to be a pretty significant letdown. I'm sincerely hoping this isn't indicative of the entire Blue Mediterraneo line, as I have another one scheduled for review tomorrow.

I do actually want to smell like an orange. Too bad the eponymous orange lasts for the blink of an eye; I guess they wanted something to stick around for longer so they added musk and a bit of caramel. Overpriced for what it is. 5.5/10.",06/13/25 08:15,ChloeG118

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"The opening is wonderful, smells very natural. It´s just orange, mandarin and lemon. The orange is strong at first, dies quickly, then the mandarin takes over, dies quickly, the. It´s lemon time, but it also dies quickly. After that it´s just faint leaves, leftover citrus mush (cleaner vibe) and hint of musk, maybe caramel? Some tiny sweetness.

It projects really well …. For 10 minutes 😒 the next 20 minutes it´s decent, the smell changes a lot during that time, after 30 minutes it´s a skin scent - and not very pleasant one, it kinda gives I accidentaly sprayed airfreshner on my hand.

I expected it to have bad performance, so I bought just the 30ml thinking if I like it I will buy the big bottle, overspray and take the small one with me to refresh it after an hour. But due to the much worse performance than expected and very uninteresting drydown I dont think it´s worth it. Will probably just use it once or twice in the highest heat when going for a swim.

It´s a shame, the opening is an absolute banger. 10/10 scent opening, performance 2/10(only because it actually projects the first 10 minutes really well), it wasnt expensive, you can find this brand very discounted - and I understand why. Overall 7/10",01/02/25 08:56,Martin1993

The thing is that you go nose blind to it quickly because it is so much citrus, but I get over 5 hours from it. Every time I wear this I feel like I am in Italy, it is simply perfect, rejuvenating, so fresh and yummy. I will be reaching for this very often in the summer, you can overspray and it just smells even better too. It is a mostly citrus fragrance, not sure why people are upset that this isn't a 10 hour beast mode fragrance. It isn't supposed to be. I don't care what anyone else says, this is a masterpiece.

Unfortunately (for me), the petitgrain note disappeared within minutes, and I was back to sweet orange candy. I personally wouldn’t wear this, but actually do love the way this smells.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"My first impression after smelling Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri: 'Wait a second, I've smelled this before... It's the same as Lush Sun!' Since Arancia di Capri was actually launched a good 15 years before Sun, it is easy to conclude that Lush's perfumer Mark Constantine was greatly 'inspired' by Arancia di Capri. I've always loved Sun, a perfect combination of lemon and orange in a fragrance, but hated its poor longevity and sillage. Is Arancia di Capri any better? Alas, nope. It shares Sun's transparent citric fruitiness, but also its abysmal performance. At least Sun used to be very cheap (not so much anymore), whereas Arancia di Capri has been greatly overpriced since the get-go.",08/17/24 15:13,LadyIva
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri. What can I say about this fragrance? It is simply gorgeous. This is the olfactory equivalent of a perfect summer holiday romance. Undeniably addictive, ripe and fresh and forever young, but alas, heartrendingly short-lived. Just as soon as you have fallen completely in love, it is already time to say 'arriverderci'. If there were no problems with the longevity of this fragrance, I wouldn't even glance at another summer scent. Indeed, even with the performance issues I will always have a bottle in my collection - a testament to this masterpiece of a formulation by ADP. Although the fragile lifespan means this fragrance regrettably falls short of signature scent status, one is left with no other choice but to return to the Caprese peninsula to experience this bittersweet affair over and over again.",08/13/24 04:13,crhyrains

In any case, performance is not good enough, even for this brand. Decades ago, when competition was less, brands like this one could get away with the notion of an overpriced cologne.

I have a major issue with overly sweet fragrances and I find this slightly sweet but not syrupy or cloying. My major disappointment is that it does not last on my skin at all. Within 30 minutes it is a skin scent for me. While lovely, its mighty expensive for the limited sillage and longevity.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,Continuing to work through my Blu Mediterraneo discovery set. This is my favorite so far in that I least get 3-4 hours from it. Lovely opening. Fantastic actually. Like peeling a fresh orange with zest and pith and a spray of juice. So real you can taste it. Definitely fades quickly but I get whiffs of a woody musky dry down for 3-4 hours. Not FB worthy but very pleasant.,06/22/24 18:14,austinmdpedi
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"The first time I used this perfume, it smelled like urinal disinfectant. Like most of the Blue Mediterraneo line, but the problem was undoubtedly my nose. On a second occasion, that urinal smell was no longer present in my brain (I don't know why) and this perfume, along with Fico di Amalfi, are my favorites from this line. Fresh and classy. Summer in a bottle. But there's the issue of performance combined with my body chemistry, which is a drain for citrus perfumes. I rarely get 3 hours where I can smell anything from this line (whereas with other perfumes from the brand like Zafferano or Oud, the experience is quite different, with both lasting over 8 hours).

Therefore, I can't recommend this perfume given the usual price found in online stores. While Zara perfumes are half the price in stores compared to the USA - €20 for 100 ml - Acqua di Parma perfumes (or Mancera, for example) are much cheaper in the USA (at discounters) despite being, like Zara, two European brands. I don't understand this disparity, but paying around €80 for a 75 ml EDT that lasts only 2 or 3 hours (on my skin) is not justifiable (for me, as I'm far from swimming in money).

But, I emphasize, this is a magnificent perfume (except for the performance) with a super realistic orange scent (done in a soft and non-harsh way) and it's the scent profile I associate with a typical summer day in Portugal with temperatures of 35ºC / 95ºF or more.",06/16/24 10:45,NunoRealinho

Petitgrain offers the green leafiness of course, and the caramel note stands in audaciously whimsical contrast, giving a smooth, thickened sweetness in the base. Contrasts well with the citrus sweetness in the top. Spray the heck out of this though, as it's not the greatest performer given the citrus orientation.",05/25/24 19:15,JmThms

Perfect for the day time, and it has great longevity so couple of sprays during the morning will last you till the night. All the top notes are very prominent in this fragrance. It’s a very orange and mandarin heavy fragrance with a good dry down of musk. I wouldn’t say it’s the most unique fragrance, but its longevity makes it quite decent for its value. Honestly, it’s just a great summer fragrance to own and just really easy to wear.

This is a light, refreshing and sparkly citrus fragrance perfect for any age or gender. AdP do the best and most realistic citrus notes out of any house I've come across and this one focuses on a really raw, juicy orange that smells gorgeous. The only downside with this fragrance though is the performance, it barely lasts and doesn't project at all which is a real shame because the opening is so good. This can only realistically be worn during summer if you want it to last 10 minutes but there are other frags from the Blu Mediterraneo line that have amazing citrus notes with better performance.

Middle notes: Petitgrain, orange

This fragrance is a delightful choice for any summer occasion, boasting a refreshing opening that retains its appeal even after an hour of wear. I recommend layering it with a vanilla-based fragrance to enhance its complexity.

However, it is important to note that its projection is somewhat lacking, and its longevity leaves something to be desired. Consequently, some may consider it overpriced given these performance factors. Nevertheless, its exquisite scent has garnered numerous compliments, particularly from individuals aged 25 and above, though its appeal to younger demographics is uncertain.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri is another simple, refreshing cologne from this range. Fleeting and ephemeral as they all seem to be, it is more like an aromatherapy than a scent proper. It is fairly predictable in structure - citrus-led with an underlying greenness, very refreshing and natural-smelling. However, given its limited performance, I consider it overpriced.

AdC opens with a radiant, orange-led citrus accord, like olfactory sunshine. It becomes a little more tart as it develops, thanks to the bergamot and perhaps some lemon. The green undertone follows closely, enhancing the citrus with verdant freshness. The slightly woody petitgrain is a beautiful addition here thanks to its fresh woody greenness.

It fades fast, becoming a sweetly musky skin scent with a hint of citrus remaining. Sillage is intimate and longevity is weak - it lasts slightly longer than Bergamotto di Calabria.

A pleasant, unchallenging unisex cologne, AdC is made for hot weather and repeated application. It is very refreshing, but there are many classic colognes out there with better performance and lower price points. 2.5/5.",09/08/23 09:14,Enrium

Mostly citrus orange, similar to how it is in Guerlain Mandarine Basilic, very juicy and realistic. Slight hint of greenness from petitgrain, slightly soapy (think posh hotel hand wash), with soft caramel and musk accompanying.

Audience:
Feminine-leaning unisex. Summertime scent. Office friendly, non-offensive (not very sharp). More mature than Xerjoff Lira, as doesn’t smell overly cakey

Performance:
Too weak to do it justice. A massive shame as I love the scent but can’t decide whether it’s FBW just to overspray",08/13/23 04:58,Sixx

Another One Bites the Zest

The point of the top notes of any fragrance is to get the suckers at the fragrance counter to make an impulse buy, with the uninitiated believing that what they smell for a few seconds at the counter is how they will smell all day if they buy the fragrance. But the truth is citrus as a top note never endures much past the dry down. You buy for the base notes that will remain and sustain through the hours, and if you don't like those base notes, too bad, because in an hour or less after you spray, that's what you've bought. Purchasing a scent with citrus as its sole component is just nuts and this is a hard fact that this scent demonstrates perfectly.

After an opening blast of orange soda this gets bitter like orange rind, the dry down doesn't change or improve but vaguely reminds of an old barbershop hair tonic with added lemon zest, and in a half hour not even that. It's not repellant, it's just not attractive or comforting or much of anything, and again, as with all but one Blu Med I've tried, the performance is just abysmal. And this may in fact be the worst scent in the line.

This is a seriously pointless fragrance. If you just want to smell this kind of scent get some Orange Fanta or Sun Maid Lemonade. Get a lemon meringue pie. Anyone who isn't in the room with you when you apply this won't get anything from this by the time you drive to work. I don't know why anyone would waste money on this fragrance when there are so many better scents on the market. Is it the company rep? The pretty bottle? You can do way better than this, even in the under $20 category. This is just a waste of your money. Don't bother.",08/06/23 15:08,JusttheFactsMan

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"VERY light opening. I can smell the orange and it's really quite nice, but it's incredibly low 'volume'. Instant skin scent. A little soapy. Has a clean watery vibe but not salty. Very lightly green/leafy. Reminds me of the opening of Kenneth Cole Black (which I love) but weaker.

In the middle I start picking up a hint of tobacco leaves? Not sure what that's about. Otherwise it still smells like citrus ""in general"" instead of any particular note. A slight undercurrent of powdery musk. It gets even lighter by the minute. On my body, it's nearly gone in like 30 minutes. It disappears faster than a misty body spray. Usually the fragrances that others complain about their short longevity work for me. This one just dissolves into my skin I guess.

The scent stays consistent throughout the (very short) life of the fragrance. It smells very nice. I really like what I can notice. It's like a lighter, more unisex version of Black.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance smells AMAZING. I am incredibly happy to finally have it in my collection. Hands down my favourite fragrance from the Blu Mediterraneo line. This is the most beautiful natural smelling summer citrus fragrance I have ever smelt. It smells to me like a photorealistic californian mandarin being peeled, broken apart and juiced. Super sweet mandarin. I absolutely love it. The only issue with this is and most of the Blu Medditeraneo line is that the longevity is horrendous. About an hour to an hour and a half of longevity and 20 to 30 minutes of projection before becoming a skin scent. Fortunately the smell and affordable price makes up for it. Xerjoff Renaissance smells very similar to this and the Xerjoff performs much better however this AdP smells much nicer than the Xerjoff.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Citrusy fresh, a little musky and a green tinge to it thats how I would describe this scent. It has also a clean soapyness.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Pick a citrus and you'll probably find a note of it in here somewhere. There is a sweet earthiness to the base that really elevates the scent beyond the fruit and into something more complex and romantic.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"So so so delightful and simple. Sweet citrus with a warmer undertone that doesn’t take away from the brightness.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,This is so mouthwatering delicious if you enjoy the smell of cutting into a juicy orange that was picked fresh off the tree this one is for you! 🍊,11/10/22 11:18,Heavenly Heather
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Delightful natural citrus scent that acts as an instant pick-me-up before leaving the house. The dry-down is a soft clean musk. It smells high quality and is beautifully blended.

However, hardly any sillage to speak of, longevity around 4 hrs on me in moderately cool European climate.

I did enjoy it, but would not necessarily repurchase at the given price point. For that either it would have to perform better or have a more interesting note profile.

Nice freshie for spring/summer, in case you received it as a gift.",11/09/22 05:01,latafan

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Smells just like the juicy rush of vitamin C you get when peeling Cuties for the kids. Clean and realistic blast of fresh mandarins. I absolutely adore the fragrance itself, but the performance is wretchedly disappointing even for a citrus freshie. Completely gone in less than 1 hour. If you can get a big bottle at a discounter and don't mind spraying yourself 100x during the day, its worth considering, but who has time for that?",10/01/22 19:39,PeachPerfume
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful Beautiful and just beautiful. I cannot believe I never even knew about this beauty until now 🙄
Where has it been all my life???

Petit grain and citruses are my favorites so I had to blind buy the big 5 oz. bottle (it was on sale) and oh. my. goodness!!!!!! Y U M M Y !!!!!!

This is definitely a Summertime scent and yes, the longevity isn’t the greatest but it doesn’t bother me, I absolutely looooove it!

I do not necessarily detect the caramel note though perhaps it balances the citruses and brings depth to the whole composition? All I know is that this smells like heaven on earth and I am thrilled to have added this beauty to my collection!!!

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"I bought this fragrance for the beautiful realistic juicy orange and the romantic association with the nature of Capri. Unfortunately, the mental vacation it takes me on is always too short. Like many others have pointed out, this fragrance has no lasting power nor projection.

This morning I sprayed 26 times, and my sister sitting next to me in the car could not smell it. When I asked her what I'm wearing, she said, ""Funny? All I can smell is something sour.” That's how I feel about this scent. The poor performance deterrs me from buying more ADP fragrances.",09/18/22 16:18,Ginawang23

For me at least, after one or two hours, it is undetectable unless I put my arm right up to my nose. I love citruses in the summer but the price point of around $80-100 per bottle just isn't worth it for me with such poor longevity. Its too bad because the opening is amazing.",08/22/22 10:07,SterlingArcher76
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,Beautiful naturalist scent. The lemon note can sometimes shine through for ten minutes and be sharp but it calms down. Very good drydown. It then gets light gourmand. Some think this scent reminds them of sunscreen. Not for me unless you are using the Biotherm citrus sunscreen. Maybe this has the same scent vibe. On me it stays on 3-7 hours. Longer on clothes. I have used this in hot weather and in sunney but - must have a jacket - weather. Always good clean scent. It is citrus fresh.

I've been looking for an orange or a mandarin dominant fragrance for quite some time and this, this is just the thing I was looking for. It's bright and fresh, perfect for a summer day when the weather outside is extremely hot.

This summer I wanted to find my signature cologne and after exhausting research and testing I decided to go with Fico Di Almafi, I was delighted with the brand, so I went and tried the rest of the line.

Let there be said that I'm not into citric scents, I don't like them and they don't like me either, but Arancia Di Capri is the first citric scent I feel comfortable with. It Is bright, fresh, natural, calming, and most of all it fits me well. It performs better for the weather it was designed...hot days of summer.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Arancia di Capri is lovely, I mean Acqua di Parma really gets their citruses spot on - this is a sweet orange that's fresh with zingy petitgrain. The other notes help this not to become straight orange juice, and it's this musky bright clean aura all around you after it dries down. I can't help but feel that this ought to be in a splash bottle, though. I splashed on a 4 mL decant earlier and by hour 4 it had considerably faded - I could still get a sense of it lingering around me, but definitely would need to reapply if you wanted it to still be refreshing. It is beautiful, though - it doesn't turn sour on me like some citruses do in the heat. If it were more affordable, I would bathe myself in it this summer.",06/22/22 10:32,ntabassum92

10/10 from Acqua Di Parma!",06/03/22 15:12,Matt1987
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Very mixed citrus forward, especially orange and bergamot. I get a slight tea accord that's not listed as well. I also get a peachy type accord in the opening but could just be a combination of the notes together. The opening is beautiful. A little greenness comes out as the citruses calm down. Petitgrain is more prominent than the cardamom. Not really detecting any musk or caramel to be honest other than an ever so slight, way in the background scent which you won't notice unless you're specifically looking for it. This does smell pretty natural, i will say. I do get a slight fig-like accord here, similar to Fico De Amalfi but it's not as prominent.

Longevity and projection is not good. The top prominent notes dissipate pretty quickly and it become a skin scent very quickly after application. You have to sniff right on skin to smell anything very soon after spraying. If you can get this for a massive discount, this would be a good warm weather scent. I would never ever pay full price for this. I was able to get a tester 5oz for $60 with cap and for that price, i don't mind. Had i paid full retail, i would have been extremely disappointed. Beautiful scent, just does not last. Be prepared to carry a decant if you want to wear this for an entire day.

Very office safe, good for warm summer days also. Presentation is classy and nice and the same as the others in the line.",05/24/22 15:54,btd069
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,Such a beautiful scent. The opening is similar to drinking a sweet orange juice. Then the dry down is a calming caramel indeed.

Today I was bored and I gave it another try - still hate it. It smells so weak yet managed to annoy me completely. I thought I'll just cover it with something strong.

It totally effects me like Liz Claiborne for women. Liz on women made me go bananas and I wanted to smell it all the time. This ADP Arancia really borders feminine imo, but It just may work for a guy. The caramel drydown is light, but nice. I just wish it was muskier like Cedro de Taormina. Longevity on ADP Arancia is not good, but it is NOT an e.d.p. either. I am going to try this one for the warmer months. Spring / Summer comes a bit earlier in central Texas.

Update:
Initially the scent is nice, but drydown is like cloying, powdery baby wipes...especially in the heat. Cool Water has the same effect, the drydown is offensive.",02/28/22 13:07,Dawnyallah

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma's Arancia di Capri is a moderately pleasant perfume. It's a sweet orange perfume overall rather like Monotheme's Verde d'Arancia. It is not a fresh orange perfume like Hermes's Eau d'Orange Verte or Atelier Cologne's Orange Sanguine. It isn't a photorealistic orange by any stretch of the imagination.

What you get with Arancia di Capri is a scent that quickly settles to an intimate projection but has a lot of durability as long as you're not wearing it on your arms in the sunshine, in which case, of course it won't last long. You get an opening of orange, lemon, bergamot and a touch of mandarin and cardamom to give you a sweet orange accord. Around 30 - 40 minutes in the petitgrain slips its way into the olfactory experience. Alas, petitgrain is a note that tends to disagree with me and it gives me a slight headache here for a while until it fades away. This general sweet orange accord stays for the next seven hours or so. And then, just as the perfume appears to fade away there's a little surprise - you finally get the slightest whiff of caramel with the musk. This rather surprised me as there seemed to be an hour or so of a faint orange and greenness and then nothingness for a while before the caramel and musk made a brief fleeting appearance. They are there but you'll need to be away from sunshine, be properly hydrated, eating well, paying attention and have a good nose!

There's no prize for originality in saying this but it is a spring, summer and early autumn perfume, more for day wear than the evening. It's subtle and a gentle projector so it's also one purely for your own enjoyment. Hardly anyone will smell this on you after the first hour unless they're standing right next to you in very close quarters.

It's pleasant enough but at £82 for 75ml and £124 for 150ml it's just too pricey to justify a repurchase when there are cheaper perfumes that do the same feminine, sweet, orange accord for far less money.",08/15/21 09:42,mutatismutandis
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"My review will mirror so many others - fantastic orange and petitgrain to open up. As it dries down it transitions from a realistic fresh orange note to more of a gourmand-style orange as the caramel steps forward much more. In the end as a skin scent it's very soft and low-key and more classically Italian musky-aromatic citrus.

It's performance is not that good, but as I've said for others I have times when I do want a scent that has a shorter lifespan - I call them Sprinters, and I like to have a handful available for each season, but for those who avoid low-longevity frags, this is definitely one to steer clear of.",08/13/21 16:31,cvaile

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"I’d recommend you pass on this fragrance. I purchased a 150ml bottle at the beginning of summer and have been using it for a over a month.

The opening is amazing. The orange & citrus are very natural and refreshing. This, not unexpectedly of citrus, is pretty much gone in under 30 minutes, even on clothes. The mid notes are very weak, and on my skin or clothes I never get to the base notes. Never. None of that promised caramel. So basically, the whole experience is over in about an hour.

The real annoying part: After I spray some on, a few hours later I can go to the atomizer and there it is…caramel! It smells so good and realistic. But on my skin or clothes, it never shows up. Not in 20+ wearings.

Of course, YMMV. My advice to anyone looking at any of these AdP Blu Mediterraneo fragrances is try it on, and walk away. Leave. Don’t be taken in by the amazing opening. Go away and see where it takes you. It’s definitely not a blind buy, strictly based on performance.

I’m going to burn through this 5oz bucket by the end of summer and never look back. Which is such a shame.",07/23/21 11:34,TaxMania
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"I wanted something that felt like MFK's petit matin but lighter. This is PM-lite. I received a 2ml sample when I bought another perfume from my local perfumery store, and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise. The petit grain in this one drew the scent profile of PM into my mind, but still remaining unique with its citrus-dominant profile.

Honestly, the caramello note does not rear its head in a typical cloying fashion but more of a soft sweet embrace around the other notes. While I appreciate PM's floral-citrus-musk composition, I find this a lot lighter and puts me in the mood for some sun.

Longevity is understandably shorter for a citrus-dominant EDT (about 3+ hours for me), get this in its big 150ml flacon format and you'll be living on a citrus-powered cloud for as long as your bottle lasts.",07/23/21 01:02,Inconucopia
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,Smells like I’ve just had a shower in San Pelligrino Aranciata…but I’m not complaining because it smells light and refreshing.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"Such a realistic orange juice type of smell this one has, oh lord. It makes me wanna drink it. I think this is a very natural scent, the notes are well blended together and the musk and caramel come around just to give it a little hint of depth to the citrusy forward scent.

Overall: loved it, this is a summer killer. I just wished this lasted a little longer, so i would recommend you guys get the 150ml and overspray as you wish in order to make it last.",06/27/21 00:32,Matías Ross

Orange Sanguine smells like a real damn Orange. This is not as photo realistic but is still good in its own way. It doesn't smell too synthetic to my nose.
My only complaints are

1. I wish it had vetiver in the base instead of caramel. If I'm wearing this in the heat I don't want caramel. Not that the caramel is cloying or super strong, I just would have picked something else for the base, or just omitted that note altogether.

2. My skin likes to drink this and it seems to perform worse than others on me.

The AdP is perhaps a little less harsh and chemical but I honestly don't think I could tell the difference if I didn't already know.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"A lovely scent good for hot weather. Its an EDT so you know it can't last too long but this doesn't last on me more than a few hours. The opening is lovely but soon loses its projection, but for me, I layer it with Guerlain Nerolia Bianca to bring out more of the sweetness of it since i love the citrus in this.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,I live in the northern hemisphere and it is winter now. But I cant wait to the summer to use this again I use it sometimes now aswell. But it isn't the same as giving yourself a shower of fresh orange juice. However much I love that feeling that this fragrance gives I cant rate it high.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"The opening is delightful, a sweet, fresh and realistic orange with a hint of spice in the background to keep it from becoming too much like the smell of orange pulp. The problem for me came once you I got to the dry down. It’s got this cheap manly musk that turns into the smell of sweat and cologne when it mixed with the cardamom and what I assume is the caramel note. It reminds me of what my brother could come home smelling like after basketball practice.

He’d spray COPIOUS amounts of Ck One over his sweaty clothes to hold him off until he got home and showered. I’ll leave it up to your imagination to imagine what that smells like. Hard pass for me.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"This scent is a beautiful, sophisticated citrus scent that I think would appeal to almost everyone. There's nothing offensive about it--it's just clean, bright, and fresh. It's not overly sweet or ""fruity"" either, which I love. It reminds me of sitting in the sunshine on a balcony in Santorini drinking mimosas and laughing with friends. You know when you start to peel an orange and you get that first splash of citrus with the almost bittersweet rind undertone? That's what this smells like to me. Summery and alluring. And the best part is I can spray it--literally douse myself in it--and it settles nicely into the background. I get headaches from perfumes very easily but this one never does that.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"With so much praise being bestowed on this fragrance, I decided to write this review as a counterbalance and point out some of the faults that, in my opinion, have been given mere
lip service in some reviews, but in most cases outright ignored.

For those whose Italian is a little rusty, arancia is the Italian word for orange, so right away you know what's in store for you. This is OJ all the way, baby! The good kind though, not the bad kind. The opening is a blast of freshly squeezed orange juice, and it's quite good.
Unfortunately, it only lasts for about a minute and then fades away to a mild orange/lemon scent that stays for the rest of the journey. Occasional wafts of caramel hit your nose as Arancia dries down, but this is a linear scent through and through.

This is Acqua di Parma, so the quality and ingredients are all top notch; my main problem with this scent though is that the longevity and sillage are practically non-existent. Yes, it's a citrus-based fragrance so nobody is expecting beast mode performance, but at this price point Acqua di Parma needs to deliver more than this. Within an hour, people sitting next to you will have trouble picking up the scent, and unless you're outdoors in the high heat this stuff is barely noticeable past the two-hour mark. Interestingly enough, because of this problem, Arancia would actually make a great gym scent, although I doubt most people would use it in that setting.

So, if you're looking for a fancy gym scent, or you're a die-hard fan of orange and you have the money to purchase multiple bottles (because you'll be reapplying like crazy), then I would recommend Arancia; if not, don't bother. This may sound harsh, but Arancia is a niche version
of a Demeter orange fragrance. If you're a fan of this then more power to you, but the weak longevity and sillage, especially for the price, frustrate me way too much. Thumbs down.",07/06/20 17:55,LukeS

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"I received this from a friend, not knowing anything about it except that it was described as clean citrus and good for summer.

This surprised me more and more as I wore it. Upon initial spray, i got an intense orange which is underlined by some green and slightly herbal notes, possibly petitgrain, with opening reminding me of MFK Aqua Celestia. As the initial blast dies, the mandarin note comes to fore with an faint candied sweetness that is beautifully clean and classy. This is a very subtle scent that you can go a bit heavier on ...especially when the sprayer is amazing too!

This lasts a surprisingly long time on my skin - about 7 hours later, my wife could smell it on me as she looked over my shoulder while i was seated at the couch, and complimented me on how attractive I smelt. Even walking around the house, I noticed the faintly sweet sillage lingering in the air.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"My notes a couple years ago reads the following: ""Opens like a gin and tonic, chills out, then the herbal comes out, orange.""

Tastes change. Sometimes, longevity and projection aren't important indicators anymore. When you look over a collection, the assumption for some may be, each fragrance has a character, or a role. Arancia di Capri's role, as I see it, is fulfilled exceptionally, but it isn't nearly as celebrated. And that's fine by me.

This fragrance has survived multiple collection culls because of what it provides. Is the theme unique? Quite the contrary: citrus scents -- inspired by Italian towns, at that, are a dime a dozen. And, for the most part, they smell pretty similar to one another. Not exactly, of course, but all of them are generally in the same ballpark. So what's special about Arancia di Capri?

Well, truth be told, not much. But that doesn't mean it isn't somehow an exceptional fragrance. And that's because it embodies a fragrance that is valuable because of its scent, and role, and less projection, or longevity.

On one hand, you have the run-of-the-mill Dior Homme Cologne, or Terre d'Hermès Eau Très Fraîche, which represent designer fragrances that definitely have mass appeal. Sure, you might have to spray a dozen times with DHC for anyone to smell it, but that sweet lemonade is for you to enjoy.

Enter Arancia di Capri, who, like DHC, cannot really be fully detected at a distance. But, it's the most enjoyable orange scent to me, and guess what: that's what matters.

No one is going to smell your Arancia di Capri. It's performance is abysmal. It's in the same league as Acqua di Bergamotto by E. Zegna. But that element of being undetectable to others makes it the perfect vehicle for learning an important lesson about enjoying fragrances. It is for you.

It is perfectly inoffensive. It is understated. It is a played out theme, but if you enjoy it, it's a wonderful and unknown melody that you can hum to yourself.",03/09/20 12:09,sucatlord
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"I'm a huge fan of AdP's Blu Mediterraneo line, and Arancia di Capri is another masterpiece. I'm a sucker for quality citrus fragrances, and this is such a well balanced orange scent it left me speechless the first time I tried it. It was love at first smell. It's not synthetic at all, I don't know where the reviewer below got that from. It's totally natural, if you've been to South Italy, this is what it smells like, it takes you back to that lovely holiday. The first time you put Arancia di Capri on, it's like peeling a fresh juicy orange and taking a long deep whiff up close. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Try it, I think you will absolutely adore this scent.",02/15/20 13:37,December Rain
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"My first review here, but I'm so in love with Arancia di Capri that I can't keep it in.
On my skin, it opens with a citrus smell, sweet orange, not the peels, but the juicy flesh. On the top there is a hint of fresh, bright lemon, which fades in about an hour. When it dries, freshness transforms into delicate sweetness of orange and caramel, may-be with some peach. An hour later I start to smell a bit of cardamom.
This perfume is warm and comforting, it stays close to skin, but remains there for more than 6 hours.
I wear this perfume whenever I’m tired or feeling lonely, it is comforting and warm, and makes me feel softly feminine. In fact, I mostly use it at home.
Will be getting a big bottle, if I spray more the smell is more noticeable and lasts longer. Silage is soft, so I won't disturb anyone with it.",01/22/20 14:11,Magictpa

On me it is straight up citrus, all top note. It never develops into anything else and the longevity is poor (not unusual with me though). It literally smells like freshly squeezed citrus juice and then just fades away. I actually wear it to bed now as it relaxes me and I want to get some use out of it!

Don't get me wrong, it is very pleasant but for general wear I can't get any mileage out of it without layering it significantly with something else (I recently layered it with a sample of Sole di Positano and that worked quite well).

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo Arancia di Capri Acqua di Parma,"I am so happy with the review posted by slpfrsly! That review is what got me to blind buy a bottle.

When I first sprayed it I initially wasn't totally sure about it but after it dried I knew it was for me. Initially, at first spray, reminded me of one of the Moschino cheapies, but only for a couple seconds.

I love freshie colognes and layered this with Mugler Cologne and the combination of the two is great and seems to make it last longer on my skin.

A lot of people are talking about how fleeting the scent with this one but in my particular case, ALL perfumes are fleeting on my skin. I haven't met one so far that lasts more than 2 hours, so this is comparable to most in my opinion as far as longevity.",08/27/19 11:43,waskotransportation

Iris Nobile 10th Anniversary Special Edition Acqua di Parma,"an exquisite fragrance. best worn on cool fresh days.

after an initial burst of citrusy delight with star anis, she begins to dry down into a something ladylike, yet slightly sweet and earthy. the earthiness i smell is definitely oakmoss and patchouli. the main flower in front is orange blossom, with a soft ylang sitting behind her. the iris is very gentle in this. there is a touch of vanilla and amber, but the oakmoss and patchouli stay alongside right through the dry down on me.

sillage is medium and lasting at least 12 hours.

the note inside the box tells you that this is exactly the same formula as the original and also lists the notes, which are different from above.
i will list them when i get chance. there is definitely lovely oakmoss in this composition.

oh what do i know?...but is this really a ""floral woody musk""?
Iris Nobile smells like a chypre to me. not a classic chypre like Mitsouko, but not like the floral woody musks i have experienced. a modern chypre. and it definitely has the Francis Kurkdjian vibe.",07/13/16 03:25,Angeldaisy
Mirto di Panarea La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"I am not sure what combination in this frag at the beginning to half an hour reminds me of Bleu Marine Pour Lui by Pierre Cardin (1986). https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Pierre-Cardin/Bleu-Marine-Pour-Lui-2594.html

It might be the Citron + Myrtle + Sage + Lavender and maybe the Lentisque. Some of what I mentioned may not be included in the notes of that Bleu Marine Pour Lui, but I am sure that some of each constituent in each mentioned ingredients above may work its way to recall me with that nostalgic scent I really enjoyed when I was very very young.

I like this Mirto di Panarea la Riserva 2025 anyway. Its greenness, refreshing and dry juniper berries, that cineol among others in Myrtle and the aromatic tea like in lentisque really make my day every time I spritz it on.",10/26/25 02:16,phongchart
Mirto di Panarea La Riserva Acqua di Parma,"My recent encounter with Acqua di Parma was a happy accident. I saw a sample of what I thought was the classic Mirto di Panarea (2008), a fragrance I hadn't smelled in years. But upon receiving it, I realized it was a new EDP, named Mirto di Panarea La Riserva.

Though it appears to be a flanker, the scent has almost no connection to the original. The iconic myrtle note of the classic MdP is barely noticeable here.

The opening is a definite ""wow."" It's a powerful, citrusy, metallic, and woody citron-rosemary accord with a touch of juniper. This initial blast instantly reminded me of two other fragrances: the openings of FZOTIC/Bruno Fazzolari's Five (2013) and, in some extent, Ferragamo's Acqua Essenziale (2013). All three share that clean, sharp, and almost futuristic opening that feels both modern and invigorating.

However, the impressive start doesn't last long. As the citrus notes fade, the metallic accord gets stronger, and a subtle yet high-pitched peppery note of Iso E Super becomes increasingly and rapidly noticeable. This shift leads the drydown to become strikingly similar to that of Atelier Cologne's Bohemian Orange Blossom (2022)—or dozens of summer fragrances from main-strain designer brands in the last decade—with a key distinction: while the Atelier uses a notable dose of neroli and overall feels lighter in a way of EDT; La Riserva makes the same space with rosemary and feels stronger like an EDP after all. While both are in the fresh citrus category, this synthetic, dusty, peppery, and woody drydown is not what I typically seek in this genre.

I wish its drydown could have been better. Even a reinterpretation of Five's drydown would have been preferable to this adaptation of Bohemian Orange Blossom's.

Just looking at the notes, I actually love every piece of this creation lol … juniper, citron, lavender, sage, Myrtle, myrrh, patchouli, labdanum and mastic.

Maybe it's just me, but I find that the chypre label is becoming like the oriental label - perfumes are calling themselves that but not really being true to the genre. This one is a true chypre and I appreciate that.

This opens as a powdery, citrussey, jasmine and rose. The citrus doesn't last all that long and then it becomes all floral. The rose is restrained and dry, but still lush. The jasmine is such high quality. There isn't the slightest whiff of anything synthetic here.

The dry down becomes a little woody, a bit sharper than the powdery and ultra feminine florals that precede it. The moss is gorgeous, so rich and earthy. It finally becomes musky, but in a very feminine way.

This is old school movie stars holidaying on the Riviera, dripping in jewels and arranging secret trysts away from the prying eyes of the paparazzi.

If this perfume was a movie, it would be To Catch A Thief. Grace Kelly would have loved it.

It's got moderate sillage and the longevity is stellar. I put this on in the morning, showered later at night and could still smell it on me when I got into bed.",02/20/15 09:31,becuille
Acqua di Parma Profumo 2008 Acqua di Parma,"I got curious about this fragrance simply because of the cost. I was lucky enough to find a gorgeous mini online and... I really didn't think I was going to like it. The first time I tried it my initial impression was, ""Gah! That's strong!"" and I was afraid it would give me a headache. However, I was really busy that day and must have washed my hands up to my elbows 10 times or more and guess what? The scent was still there. Since this is almost a miracle when it happens to me, I decided that I had to give Profumo a second chance.

I'm so glad I did! Once it settles into my skin it's such a soft, classy, warm and feminine scent. It reminds me of 50's glamour and an age when women wore dresses and heels daily. I can definitely see myself investing in a large bottle of this in the near future.",07/18/12 09:31,SouthernLady
Acqua di Parma Profumo 2008 Acqua di Parma,"A truly wonderful scent, the price is justified and money is well spent when you get so much in return. Better just one bottle of magnificence than a thousand bottles of mediocrity. This is what I said to myself to stop my credit card guilty feelings.
The scent is wonderful as I said, it comes from an age when scents were made with passion, dedication and art. Wearing it today is a hommage to good taste and the hope it has not completely gone lost.
In certain moments it reminds of Mitsouko, maybe only for being a chypre but I would also add also for being a masterpiece that stands the passing of time without wrinkles on skin. Buy it if you like lovely scents that lasts a lot, if you like wearing something special, if you despise those modern scents which smell all the same.",07/17/12 05:00,Henriette
Acqua di Parma Profumo 2008 Acqua di Parma,"To me the amber is the dominant note here.

Acqua di Parma Profumo 2008 Acqua di Parma,"I tested this yesterday, but I'm not sure if it was the new Profumo or the old one. Probably the new one.
I really like it! It's a complex, sophisticated, extremely rich refined scent! It may suit old fashioned tastes or a need for a deluxe night out!
It's warm, multi-layered fragrance with many nuances and a strong woody full body drydown. Very classy and suitable for a grand dame or a grand dame at heart!
Well, nothing forbid to wear it everyday, but the price is just crazy for my budget!
For sure you get lot of kickback for your money. It is long lasting, with good sillage and always changing on skin as old perfumes used to be.
The florals are mingled together and the drydown is rich in oakmoss. Absolutely a beautiful complex chypre that many would tell suitable for mature elegant ladies not under 35. Anyway the choice is left to personal tastes.",12/09/10 09:06,Mellyhelly
Acqua di Parma Profumo 2008 Acqua di Parma,"What a lovely fragrance. Kinda old fashioned with its floral, slightly powdery notes but absolutely very feminine and classy. I don't smell too much bergamot or anything sharp and didn't find the drydown too woody. But that could just be how the scent works with my body chemistry. Really worth trying. Too bad it's so outrageously expensive.",02/02/10 09:45,libertybelle

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I like this fragrance. It reminds me of Acqua di Gio EDT. Unfortunately, the performance on this is god awful. It projected for a good 3 minutes, and then became a skin scent. On my skin, it lasted about 2-3 hours total.

This is fresh, bright, and green, just like Nautica Voyage. I prefer Nautica Voyage to this, as it is way cheaper and way more worth it. This is extremely overpriced.

Overall rating: 4.5/10. While I may like the scent, it's just not worth what you're paying for at all. I have the same opinion on ADG EDT and many of its flankers. Get Nautica Voyage if you want a fragrance that has a similar vibe to this, is cheaper, and preforms better. Nautica Voyage is more fresh though.",08/18/25 12:10,Daemints

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,Very good smelling fresh green scent. The scent makes me feel ....a I'm happy and outdoors with my family kind of feeling. It works excellent for the spring or summer time. Projects for the 1st hour then nice scent bubble for a few hours. Its a scent people will notice and like. Lasts maybe 4 - 5 hours on my skin and till next day on clothing. I'm wondering where the bottles that last a few minutes were bought.

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"A very boring cologne, it opens very energizing, but the rosemary note that makes it interesting goes away after 3-5 minutes. Then it dries down to something that reminds me heavily of Armani Mania by Francis Kurkdijan, a fragrance that I had but I never really liked it at all because of it’s boringness. Some resemblance gets me to Kologne, Shield of Protection by Kilian at the opening, that is really a very nice cologne, and it lasts double the time of this, quality is also on a whole other level. This is usable, fresh, but I would pay $60 at much for this kind of scent and quality, feels a lot synthetic and it goes away after 3-4 hours.

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"In this time where most male scents are overly feminine due to the influence of sweet bases (damn you 540, this is your fault), comes this. It’s a generic male scent, in the vein of Armani Code, but achieved using quality ingredients. This makes the experience so much more high end. I have over 100 scents (95% niche), but did not have a generic male scent due to them being overly synthetic. This is a beautiful addition to my collection.

Don’t pay retail tho, it’s longevity isn’t tremendous, due to it being a cologne. But if you pay a small price, just reapply several times (honestly I do this with every single scent anyway).",12/05/24 11:30,Cloudwalker
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Absolutely Love this. Absolute classic fresh musky masculine cologne. Quality and longevity far exceed the price. If you’re a a guy in your 30’s pr older you will be hit with nostalgia! Younger people you can call it vintage and love it aswell.

First botes you get are citrus and aromatic. Then it dries down into a lovely fresh subtle musk. The pink pepper, citrus and musk base note are the most prominent notes.

I wanted something subtle, classic with that Italian sartorial feel and it’s exactly that. The added bonus is my girlfriend cannot leave me alone when i wear it! It is definitely subtle until you get close to the skin where it sits for a good 12 hours.

One thing that might put spme people off is that the opening notes only last around 2-4 hours so if you want a strong far projecting fragrance this won’t be for you. Perfect for if you work in close proximity to other people like me and need something a little more subtle though!

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I love wearing this at home!

Every five days I do my grooming routine and use it afterward to feel clean, classy, and masculine. It is a timeless ""old school"" scent, pretty basic but it has that Italian vibe that I like. Fragrances along this one that make me feel the same are Dior Homme Sport or Cologne, Versace Pour Homme, Xerjoff Nio, Roja Parfums Elysium, and MFK Masculine Pluriel or 724.

Nex try will be Bergamotto di Calabria!

Longevity is quite iffy, but if you overspray on cotton clothes it will stay a long time with a low projection. I usually get 3-4 hours on my skin and like 24 hours on my shirt with 8 sprays haha",08/13/24 13:41,AlessandroCB

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Got it off a discounter (Jomashop) for a price way below retail, which is think is way better than buying it for its retail price. This isn’t sponsored btw I just want to tell you guys that you NEVER buy frags retail price unless they don’t allow discounters (Chanel, LV, City Rhythm, etc.) anyways, this is a great everyday safe green and spicy scent. It IS an EDC which is TERRIBLE but its longevity isn’t too bad, about 4-5 hours without letting it macerate (FRAGS ARE ALWAYS BETTER WHEN LEFT TO MACERATE FOR A COUPLE WEEKS). It’s a smell you can’t really hate and it’s VERY VERY basic but also somewhat fancy. I’d say get it if you want a good summer citrusy “fresh spicy” scent (what I wanted).",06/18/24 23:32,Ego10gogo
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I thought I'd bought a sample of the original CLUB, but I realized I'd bought another fragrance I was used to.

It has the same herbaceous vibe that is a more citrusy, woody scent, still with the famous menthol note. The same occasions and versatility as the original. Last 5 hours (shame) and a fair projection.

According to my rating system, it's a 7/10 but I give -2 penalties for acting like a ""snake in the grass"" (no pun intended) to fool people: 5/10.

Try before you buy",05/27/24 11:59,lou6
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I've smelled this before but wasn't impressed so I never bothered testing it until today. I'm afraid ADP seems to be losing their direction since around 2020 and this is a good example of that. This smells like your average musky cedar designer and the comparisons to Armani Code are justified. ADP has always been more about classics and some modern stuff outside of the signatures of the sun line, but this just seems like a lazy.

Is it pleasant? Sure. Does it have any personality? Not much. It's very plain, innofensive, generic and boring. It smells like something you'd pick up at the mall or Walgreens from a low level to mid tier designer house. Armani Code is better than this, and the latest Armani Code Parfum is way better than this, in my opinion.

also i agree with the comment below- when i first found out about this fragrance (about a year and a half ago) the reviews were brutal, i suppose because it was a new version of an already existing fragrance (similar to the hate dior homme 2020 got).",02/22/24 10:13,ShaneL02

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Reading the reviews and also seeing this reduced in Harrods, I can’t believe this fragrance gets the hate it does. Although to some it may be “generic” and “disappointing”, to be put simply, you can’t go wrong with it. It’s simple, nice smelling and gentlemen like.

At first it’s a spicy citrus pepper which then dies down into a more barbershop type fragrance with the rosemary and cedar. Not to mention its longevity is very good, having sprayed it in the morning and being able to smell it on my clothes the next day, one should be able to smell it the whole day. However, its projection may let it down a little, depending on the persons skin (at least with mine), I find that it can turn into a skin fragrance after hours of wearing. Which is why I’d recommend a travel atomizer just to boost projection later in the day. Yet, for the price you can find it for, either at online discounters, duty free or discounted in store. This is a no brainer if you enjoy ADP and barbershop type fragrances.",12/31/23 07:04,Youngzz

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Colonia C.L.U.B. is a disappointing scent, a rare miss for Acqua di Parma. Having also tested Colonia Futura today, an excellent fougère, there is no comparison. C.L.U.B. is ultimately a flat, one-dimensional ambroxan bomb. The opening is briefly in keeping with AcP's aromatic colognes, but then the ambroxan hits.

On initial spray, C.L.U.B is a clean, fresh citrus scent with a slightly sour green undertone. This doesn't last long before the ambroxan creeps in and takes over. Ambroxan can work well in perfumery as a fixative, or can add interest when restrained. However, one of my pet hates is a heavy, grey cloud of ambroxan overpowering a scent. I find it headache-inducing, and that is the case here.

The ambroxan phase of C.L.U.B. is an unpleasantly metallic, grey cloud. Slightly woody and increasingly musky, none of the listed notes are evident after a time, except a hint of synthetic cedar. The ambroxan lingers. Sillage and longevity are moderate.

A masculine-leaning single-note ambroxan scent after the opening, I dislike this. Why anyone would choose this scent from AdP is hard to fathom. 1/5.",09/16/23 07:07,Enrium

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"This smells amazing! This is the best cologne-smelling fragrance I've smelled since I have been in the game (only a year, but I've smelled a lot of scents). I love how fresh, slightly minty, and spicy this smells. It comes together nicely and smells intense. It's ever so slightly sharp but doesn't bother my nose. What's really good about this is that is performs constantly at least in the first one or two hours. I cannot speak for it's longevity for now but in the future I will make an edit for this review that will speak more about how long this lasts and performs. This is such an awesome smelling scent.

Update: I doused myself with this for a day and it smells good, but also basic. I'm switching from love to it's ok. This scent does travel far if the air allows, but I don't believe that it will travel too far in still air. It lasts long enough. About 6 hours.",02/16/23 09:09,aaronmy
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I bought it thinking it was a new version of the Club which I love. But it has nothing to do with that one. I't a freshy, clean, out of the shower, unisex, cologne. It absolutely lacks of the Italian-gentleman touch the Club (without points) used to have.",02/07/23 03:24,PabloZ
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Absolute masterpiece of a fragrance in my opinion. It’s on the blue/green side with a super clean smell to it and will not choke anyone out but still lasts all day. Could easily be a signature scent as it is very versatile and easy to wear. Appropriate for high schoolers if they want to mask the smell of their bo after gym class, business men in the office, or mature gentleman if they want to smell to part.",01/09/23 21:43,FrankieMets25
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,A flat generic masculine cologne to me. I've smelt this DNA countless times in the designer realm and this doesn't add to the Colonia line from AdP. A big disappointment in my books. Stick to the original Colonia or the Essenza.,11/25/22 20:59,Jeff Shin

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"What really got me excited with this one is the shiso in the ingredients. ADP’s Colonia C.L.U.B. reminds you of simpler fun times - day in the sun. Bright citrus and fresh with hints of spice and a bold woody base. Its drydown for me is the winner.

Perfect for a full day’s wear and very office friendly.",09/14/22 13:11,BranVargas
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Fresh citrus aromatic. Sharp citruses, peppers, and green herbal rosemary burst from my skin but in a very smoothed out and airy fashion, all over a light woody base.

No bias on my part, I know nothing of the original Club (or many other AdP fragrances for that matter), but I find this quite pleasant and extremely well-balanced. The citrus and spices and greens and woods all play an equal role, everything is seamlessly blended together, and it sits smack dab in the middle of sweet and bitter. Performance is surprisingly decent for me with moderate projection for ~2hr, longevity 12hr+.",09/06/22 07:57,RisingChaos
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I get nearly the same fragrance as Colonia Pura but with the aldehydes removed making it just boring. It's like the bare minimum of a fragrance which is why I think it reminds reviewers of a wide range of different scents. Total head scratcher of a release. The only good thing I can say here is that it doesn't smell ""bad."" It doesn’t smell like much of anything in fact. Then there’s the name and we've reached a level of mind boggling seldom seen.

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,I found this quite disappointing. Not full bottle worthy in my opinion. There are much better offerings from Acqua Di Parma.

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I tried this fragrance in Bluemercury today, completely unbiased as I didn't even know it was a new release until after I smelled it. My initial thought is that it was designed to be a more mass-appealing scent than some of the others I tested while I was there. I agree that this is ADP's entry into the ""blue"" fragrance world. And if someone smelling this is not crazily into fragrances, I can imagine this would be a nice, casual, summer scent that is versatile and will draw compliments without creating a harsh scent cloud.
I think this particular fragrance gets a lot of hate for differentiating from the original Colonia Club 2015. However, by itself, I still think it is a pleasant fragrance that I will be adding to my collection when it hits discounters (which, having seen its response from the public, it will).
Also, keep in mind this is an EDC, so the projection and longevity aren't going to be as prominent as another blue, such as Eros (which is quite strong). But I find the freshness of this fragrance to be nice, and still noticeable without being overbearing. This would be a great fragrance for teenagers who want to smell good from March through early September. Not exactly the most unique, but it's not inoffensive whatsoever. This is something that you can blind buy if you want to smell similar to other popular blues. Just wait until it comes to FragranceX or FragranceNet!!",07/16/22 15:05,skoenig4
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"This is nice. I'm not familiar with the original Colonia Club so I'm not sure how it compares. The first thing that I thought when I smelled this is that it is more of a classic scent that smells green with a hint of freshness. It smells older, mature, and masculine. I also get some kind of a powdery note.",07/16/22 14:20,Asca Naca
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"You know when people call a fragrance “shower gel”-y? I don’t know if I truly understood that until smelling this. I’ve never smelled a fragrance that smells more like a generic men’s shower gel in my life. It has zero character whatsoever. Honestly, this does not smell like it’s made by Acqua Di Parma (one of my favourite houses), this smells like it’s made by Axe/Lynx.

Acqua Di Parma I still love you because of many of your amazing scents (some of which rank among my favourites of all time)... but please don’t let this be the new direction you’re going in. There are ways of making a scent mass pleasing without making it this lifeless...

P.s. The original Colonia Club was a gorgeous fragrance, definitely one of the best from the house. Such a shame to see it go.",05/30/22 18:10,TheSniffer
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I like this. I wasn’t even aware of this release until I went to buy some stuff from the barbiere range. I wasn’t going to try given the previous club (which I owned) was too minty and while cooling had an almost burning sensation. But I did.

This one morphs from a real freshy to start with the bergamot and reminds me of a toned down of the limited edition la spugnatura and then settles into a lovely light woody skin scent after about 3 hours. The longevity on this is great. It’s very pleasant and I’m very much looking forward to wearing this on a hot day or warm evening for dinner on a terrace.

ADP is a great house, and there are classics like Essenza that I keep coming back to. On this one, and unlike the pura that was nice but not so interesting, or the futura that was just too herbacious, they got the balance here really spot on. The shiso makes this really Interesting. The pepper just right, and the dry down of woods and light musk being comforting but also leaves me feeling confident.

I just ran out of essenza and was going to refill, but this one made me go for a detour. I’ll let you know how I get on, but a few days in I’m enjoying it very much.",05/29/22 10:01,los benjos
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"A lovely addition to the Acqua di Parma Colonia lineup. I didn’t care for the original Club much, but this new version is wonderfully light and interesting enough with the minty Shiso note. The drydown has a clean, aromatic and soft light green vibe that has better longevity than I expected, perhaps thanks to some aromachemicals which luckily don’t dominate. It has a more youthful feel to it, a departure from most of the other Colonia’s in the range and this is a good thing, targeting a younger demographic keeps a brand current (apparent in the marketing and promo material for this one) but there’s still plenty of choice for those “old schoolers”. Beautifully blended as with all AdP’s. Very much looking forward to wearing this in warm weather and passing favour with the cool kids!",05/28/22 06:41,TomW
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Just a first impression, but might be worth writing as there are so few full reviews of this:

C.L.U.B. opens like Bergamotto or other nice AdP bergamot openings. At this stage I thought this might be a great new summer freshie.

After the opening it goes green and aromatic. At this stage I thought it does share something with the green original Club. But this is sweeter.

2h later. I think I smell the rosemary and the shiso. It's too sweet for my tastes now.

4 h later, oh, it's taken another turn. It's clearly woody now. Like a basic blue fragrance drydown, not bad, basic nice.

It's strong enough, actually survived a shower on my wrist (I didn't scrub) and the scent was still strong on a paper strip the next day. EDIT: Still strong day four.

Don't know what to think, I love AdP in general but hate the name of this. I personally prefer the original CLUB to this. That was a gentlemen's country club, this seems more youthful, like a night club for young adults?",05/24/22 10:56,Made by Kouros
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Bring back the original Acqua Di Parma Colonia club released in 2015! Why releasing this mainstream generic scent? This new release is just worthless! 👎

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I had to wash this one off. I wear the OG and was hoping for that DNA… and although it may be lurking in there somewhere I’m unwilling to wade through all the synthetic effects of the new strain to find it. Hopefully ADP will bring back the good green.
Out of respect for the house, I will give it another shot at some point… just without the expectations of its outstanding predecessor.
Edit: Weeks later tried it again…and was even more repulsed and offended the second time. Whatever woke dipstick put this disaster together needs to be sent packing. Simply the absolute worst release from ADP ever. By a long shot.",05/05/22 13:19,Grownassedman
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"The opening smelled very familiar but I couldn't place my finger on it until @wst mentioned it below. This smells like an acquatic, more delicate version of Versace Eros. The dry down smells very similar to Bleu de Chanel. It smells fine, but unremarkable, and seems to have poor performance. I stand by my earlier complaint regarding the name. ""Community Love Unique Bond""...? Really? What does that even mean?",05/03/22 13:04,agonzony
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"ADP what have you done?
I'll say this, if this was just another flanker, i wouldn't mind it. But replacing the original with this is a crime.
Seems to me that someone at ADP thought they needed to appeal to the younger audience so they reformulated it into a generic freshie that everyone could like. It's nothing special.
Always thought Club, Essenza and Intensa was the identity of modern era ADP. Those scents are what people associated with ADP and made them stand their own ground in the fragrance community.",05/01/22 03:27,Skywarp
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"Bought this one in the boutique in Roma, after wearing a tester all day. Worked perfectly in the warmer weather, and was always pleasantly surprised, with the aromatic notes bringing me away from the busy inner city of Roma, very relaxing.
This fragrance will come off a bit harsh for some moments after being applied, but once it's settled, it's very pleasant. When the base notes of musk and cedar kick in, you feel a depth to it, which is unique in its own way. Perfect for warmer weather, the aromatic notes are easy on the nose once settled, and it becomes very elegant and easy to pull off.",04/22/22 03:07,Jacob Cardinale
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"I really love the original in the dark green bottle, I was in Helsinki, Finland and passed this new Colonia C.LU.B version in store. I wanted to try this with an open unbiased mind, first I gave it to my female friend to try and her reactions was ''eh its ok'' with abit of a disapproving face. I then tried it and its completely ''run of the mill'' , so basic and nothing special about it at all. Im thinking that the person at Acqua di Parma who decided to replace the original with this must have been suffering from so kind of head injury because its a tragic decision. This new version will be found in TK Maxx at 70% discount soon and even then I wouldn't buy it .",04/13/22 12:03,Kadafi

As for the name, which seems to be exercising many of you, what would be better? Association? Union? Society? Company? League? Hahahaha I'm so hoping I'm going to find there is something called The League of Gentlemen now.
The dry down is a bit rough tbh, cheap ambery wood. Is not like any cedar I've ever smelled.",04/13/22 06:37,Siv7Stars
Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,"A bit underwhelming from the AdP house. I think they wanted to create a softer version of Colonia Club by using Shiso, but somehow its delicate mint accent is missing. The scent however is relatively linear after about 20-30 minutes. The base seems to contain ISO-E Super (cedar character) and subtle hints of grapefruit, although the latter is not in the scent profile listing. This is all softened by a musky quality most likely due to the ISO-E Super as well. What it can be equated to is a watered-down version of Bleu de Chanel, without the other subtleties of it soft mint and slight floral appeal.",03/29/22 11:39,nateanton

And even not a lot of citrus or bergamot. It rather has a nice elegant clean soapy vibe that turns into a skin scent quite soon. If you are looking for a heavy performing long lasting scent you better abstain. But if you don't mind spraying a bit more often, this is a nice freshy.",03/24/22 03:32,jda59

Colonia C.L.U.B. Acqua di Parma,Tested Colonia C.L.U.B. today and unfortunately it’s quite boring and takes a step back from the original Colonia Club. The previous version was a beautiful minty fougere which really stood out from the ADP range. I’ve spoken to their head-office and apparently the original Colonia Club is temporarily out of stock but I think this new formulation has replaced the old one.,03/10/22 14:55,Knightsbridge9

Peonia Nobile Edizione Speciale Acqua di Parma,nothing like peony nobile. the most heady amber floral with the sweetest honey sparks.,02/11/20 11:49,scensitive
Peonia Nobile Edizione Speciale Acqua di Parma,"Eh, if they had been given to me in a ""blind test"" I would never in my life have come up with the fact that I was smelling something that, probably on a wishful thinking basis, was called peony. Although (to do perfumers justice) it should be mentioned that capturing it in perfumes is not an easy matter, so not too often it succeeds....

In the uncommonly beautiful flacon of the special edition Peonia Nobile, I therefore discovered something that surprised me to no end. Unfortunately - and as expected. A sweet-plastic interpretation of a flower or some-flowers, on a base of amber resin, known from too many compositions and pouring hectoliters from everywhere. Not high-flying. Naturally - it couldn't do without a little fruity accent and a small dose of overly sedate patchouli, too. It's a pity - a special edition and ""nobile"" in the name should oblige something (besides the price), though.

Performance parameters: 3 fathomable ""puffs"" after 2h leave only the ""tip"" of ambergris close on the skin. The ambergris is a write-off of Christian Lacroix for Avon, the ladies' version. Nota bene: if one would like to get this Edizione Speciale by the ""layering"" method, I guess that some inexpensive, sweet and floral perfume mixed with the aforementioned Avon Lacroix should ""do the trick"".",07/04/17 12:53,Arttemiss
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"Clearly marketed as Acqua Di Parma's prestige line of perfumes, the Note Di Colonia range are beautiful bottles, beautifully packaged, and contain pleasant and well rounded fragrances. This is the perfect white shirt and suit perfume, to be worn when you wish to feel expensive and confident. However, as with all Acqua Di Parma, its fragrance is light, and does not stick out the day. For the price these regularly retail for, they are not worth it, but if you can get one on sale, then it is a lovely perfume to add to your collection. Note 3 I believe is based on ""The Triumphant Return"" from the opera Aida, and the fragrance does evoke a victorious and successful image when sprayed. A Soft floral and powdery base, with a strong citrus punch when first sprayed, this is a more refined, breezier and sophsticated cousin of its ADP brothers and sisters.",06/16/25 15:44,aftiley
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"This is interesting, particularly with the jasmine/ginger combination with the olibanum/myrhh balsamic accord. Jasmine is a powerful influence and it manifests prominently, especially in the opening. Some people describe it as ""abrasive"". Its distinctive. Its somewhat powdery, and should probably have a ""Powdery"" accord listed in the stack. Acqua di Parma Note di Colonia III is good, but not 4.45 rating good for me. I prefer Acqua di Parma's more classic Citrus Aromatic fragrances.",03/13/25 08:53,JmThms
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"Is this extra special or something that breaks ground? No. However, the blending and quality of this particular fragrances's make up is simply stunning. A gorgeous creation that gives you everything in the range from Acqua Di Parma in a 5oz. flacon like bottle. Take Ginepro from the Mediterranean line, Sandalo Concentree from the Colonia line (sadly discontinued) & Mirrah as well. Then have Colonia Intensa at the very top to give it that clean and soapy freshness and you have this masterpiece of a fragrance. Theres a, richness and depth as the top notes of citrus fade with this woody, vetiver, floral & spice that slowly builds leading into a sophisticated yet simple drydown of subtle sweetness from the Tonka Bean, myrrh and a very leather like clean scent. It's almost Barbershop like sophistication that meets church like stoicism and you have a majestic rendition of 2 separate genres collectively melding as one. This is not for the young'ins of today. This is class, maturity and subtle sophistication.

Just a brilliant creation that in terms of quality takes a back seat to no one.",03/06/25 08:08,Apocalypse6vs8
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"My favorite in the line. Dry down is clean, resinous, powdery and slightly soapy. Reminds me of a Prada, maybe Iris d'Cedre, but not as cloying or overly powdery. Definitely worth a sample.

The final drydown has the signature ADP soapy, powdery barbershop DNA that I love. This is one of my favorite Acqua di Parma Colonia's. Performance is fairly decent but could be a little better on skin. It smells Italian almost like a Prada l’Homme. I’d sum it up by describing it as a fresh, powdery, sweet coca-cola.

Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,Found a bottle for 148 dollars. For that price I think this is good. Basically a fresher take on amber and resins with a faint soapy dry down.

Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"The best out of the 5 'Notes', I agree with the reviewer below me. Well blended, transparent amber-tonka cologne. The notes that shines here is labdanum. I happen to love that note. I’d say this is a super upscale designer that is modern, chic and likeable. This is for people that don’t do ‘beast mode’. Honestly I am not crazy about beast mode performance on men anyway.

While it is really good, I do think this is overpriced. It is not worth over 150 euro for 150 ml. Quality should, and can be had at a lower price point.",10/04/21 13:25,Scentedalterego

Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"Note III opens with a mild orange, imbued with incense resins that make the aroma very bold and heady. Myrrh is certainly the key player. I don't like this application of myrrh, I've seen it in a number of other fragrances, and I find it to have the same the same effect for them all. It gives the fragrance a very crude feeling.

The oversoul of Note III is very much like Note II. They feel kindred to one another. Note III is a bit more tame and tapered by raw comparison, but still gives me a very similar impression as Note II.

It's like you walk into the bathroom after your girlfriend is done; and she forgets to flush the toilet; and you slip and fall, and your arm dunks inside the toilet (but she's such a sweetheart—it's not as bad as it could be).

I hate to say that this fragrance could be therapeutic, but I guess it could have that effect, if at least something. I don't find that it's very high energy. It's kind of gloomy—like Note II. That being said, it doesn't do much for being active.

I don't get much more out of the notes either. Pretty much just a dominant mild orange with lots of hazy resins underneath.

It kind of lacks the sweetness to be attractive, so I can't say I see any potential in formal wear. And I don't think you would turn many heads or impress anyone with this either. It's a bit too underwhelming and simple for that unfortunately.

Performance was incredibly average. A little stronger than Note II. But sadly—to no avail. The orange is much more dominant than anyone has testified. It remains strong throughout the duration of the fragrance. Yet once again—not really to much avail.

An atrocity to the Note di Colonia line to say the least.",09/16/20 21:47,Grasshoppaaa
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,I loved my grandmother dearly and still miss her nearly 40 years after she left this world. This is a scent she would have liked back as she was getting up in her years back in the 1970's. It would have probably been best used to cover up the smell of cigarettes. While I feel a great sentimentality for the smells of that time this association isn't at all positive. It's just not at all the kind of scent I like now.,08/28/20 10:29,patrick.herron
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"Sampled it on paper: the 4 frags of this ""Note di Colonia"" collection are great, and n.III is the most interesting imo. Beautiful airy AdP's citrusy opening, resinous floral heart, and heavenly resin/myrrh/tonka drydown.
Basically a similar opening to Colonia Intensa, and a drydown going towards Colonia Mirra.

I should retest it on skin... but at the current retail price I would recommend other fragrances. But when it'll arrive at discounters, I'll rethink it!

Edit: I now own it. Crystal-clear masculine leaning fresh opening (citrus/ginger and probably some watery/calone notes also) with a hint of florals, and the drydown is all about a sexy vanillic myrrh bringing it back in the unisex zone (similar to AdP Colonia Mirra and Armani Myrrhe Imperiale) supported by tonka. Heavy projection in the first hour that will become moderate after that, and settles down at the 4-hours mark. Great longevity.
Simple, crowdpleasing, but very well blended. At the high-end of the designer world, but still not at a niche level imo. Glad I own it, but also glad that I paid just a fraction of the full retail price.
Recommended? Yes, but don't spend more than $150 for a 5oz bottle!",04/15/19 12:54,Andy the Frenchy
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"Very interesting and unexpected smell. It has a fresh (even cologne like) vibe to it despite the seemingly heavy and opaque notes (probably because it's AdP after all lol). That freshness comes from the combination of mandarin, ginger and jasmine. And myrrh here is fizzling and coke like, reminds me of serge lutens myrrh.",09/13/18 19:42,willyng
Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"I don't understand the moderate sillage votes because this is a BEAST,and the sprayer is the lightest of the AdP fragrances!

A 10/10,it truly is,so beautiful. It gives off the same fruity-smokey-woody vibe as Creed Aventus, not a clone in anyway,and I don't mean to compare, I hate comparing scents but the vibe is similar.

This is among the most beastly fragrances in the beast mode section of my collection!

The compliment factor is very high as well.
I love it,it's a masterpiece and I love AdP.

Note di Colonia III Acqua di Parma,"FIRST SNIFF: I was introduced to this part of the line by the ADP SA who was tending the perfume bar downstairs at the Houston Neiman's store. She laid out the three scents in this grouping and had me smell each in order. I was informed prior to smelling them that each one is stronger and more full bodied than the last. So the first in the series would be the lightest and most understated. The last the most robust and full-bodied. (a true assessment)

Like the others in the group, it immediately obvious that this is a well crafted, well-made scent. This is the crown jewel of the trio! Certainly the most ""niche"" of the three, it has a strong EDP body that is not only long lasting, but also well projecting. Hard to believe that scent this robust comes from a transparent liquid IMO!

THE PICTURE IT PAINTS: Dark room. Hot date. You applied a spartan 2 sprays of this 90 minutes earlier and it is smelling just as good as when you put it on. If this scent were a fabric, it would be thick, heavy layers of silk and velvet. In Dark colors, Maroon, brown, black and gold stitching and embellishments throughout. A scent so warm, and rich, dense and enveloping you want to curl up in it and just sleep forever.

IN THE BRAND FAMILY: Because the bottle is Lalique and it is so limited it may be worthy of a collector's cabinet. Of the three in this collection this leans the most niche but it's not weird enough or strange enough to be a strong niche contender IMO. This gives the dark brown bottles of ADP a run for their money to be sure.

Full Bottle worthy? - maybe
Sample worthy? - YESSSSSSSSSSSSS

PARTING THOUGHTS: There is a definite cedar wood presence here that (unlike most cedar notes) is remarkable and well done. It seems like it is sitting 8 feet from me, an amazing effect to be sure. A mysterious and confusing effect seems to be caused by this scent - each time I sniff it i smell something different. Like a strange painting in a horror movie that changes to something different each time I turn away from it and I look back and see it has changed but I didn't see anyone or anything happen to cause it. I have that kind of feeling with this. Like each sniff is giving me a different take on the while scent profile.

This scent is a winner, the only one you need to know or pay attention to should your path ever cross the Note di Colonia collection.",03/31/17 06:39,TheNichePerfumery

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"The opening melange of citruses in Cedro di Taormina is beautiful. Its a creamy melange, probably a manifestation of the lavender and labdanum. The aromatics and woods give texture to the association with the flora of Taormina. And for a Woody Citrus Aromatic, this scent profile is a bit darker. This is up there with Mirto di Panarea.",02/26/25 23:27,JmThms

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Cedro di Taormina was the second favourite of all the Aqua di Parma scents I decided to give a try.

It’s a fresh, green, citrusy, aromatic, woody scent in line with all Aqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo’s line. This stood out the most as being the most powerful in this blue line but I decided to get Mirto di Panarea because it leaned more feminine…and because of that gorgeous limited edition packaging.

Cedro di Taormina was more masculine and stronger. It has lavender, black pepper, cedar and vetiver. I would still say it’s more a unisex fragrance, if judged on its own merit, I would definitely wear it!

Lasts for about 4 hours with moderate sillage on clothing. Maybe I would revisit this next summers when I run out of Mirto di Panarea!",10/18/23 08:02,Maya lilac

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"This fits the brand copy about lush greenery blended in with the volcanic rocks perfectly. It opens with juicy citrus fruits of orange, lemon and lime. The greens arrive with basil that gives it an herbal, shrubbery feeling and the pepper and lavender somehow serves to make me think of rocky terrain.

I've never been to Sicily, but I've seen the Godfather 2 enough times to have a feeling of the landscape in my head. That green shrubbery pepper feeling mixes in with the vetiver and labdanum to perfectly keep this scenery throughout the experience. Cedar here young, green tree branch variety. Very natural.

This is a transportive fragrance and it's a shame that Acqu Di Parma has discontinued this and Ginepro di Sardegna. Worth checking out if you like aromatic vetiver with some touches of wood and lavender. Pepper is fairly prominent so if you don't like pepper then get a sample because it has a small learning curve.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"I really enjoy this one and have half a bottle left - cannot find another anywhere due to it discontinuation. If anyone in the UK has a bottle to sell, I'm your guy!",11/19/21 04:09,MR COTTRELL
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Cedro di Taormina is okay. You get an opening of citrus, lavender, cedar and petitgrain. Around 20 minutes in you get basil, vetiver and black pepper also joining the party. When it's stabilised you get a balance of lavender, herby green and wood in the general profile but you can still smell all the notes. It's skilfully blended. Unfortunately for me, the combination of petitgrain and labdanum gives me a slight headache when I smell it on my arms. It's only when the petitgrain goes and the labdanum fades that I can enjoy Cedro di Taormina.

An hour and a quarter in it's fading rapidly and feeling more like an eau de cologne than an eau de toilette. At this stage, it feels to me like it was a perfume made by a committee, half of whom wanted to make Bvlgari's Pour Homme Soir, nearly half of whom wanted to make Guerlain's Homme L'Eau Boisee and one person wanted to make Tom Ford's Italian Cypress. And as you expect from decision making by committee, it hasn't quite hit the mark in any of these directions. To call it boring is being rather harsh. To call it cheap smelling is simply wrong. It's just somehow not quite hit the mark in a way that's very difficult to put your finger on.

Some three and a half hours later the perfume is powering away quite nicely after I'd gone for a walk. But 20 minutes after getting home it's fading again. So while I can understand people complaining that Cedro di Taormina fades quickly, it clearly does stick around as a skin scent. In total, I get about eight and a half hours from it. However, clearly this one is at its best in warmer conditions. I just think that this perfume is a case of defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.",10/15/21 17:33,mutatismutandis
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"This was a total dud for me. Not surprised it’s been discontinued because it’s just not very interesting at all. Even after a heavy spraying it’s barely detectable in 45 minutes. Dry down is flat, boring and cheap smelling. Good riddance.",09/02/21 19:31,PapaTLooch

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"I got a sample of this and it was always going to be a wild card but unfortunately this isn't the scent for me. I definitely smell the lavender and the cedar, the labdanum too. It pulls very masculine on me and becomes quite sharp and cloying as it dries down. I can't report on longevity as I didn't leave it on all day, unfortunately. I'm giving it to my father as it seems quite appropriate for an older man.",04/23/21 20:34,LaMiaRosa

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"It's citrus, and woody, and a bit herbaceous. It pulls toward the more ""masculine"" end of unisex, if you associate cedar/vetiver with masculine. The cedar is pretty strong in it, and the lavender exists in giving it a touch of camphor. I think the woods/camphor/citrus are what some of the reviews below are associating with cleaning products. If the lavender was less camphor- or just not present, I feel this would be a ""home run"" for most. I do like it. I just wish that one note was dialed back.",11/26/20 14:27,thecoffeeslayer
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"I was excited to try this as it is my first offering from AdP and most say it's the best from the line!

Not a fan of this one. Boring cedar dominant fragrance that I kept waiting for to grab my attention and change, but no, very linear. I can see this working better in the heat, it's autumn here now, but I am not a big fan of the scent. Citrus and cedar are in the top and stay that way the entire time, bleh.

This reminds me of my great-grandmother, not that it smells like an old lady (I hate that saying), but it reminds me of her.

Sad miss on this one, don't think I will be trying any others from the house as none grab my attention.",11/19/20 12:53,jellisunc
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Woke up to an early Fall day in the mid 70s, so decided to test a summer freshie. Citrus notes jump out first, then a masculine blend of additional notes: lavender, pettigrain, cedar and vetiver are the most dominant. I like Cedro di Taormina but feel it’s not for me—but not a downvote. Agree with a reviewer below, this will smell better on male skin.",09/29/20 07:38,Bubbles1964
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"I blind-bought this, because I often like natural-smelling, Italian-style scents, I'd been interested in trying something from Acqua di Parma for some time and the 30ml version of this was available in a probably Covid-inspired discount-on-discount-on-discount deal on Groupon. I liked the idea of having this as a travel-friendly summer option (in case I ever got around to going anywhere ever again). As yesterday was a hot summer day where I live, I decided to try the fragrance.

I've had a couple of scents that have instantaneously struck a chord with me and just seemed ""right"" (Bvlgari Soir, one of the Issey summer flankers, probably Davidoff Leather Blend) and maybe a few others that, whether or not they've immediately felt right to me, have really impressed me right away. Cedro di Taormina probably does just seem right to me and anyhow its quality was delightfully, almost overwhelmingly evident to me even at first spray. It does indeed smell natural to me and probably is evocative of Mediterranean landscape. It also has something of an old-school, semi-barbershop feel, without feeling at all dated. I find the combination very appealing. I can understand that the old-school aspect might cause many people to think it an unexceptional fragrance but, while I wish I could compare it to other AdP scents, I'm inclined to say that actually this is exceptional, in the sense that to my mind it is an exceptionally plausible, well-blended, restrained but sophisticated, classical kind of fragrance.

Most if not all of the notes listed are there on my skin at varying stages but the stars of the show are the citrus, silky lavender, some cedar of course and, in particular, the leathery, slightly animalic, semi-powdery labdanum. The labdanum alone definitely renders this masculine on my skin. For me it also tilts this slightly away from spring-summer to, say, later spring, summer and some of the autumn.

Sillage is moderate and certainly adequate for me (it's the kind of fragrance that reminds you every now and then that it's still right there). Longevity, surprisingly, is good, if not excellent. I directly sprayed this onto either forearm twice for test purposes and can still smell it without trying after 18 hours.

Love it. Love everything about it.",08/22/20 21:59,woomanmoomin
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"This is pretty nice but very different than I was expecting. I don't smell very much cedar, just mainly getting a cool herbal blast that smells very minty to me. I'm reminded of scents like Guerlain Homme and Cartier Roadster.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"I am usually jealous of how good men's colognes smell because I am so much more inclined toward fresh, sporty, clean smells than the (stereotypically) sweet, fruity, powdery ""feminine"" scents. Of course, not all feminine fragrances fall into those categories - but when I see a (usually) blue or green ""men's"" version of a fragrance next to a (often) pink or purple ""women's"" version, I almost always end up preferring the more masculine version. So much so that I have happily worn many masculine fragrances over the last 15 years or so, even when a feminine version exists (i.e. Liz Claiborne Curve for Men, Antonio Banderas Blue Seduction for Men, Davidoff Cool Water for Men, etc.). And so, thus, started my overly-simplistic view of men's vs. women's fragrance profiles.

As my fragrance journey and education has advanced, particularly recently after discovering Fragrantica(!), I have been enlightened by the discovery of just how vast the variety of fragrances are, including the wide assortment of unisex fragrances, particularly all of the high-end and high-quality stuff, as well as both masculine and feminine fragrances that fall under different fragrance classifications, or groups. Namely, that what I actually preferred were not strictly men's vs. women's scents (and in being politically correct, nothing is truly ""male"" or ""female"", so instead I'd like to clarify that I mean ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" as per generic societal constructs... but even those fall on a spectrum within which anyone can happily place themselves wherever they see fit, but I digress), but, more specifically, aquatics and fresh, aromatic, green, clean, woody.

So I recently ordered over 20 different fragrance samples across these categories, including unisex, masculine and feminine fragrances, to broaden my horizons and to educate myself. Enter one of the prototypical (read: hugely popular and revered) brands of unisex fragrances, Acqua di Parma, which I thought would be a safe place to start given its status and its wide assortment of unisex offerings.

AdP Cedro di Taormina was up first. The description makes it seem to be all of the things I love: aromatic, fresh, clean, green. I had to try it! My thoughts? Amazing... absolutely amazing..... for a guy. How is this unisex?? This coming from a person who has worn men's cologne! Like actual cologne presumably MEANT for men! I mean, this scent reminds me of the guy who is effortlessly confident, cool-headed, easy-going, friendly, charming, and always smiling or putting one on your face. He's sexy in a relaxed, guy-next-door kinda way. All good things. But, I want to date him, not BE him: I really do not see any kind of woman that would actually wear this. Nothing in anything I am smelling here reminds me of any woman, of any age or creed, that would wear this. Seriously not one to judge any confident girl who wants to rock masculine scents (*raises hand*), but I don't think it will be this one, for me. That said, the next guy I date will definitely be getting this as a gift for Valentine's Day. ;)

For me: 4/10 (delicious, but bit too masculine)
For a guy: 9/10 (yes, please!)",05/12/20 12:50,nisha2988
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"The fragrance opens very zestily and spicy, the opening notes combine well creating a good and strong initial impression. The opening lasts for only a few moments, almost immediately the mid notes will come up; the black pepper and lavender add to the spicy and floral notes; the initial citrus opening subsides a bit as the mid and base notes become more prominent. From the base, the cedar is the most prominent note, whereas the labdanum and vetiver add just whiff. The projection drops very quickly from the opening to dry-down; also, the zesty and sharp citrus notes of the opening fade out and leave their space to the woody and citrus notes of the cedar. Once fully dried-down, the fragrance can be summarized as a low projecting cedar fragrance with light spicy and floral notes. The fragrance feels relatively fresh, modern, pleasant but not special.

Category: Woody aromatic.
Batch reviewed: 2020
Wow Rating: 3/10. A soft, cedar fragrance, pleasant but unimpressive.
Dislike Rating: 0/10. This fragrance contains no offensive notes.
Uniqueness: 6/10. A mostly cedar-based fragrance, it is a relatively unique scent.
Mass Appeal: 7/10. This is a soft cedar fragrance, enhanced by floral and spicy notes that will please most people.
Projection: 1/10. Dry-down projection is very low.
Sillage: 0/10. Almost none.
Application: Six or more atomizations to compensate for poor performance.
Longevity: 3/10. No more than three hours.
Seasons: Spring.
Occasions: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office/business casual. This is an office-friendly fragrance.
Versatility: 6/10. Moderate would be higher if performance would be at least moderate.
Gender: Unisex.
Ages: Any
Recommendation: A pleasant fragrance with very poor performance. Do not buy it.
Blind-Buy: Yes, but only if you are familiar with cedar as a note in fragrances.
Summary: A soft projecting cedar fragrance with some light spicy and floral notes, good but not great in any way.",05/03/20 16:22,piyux
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"another one i desperately wanted to love but not even the presence of cedar or citruses brought me round. next to others in the Blu line this feels rather heavy which initially was a deviation from the Blu line's aesthetic i welcomed. as sad as i am to see this is being discontinued (because i am confident that this morphs beautifully on the right body chemistry) i can see why it has landed in the chop pile.

CdT would have fared better as a variant on the Colonia line; you expect a stronger level of intensity and denseness from offerings outside of the Blu range. here's where things got interesting: the Colonia Sandalo flanker, which at its base smells almost identical to Cedro Taormina, offers much the same wooded experience but in a cohesive way. that is where Cedro Taormina falls apart on my skin - loads of strong notes shouting and competing with each other. there's also something that runs throughout that reminds me of vegetable soup. i swear to god i can smell V8 tomato juice and long simmered celery through the entire wear time.

in fairness i think it is wonderful ADP wishes to incorporate more wood dominant fragrances to their catalogue and the longevity of Cedro Taormina is impressive. the one area i feel this worked for the Blu line is that it compliments in all weather - hot, cold, humid, dry.

this was ahead of its time and feels like a very polished rough draft, which i hope to mean is a sign of more woody offerings to come from ADP.",12/03/19 09:55,oobunillaoo

Edit: Finally got a full bottle of this. It's been quite a while since I plowed through my sample, but this still smells as good as I remember. A bright and quite herbal opening gives way to a smooth, sultry, creamy woodsy drydown. Just lovely. Performance has been quite good, with around 7-8 hours of longevity and 2 hours of projection.

It opens up very bright and green and citrusy for the first hour or so - and is quite pleasant - before cedar, vetiver and black pepper dominate the fragrance of what it at its heart a rather dull and generic perfume. Just like many of Acqua di Parma's Blu range this falls under 'a miss.'

Longevity is maybe 4 hours or so as a skin scent without much projection.",01/14/19 09:28,monkey500
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Cedar without the typical spiciness as found in other fragrances...and that paired with a nice lemon/citron scent.

This is nice because, as mentioned by others, it doesn't swim in Iso-E Super. Nor is it spicy.

It has more longevity than I would have expected given its lighter and non smothering scent.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Cedro di Taormina is a masculine aromatic. The fragrance opens with a stingy, bold woodsy essence. It's a touch sour, and has a distinct masculine notion to it in that sourness. The woodsy essence is enveloped by an aqueous body—consisting of citruses, basil, and vetiver. They give the woodsy essence a strong transparency effect. And in their crude, although tinctured forms, add to the sourness a bit. If you get close, you can sense a faint bit of sweetness from the lavender.

It definitely has a Married With Children vibe to it, something along the tune of ""Love and Marriage"". I don't really find that the two accords compliment each other too well. The aqueous body doesn't have the sweetness or stimulation it needs. The vividness of the notes are very mellow-dramatic and drowned. It doesn't freshen the woods, as much as it does seemingly does pollute it further. It could have used some magnolia and some cherry blossom, just like Taormina itself.

The fragrance is very unique though. It's so bold and masculine—it really comes off with a strong ""tough guy"" vibe. And I think you really have to be a tough guy to wear this. Although I've noticed that the fragrance seems to project much better in very high heat—and is almost very enjoyable even. Uplifting and inspiring. Go easy on the sprays though. It's certainly one of the strongest fragrances in the Mediterraneo series.

If it matches your persona, then you really might find something neat here Cedro di Taormina. I wouldn't call it a crowd pleaser though, so it's not likely to get any raves amongst the crowd. Although it might be able to provide its beholder with some sense of comfort and security among them.",12/10/18 00:30,ReapThaWhirlwind

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"A breath of cedar that is quickly overtaken by citrus. The citrus is really good and lifelike although before I could place exactly what fruit I was smelling it shifted again. It flirts with being an aquatic cologne and threatens to smell like blue toilet and has seconds of pure fresh sea-breeze before settling into basil.

So much basil. I don't mean pesto. It has some of the licorice notes of holy basil, but it also smells very green and leafy -- like if classic basil smelled how it looked rather than how it smells when you are cooking with it. Unpicked basil? It is lush and really quite interesting.

In the end I'm not sure how I feel about it. It is right on the line of being too cologne-like for me, but every time I think it's crossed it it's just too interesting. I'll have to revisit when I'm looking for green and beachy not woody.",07/31/18 16:59,cedar_lea

It has a transportive quality about it that takes you seaside on the Mediterranean with the ocean breezes, kind of like the bottle implies.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Sprayed this on while walking through airport and duty free section yesterday - instant mood lifter and you cannot help but travel with your mind when smelling this. I have a soft spot for mediterranean scents and this one (the whole range) is no exception. The initial smell is a bit fresher and more aromatic than the dry down. Top notes are really on point. It gradually gets woodier with the pepper and lavender checking in. Surprisingly good longevity with moderate sillage on me. My colleague, who sat two seats right from me on the plane got soft hints of this. It all ends with a soft powdery finish, maybe the vetiver.
Love it - perfectly unisex and well worth the money.",05/04/18 03:41,nitschevo
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Oh man.
This is the type of fragrance that puts a smile on my face, no matter what.
Received it yesterday and I am not going to review it yet. It's 8 degrees C.

No, I'm wearing the other fragrance I received yesterday:
Chergui by Serge Lutens. A type of fragrance that will have ""to grow on me"".

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"As a citrus/woody, it immediately reminded me of Guerlain L'Homme L'Eau Boisée so I thought I'd do a side by side review. The citrus in AdP is a general bitter citrus accord whereas the Guerlain has a single precise spike of lime in the gamut. Again with AdP has general woodsy accord whereas the Guerlain has a more discrete woody note/s. The overall vibe of the AdP is a high quality, natural, fragrance for fragrance sake that invoked images of sunshine and nature whereas the Guerlain is leaning towards a classic aftershave i.e. it could be 5% Aramis and it has something bordering on a soapy/powderiness. The AdP is fuller, denser and more complex whereas the Guerlain is more attention grabbing (most probably from the Iso E Super)

I personally much prefer the AdP and think it's just a higher quality scent although I could see how a layman (male) on the street might go for the Guerlain because it is more of a standard, traditionally masculine scent. It has scored higher on reviews here.",12/18/17 09:54,TonyTheTiger

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"I received a tester of Cedro di Taormina. This fragrance is really stunning. The evolution is truly great. It starts citrus, then floral and bit spicy evolving on woody and fresh base notes. It ends completely different comparing his debut and it's nice and comfortable. It smells masculine and clean. Cedar disappears quickly, from top notes you can still advert basils with vetiver and cedar wood. So, don't expect the classic citrus summer fragrance, it might be used also in other seasons.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"The initial blast of Lemon gives way to an absolutely beautiful Cedar note. Whilst the scent is very nice Cedro di Taormina suffers from performance issues. Whilst the longevity is decent (5-6hrs), it is at very best a skin scent, and a very weak one at that.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"The opening of Cedro di Taormina on my skin seems to depend on how much I apply: with only one spray, it's more like a sharp, laundry-like white musk lightly infused with citrus; with two sprays, the sparkling citrus finally comes to life.

My favourite part of Cedro di Taormina starts about 20 minutes later: while the citrus mellows, the cedar, basil and vetiver come through. The combination has a certain balmy, sweet spiciness like anise/licorice as previous reviewers noted, which brings an unusual depth to the otherwise conventional cedar note in fresh perfumes.

Unfortunately, this interesting phase doesn't hold more than 1 hour. Afterwards, Cedro di Taormina is reduced into a typical aromatic lavender-tonka men's cologne over a woody peppery and clean musky base.

The sillage is mostly close to skin, and the longevity is at least 6 hours. Cedro di Taormina is mostly consistent with the overall aesthetics of the Blu Mediterraneo line, being a fresh, cologne-style woody fragrance. I quite like the interplay of anise and cedar during the middle phase, but the ubiquitous lavender-tonka peppery woody dry down is unremarkable on my skin. If you would like a conventional citrus woody fragrance with a subtle anise twist, Cedro di Taormina might fit the bill. Otherwise, I would not particularly recommend it based on my personal experience with this fragrance.",03/27/17 14:26,StellaDiverFlynn
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Wow, they got this one right!
I never say hardly, a fragrance transports me, but this one does, something green, woodsy, maybe some hay, laying around in a citron grove in Italy in the Summertime.

Lemon is common and borring, but here it is so nice and natural, very lemony, but more aromatic, it is a fine citron note to open.

This reminds me of Creed Spice and Wood; Both have a fruit and pepper accord that blends with cedar.

I just like this a lot. I have 4 from the Mediteranian line, yes this is the best.
From the notes it may seem ordinary, but this is an extraordinary Summer fragrance. It is beautifully blended, unique green, fresh, with just the right amount of pepper.

I loved the citron, basil, lavender opening, but after 10 minutes that nice sweet lemony top note disipates, and a stronger pepper and basil accord, that smell a bit like anise or liqourice is left in the mid. I smelled that kind of spiciness befor, and I know some will like it, but I think it's going to be a pass for me.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"A new great perfume in this marvellous line.
This perfume reminds me in the long run a bit of Annick Goutal Mandragora.
The perfume opens with a very prominent citric-spicy note.
In about a hour it turns in the basil spicy note and the cedar. These two with the Lavender give the note that reminds me of Mandragora of Annick Goutal. These notes together give that anise-like scent, very refreshing and with the lavender a bit soapy.
In the lavender note you smell the original, colonia.
Its is a refreshing very characteristic perfume that fits very well in humid warm days.

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Wore this today on a hot dry day to the hills for a hike, and then to the beach for a swim. I smelled the petti grain and lavender most strongly at first. After about an hour I mostly smelled the lavender and a bit of dry cedar. The lavender smelled soapy and clean. After about 7 hours I smelled a gentle mix of cedar and labdenum, almost vanilla-like. The dry down was definitely my favorite part. I liked this one..definitely fresh and smelled real....not synthetic at all, which I greatly appreciated. I will continue using my sample until it wears out...and consider buying a full bottle. This is a fresh and inoffensive, light fragrance for summer. I wonder how it will smell in the dead of winter....I suspect it might bring back memories of summertime, which would make it a worthwhile purchase. It smells more masculine than feminine to me, which is neither good nor bad....just an observation...although I think both genders can get away with wearing it...embellishing it...with their own personal style and flair.",08/28/16 19:58,Hellokt

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"Smelled this yesterday for the first time and was very impressed. I've been searching for a new fragrance, something for the summer, something that will WOW me... This one did it for me.

I had sprayed it on a paper strip which I brought home and couldn't stop smelling it. I left it on the table next to me as I was working on my laptop and kept getting wiffs and it smelled amazing! I moved to the next room and brought the paper strip with me. I then retuned to the room I was initially in and I was still smelling it. Whoa, this stuff is strong...or am I smelling something else altogether?? I was a bit confused. Then I went to the table and sniffed the area where the paper strip was resting before and it was this!!!!! WTF! That was the reason I didn't buy it on the spot, because it is EDT! After that all I kept thinking was buying a full bottle. So today I went and bought it and I'm enjoying it very much.

I also get a resemblance to bleu de Chanel but as it dries down it goes down a different path that oddly reminds me of my girlfriend's Princess Oud by Creed, minus the oud and ambergris. By the way, I love PO by Creed on my gf and this one reminds me of that scent but a masculine and lighter version. I love it.

Great silage and very good longevity. This is a very refreshing and pleasant spring/summer scent.
9/10 for what it is.

Update 7/10/2016: I returned this today. I love the smell a lot but, compared to that little paper strip, on my skin this lasts 2 hours! Very bummed about it... If I got around 4-5 hours (even though that's considered pretty weak) I would have kept it, that's how much I love the smell. Oh well, on to the next one.",06/19/16 18:43,RBZ
Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"A new Fragrance by Acqua di Parma is a good reason to be excited – and this release under the Blu Mediterraneo line was refreshing, going back to the roots of the Italian House. Acqua di Parma followed Colonia Club, which is good but this new Blu Mediterraneo blows it out of the water in my opinion. It is no mystery if you have been around Acqua di Parma; the Fragrances are very well blended. This comes off very lemony and right away gives way to the other notes like petit grain, black pepper, and basil. While the middle notes are starting to project, slightly powdery and flower smell from the rockrose (labdanum) and lavender arise. While the vetiver, cedar, and guaiac wood ties it all in. A favorite from the line, it feels more complex in a sense than the others and found it to be the longest lasting one so far. The description ""Cedro di Taormina is the scent of fire, earth and wind!"" is the best way to describe this eau de toilette.",06/03/16 09:30,fragrantseller

Cedro di Taormina Acqua di Parma,"At first, it's pure lemon juice meeting skin - very true to the natural fragrance of freshly squeezed lemon. That first zesty experience then makes way for the heart of the fragrance relatively quickly.

For the most part of wearing this fragrance, the citrus note experience is closer to that of an orange or mandarin - still fresh but sweeter than the opening. The lavender is a silent but perceptible complement to the citrus notes. It is the only scent close to herbal that I can detect - on my skin the basil is not perceptible.

In the background, I do however enjoy the bed of vetiver and warm wood that the citrus fruits and lavender are resting on.
Overall, a highly pleasant fragrance. The whole experience lasts about 2 hours on me. As this is a light scent, no problem to simply re-apply and start it over again - I don't think this juice will be overpowering. Very nice and truly Italian summer fragrance!",04/24/16 12:39,CentralPark

Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"Ebano is a great fragrance, in fact, my favorite of the entire house. I just realized that despite owning this fragrance for 2 years and buying a backup bottle last year, I have never written a review. This is my go-to scent for Fall and Winter months. This is aromatic with a dark, beautiful ebony wood. It has a slight touch of resins. This is an executive fragrance for days when you want to feel like a boss. Ebano is for someone in a position of authority. However, it is not an austere cologne. The touch of honey gives this creation a warmth and approachability factor. This is a great dad scent. Too bad it’s discontinued and did not get it’s own EDP line.

Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"Classical pepper scent. When you smell it, you will immediately say “what does this smell like?” ; its unoriginal, yet wearable.

Yes, Nobile is perhaps what this reminds me of.",11/19/23 16:25,Sarjoz
Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"Less similar to TF Anthracite than i would have liked, I’d say it feels more like a mixture of Bottega Veneta homme Parfum with Tauer LADDM. It has a spicy warmth with the pepper and resins that feels like the BV, but the dry petitgrain, bergamot and Vetiver reminds of the dryness of the Tauer. The Bottega is much warmer and comforting compared to the spicy dryness of this one, but depends on what you’re looking for.

I would say daily scent, but its fairly aggressive for the office unless you are as well. The chili is fairly prominent as in Mugler Taste of Fragrance, and Guerlain L’homme ideal l’intense so you may have to be a spicy character as well to rock this.

Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is a nice cologne. And sometimes a ‘good’ or ‘nice’ Cologne is a perfectly exceptionally appropriate fragrance to wear. We don’t always need to be traversing the seven opulent myrrh Oud amber heavens on Aladdin’s oriental carpet or blazing with sweet gourmands, citrus or sea salt. This smells refined expensive traditional warm captivating very masculine and authoritative. And here’s what it smells like - upon entering an antiquarian book store steeped in the scent of its own creaking oak beams you make a beeline for the leather bound books published in the 1700s. Scrolling through the darkened stiff dusty pages you happen across thick and spiced honey bizarrely oozing from the bind and you take a hard sniff. There is also a feeling of slightly charred or very antique wood but overall it’s surprisingly warm and cozy. It is as if the perfumer took Tom Ford’s Noir Anthracite, diluted it for more acceptable daily wear and mixed in a hearty warmth from honey. This is what I would imagine the inner cloisters and corridors of the British houses of Parliament might smell like… and many of the ministers within probably smell like this too. It also reminds me of the scent emanating from a freshly opened tin of honeyed pipe tobacco . Where the youthful ambitious (but unseasoned and mildly insecure) might buy TF Tobacco Vanille, their fathers go for Ebano - because they know they’ve already got it / made it and know who they are. It’s a different composition, a generation above TF TV, but in the same family. Longevity and projection are modest but then this isn’t meant to be a garish spectacle but rather a quietly confident statement. At drydown it does resemble somewhat of a traditional barbershop scent, a very civilised and pleasant terminus for this olfactory journey.",09/30/21 13:31,easterncrescent

It’s also very flat and there is little depth to the scent. I expected an opulent, assertive masculine woody fragrance but all this reeks of is inauthenticity. A big disappointment.
I would advise gentlemen to avoid this purchase as it doesn’t leave a clean impression. It’s like a dusty old house.

Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"I'm tempted to say that this is probably one of the best official encounter perfumes there is. What I mean by official encounter is any meeting of importance outside of family/friends ties. Beautiful, powerful, warm scent totally outside of sweet floral and fruity notes. It is a warm woody perfume that keeps the timber smell all the way through. Cut a fresh branch of an evergreen tree, put it to your nose, and there you are with a dark, bitter, resinous scent that goes on and on. The bitterness is augmented with vetiver, pepper and patchouli. Honey makes is at more sweet wearable bitter scent, but is is not a base note, so to the end you really just smell more or less bitterness and dirt of the patchouli. First hours though are just mellow bitterness with a soapy quality to it. It has also a very Xmassy vibe to it as you basically smell as a fir for about six to seven hours. You will blend beautifully in with the misteltoe and fresh-cut branches of spruce.
The perfume has a solid versatility, but obviously also limits. It is not for teens, it is not fresh, its is not a summer party scent, it is not a date scent if you are young. This perfume gives you more sense of grit, stating you mean business and in a civilized manner, so it is not for a rebel. I read here that it resembles perfumes of the late 70's and 80's. There is definitely a factor to it, and as it was an era when the perfume should counter stench of cigarettes and alcohol, the power was indeed in demand. Today, the power of the perfume stays, but it is perceived many times as an overkill, because when you don't stink, there is nothing to beat. I would not consider Ebano as a particularly heavy scent, but more of a wanna-be reminder of those times. Combination of quality, elegance and power you'll get here, will give you a silent boost and a sense of well-being impossible to monetize. This makes it easily one of my latest favorites.",10/23/19 10:45,pete2784
Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"Tried this because of the ebony as i've never tried it. My impression of the ebony note after a few wearings is interesting. It's just darker wood as advertised. Not sure it's because of the other notes supporting it, but what i smell is a mix of cedar and something that reminds me of gunpowder/coal/blacksmith? Not sure if that is how ebony smells, but i like it.

As for the overall impression of the fragrance.
The top notes dissappears almost immediately, the honey and ebony takes over. Those also gets toned down alot within 15 minutes and gone within 30 minutes. All im left with is patchouli and vetiver in their known AdP old school style.

Can't say im surprised about the poor longevity, as no Acqua di parma last on my skin. So if you have good longevity on your skin, this will probably last on you too. But my skin just ate up the top and middle notes within 30 minutes so i can't really convince myself to invest that kind of money for poor longevity.",08/09/19 02:29,Skywarp
Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"This is a bit underrated, in my opinion, because other scents in this line are such big hitters, namely Oud and Leather. Indeed, with the arrival of Sandalo you basically ended up with a trio that are going to cater to the majority of customers looking at the Ingredient Collection. As such, Ebano is woefully overlooked, which is a shame because it is such a well-done perfume. Woody, resinous, a hint of incense, I really think it has a close affinity to Gucci’s original Pour Homme. There is also the just perceptible spicy warmness, fig leaf pluminess of Tom Ford Tom Ford for Men Extreme. Longevity and projection are excellent in my experience and the fragrance is surprisingly versatile.

Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"I really wanted to love this fragrance, I was extremely excited at the prospect of another AdP Colonia and one based on Ebony wood sounded delightful, unfortunately Ebano misses the mark. It starts very well, the opening is really superb, the red pepper note hits upfront, both fresh and spicy and then the unmistakable ebony note is among the best I’ve smelled, owing to the fact that it is the true focus but with touches of vetiver and other cleaner woods. Totally masculine, on the darker side with a dusty, dry feel and a hint of patch earth too. The thing which lets this perfume down is the drydown, it dries down, to creamy woods quickly and Is just a bit flat. Ebano is something which could’ve been so good and even glimpses greatness briefly but I’ve come across this before with this kind of woody scent. The drydown is passable but very boring and like something bog standard from the designer realm, I feel a bit bad giving it a hard time because it’s okay but could’ve been so much better. I’m not too bothered about the performance but it is a low lying hum as can be expected from an ebony/woods fragrance with little silage but still unusual for this line as they are usually strong. In conclusion then, I loved the opening and thought I may have hit on a holy grail of old skool, peppery, masculinity but that excitement was too short lived. I’d recommend anyone to try it but Ebano didn’t meet my high expectations.",01/27/18 15:50,Houdini4
Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"Very good fragrance. Strong opening. Amber honey red pepper really are noticeable. A very solid fragrance, with very rich woody notes. I guess its best for night and winter. Also very oriental and unique. Scent is very rich and masculine. Performance and zillage both moderate. Radiates well on rhe skin but not offensive. I ll give it 8/10",01/24/18 06:37,Jms710frag
Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"Yes a really old school perfume. I agree totally. And no its not typical Italian. It reminds me of an old English gentlemen's society club with well dressed men:).
It opens with the fresh-bitter aromatic note citric with petitgrain.
Then the honey sweet aroma comes through.
The vetiver is there as a basic note that stays until the end.
Then the perfume ends in the woody-warm spicy old school scent. It reminds me a bit of old spice.
Its a good perfume when y like this old school combination.
When to wear? Definitely more wintertime and more for when y like a more classic way of life. Like I said its a typical old fashioned society perfume more English than the Italian vibrant and stylish perfumes this house offers. This perfume is a bit moderate compared to other ones of this house.
In the same year AdP released two very different perfumes in 2017 that are totally the opposite of each other: This one and the Mirra version.
I can tell because i tried them on my wrists:).
I prefer the Colonia Mirra more. But they are both very well balanced with style and class.",07/22/17 06:19,osiris5
Colonia Ebano Acqua di Parma,"Old school woody scent which reminds me a lot of Je suis un Homme from Etat Libre. They might not have the same notes but they are at the same level with regards to their smell. This one is less dry compared to Je suis un Homme and has a dirty aroma which Je suis un Homme doesn't have. Overall, it is an OK scent for people above the age of 30 years. However, considering the price it is not worth all the money.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Love this. The opening is quite woody; the vanilla notes begin surfacing little by little after a few minutes. It's not pure vanilla, of course; there's something slightly floral about this. Anyway, this is a very intimate, cozy, gourmand scent; it just irradiates comfort for me. Like an artesanal vanilla muffin that just came out of the oven. Projection is nothing to write home about; it works inside your personal space for the most part. Longevity is a good 7-8 hours. It's a unisex fragrance for me, maybe leaning a bit more toward the feminine side. Great for the colder days or nights that you want to spend cuddling with your partner.",09/27/25 17:43,clauricaune
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Vaniglia could easily be renamed ""Vaniglia & Friends"", don't go in expecting a pure vanilla scent and you won't be disappointed.

This smells like a delicious, moderately dense sunny vanilla cloud. ☀️☁️ There's a lot more than just vanilla contributing here, but the overall scent smells oh-so good. There's a mildly soapy quality to this which gives it kind of a ""balmy"" vibe, as if you were using a luxurious hand cream. I'm willing to overlook this as the smell is so good. Vaniglia is blended to perfection and makes its presence known in a classy way, if there's one thing Acqua Di Parma excels at it's giving fragrances that calm, assertive presence instead of being desperate and trying to fill the room. This is my ideal volume for a fragrance.

Vaniglia is a fragrance that delivers and offers no surprises, honestly a 20-30ml bottle of this would be more than enough, 100ml, let alone 180ml of this would bathe you in it for the rest of your life. And while it smells good, it's not a very practical fragrance to wear. Discontinued or not, I don't think I'd shell out the big euros for a bottle. All that said, Vaniglia is definitely worth sampling. ☀️",04/05/25 04:53,GloryRide

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"An unprecedented fascinating interpretation of precious Madagascar Vanilla.
The essence of vanilla acquires new depths, combining with notes of bergamot, mandarin, neroli and jasmine for a luminous and enveloping composition.
Vaniglia is an oriental vanilla, woody, citrus, floral, powdery perfume.

The scent opens sharp citrus and quickly heads towards a stunning vanilla with a slightly woody floral touch. In the end it becomes a predominantly vanilla/musky fragrance and sweet in measure. One of the best vanilla in the collection and with the best performance of the House of Representatives I've ever met with the usual quality; for those who like vanilla perfume: MANDATORY!",12/22/24 13:38,Majid Abdul Hakim
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This. This is a surprise. The heliotrope is soooooo
Good. It’s very forward in the opening.
Then the neroli.THEN the jasmine and vanilla. The dry down adds some mandarin, but not too much this is not incredibly citrusy like most ADP fragrances.
I’m still getting the heliotrope throughout!
It doesn’t have great longevity but I overspray because I love it.
I spray it on my cashmere sweaters and scarves and it lasts forever!
I would love this on a man. I feel this is truly unisex.",12/16/24 19:53,KP1111
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"reminds me a lot of vanillary by lush. I don't dislike it, but don't reaallly like it. it starts out smelling like cat pee on me, and then dries down and smells like an old ladies perfume. not my fav but could be worst.",12/06/24 08:57,wallflowermolly
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Not something I would wear as a man, but would 100% gift this to my girlfriend. Such a beautiful soft vanilla smell, and the neroli makes it slightly soapy. Reminds me a lot of those scented sunscreen lotions girls sometimes wear. However, it goes for around 180 euros which is just difficult to justify. 'Oud' and 'Leather' are valued a lot better in my opinion. If I come across a good deal in the future I'm definitely buying it though!",09/18/24 08:38,sweetymasculine
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,This fragrance seems to have been discontinued :(,05/17/24 09:43,tedo_tedo
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is a really great vanilla, that would do well in the warm weather. As the name would suggest, this is vanilla dominant, with noticeable neroli and heliotrope. The opening to me, comes across as a floral vanilla with slightly bitter neroli and citrus. As it develops the neroli-citrus combo becomes less bitter, and IMO gives it a warm-weather/summery feel. I actually get a fairly hefty dose of neroli in this fragrance. As it dries down the heliotrope becomes more noticeable, contributing to a powdery effect. I also get something slightly sweet, borderline gourmand...akin to powdered sugar.

While the name is indicative of the scent, I find the bottle a bit misleading. This is not a dark, heavy, woody vanilla. To me, it's a summery, floral, powdery, and slightly sugary vanilla. I really enjoy this a lot. As far as performance goes, this is great- it lasts ALL day. Is feminine IMO.",02/10/24 11:39,Vickalicious
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"A very well done quality Vanilla fragrance, some light supporting florals and that Aqcua Di Parma twang. Unisex. Classy, well done and not overpowering.",01/02/24 15:05,WesleySniper1st

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This perfume is like a mixture between AdP Essenza and vanilla beans. Neroli aspect is pretty obvious. Imagine a typical cologne with vanilla hint. It really is unisex. Smells very nice on me and also on my partner. However, on him it stays much much longer. It is definitely not a mainstream juice, but not too extravagant to pull it off.",10/17/23 21:56,marusiatko
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Nice Vanilla scent. Powdery Vanilla. Floral Powdery Vanilla. It leans a bit feminine due to the florals, and a bit due to the soft powderiness combined with the florals, but there is easily enough unisex orientation to suit me. Evidently the heliotrope helps impart the vanillic accord and almond facet. Its light enough for seasonal versatility. This is good and I'd buy a full bottle at a good price. But my favorite two Vanilla scents remain Ted Lapidus Pour Lui and Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille.",10/01/23 17:57,JmThms
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"A different, not Common vanilla.
Vanilla is extracted from the pod of the plant of the same name, a climber that is part of the orchid family, making it the only one to produce an edible ingredient.
Here we have it in its sweetness and not cloying roundness, initially accompanied by a splendid heliotrope and citrus fruits, which I feel prevail as an accompanying note, to finally meet a splendid jasmine that surronds it, thus making it very pleasant even for those who, like me, is not particularly lover of this note.
An Aztec legend (who used it to flavor cocoa), narrates that vanilla was born from the blood of the goddess Princess Xanat, beheaded by her father who did not want to marry her off to a mortal.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This perfume is delicious but unfortunately I would never buy it because of its poor performance on my skin.

It has an opening with nuances of citrus cologne that gives way to a powdery vanilla with floral aspects of jasmine.

It has a moderate-soft sillage and lasts on my skin for no more than 3 hours.

Without being the same at all, if you fancy a perfume with vanilla with a cologne vibe at a good price and with better performance, I would recommend Per Hai from the Spanish firm Oveh Madrid.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is really nice but very expensive, almost prohibitively so. It's a green, powdery vanilla that's sweet but not overly so and not cloying at all like some vanillas can be. I actually thought this was too mature for me at first (my boyfriend said it smelled like something his mum would wear) but I don't think that anymore, it's classy and chic and I feel very grown up wearing it. Unfortuunately, as mentioned, it also has a very grown up price tag attached to it so would only buy if I got a great deal on it.",04/22/23 10:14,Fraggremo14
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Soapy deep vanilla, it is very nice.. it is a lot heavier than eau duelle for instance, more powdery. In regards to vanilla fragrances, eau duelle is still the winner in my opinion. That aside, this a great fragrance!",02/06/23 09:06,tropic0
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Like Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille that I tested recently, Vaniglia is a really good unisex vanilla-dominant scent. It is more subtle and wearable with more mass appeal than TV, but it still is an intriguing, creatively composed scent.

Vaniglia is vanilla-dominant throughout, as the name suggests. The vanilla is deliciously dry and powdery. It opens with citrus-tinged vanilla, mostly thanks to the neroli. Heliotrope adds a hazy, almond-like undertone, but this scent is not a gourmand, despite the tendencies here.

It becomes more floral as it develops, with jasmine rounding out the vanilla. It is more powdery here and a little bit sweet.

Woody notes creep in as it dries down, providing the dry, powdery vanilla with a beautiful warm counterpoint. It fades to a powdery skin scent. Sillage and longevity are moderate.

Vaniglia is a high-quality, subtle unisex vanilla scent, dusty and powdery with just the right amount of sweetness. Cosy yet elegant, it is really satisfying to wear. Ideal for cold days. 4/5.",12/06/22 12:06,Enrium
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I've been wearing it for a week in cooler fall weather and it has become a clear 'love' for me.

The opening is slightly sweet leaning but still quite natural vanilla which in the drydown settles down onto the most cozy fluffy powdery base. Throughout wear I get short soft soapy whiffs - think 5-star hotel soap - as well. This just makes you smell like someone who only bathes and slathers themselves in the most lux body care products. On me it's really the vanilla, the heliotrope and the musk that play off each other in the most beautiful comforting and classy way.

Since the days have been getting colder I find myself reaching for it almost daily. Sillage depends on how much you spray. With three sprays I get about an arm's length, which is my personally preferred range. As for longevity, it last throughout the day on me, on my clothes until I next wash them.

Solid no-nonsense well-blended and completely unisex pick for the colder months.",11/18/22 05:34,latafan
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"It's a whole vanilla perfume. The opening is a neroli infused with a roasted deep powdery vanilla. In the middle, the vanilla becomes sweet and unfortunately, the neroli leaves; but, the vanilla still powdery and deep. In the drydown the scent is less sweet. It's settled on a powdery woody vanilla.",11/06/22 11:10,Noha8
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrances starts with a neroli infused with natural smelling non sweet vanilla. As this fragrance dries down the heliotrope makes the vanilla denser an denser somewhat like a suncream (not suncream smelling) but so natural. It smells just dense and warm, like vanilla pudding but natural. This is just Unisex because it lacks both the harshness you usually meet in a man fragrance and the sweetness you have in a female fragrance. If you are a male and wearing this people will think it's a men's fragrance, if you are a woman they'll think it's a women's fragrance. There is nothing synthetic about this fragrance.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"3 words: Classic, sensual, cosy, it also has so much depth, is enveloping and sophisticated in a comforting way.
So, I went to the department store and perfume shop and sampled lots of fragrances on blotter cards, this and carner (tardes/ rockstar) Jacques fath (curaçao bay) aerin (hisbiscus palm) plus lots of others bronze goddess fraiche, solar and intense, Chloe love story, idole and more. 20 + fragrances. Wanted more but you know it was starting to get awkward in there ;)
ANYWAY, I kept all the samples, obsessively whiffing and sniffing several times throughout the last two days and getting rid of some that faded and I’m down to my last 5 favourites. I was going to write vaniglia off as it seemed just so so when I first sprayed, BUT I held on. This develops into something smouldering and deep and delicious. It’s intoxicating, wow I am genuinely surprised because the more I smell the more I like. This is a keeper I just know. It doesn’t aggravate the sinuses or have any shrill high pitched notes that creep up on you. It delivers. It smoothly and deeply caresses you with a pure but slightly dark sensuous experience. This is a truly good fragrance. Very enveloping, my opinion changed not just slightly but dramatically. This requires time to show its best true colours. I feel they must have used very expensive ingredients because out of all of my testers this one still feels like it hasn’t reached its peak, it’s not fading and feels like it’s still going after two days. The only other fragrance which has developed into something more and has clarity of smell (and I like more too than when I sprayed it, it actually made me feel a bit sick for the first day) is hisbiscus palm. I can now see why people like it. The carner ones and curaçao bay are just starting to fade but held out well. Hisbiscus palm and vaniglia have been well curated and feel like solid complete fragrances that stand the test of time. I have decided to purchase vaniglia and the other 4 in due course.
If you like vanilla I really think you can’t go wrong with this, I am so impressed with the luxurious, heavenly and expensive fragrance. It feels like pure unadulterated luxury. It has a lot of depth. I can detect the floral notes and less so the citrus and they add more height and range to the vanilla essence of this fragrance but it’s just so well blended. I can picture a classy woman, in cashmere who has style. Early autumn 🍂 time and winter this is most suited too but could layer this other times to increase longevity of other perfumes.
Edit: I went onto their website to check for ingredient list, it contains BHT, which is dangerous and I emailed them (I know this is to help maintain integrity and preserve the fragrance) and got a long email response which was like a politician evading the direct question I asked. So not helpful. They surely must be able to use a more natural preservative. It made me not buy this beautiful scent after all. Such a shame.",05/19/22 02:47,Rainstorm
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"OMG!

This was one of my first fragrances ever, so naturally as I've been collecting and upgrading into the niche realm in search of quality and longevity, this had been collecting dust at the back....

As I'm currently on my way to Selfridge's, I decided to put this on because of its poor performance (so I can test new frags). As soon as I sprayed it, I had shivers and goosebumps all over due to how densely delicious this smells.

Deep, Dark, Clean and Alluring Vanilla.

I decided to cover myself in it and everyone I passed on the road was compelled to inhale this perfume. It affects people in the same way The Moon by Frederic Malle does. And to be honest I think this is nearly equal to Musc Ravageur, just not as long lasting.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Very surprised about this one.It doesn't really shout out AdP DNA, and I don't know why it's so under appreciated. I think this fragrance is gorgeous, definitely feminine leaning, but it's gorgeous, tillage and projection are nice and soft. Longevity is a little better than usual you would expect from AdP. To me this is probably my most versatile Fragrance, office, gym, out for a meal, out for a walk, I really can't think of it being out of place in any situation. It is a Vanilla leading frag, but very nice and soft, and just so delightful and as someone else stated; very comforting.

I tried Camelia and did not particularly like, I also own Ou from the same family, love it equally, except this one is most definitely feminine leaning. It's one of the very few frags that I *will* buy again when this bottle is finished.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I received this today in my scent mail. Initially I was a tad disappointed. I think in my mind it was going to be THE perfect citrus gourmand, balanced lemon and vanilla notes. It is nothing like that, on me. Initially I get cloves, sa LOT of cloves, slight cinnamon notes, and dry woody cedar, with just a touch of orange. Not being a huge fan of cedar or strong cloves and cinnamon, this did not please me. However, on me this comes into it's own in the dry down. The spices soften and become a clove/vanillic 'dry' scent (this may have heliotrope, but I do not get a lot of sweetness or powdery notes - they are there, but not overwhelming), with an orange citrus layer floating along side. Not a beast mode scent, but nor is it a shrinking violet. Considering my skin eats most things extremely quickly, the longevity was pretty good. If I had to pick an image to describe this I would say 'orange spiced Christmassy baked goods fresh out of the oven'",03/22/22 05:32,Jezebelle333
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Vaniglia by Acqua di Parma was love a first sniff! Not your usual gourmand vanilla.

This starts with a fresh blast of neroli, bergamot and heliotrope, plus vanilla, which is always present (I can't smell the mandarin). The heliotrope gives Vaniglia a cool vibe, making it different from other vanillas. During the dry down, cedar and musk become present, but the vanilla and heliotrope continue their presence, and the scent become slightly powdery.

Vaniglia has great longevity on my skin, more than 7 h and radiates moderately. This is very well blended and makes a great office scent.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Smelled this a few times in the store before I purchased a bottle.
This has vanilin extracted from cloves which is also found in vanilla, so it's very similar if not identical to vanilla. I pick up neroli, vanilla, jasmine, musk, cedar & big dose of hedione. I get citruses only in the opening minutes.

Performance is good and scent is relaxing imo. Leans a very slightly feminine thanks to the jasmine which is not super pronounced, but it's there. Smells like if L'Artisan Parfumeur Traverse Bosphore and Tom Ford Santal Blush had a baby.
It's also versatile enough to wear in the cold and heat because of the neroli and citruses. Fantastic execution. Sleeper from the house of ADP.

this smells like cedar and maybe musk and a lot of those big aroma chemicals used by brands like essentric molecules which make the whole fragrance smell like white noise (or in this case, drab gray/beige noise).

so this is basically modern trendy niche perfumery in a nutshell and it’s not my thing. I’ve always been attracted to unisex/androgynous fragrances but this recent obsession with genderless scents have been leaving me cold.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I have tried several ADP’s over the last few years and the bottom line is this is a house I generally avoid due to the fragrances smelling like old barbershop which is just a smell I don’t enjoy. A sample of this made its way into my hands twice now and I will admit I really like this one.

This smells really polished, no barbershop here. A very floral vanilla that changes slightly for that first hour then settles into a creamy vanilla scent. I can see this being a compliment getter from everyone.

I’m sampling quite a few things right now to make my next big purchase and I would say this is a serious contender for a big bottle buy.

Update: I have sampled this three times now and the first few hours of this fragrance is great. But what the hell is up with the dry down? Like grandma soap. Every time. If it wasn't for this horrible drydown I'd be all over this.",07/13/21 06:54,RevAaron

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"God, this is good! An instant love for me 😍

Woody heliotrope vanilla heaven, with a twist of sitrus! A great unisex scent IMO. The opening is more on the masculine side and the drydown leans a bit more feminine.

It's quite heavy on the heliotrope, but pulls it off without smelling dated or cloying. My sister douses herself in manifesto from time to time and I didn't think of them as similar, but will certainly have to test them side by side.

Vaniglia is very well balanced and the perfect vanilla for me: a bit quirky, not too sweet but still creamy and delicious! Yum!

Performance: not sure what to think yet. Usually I can smell a perfume on myself very well, but I think my nose gets used to this. My sister said I smelled great when I had just applied it, a few hours later she had to get really close to smell it, but all of a suddon she said ""Oh, I just smelled your perfume! You applied it again!"". I hadn't, I had just walked past her, so I guess it doesn't project much except the first hour, but sillage may be better.

I feel like it ruined the vintage classy vibe I was enjoying and turned the perfume into just another generic white floral direction.",06/04/21 09:44,MissAnnette

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The masculine equivalent of L'heure bleue, one of Guerlains masterpieces. Cedar makes it a bit darker though heliotrope and vanilla give this fragrance the same powdery vibe. Quite unique fragrance, highly recommended to all male (and female) vanilla lovers!",03/12/21 09:21,Elisabeth M.
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Strange, unique vanilla. I don't enjoy the opening, it smells like a classic old fashioned cologne. However, it changes, heliotrope and vanilla become the most prominent notes. Yummy warm vanilla powder, slightly bitter and woody. True unisex. Classy and expensive smelling vanilla. Professional setting or a special event. When you want to wear a vanilla fragrance that smells sophisticated and refreshing. Not the best performance, it is rather modest, but sometimes you want / need just that. It's great for spring and summer months, that cologne base is lovely, neroli and spice... No spice listed, but there's something spicy about it, a tiny amount of herbal spice. On their website they claim that the sweet essence of vanilla is extracted from the cloves. So that's what a spicy note is, cloves. Overall, it's an interesting scent, with a beautiful contrast of cold herbal citrus opening and a warm vanilla powdery drydown. Luckily, I don't get a lot of florals / jasmine, mostly bitter orange blossom. Yay!",03/07/21 08:16,_I.V_
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"A cologne scent with a perfect vanilla pod touch. Very unisex. I truly like the warm edge the vanilla here gives to the classic clean, perfect cologne.",01/24/21 07:37,MademoiselleMaya
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"A very nice change from the others in the brown AdP line (which I love most of) with a slightly gourmand vanilla touch.

I am not a huge fan of the opening stages I think the jasmine pops a bit too much for me but the mid onwards to drydown this fades to leave a nice heliotrope and vanilla over the top of a musky clean base.

Reminds me of a touch more masculine and less gourmand version of Profumum Roma's Meringa.",12/30/20 01:55,SmellMyCheese
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Intense heliotrope vanilla centered scent, I know it is not in the notes pyramid according to Fragrantica, but I smell leather and benzoin in this. Actually this makes me think of a niche type of Shalimar..

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"As with others in ADP's signatures of the sun line they take elemental scents and turn them into well construed perfumes.

As someone who enjoys sweet and spicy scents and this is right on the money for me. It's now my signature scent. It's a woodsy vanilla with a sophisticated touch. None of the other notes come out overemphasised. Great for office and leisure use.

Sweet and sensuous, gentlemanly but bold. A masterpiece.",09/08/20 15:29,ManOnTheGo
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is not what you expect from the name of it! This perfume is a fresh neroli-heliotrope-white musk scent on a vanilla base. After 3 hours the dry down gets a bit sweeter. Longevity is great, sillage is awesome for the first hour, then it gradually softens to become a skin scent eventually. Borderline gourmand but not quite. On the fresher sweeter side but definitely not cloying. I pair it with YSL Magnificent Gold, to tone down the oud in MG and make it wearable for summertime.",09/05/20 06:03,Margarita Birda
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I am not an acqua di parma fan. However i have tried this fragance and i love It. I dont know if It really worths the price or if maybe It can be a bit too soft for the money It costs but i know It has a great smell and i know that i could feel It for at least 4-5 hours perfectly and then very close to the skin for 6-8 hours. It is a very soft vanilla, a bit like the plástico dolls smell, delicate and perfect for daytime use. Although It is vanilla i think is elegant and weareable un any situación, even in the formal ones. It is true that the most importante notes are heliotropo, vanilla and neroli.

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Excellent vanilla-centered fragrance.

Smooth, soft, pleasant, cozy, warm, inviting... Just lovely.

A little bit on the dry side with hint of woodiness.

A bit sweet in a powdery way, but not cloying at all (like some sweet vanilla fragrances can be), and like another reviewer said this feels mature somehow.

Somewhat floral and with a certain citrus vibe, but the floral and citrus notes are very well balanced against the vanilla so that the notes blend together beautifully and support the vanilla which is absolutely front and center. The vanilla makes it warm, while the florals and citrus keep it clean and fresh.

It definitely leans feminine in my opinion - I think my mom would love this, actually - but a confident man could surely pull this off. I'm envisioning tanned skin in a light linen suit on a warm summer evening in southern Europe...",05/28/20 02:15,Tamlin
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"simply for vanilla lovers, I have tried quite a few from this House but most suffer from longevity issues. this is better. i am not sure on the price tag but if you love Vanilla, musk, heliotrope and jasmine, you should try it. smells heavenly on ladies. cozy and personal, intimate sessions this will be a win, i LOIKE ;)

Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is reformulated and quite different from the brown bottle version, the new formulation is less feminine. The jasmine is significantly toned down and the vanilla note is a little less sweet as well.

From AdP's website description the vanilla note here comes from clove extraction. Quite surprising to me that clove contains vanillin, anyway that's the secret of vanilla note not being very sweet but instead more woody here. Overall, it's a very pleasant and versatile fragrance with a unique fresh twist, just the way I imagine AdP's vanilla to be.",09/30/19 19:08,willyng
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The Shop assistant describe it as a ""bitter vanilla"" and I agree with him. What a balanced combination!!!

The whole line it's wonderful, I couldn't choose, fortunately for me it's far off what I'll pay for fragrances :)

The scent lasted for about 3 hours and 5 on my jacket. Nobile Iris was fairly linear, no huge shifts or weird changes. Frankly it just smelled good. Clean, but not quite ""fresh"", complex but not overly so. Definitely signature scent worthy, for the right person. I'd say this is fine for work (be light with it though) and shines on weekends with friends and family. After the shower too. Loved it.",04/06/21 21:20,AMMILLER

Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"I love all of Acqua Di Parma´s renditions of iris. Iris is, in my view, the most italian of fragrances, as Italy is one of the top exporters of orris burre in the world. I currently own Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile EDP, and Iris Nobile Sublime EDP, as well as this beauty here (Acqua Nobile Iris EDT). Thankfully the packaging is very different, because the names are so similar, but the fragrances, though clearly realated, have different formulations, and this is my favorite in this kind of weather (upwords of 83F/28C degrees.)

The reason I love this: Hellooo Citron! Aromatic and fresh, and thanks to the brilliant house of Acqua Di Parma: long lasting for an EDT! It lasts about 4 hours on skin and much longer on fabric. While I find Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile EDP (6 hours, by the way) lovely for having more presence and projection, it is to me, more of a spring fragrance, while this: Acqua Nobile Iris EDT, is FANTASTIC for summer!

I lived in Italy, one of the happiest moments in my life, and Acqua Di Parma's Iris Nobile as well as Santa Maria Novella's Melograno are the fragrance of Italy to me.

I hope you find this review helpful if you´re trying to choose between the 3 fragrances. Evaluate the weather in your city and don´t write this beauty off just because it´s an EDT. This is quality perfumery!

Enjoy your summer!",08/07/19 10:27,anilinam

It reminds me of prada iris absolu which I love !! Nothing more to say, I love it !! Great creation !! It isn't a sophisticated outgoing bold scent , still it is a quality airy and comforting perfume , feminine and very easy to wear !!
only issue is longevity isn't great, thank goodness I have a big bottle so I reapply often .",08/17/16 13:55,genny17
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"EDT: For me a violet dominated scent, the citrus and green notes swiftly giving way to a full-bodied (a little predictable) sweet violet which stomps on any delicate iris.

Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"Truly beautiful iris scent. Very soft, unlike many other iris scents that are cool and harsh. This iris scent is like delicate satin that you love on your body. Absolute delight.

Update: There's something in its base that puts me off. What a shame.",08/06/15 13:47,Arlene-Beatrix
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"At first it's a very loud bright accord of citrus and white flowers. It cools down in about 10 minutes and turns into a white flower, citrusy, fresh and sparkly excellently blended perfume. It is slightly sweet and slightly bitter (violet leaf?) and I like it. This fragrance is very wearable and enjoyable, it smells expensive.

When the scent settles after an hour or so I can get some very soft iris flower, quite realistic. There is no iris root in this perfume so it lacks the buttery and powdery feel as you may expect of an iris perfume. So to me this fragrance is not much about the iris, it is a very classy Mediterranean citrus flower+citrus summer scent.

It took me some time to warm up to this one and I can say now I love it for the summer. Sillage is arm length and the longevity is good several hours. It is worth the price",05/30/15 03:09,oks-oks
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"This is a drop-dead gorgeous scent. So wonderful that I'm burning through my rollerball fast even when I restrain myself from reaching for it!

Acqua Iris Nobile smells like the most exquisite and elegant floral. The iris is very buttery here, and is sweetened by orange blossom. I could definitely smell the violet leaf that gives Acqua Iris Nobile a green tinge while neroli and minimal citruses shadow in the background. While Acqua Iris Nobile is a fairly linear perfume that boosts iris and OB all the way through, the smell of it is so wonderful that I really don't mind the linearity of it. Actually I like how it stays floral and doesn't turn musky or soapy on me during dry down like Infusion d'Iris by Prada. Sillage is moderate turning soft, and longevity is around 6 hours on me. Also the dry down of this perfume smells extremely like Iris Nobile Sublime offered by the same company.

The overall effect is a green fragrant iris that is to die for!

On a side note in terms of the impression this perfume gives off, I really think it depends on the style of the wearer: if you're a oriental lover this might smell ""cold"", but if you wear lots of green than this can smell ""cheerful"" and ""casual"". Regardless of your background, everyone here seems to agree upon the high quality of the scent, which one simply cannot deny once you catch a whiff of this beauty.

Definitely full-bottle worthy for me.",05/08/15 00:11,pepperoniann
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"If you are new to the world of perfumes and want to try one that you will know immediately is well made and expensive, get yourself a sample of this. I waited to write this review until I had a few other niche perfumes under my belt for comparison. I hope I can convey how beautifully special this one is.
Well blended is the key. There is absolutely no synthetic smell at all. It is the cold, no nonsense fragrance that a lady in a business suit wears. Or a lady judge! It is soft power, a bit powdery from the amber, slightly floral from the iris. Not at all like Prada Infusion D'Iris (which is very nice too). This is cold and classic like a beautiful ivory statue. If Athena was feeling aloof and chose to wear a scent it, I can see her picking this one.
I don't want to scare anyone away with this review. This is one of my new must haves for when I need to think clearly and make decisions. This is a very special scent that all others can be held up to when deciding if a scent is good quality. No nonsense, no kidding.",11/17/14 12:19,Hedonista
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"I own Iris Nobile and wear it often and I was surprised to find this ""acqua"" version of it to actually feel stronger and more substantial than the original, with a much bigger emphasis on the iris. However, where the original is one of those ""little black dress"" perfumes that's suitable for pretty much anything, this one really lends itself best to spring/summer.

It's a really sparkly, zesty kind of a fragrance, one that makes you smile. A little bottle of sunshine.

Iris and violet leaf are strongest on me, with a sparkling citrus backdrop. The iris in this feels rootier than the one in the original version, but it's still a more floral iris that rooty orris accord.

I find this fairly linear, save for a hint of vanilla at the close.

The sillage is soft/medium and for longevity, I get about 8 hours from it, so it's pretty good there.

I'll be getting a full bottle of this for summer because it's the perfect summer scent. Very happy and cheerful, but also very ladylike and elegant. Definitely a great addition to the Nobile series.",11/10/14 13:18,becuille
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"On me, Acqua Nobile Iris is dominated by green violet leaf, neroli and citron. The violet leaf is a bit sharp in the opening, which is then smoothened by a discreet vanilla. The eponymous iris behaves more like a strutural note at first, providing a mineral powdery texture, but later becomes more discernable along with orange blossom, rendering the drydown a little bit more floral. The overall effect is clean and fresh, cologne-like yet with a graceful feminine touch.

The sillage is soft and the longevity is around 7 hours. Acqua Nobile Iris is a refreshing spring/summer fragrance, casual and comfortable, yet with an understated elegance. If you happen to be looking for a citrus cologne with a twist, Acqua Nobile Iris is an option with a solid structure.",07/21/14 11:00,StellaDiverFlynn
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"I realised why I did not love this beautiful fragrance at first - I was chronically overspraying. With lighter touch, I am liking it more and more. For me the orange blossom becomes prominent and longlasting. I think less is definitely more with this one. I really like the iris close on my skin. This is a timeless fragrance and I don't think I will ever get tired of it.",06/23/14 05:14,Lucy Peach
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"Ahhhh... a cozy citrus. An interesting combination of brightness and powderiness. It reminds me of waking up at dawn in a country house, full of windows, very early as the sun begins to lift over the horizon after a night of rain. You walk into the sunroom filled with flowers, then settle into your breakfast of freshly squeezed orange juice. On the other hand, this is a lovely perfume to wear to bed, it is very relaxing.

Acqua Nobile Iris is an authentic and softly sensual perfume. It feels baby fresh without smelling of baby powder. Very gentle but also uplifting. It is similar to Acqua Nobile Magnolia, which is in the same family, because of these qualities, and because of the similar notes and structure. These Acqua Nobile perfumes are also both ageless and timeless, for any floral lover.

I think that if you like Prada's Infusion D'Iris in the EDT concentration more than you like it in the EDP, you will also like this one very much.

Thanks Germany, for the samples!",05/16/14 12:10,evesoho
Acqua Nobile Iris Acqua di Parma,"I love this one. Its clean and sweet and violet , irises ,,,, one of my favourite combos. The musk and vanilla makes this to be warm soft and clean.

It's not an going out for dinner scent but every other place is quite suitable. If I wear it and want to step it up abit and make it fancy I add the new EDP iris sublime.",03/29/14 14:09,Germany

Mandarino Millesimato 2022 Acqua di Parma,"Asked my mom to buy this in Rome for €220, number 1079/2022 piece. Bottle is gorgeous, scent is an accurate representation of natural mint, last quite long on skin (sillage is great) and priced quite fairly for what you get for. Wore this several times outside and to school, performance is fairly good for a citrus fragrance. Best release from Acqua di Parma for the quality you get for (unlike other release with weak longevity) in my opinion. From my experience, don’t spray at clothes, will wear off in 1-2 hours, I found it to last the longest when I spray it on my neck.",06/01/24 01:42,Benzzz
Mandarino Millesimato 2022 Acqua di Parma,"Given there are only 2022 bottles globally available, I felt compelled to give this one a try. I was surprised by the spearmint. It feels really nice, and although it sits close it feels as if it’s made to do so. Naturally energizing but highly personal, it’s a quality fragrance. Very light, highly compelling; and, the spearmint is totally unique. Calmer than the mint in the OG Colonia Club and far more subdued than Green Irish Tweed, but it vanished far too soon to justify a purchase. Perhaps at a later stage I can try the standard version and see how the spearmint sits then. If this lasted longer or transitioned rather than disappearing so quickly, I would have bought it. It’s a very nice two-hour experience.",05/10/24 04:59,Bradley B.
Mandarino Millesimato 2022 Acqua di Parma,"Bought my bottle today,number 744 of 2022.
As a big fan of the house,I was expecting more to be honest.It is citrusy,soapy and very linear.What you spray is what you’ll get throughout the wear of the fragrance.It didn’t last too long.I need more time with it to get to know it better",05/02/24 22:49,gabinete
Mandarino Millesimato 2022 Acqua di Parma,"Tried and tried again, with curiosity and expectations. First impressions. It is a much less tart tangerine than other fragrances on the same notes; it is not flat like other citruses that focus only on the characterizing note. It opens crisply, with green and fresh notes, but soon and steadily becomes a sweet tangerine with notes of musk and patchouli that combine well, leaving the tangerine always as the protagonist but not as the only protagonist.
Because of its sweetness, it is not necessarily a daytime-only scent. Definitely very elegant and also quite different from what exists on the same notes. The duration is not negligible, although predominantly on this base that does not focus only on tangerine. An elegant perfume, certainly unisex, for what little I have smelled the corresponding eau de toilette, different and more ""complete"" and complex.
The price is limited edition, assuming it remains so. Certainly when compared to a ""Pur Kinkan""
Edt by Cartier, which is little more than a scented water, (albeit of the highest quality and which I adore)
sold at € 275 (75 ml), it can stand. The product, I reiterate, seems to me to be really of great quality. A gem for lovers of the genre, even for those who are ""scared"" of mandarin as a basic idea. This is more, much more.",05/06/24 05:31,Mone71
Mandarino Millesimato 2022 Acqua di Parma,"A delicate and very natural tangerine.
I found the Millesimato version to be ""warmer"" and sweeter than its ""Sicilian Mandarin"" sibling.
The duration even on me is about 6-7 hours: not great considering that we are talking about an Eau de Parfum but it is still a citrus scent, so you cannot expect miracles.
Since this is a limited edition (2022 pieces, but...we'll see if it really is!) I picked one up in the Milan boutique at its debut, during Design Week. I happened upon the number 1672/2022. And unfortunately no: you can't choose the bottle number because you would have to open the box to do that. So it's absolutely random.",05/03/24 05:35,federicosol84

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Closest thing I have to smelling like Root Beer but still not close enough. Smells very similar to Trussardi's Passeggiata In Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II but it doesn't have a chocolatey element to it.

Mandorlo di Sicilia has weak sillage and it feels like it wears off fast or maybe I get anosmic to it because every now and then I will catch a whiff. So I would say you could wear this in an office setting and not offended many people.

I can't explain how it smells even though I just compared it to root beer. Initial spray smells like pink bubblegum and for a second it feels like root beer. Just like Trussardi's Passeggiata In Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, Mandorlo di Sicilia has an artificial scent of almond biscotti and vanilla on the dry down.

They also both smell odd when I spray them on certain polyester clothes so I would try it on skin or cotton fabric if you don't spray fragrances on your skin. On my skin I mostly get the pink bubblegum smell. But if you like bubblegum I wouldn't get this for that fragrance. The best pink bubblegum fragrance I have tried is Lush's Snow Fairy.

I think this is a decent almond baked-goods scent that isn't TOO sweet so it could possibly lean towards being unisex. I'd say it's good for the fall.",,beta-ionone

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"[On skin]
Opens with a fantastic burst of fizzy root beer. It's playful, sweet, yet mature and has surprising depth, smelling very natural too. I'd say it's completely unisex. A warm, playfully sweet, and inviting scent. I could definitely see this as a summer fragrance, but it somehow does have a warm vibe to it. It's intimate and inviting, and honestly, I find it addictive as the wearer; I just keep going back in for a sniff.

After about 15 minutes, the fizziness settles, and the root beer evolves into more of a root beer float, with creamy vanilla stepping forward while the root beer scent is still very much there. I don't get much citrus on my skin. I truly love this fragrance, probably because I have positive childhood associations with root beer. My only wish is that it projected more and lasted longer, but that's a common desire for me with these Acqua di Parma scents.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Wow, this really does smell like root beer. This reminds me of Rogue Smoking EDP by BDK, which has a bit of a medicinal smell to it, this removes that entirely. I've heard many people say that Rogue Smoking smells like Dr Pepper, and it's true, so I guess Dr Pepper with the medicinal smell from it removed is just root beer. I feel like this can be worn anytime, as its not too sweet or fresh. This is also a very affordable fragrance.",07/05/25 15:27,Marocaso
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"love love loveee this! I got it from my mom, and it's a great sweet gourmand that isn't overpowering. It feels very vacation-y and perfect for summer, and the longevity is really great. I put this on in the morning, went to the gym, swam in a chlorinated pool, showered, and could still smell it on myself!

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Despite the name, Mandorlo di Sicilia leans far more orange creamsicle than almond on my skin. I understand the root beer comparisons floating around, but for me, it's a creamy citrus scent. The vanilla here is surprisingly wearable in the heat. Not cloying or heavy, but smoothly blended with the orange, giving it a soft gourmand quality that doesn’t overwhelm.

For a fragrance marketed around almond, I get virtually none of it. It’s also not nearly as feminine as often described; I’d call this firmly unisex. There’s absolutely space here for a man to wear this confidently, especially if he has a taste for gourmand scents as I do.

This isn’t your typical summer fragrance. Rather than reaching for freshness or marine notes, Mandorlo di Sicilia invites closeness. It’s a rare warm-weather gourmand that whispers ""come closer"" instead of projecting loudly.

Speaking of projection: it's subtle. I catch occasional wafts, but it wears close to the skin. Longevity is still unconfirmed, but based on its performance so far, I estimate around 8 hours. Will pick up a full bottle to scratch my gourmand itch in the hotter months.",06/21/25 18:01,averycj

Tolu balsam, white musk, and cedar provide a balanced base to what might otherwise have been an overly sweet perfume. Depending on where you focus your mind, the scent might transport you to artisanal biscotti —or to bubblegum mouthwash (is that the anise?).

It reminds me of summer days, Italy, being a young woman and going out on dates with my English husband, in restaurants and bars in Milan, during the spring and summer, before we got married. It is the most beautiful and elegant almond perfume, no bitterness or flowers. It is sweet but not in a sickly gourmand way. I still use it with the shower gel and body cream, in summer only, as a beautiful and nostalgic treat. I love it.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Testing Mandorlo di Sicilia from a 1.5 ml Aqua di Parma sample. I quite like this scent, I am not going to lie. It’s an EDT concentration, according to the sample card, so I need to manage my expectations accordingly regarding the performance, but the perfume is nice. Different. Distinctive from other perfumes that are heavy on vanilla or almond and I currently have in my collection, which is a plus!

I get mostly from the plethora of notes listed the anise, orange, vanilla, almonds and the peach. It’s a very warm, cozy, comforting type of scent that is very mass appealing and easy to use as a signature fragrance. It has a uniqueness about it which is undeniable.

I like it but I wouldn’t rush to get a bottle. It’s something that’s missing for me in the scent to make me spent my money. Lasts about 4 hours on skin with minimal sillage. It’s interesting but not for me at this moment in my life!",03/20/25 13:03,Maya lilac

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Beautiful almond, vanilla, and anise/licorice. It does give a root beer vibe in the opening. Sweet but not heavy or syrupy, leans feminine. In the late drydown the sweetness feels richer and more dense with vanilla, but it never feels dark. It is not very strong and stays close, though I'm finding most almond dominant scents are not loud.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I quite like this one. It’s not too sweet but scratches the gourmand itch that hits in colder months —while also, I suspect, working for warmer weather. This does smell like an artisanal root beer that’s been made less sweet and more vanilla than the typical Barqs root beer you might find at the store. It’s funny because I got it to have an almond perfume, but this doesn’t really smell like almond to me. It’s more of a sweet, spicy aromatic scent not dissimilar to Moon Milk by Frenshe, though that one leans more winter than this does. I find that it lasts up to 6 hours with low projection after the first hour or so. I prefer that with sweet scents though, otherwise I get tired of them. The perfect gourmand for those generally ambivalent towards them. Try if you like the afor-mentioned Moon Milk, or Sea, Sud, Sun by Versatile Paris, or L’etang Noir by Maison Louis Marie.",01/07/25 06:49,Eau de lys

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"WOAH it smells EXACTLY like rootbeer. Took me right back to this time I was camping in my family's RV at Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Camp-Resorts and there was this very American sports restaurant/bar nearby and I ordered a rootbeer. Literally A&W rootbeer. I love it. If you don't like rootbeer, you won't like this. But it's so fun. I get a small twinge of mint, but that honestly could be the star anise. This feels like that one recipe where people make ""healthy coke"" with random ingredients and it comes together to taste like coke. Does that make any sense

Anyways, after it dries a bit I get more of the fruit and vanilla, and it fades a bit from the rootbeer. No jasmine tbh. What a rollercoaster. A good ride",11/23/24 14:39,bananamiik

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Less floral and sweeter-smoother than Daima Fragonard which has the heliotrope violet and gardenia and so it's to me much lighter ethereal and feminine and its sweetness is more fruity, while this is more unisex and summery. This is bolder and more almond-infused even tho the almond here is a top note, while Daima has the almond more subdued by the other notes despite being a middle note, it's there but more subtle than in this. I like both but Daima has some dusty vibe at times from the sandalwood and the heliotrope which sometimes has a vintage powdery dusty feel along with the sandalwood, while its floral notes kind of overshadow the beauty of almond. This is very very intense so a little goes a long way. It's beautiful and I love the unisex quality it has. I've noticed that anise gives a nutty and solar-warm undertone in perfumes such as Korres Philosia and so it does provide a warm-solar nutty element here pairing nicely with the almond. The ylang ylang is always a solar playful note and makes this very uplifting and happy. It's a fruity summery almond scent that despite its intense almond scent it differs from Hypnotic Poison/sweet hope la rive and the lactonic play doh bomb Police Forbidden. Its fruitiness lasts in the drydown and later on and it becomes more feminine gradually. It's not a sharp heavy scent despite being intense and bold, it's smooth by the vanilla, with moderate warmth from the tolu balsam which is also beautiful and makes the scent rich and decadent. The peach isn't obnoxious as it normally tends to be to me, and here it balances out the citrusy element from the top notes, same as in Daima. Overall full bottle worthy for me and a nice summer treat for lovers of Hypnotic Poison and Police Forbidden which I consider more heady perfumes and winter-appropriate while this is perfect for summer to me and day time wear too. I love the bottle also and since I'm Mediterranean from Greece, our neighbors love almond as much as we do and this scent reminds me of my fav island Spetses where we spent some summers and my fav sweet was the almond sweet delight of Spetses the traditional Greek dessert of the island with almond and rosewater - it was the perfect dessert for the greek summer without the heavy ingredients of most desserts. We sometimes had it with ouzo the anise drink that ppl relate to the Italian sambuca but ours has some differences so the anise note here makes total sense to me.",10/08/24 13:12,sassa7
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Mandorlo di Sicilia is a soft spiced, vanilla based, almonds perfume. For a perfume with the name almond in the name, I was expecting it to be mostly focused on almonds but I can smell easily in here mandarines, anise star, vanilla, some un descriptive warm flowers and balsams. It’s much more complex than I was expecting judging by the name. I say that being pleasantly surprised, not with disappointment.

I like Mandorlo di Sicilia. Would I get it for full price? No, for sure! Again, performance is the issue for me. It’s moderate like all the Aqua’s de Palma I have sampled so far and unfortunately I live in the cold North where these lightweight fragrances get lost most of the times in the crisp air.
But I see the appeal of this working perfectly fine in the warmer climate of the South of Europe or other warm/tropical areas.

It’s a good one if you love a sweet, spicy vanilla based scent that features heavily the almond note. Aqua di Parma is doing something really good with this blue line.",10/04/24 10:20,Maya lilac

I've never been to Sicily but I can imagine it might smell like that where almonds grow. Oleander flowers smell similarly, too.
It reminds me of Dragée by Reminiscence which is more gourmand, of La Dompteuse Encage by Serge Lutens which is more floral and of Devotion by D&G which is more chemical and sweeter. Today it was too uneventful, I'm changing my love to like.",08/15/24 03:48,MademoiselleMaya

The opening notes of star anise, bergamot, and orange blossom create a sweet, citrusy introduction that is both inviting and uplifting. As the fragrance evolves, the heart reveals a creamy blend of green almond and ylang-ylang, evoking the scent of Sicilian marzipan.

The base notes of cedarwood, vanilla, and white musk add a comforting, lasting warmth that lingers beautifully on the skin. The longevity is impressive, easily lasting throughout the day, while the sillage is moderate, leaving a gentle, memorable trail.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Okay honestly I kind of get the root beer float comparisons, but MOSTLY, this smells to me like almond extract made into perfume. Literally as soon as I sprayed it, it smelled like I was sniffing a bottle of almond extract, but without the sharp alcohol that you get from that.

The best way I can describe this scent is if you got a whiff of almond extract in your kitchen after making vanilla shortbread cookies 6 hours ago. You really get more of that gourmand 'almond cookie' smell in the air, while you get a hint of the star anise if you smell this directly off of your hand or wherever you applied it (I always apply on the back of my hand the first time I try a perfume).

This to me is the definition of gourmand and I'm now realizing is one of the only ""true gourmands"" that I've ever tried. I can literally almost taste it. Beautiful stuff, if you like almond cookies or the smell of almond extract you will LOVE this. I don't think it's overly sweet at all but that's purely subjective and up to personal preference and sweetness tolerance, of course. Having purchased a 5oz bottle with about 4.25oz remaining for $50 off marketplace, I'm a very happy man. For the money I paid, this is an insane deal but even for the money Jomashop is charging for the full 5oz bottle, it's still an amazing price IMO.

Projection is STRONG for the first half hour to an hour. One spray on the back of my hand completely filled my space (I was in the car at the time, which probably contributed, since my hand was closer in proximity to my face than it usually would be just walking around), and surrounded me in a delicious scent cloud on my drive home. After that first hour, it mellows out and has probably a half foot of projection but like I said, you will continue to get whiffs of it in the air. Even though the perfume itself is not super strong on my skin after two hours, I'm still smelling it in the air which to me is a positive sign. Great for going out for errands, maybe even for wearing to sleep or just around the house.

I know low longevity is viewed as a negative by most of the community, who want something that will last all day, but it becomes irritating for me at times. A lot of the time, I want to be able to spray something in the morning and apply something else entirely in the evening depending on how I'm feeling then. Super strong perfumery makes this difficult and while I love a long-lasting perfume, I'm starting to find a lot of joy in perfumes like this that light up your world and give you the smell you're craving for a couple hours and then allow you to move on.",03/20/24 08:58,LePianoMan

Something you might enjoy on a small yacht off the coast of Amalfi. Small batch soda with less sugar and more anise, vanilla bean gelato, blazing hot sun but a cool oceanic breeze ruffling your big sun hat. The most dominant notes are certainly the vanilla, green almond and anise - but are followed closely by the Ylang Ylang, peach and something warm and a little bitter/earthy grounding it all … probably the tolu balsam.

I also get black jujube from this. I love it! A unique summer gourmand.",03/18/24 02:56,marietangerine
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Pretty exotic cologne to wear if you're a guy. I love it! I get why some other dudes wouldn't wear this, but I do because it fits my personality. It's really hard to pull off a gourmand fragrance for the summer, but this one gets the job done. Performance is lackluster on my skin, so I recommend you to get a bigger bottle (150 ml) so you can reapply it during the day. I would buy it again because it smells so unique and natural, like creamy vanilla and green almonds.",03/12/24 11:05,Luis009
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I blind bought a 150ml. I know. That was dumb.
It got such good reviews though, except for the longevity which I can overlook because I bought such a large bottle and I really wanted a nice quality vanilla in my newly forming collection.
On first spray I thought, this smells like wintergreen, which in my mind the only thing that smells like wintergreen is Pepto Bismol.
Then I re-read some reviews that said it smelled like rootbeer. Now I'm thinking, yes, I can get that.
Then I saw one that says it is like a creamy rootbeer float. Now, yes, I can get that too.
So weird.
I'm not mad that it doesn't last that long.",03/11/24 15:18,Iconic'80s

it’s an edt so it’s not in your face but you get little wafts through out the day.",07/30/23 10:58,emilyjxne
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"The root beer (or for non-U.S folks like myself, dandelion and burdock or sarsparilla soda) vibe sitting atop a sweet and creamy almond and vanilla, is unique in such a summery perfume. It’s sweet and light and undeniably pretty, but the medicinal feel of the spices are definitely an acquired taste. I like it, but probably not enough to invest in a full bottle.

I’ve had Dragée from the Notes Gourmand range by Reminiscence and that one isn’t as interesting as this and it’s sweeter and more powdery. I don’t think this really smells like Green Lover by Lolita Lempicka as that’s fresher and more zingy. The unusual scent in that one is less root beer and more gin and tonic…. It’s got a bitter tannin bite rather than an antiseptic one. It’s Root Beer mixed with Cream Soda like @N|ne said!

I feel like this is closest over all to Dior’s Hypnotic Poison, in that it’s sweet and almondy but has that root beer-like scent that persists throughout the wear. Mandorlo di Sicilia seems like the perfect summer perfume for anybody who loves HP in colder weather!",07/20/23 10:57,Skinscents4Fusspots

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I fell for this one hard after a friend gave me a decant, and now I have several bottles.

It’s a strong vanilla almond on me with star anise as a supporting player. I have no idea why this gives off a root beer or soda scent but it does and I’m here for it. It’s more than that of course, but I love the entirety of it. It doesn’t remind me of any (so far) in the “reminds me of” section. It’s so unique to me.

In my California Mediterranean climate and on my normal to dry skin, I get wonderful strong sillage, and it lasts on my skin almost 24 hours, until I take my next shower. Sure it’s a skin scent by then, but it’s still a strong skin scent. Before that I get 3-6 feet of sillage. I hope they never stop making this!",07/04/23 06:00,Carpe Noctem

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I’m in my third day of sampling this perfume along with the rest of the Blu Mediterraneo line.

I was immediately drawn to this because to my nose it is HIGHLY reminiscent of Diptyque Eau Duelle which I adore. Same sweet but dry vanilla smell that permeates the entire wear.

Outside of the initial spritz, I don’t get much citrus but I’m continuing to test as it could just be nose fatigue. It’s sweet and definitely feels like a gourmand to me, but it’s not heavy at all. Feels especially great for the late days of spring/early days of summer where there’s sun but still cooler temps. I’m excited to test in the heat. It wears close to the skin and is inviting.

It’s also the longest wearing of the BM group. That’s not necessarily saying much, but it leaves a much longer impression than the other scents so far, particularly Fico di Amalfi and Arancia di Capri.

So far I’m enjoying this a lot but am not sure if it’s full bottle worthy. I just can’t tell if I love this on myself as much as I love to smell it around me.",06/07/23 11:25,Fine_Bovine

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"2024 Update: After having experienced how it behaves on fabric and skin in the summer heat…I started loving it. I also regularly layer it w L’Occitane Eau de Baux, which works really well.

2023: When a friend who lost interest in it gave me his 30 ml, I really wanted to love it. But so far I get associations with 1970’s suntan and other cosmetics. Somehow it feels like it never knows what the right time or place is for itself :/

Still winter here so I haven’t tried it in warm weather yet; maybe it becomes really sexy when all you need to wear is a T-shirt, I’m hoping that’s the case.

Either way this is not a comfortable transporting easy almond/vanill to me (like my beloved Etro Heliotrope is); something feels off. So interesting how differently we perceive these things.",02/25/23 23:27,Dad's Sweater

The vanilla is pretty strong for the first half hour on me, and then the star anise just takes over and for the rest of the wear it’s liquorice and cedar. This makes me headachey and feel sick.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Imagine taking a stroll through a Christmas market in Central Europe - the scent of warm roasted almonds coated in powdered sugar mingles with the aroma of vanilla chimney cakes and anise cookies. For the past 8 years Mandorlo di Sicilia has been my scent of choice for the Advent season - warm, cozy and delicious. This is a true gourmand without a trace of synthetics. Lasts for about 6 hours and stays close to the skin but I don't mind reapplying.
I've worn it in summer too but it felt out of season. It is at Christmas when it is truly beautiful. A great day scent to wear while gift shopping and baking the traditional Czech almond vanilla rolls and the other 20+ kinds of cookies.",12/07/22 22:56,Vanilla violin
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"If I were told this only had 3 notes, I'd believe it... the almond, star anise, and vanilla are the major notes. This is an easy reach scent. Inoffensive & appropriate for most weather and occasions. It wears close to the skin and is practically impossible to overspray. After 2 hours it's only a skin scent, but continues to linger about 6 hours. I agree with the comparisons to Rouge Smoking due to the ""soda"" vibe of this scent, but Rouge's sillage is much better (as it should be for the price). You could also picture Jean Paul Gaultier Classique having a baby with Kilian Love Don't Be Shy. Overall, it's a pleasant, spicy almond scent to throw on when you're not trying to make a statement.",11/28/22 13:25,hola gigi
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"It can be a little difficult to find yummy, cozy gourmands that work really well in the heat of summer. Mandorlo di Sicilia is one that smells amazing in the summer. It is airy and fresh and smells like a cross between and almond cookie and a fizzy rootbeer.

The opening is fizzy rootbeer for me. It is sweet, spicy and effervescent. As it dries on the skin the effervescence goes away and I start to smell the almond and it transitions from fizzy rootbeer to spiced almond cookie. Sometimes the scent transitions fairly quickly, within an hour. Other times the rootbeer stage last 2-3 hours. I love both phases, so I am happy to enjoy both of them

I wear this most often in the summer, but it's beautiful all year and it usually makes it into the rotation in cooler weather as well. It is a pretty unisex fragrance, but does lean a little more to the feminine side
The first time I smelled this fragrance I was transported back to my childhood. There must have been a hair/skin/body care product that share a similar profile, because this is how my grandpa smelled on Sunday morning going to church. My grandpa has been gone a long time, so everytime I wear this I am reminded of one of the kindest, gentlest, funny men I ever knew. I'm sure at least part of my love for this fragrance comes from that.

The performance of this fragrance is so much better than I expected. The Blu Mediterraneo line is not known for it's performance, but Mandorlo di Sicilia lasts all day and has a deceptively strong projection. I have been complimented wearing this most times I wear it. Even when everyone was wearing masks I was complimented by a cashier behind plexiglass, wearing a mask. I can smell it all around myself most of the day when I am wearing it, at leats 8-10 hours.

I have a couple other fragrances that share some similarities with this one, but Mandorlo di Sicilia is my favourite.
Lolita Lempicka Green Lover is a bit similar, but it is a bit heavier and leans more green. It is also a bit more masculine. It may be an good choice for anyone that finds this one a bit too feminine, but want something similar. The drydown of Nishane Ani is also similar, but it is the deeper, heavier version.

The ADP Blu Mediterraneo bottles are a beautiful cobalt blue. The bottle has a generous sprayer and I only need to apply 3-4 sprays for excellent performance.
The retail price of this line is pretty steep, but Mandorlo di Sicilia is an excellent fragrance with solid performance and attractive packaging. Tester bottles are often available for a steal and are an excellent choice for anyone on a bit of a budget.",11/23/22 15:14,takema

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Oh my goodness! This is beautiful! Warm and inviting and not overly sweet. This is wonderful!!
This was a blind buy because I purchased the big 5 oz. bottle on sale and I am thrilled to say it is a hit!!

Masterfully blended, the notes are working together to create a warm and cozy feeling. I personally think that this would work all year long regardless of the seasons, of course, this is only my humble opinion. There is florals, fruits, vanilla and woods and it works perfectly well on my skin (I cannot tell you how happy that makes me ✨😆✨)!!

All in all, an excellent purchase, a wonderful scent and a happy me!!",09/26/22 18:20,Dramaloladiva
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I agree with this being described as ""fresh"" and find it to be a fresh woody gourmand. It's almost like vanilla mint ice cream, or a root beer float, from the start and develops into a cedar-balsam based Jordan almond scent after a while. Sort of collectively reminds me of teaberry, which is a Pennsylvania-centric flavor made from a wintergreen plant, thus has a bit of a minty flavor, and is often an ice cream flavor at PA ice cream parlors (and where I'm from). At the same time, I do sense the anise and almond and see how that translates to a sort of minty-herbal sort of smell. Reminds me a tad of candy-coated fennel seeds as well (fennel seeds and anise give off a similar vibe in my opinion, although less licoricey in fennel seeds). It is largely a vanilla scent when all is said and done with hints of the aforementioned. Not a rich or heavy vanilla, but a chilled vanilla that is not at all overpowering on even the hottest of days. I used up an 8 mL travel spray of it and found it to be quite long lasting on my oily-leaning skin, especially in the summer. It made me feel yummy smelling, yet clean, and sort of classy while also wearable for work and the outdoors. Maybe I'm partial to this scent also because my grandparents on my dad's side are from Sicily and Calabria and feel a sort of connection to it in that way also. I want to get a full bottle of this at some point!",09/26/22 10:47,who.am.i.you
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I don’t really understand the hype about this one, I assume it’s because many people enjoy powdery sweet nutty vanilla scents, but to me all I get with this one is a heavily sweetened almond flour with a good amount of icing sugar and vanilla powder and some fruity notes and a bit of woods.
Not bad, I would wear it if it was given to me but really not something I would personally buy.
I was really hoping for some amaretto or almond granita, but there is none of that dark bitterness here, just a bright gourmand powdery vibe, perhaps even slightly cloying at times.",09/24/22 05:56,derby2169

(It also makes this smell like root beer to many at the start; anise fades away within 15-20 mins, and the almond tree because the star.) Blends well with everything from boozy Angel's Share for a date night, to any citrus MFK or a soft peach (eg Peche Cardinal) for a hot summer day. Much less sweet than some of my other favorite nut/vanillas, like Xerjoff's Italica. This is a classic and a crowd-pleaser for such good reason.

Suitable for all weather and occasions. Never cloying, not masc or fem, just perfecto. The almond comes off green (mandorlo means almond tree) which keeps it in perfect balance with the vanilla, not becoming too sweet. Projection is enough for it be noticeable yet inoffensive.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Probably my fav from the entire house.

It's a well-balanced gourmand, not cloying as the usual ADP style. It opens with an orange, kinda play-doughy. But it gets better as it drys down. I mostly pick up was vanilla, lots of vanilla - soft, creamy and adds a hint of sweetness. It reminds me of BDK Rouge Smoking a lot. The vanilla is well blended in the almond, which is the same type I find in Rose D'amalfi. This is more wearable than D'amalfi as that one is too dense and can choke the wearer sometimes.",08/05/22 21:46,hsiangchi.huang

Then after that it settles to just a nice vanilla. It surprised me with how long it lasted on me, like 10 hours as a skin scent. I might consider buying a full bottle but honestly I think it would serve the same purpose for me as Kayali Vanilla 28 which I already have. For a more recognizable Almond, I’m also sampling Comptoire Sud Pacifique Eclats d’Amande which gives me something more distinguishable from pure vanilla.

I mostly get the almond and the anise, and I have to search a little for the other notes-- but those two are so great together, they're creamy and slightly warm without being stifling, and they mix so well together but you can still smell both. I was a little scared of this perfume because I don't like licorice, but this doesn't smell like licorice, it smells like fresh anise, with that deep, slight fruitiness that's so smooth but sharp enough to be noticed.",06/29/22 09:29,onlythesun321

This eau de toilette, though rich in the kind of notes that heat can turn sickening, was an incredibly light companion to those languorous summer days. Doused in it after going to the pool, the balsam cooled my chlorinated, sunburnt skin. Mingling with cigarette smoke as we whiled away the nights at long dinners.

I just love the first few sprays of this scent - I can practically hear the fizz from the root beer as the scoop of vanilla ice cream drops into the glass. It's so bright and fizzy and delicious! After it settles, the root beer becomes quiet and it turns into a sunny almond-vanilla that - while gourmand - is definitely wearable in the heat of summer. I do wish it lasted longer, but reapply and there comes the root beer again, which to me is not a bad thing.

So often a fragrance I enjoy just doesn't work with my body chemistry or I absolutely love the opening and it turns on me later on. I'm also a fan of vanilla fragrances but wanted something I could wear throughout the summer that wasn't too heavy and this was it. The almond, the anise, the vanilla, it's exceptional and I'm sold.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Folks don't let you be scared off by mk6699,
This is NOT WEAK.
Although the fragrances in the Blue Mediterraneo line are no heavy performers, unlike mk6699 is claiming, Mandorlo is a fairly good performer. Only Ginepro in the line performs better. You should get 5-6 hours out of it. This is not a skin scent either.
Unlike the rest of the line, I don't find Mandorlo a Summer fragrance. It is a bit too sweet for that. More Spring. It is though the most versatile of the line. You can wear it all year round. That was the reason I bought it as one of the first in this line.
At that time I owned and loved the Colonia line, of which I owned 3, now 4. I also had the Bergamotto di Calabria. They are all Summer/Spring fragrances.
But in the end I just don't like the combination of Almond & Citrus. I prefer Guerlain Homme Ideal Parfum kind of Almond. Real sweet and winter cozy.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Was smelling Acqua di Parma in a store with a friend and honestly not paying too much attention, until I put my nose on this. WHY HAVE I NEVER HEARD ABOUT THIS BEFORE?!

I've been looking for a gourmand-ish summer scent, and I believe THIS. IS. IT.

First thing I get is root beer with some star anise. In the best way possible.
I pick up the citruses and peach, but never get much of the florals. To me, that's a good thing ;)
Drydown is much more almond/vanilla, but in a kind of dry way. Sweet, but not sticky and very natural smelling.
Very pleasant and comforting. Great to wear to bed.

Great now in springtime, but I think it'll work all year round, and I can't wait to try it in the summertime. Think it'll be great for hot summer nights.",04/04/22 23:01,Zoffe
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Mandorlo di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"This reminds me of ricciarelli (chewy almond meringue cookies with orange zest) and a root beer.

At first sniff I get the star anise, vanilla and almond but also some bergamot in the background. It does give off a bit of a medicinal root beer smell in the beginning and I do get why people call it minty, it's the star anise I think but it's not a cold strong mint but more of a sweet mint.

As the star anise calms down a bit the vanilla and orange begins to take over. Someone said orange tic tacs and I think that's pretty accurate. The peach hangs out a bit in the background but it is not the star of the show here. The ylang ylang is there too but very discreet. As the cedar and musk arrives the scent is basically gone.

Almond can sometimes be a hit or miss for me in fragrances but I think they really nailed it in this one, it's beautiful.

I do really love it and I have nothing like it in my collection but the projection and longevity leaves a lot to be desired and it's basically gone after 1-2 hours. I have a sample but I might get a bottle if I find a good deal on it, I don't know if I think it's really worth it for full price.

Update: So i've worn this to bed for a couple of nights now and it's just so beautiful, I love it! And I've realized that the longevity is better than I previously thought, nothing crazy but it's pretty good and lasts around 6-7 hours on my skin but it wears very close to the skin.

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I can understand why people like this scent, but its not one of my favorites from the house. Its fresh, with a watery mandarin orange citrus profile, but that and the spearmint are actually quite intense. Its scent profile just doesn't strike me as pleasant as my house favorites - Ginepro di Sardegna, Arancia di Capri, Fico di Amalfi, OG Colonia, Colonia Essenza, Cedro di Taormina, Mirto di Panarea, and Chinotto di Liguria.",08/04/25 20:41,JmThms

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is truly unisex; both men and women will enjoy the scent after applying it. It has a vibrant aroma reminiscent of organic mandarin in 4K, which alone can lift your spirits. However, you will need to reapply it every couple of hours. While this may seem inconvenient, the appealing scent makes it worthwhile, as it's quite addictive during its opening, even though it has a short half-life.

I wouldn't recommend purchasing this if your collection fits on a single shelf. This fragrance is ideal for avid fragrance enthusiasts looking to add something unique to their collection, but its cost doesn't match its longevity. Personally, I love it, being a fragrance junkie myself, so take my opinion for what it’s worth.

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,Initial spray is sweeter than I expected; mostly candied mandarin and lemon. Honestly smells a bit like bathroom cleaner to me. Some spearmint as it settles.

Photorealistic mandarine peel unfrotunately fades away after 10 or 15 minutes and then it goes straight into salty, screechy and bitter citruses. Longevity and sillage are both far above average for this category, but the scent itself is not so pleasant as you might imagine, when you read its pyramid. Not for me.",05/17/25 09:30,sergbkp
Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"This is such a fresh, bright, and sparkly clean citrus fragrance with little minty, green and woody undertones that give it a little base without taking away from its bright uplifting nature. The biggest surprise is how natural and photorealistic it smells for the price.

Can be worn anywhere however it feels like wearing this to work would be doing it a disservice as this fragrance evokes feelings of happiness, carefree freedom and fun while being out and about on sunny warm days. This aspect mixed with its affordability gives something like this a chance to stand out even in more expensive collections.

You can save your more expensive stuff for work, dates, and more serious outings and feel free spraying away with this on your off day daytime runs to the store or mall or just being out and about while enjoying a sunny day.

Looking forward to trying more from this house.",05/14/25 06:33,Primal38

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"The drydown of this is a bit masculine, in my opinion. I normally don't have a problem wearing citrus frags with petitgrain or mint, so I think it's the patchouli. I prefer the Mandarino di Sicilia by Perris Monte Carlo or Guerlain's Mandarine Basilic for a much more photorealistic and solidly unisex orange experience.",04/21/25 08:37,Willowthewisp
Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I blind bought this because I had smelled Tom Ford’s Mandarino di Amalfi in-store and completely fell for it—but it was just too overpriced for what it was. When I heard Acqua di Parma released Mandarino di Sicilia, I figured it could scratch that same itch, and honestly… it kinda does.

The opening is super bright and sharp in a good way—like that feeling when you eat pineapple and it almost stings your tongue. It’s this punchy mix of green mandarin and bitter orange that feels so alive and fresh, like sun hitting citrus peel. There’s also this clean minty coolness underneath (spearmint, I think) that adds this breezy effect without smelling like toothpaste.

Compared to Amalfi, this one is definitely more linear and more citrus-focused. No florals or deeper base. And yeah, it doesn’t last that long on skin—maybe 3-5 hours max unless you go heavy or spray on clothes. But honestly? It smells really clean, natural, and expensive in a way that a lot of citrus scents don’t.

If you’re expecting it to be a 1:1 dupe of Tom Ford’s version, it’s not. But if you just want that bright, luxe citrus energy without dropping €250, this is a really solid summer daily driver. I’ll definitely keep wearing it in warm weather.",04/15/25 12:36,PaulRDE

I fell in love with it over any of the others from the blu line. I wish I tested it a bit more however. Unfortunately I got some negative reactions from some family members, they couldn't understand the Italian summer aesthetic that this fragrance gives (which is ironic because my family is Italian). They said it smells like cleaning product, which, I can slightly see now. Its slightly off putting, I wish it had a more musky vibe to it.

I normally steer clear from linear, citrus fragrances- but the smell of a mandarin peel was so visceral on my skin that it made me chuckle a little. I truly enjoy this, very fresh and uplifting! I don’t get a lot of mint on my skin, but that’s fine. The juicy mandarine is super strong!

I was pleasantly surprised with the sillage and longevity too, very few fresh fragrances last more than 5+ hours on me. Beautiful and refreshing.

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"This is a very accurate rendition of the mandarin orange imo. Smells like I'm smelling the real thing. They managed to make it perform good (for a citrus) without making it smell like chemical fixatives (looking at you arancia la spugnatura flanker). I love this brand but their releases such as the newest Colonia Club have been absolute garbage, and not befitting of a brand with this heritage and pedigree.

I mean come on, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepbern wore ADP and you release this new club that smells like a worse made copy of Armani Code?
But I digress, this one is more befitting of the quality I expect from the house. If you like Arancia but hate that it only lasts 20 minutes, give this a try. If you are obsessed with performance get the arancia flanker or don't wear citrus dominant fragrances because you'll always be disappointed. You cannot have natural and strong performance in this category, you pick one or the other. Here, you'll get 6ish hours which is very good for a natural smelling citrus.

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Tried the entire Blu Mediterraneo line at the airport yesterday, this one was my favourite. I like the bittersweet smell of mandarins.",05/31/24 02:05,Gray44
Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"A strange fragrance, halfway between Chinotto di Liguria and Arancia di Capri in terms of Acqua di Parma's orange fragrances, without particularly smelling like either. This certainly seems to take some of the dull, watery, cool and woody patchouli from Chinotto that makes up a bulk of that fragrance. It doesn't have the same engulfing effect as Chinotto, however, and is nicely balanced by the green freshness of the cedar. This smells mostly like a mids and base-heavy fragrance to me, with little in the way of a true top note - where is the mandarin? Where is the citrus? It's a good question. There's certainly sweetness, and a dash of spice, which at times conjures the bitter zest of citrus peel. The citric accord is something closer to a cordial or maybe even something like Sunny D - a slightly viscous, synthetic, but evocative and undoubtedly also familiar kind of citric smell that nestles on top of the bed of cool, watery, woody greenery. To be honest, this comes across as a woody fragrance to me - particularly cedar, but also broadly coniferous in a general sense. It's not bad at all in that regard, and reminds me of the fresh smell of new growth cedar needles when you crush them between your fingers - the smell can be almost lemon-like, slightly camphorous, sharp, bitter, along with the pencil shaving or wood chip type aroma that comes with the note. I think it works well. It lacks the cloying and monotonous use of petitgrain that Arancia di Capri suffers from, and although it's less immediate and perhaps even less pleasant than the sweet and juicy note of Arancia, I suspect in the long term this may be a more rewarding wear. This doesn't seem like a crowd pleaser, though. This is cool, confident, not a mass pleaser, and surprisingly niche in its approach. At times, more of a citrus feel comes out when smelled at a distance, and the impression of mandarin or bitter orange is more apparent. The mint, which had played its part in adding the camphorous quality to the green woodyness, starts to become more aromatic and obvious over time as well. It seems quite lovely, and less challenging, when this happens. Plenty of white, slightly shrieky musk and synthetic fabric-likearomachemicals prop up the fragrance, which is only obvious when digging your nose in closely after it has settled. This is the most interesting fragrance Acqua di Parma have made for a while. I wonder who will wear this, who will love it? As I say, it is a strange fragrance, but that is by no means a bad thing. Lovers of Annick Goutal and perhaps some of the older niche houses ought to try this. It lacks some of the complexity and development of the earlier niche fragrances but seems to be doing something stylistically similar. Overall, I'd call this a success.",05/30/24 03:42,heracles
Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"More convincing than Arancia di Capri (but still close), the illusion of the whole tangerin is prolongated with the woody/musky background and some spiciness (cardamom ?). I don't get any mint in this one. Doesn't feel as synthetic as Arancia La Spugnatura.
Longevity is quite good.
I would have preferred a more juicy vivid opening (like bergamotto, chinotto or bergamotto la spugnatura) but i find it technically very well done.",05/27/24 03:12,MouetteExtreme
Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"I really don't understand why ADP refuses to release anything outside of its Colonia, Blu Mediterraneo, or Signatures of the Sun lines. Why not FINALLY create an all new, standalone fragrance? Something that performs well and might actually catch interest in the fragrance community and bring ADP to the forefront. Right now, they're known as the ""pleasant, eau de cologne Italian company that makes hotel scents"". Where's the showstopper?",05/22/24 12:13,agonzony
Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"Spearmint gum laced orange popsicle . And a sprig of petitgrain (lemony leaves/twigs) . Like perhaps a mint-forward interpretation of Eau de Rochas Homme replacing the basil.

This is quite effervescent in the opening, and a bit more dated in its greenness and sweetness (late 80’s / early 90’s) - think more Aramis New West for Him and Escape, as opposed to say Versace Eros.

Ironically enough, my mind also went to A*Men Ultra Zest and Tauer’s Orange Star as more “contemporary” fragrances - this never going too thick nor heavy nor too sweet. And perhaps a nod to a more “natural” Cedro di Diamante .

Very orange, very green, slightly sweet, slightly off-putting, slightly entrancing . Better than Futura? For me, yes - a perhaps slight return-to-form.

*update: wife purchased this for me after finding a t-shirt in the hamper that kept the fragrance for a few days - asked me what it was, and immediately went online. Very happy summer ahead!

As an aside:

Tomlaf188 (below) notes coriander - to me, fresh coriander is better represented in Aqua Media; however, I will concede this ADP does hint at the cilantro vibe of Live Jazz - sweetness and all. So 188’s impression is quite apt.

As an aside #2:
heracles (above) references Annick Goutal fragrances in relation to this fragrance and I wholeheartedly agree - and appreciate hercales opening my eyes to that correlation. Certainly there is a bit of a nod to the tip-of-the-tongue Eau d’Hadrien EDP, but also to the lesser-referenced Un Matin d’Orage EDP in its water-drenched opening. Very eye-opening citrus. Very apt correlation, indeed, especially to Goutal’s creaminess found specifically in the EDP blends (compared to the EDT blends)",05/20/24 23:00,beardy

I thought I would love this, the notes sound right up my street, but the opening ruined it for me. It was almost urine-like on my skin, something very strange about it which overpowers the mint.

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"It's petitgrain and spearmint forward. Green mandarin is unripe but manages to provide some fruitiness to it. Among ADP's greenest fragrances, alongside Cipresso and Ginepro. This one is a brighter, fresher green than those two. At first, I wasn't a fan but it's grown on me in the last 20 minutes. Becomes a bit more creamy and rounder as time goes on, but not by much. The opening is too green and soapy for my taste, so I wish they rounded it out a little more in the dry down. Although, overall, I like smelling this, the way I might like looking at a piece of art, I can't imagine ever wanting to smell LIKE this. However, I will say that this is so much more interesting and commendable than what ADP has been putting out for the past couple of years. They haven't released a memorable fragrance in years, and nothing that's catching any interest in the fragrance community. Doubt this will either.",05/11/24 08:28,agonzony

Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma,"There is a lot more going on here than I expected. It opens with mandarin peel but the spearmint is also very noticeable (almost dominant). It’s all happening on top of the earthy patchouli in the background and it’s really quite enjoyable. As it develops, the fragrance becomes thicker and somewhat ‘pulpier’ if that’s a word. To me, it actually becomes slightly creamy with the mandarin taking centre stage again (accompanied by the blood orange). Overall, I really enjoy the opening but not sure about the drydown. I also agree with a previous reviewer who said this could almost be a little too dense for the summer. In terms of sillage, this seems to sit quite close to the skin, however, it definitely has better longevity than other fragrances in the line such as Arancia di Capri.",05/06/24 15:47,Terbium

Colonia Assoluta In Villa Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Assoluta In Villa is a really lovely perfume. It projects moderately for a few hours before becoming a skin scent some two or three hours after application. It opens with woody notes, citruses and spices as per the notes. The citruses are on the orange and lemon part of the citrus family. There's some cypress in the woods and so it gives the perfume a hint of a beautiful furniture polish (in a very good way). The feel is indeed that of walking around a well designed garden of a country house but with an extra flowery touch that the notes don't immediately suggest. Colonia Assoluta In Villa is perfectly named.

Some two hours later the decline in strength begins. The scent is fairly stable, fairly linear, and remains so throughout. Another two hours later the decline in strength is more notable. Eight hours in and there's just a tiny bit left. By nine hours after application it's all gone.

I don't see a particularly strong link to Colonia Assoluta here so if you're looking for a version of that you've come to the wrong place. However, I think this would work during the day at any time of year. Whilst spring is the most obvious time for this one, I would assert that summer and early autumn would work well, and that if you were inside, why not the rest of the year?

Given its rarity (only 26 Fragranticans have it, according to the database, at the time of writing) I don't expect to get my hands on any more, certainly not a full bottle. I shall enjoy this fleeting elegant creation and bid it a fond farewell when my supply runs out fairly soon.

EDIT: Coming back to this a week later, the same amount of sprays in the same places from the same distance has yielded a longevity of about 15 hours on the left arm and almost 24 hours on the right arm! A very welcome surprise!",03/12/21 16:22,mutatismutandis

Both are beautiful fragrances, the kind you'd smell at a country club. Scent-wise, the vintage version is dryer, more mature, and perhaps commanding more respect. The reinterpretation is sweeter, softer and more modern. Think of it this way. You go to a country club and there's a fine gentleman in his 50s, and his 25 years old son. Both are dressed for their age. The more seasoned gentleman if wearing the vintage CLUB, while his son is wearing C.L.U.B.
If you can get your hands on the old version, get it. And add the new one to your collection as well. They don't exclude each other, neither do they complete each other. They're simply two very beautiful fragrances that should be in any modern gentleman's collection.",08/18/25 10:09,cypriant

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Started as 8/10 fresh aromatic after shavey perfume
but with an ambery under tone when I first bought it. However, after leaving it in my closet for 2 weeks it developed this harsh and unpleasant and pungent “black lime” (sun dried lime) spicy note mixed with brown sugar that is present all around like something fermented within it. The same thing happened with my blu de Chanel

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I don't agree that this is ""very minty"". There is definitely mint in it, but it's well blended into the composition. There's nothing mentholated or toothpaste-like about it. As someone else stated, it's not quite a fougere, but sort of a fresh/modern version of one. I think it's successful as a crowd-pleaser while giving something unique. Sort of like Diptyque's Eau de Minthé, which is also a ""neo-fougere"" replacing lavender with rose, Colonia Club adds mint and tones down the lavender.
Looks like AdP is releasing Buongiorno next week, which looks to have similar notes. Looking forward to trying it.",03/02/25 09:55,Keemun
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This was one of my first full bottles. I haven’t worn it in many months because at some point, after getting deep into vintage and niche, some of my early stuff started feeling jarring. Now that I have a more experienced nose and a better vocabulary, I can pinpoint what had put me off. And I can also go back to and rediscover these early loves; maybe even fall for them all over again.

Colonia Club was clearly a departure from the citrus eau de cologne style that characterized most of AdP’s variations of the original Colonia. This one seems like an homage to a certain kind of sporty green Italian masculine of the Pino Silvestre/Acqua di Selva variety, though it doesn’t quite reach fougère territory (some claim that it contains a dose of coumarin in the base, in which case it could qualify).

The proposal is straightforward: a super bracing, woody aromatic composition with MINT (in all caps) at the center. This thing is so invigoratingly cooling that the opening actually stings, sort of like the icy half of Icy Hot, in a manner not dissimilar to the sensation of aftershave slapped on open pores (think Kevin in Home Alone). I personally love this. What follows is green, aromatic, slightly citrusy, and somewhat floral, featuring neroli, geranium, and, of course, lavender.

The galbanum (Galbanol) makes its presence felt throughout. In the drydown, the vetiver and a salty “ambergris” accord (some kind of woody amber) come to the fore, rendering a pseudo-aquatic (as in marine) impression. I guess this is what put me off for a while, giving it what I felt was a “mainstream”, “boring”, “synthetic” feel. But I’ve come around (almost) full circle. I can appreciate this kind of composition, a modernized riff on a classic, more than before. I can now see the trajectory much more clearly. And I dig it!

Colonia Club feels balanced, elegant, and modern. Frequently compared to Green Irish Tweed (for a fraction of the price) and Cool Water (though more robust and less synthetic), it’s a simple affair that gets the job done. And it’s just right for a crisp, sunny day, under a pressed shirt and a blazer, like today.",01/26/25 19:00,hedonistaustero

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I will preface this by saying that I’m not entirely sure that my decant from Fragrancenet is this version or the C.L.U.B. version as it mixes the two together on the same page on the size-selection bar, however, the image used for the travel spray decant shows this original Club.

This is a very minty, green fragrance that approaches things a bit differently than I was expecting. With mint, I usually expect a brisk, airy mint smell—if I were to describe it as a color it would be white—that’s somewhat dry. However, Colonia Club is a much thicker, darker, and slightly sweet mint, akin to the thick mint note of Versace Eros. It’s very green and heavy, like a sweet mint bubblegum in a way. That being said, it’s a gentlemanly scent that brings to mind the image of a soft-spoken older man who dresses sharply, even when casual.

It’s a pleasant scent in general, but sadly it was not what I am looking for for a minty spring—or especially summer—scent. Too dense, dark green, and heavy for warmer weather in my opinion. The neroli, lavender, and geranium don’t help, only lending a floral haziness to the whole composition. With only a couple sprays of a travel atomizer, I found it a bit cloying and overwhelming during just temperate weather. It’s nice on its own, but I didn’t really enjoy actually wearing it, sadly.",12/10/24 10:00,TipTopNotes

Still, got about a good 4 hours before it became a skin scent. For sure, the performance will be amped up on hot days.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I recently discovered a new, affordable perfume that has quickly become my go to choice for the gym. Encre Noire Sport by Lalique had been a long-standing favorite, but this new scent has managed to take its place. This fragrance, is reminiscent of the refreshing, clean scent barbers apply after a haircut, making it perfect for post or pre gym freshness.

The standout feature of this perfume is the mint note, which immediately commands your attention. It's invigorating and fresh, akin to the revitalizing feeling you get after a shower. The mint sets the stage for a dynamic olfactory experience.

As the mint gradually subsides, the scent transitions to lavender, which imparts a distinct sense of cleanliness. The lavender note here is well crafted and doesn't come across as overpowering or synthetic. It's more like a subtle, aromatic touch that elevates the entire composition.

What makes this fragrance unique is the presence of a blended cream note. This creaminess complements the lavender beautifully, adding depth and richness to the scent profile. The combination of mint (which is going to be over powering note), lavender, and cream is harmonious and feels like a well thought out formula. One could totally see themselves out in Italy, by the beach, wearing this. Reminds me of the talented Mr. Ripley or The Hand of God where they were out by Italian beach.

Overall, I'd recommend this fragrance, especially if you're a fan of mint-based scents. It's a great, affordable option that captures freshness and the subtle elegance of a barbershop aroma. I've found it to be a suitable replacement for my gym scent Encre Noire Sport and wouldn't hesitate to consider it a worthwhile blind buy for mint enthusiasts.",10/21/23 21:05,REY760

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I have yet to experience something from the house of Acqua Di Parma that I dislike. I find, on average, the blends are consistently at a level where I'm not detecting bright individual notes (maybe my nose just sucks). Colonia Club is no exception, a neroli, citrus and mint burst. However, unlike the OG Colonia, it's immediately creamy and seductive in nature. Freshness of the variety that's perfect for summer, however, creamy and smooth enough that it's a great scent for any season really.

This fragrance is lovely, it's not screaming for attention or pushing any boundaries, it's just nice. Average projection and sillage (like many AdPs), but you'll get a decent 8 hours longevity on clothes.",07/26/23 21:30,Dive_Space

Have had a few compliments from wearing Colonia Club.

It's very pleasant, and perhaps a good choice for those who feel like they've outgrown Sauvage or Dylan Blue. But for me, it's stuck in the no man's land between classic and modern. It's lost the traditional, classic feel of the original Colonia, but also isn't as mass-appealing as the popular designer fresh frangraces of today. It certainly doesn't perform as well, with distinctly average projection and longevity. At the premium designer price point, I'd give this a miss.",04/07/23 08:34,lwhaymand
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This is really good. I've smelled it on my arm for most of today and what I can conclude based on it is that it isn't a weak performer nor a great performer, and that I really enjoy the scent. It reminds me of the general style of green barbershop fougeres, and in particular it definitely does remind me of Proraso Green which I loved and was part of what made me want to get this, so I'll definitely pair the two together. I also think it reminds me slightly of Rive Gauche. It's greener and sharper than Rive Gauche, which is so smooth that you could almost think it was just a molecule (which is why I think it's so special), but the body of the fragrance reminds me of it because there's a little bit of a shaving cream vibe (perhaps another reason why it's such a dead ringer for Proraso Green).",03/17/23 02:49,Marcjohn86

The scent is not as deep or as much of a ""powerhouse"" as the 1980's fougeres. I guess it could be worn by women, but this leans a bit more masculine to me.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Solid fragrance even if it is pretty far gone departure from the Colonia DNA. That initial burst of mint and citrus is accompanied on a bed of lavender dominated herbs (reminiscent of a Platinum Egoiste (I can see where the GIT comparison comes in) theme) giving it a bit of sweetness in a nice mint julep type of a feel with a pretty high grade of ambroxan that can totally pass as a ambergris. Why more designers don’t go this route for their ambroxan boggles my mind.

For those lamenting the discontinuation of this fragrance, Polo Cologne Intense in my mind is a more than suitable replacement for this. Materials are a bit lower quality (niche vs designer) and the prominent mint note is backed by a fresh airy violet leaf dominant herbs rather than fresh sweet lavender dominant herbs in CLUB. Overall not entirely dissimilar, even though they are 6 years part.

Wouldn’t surprise me if Carlos Benaim took inspiration for Polo Cologne Intense with CLUB",01/30/23 23:07,Riztory
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Once, as a treat for myself, I splurged on an AdP bath set, because I used to love the smell of Colonia Intensa, and I thought that it would make a nice post-shower scent (which it absolutely does, those soaps are lovely). Around the same time, one of the various discounters I use was selling some re-discovered bottles of Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce Intense, and I scooped up a pair of bottles before they vanished again (as one does with discontinued fragrances at bargain prices).

The end result of this is that one day, I happened to have showered with my AdP Colonia soap, and afterwards, sprayed on Fierce Intense. At first, it felt kind of clashy, since the A&F is even louder in ""Intense"" concentration than the original (which historically stunk out entire malls), but as the two started to balance, it became a rather intriguing sort of scent, wavering back-and-forth between a gentlemanly classic, and its douchebag equivalent. Anyway, long story short, the admix of those scent profiles is about 95% of what I get from AdP Colonia Club - that remaining 5% being made up of minty grassiness - and honestly, it kinda works.

Contrary to what many have said, I'm not getting anything like Green Irish Tweed vibes from this, so I'm not sure where that comparison is coming from - I even sprayed a bit of GIT on my shirt to compare, and, at least to me, it's just not there.

In the end, to my nose, this is AdP Colonia soap + A&F Fierce Intense + Mint and Grass, but the blending somehow manages to mute the harsh parts - and accentuate the nice ones - in such a way that it's actually rather pleasant to smell. It's probably not a safe blind-buy, though, since that profile is not for everyone. But, I like it well enough, and will likely be adding it to my spring/summer rotation

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Read reviews before buying a fragrance, but take them with a grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinion regarding smells. Some people love it. Some people hate it. My advice is for you to get a sample of ANY fragrance before you ever buy it. That way, you can assess it yourself and have your thoughts, rather than strictly going off someone else's thoughts and opinions.

A fresh, minty, ""green irish"", classy, casual, soapy, daytime fragrance. Usually, when people hear ""green Irish"" or shower gel, they think of ""gym"" or ""bro"" fragrances like Green Irish Tweed.

1. It's a bit sweet early on - in fact too sweet for hot summer days IMO.

2. That mint note is the most realistic I've encountered. Almost inappropriately realistic: more like a green leaf of mint picked from a herb garden than perfume. More herbal than fresh. (I think the freshness here comes more from the lavender et al.) Makes this distinct and recognizable.

3. It has a really lovely ambergris accord in the base. It's not your typical cheap amberwood/ambroxan, but smells mature manly and good quality.",09/03/22 07:47,Made by Kouros

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"To paraphrase Dickens, in the case of ADP Colonia, there is definitely a best of ""Clubs"" and a worst of ""C.L.U.B.s"". This one is the good one. The recent reformulation with the full stops in the name--not so much.
I like the way the traditional opening of Colonia is accented by mint in this flanker. The mid notes, with the emphasis on geranium carry on the fresh, cooling mintyness and make this fragrance a fine choice for really hot days. Sure, the base is an ambroxan-heavy mess that, in spite of a quality vetiver element, is indistinguishable from hundreds of other scents on the market today, but that opening is well blended, smells of quality ingredients and, since this fragrance fades rapidly to a skin scent isn't enough to put me off this version of the club.
But beware the recently released C.L.U.B. variant. I mistakenly bought it in a rush through a duty free shop on my way at to a hot weather destination where I have a residence thinking it was this product. What a colossal waste of money that decision turned out to be. But that story is best saved for the Fragrantica page for the new release.
This ""Club,"" particularly at the low prices at which I have seen it offered at various online sellers, is well worth trying if you want a fine hot weather scent. It is not as generic as some of the foregoing reviews suggest. Not is it remarkably unique. But the quality is here and the mint note is great. Oh, I guess I need to mention that I am an old guy, just so folks know that this fragrance isn't just for 20-something guys. Recommended, but not overly enthusiastically.",07/22/22 17:46,Akscent
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Why do I continue to believe that a new fragrance will be good. Ugh. Found this at Von Maur for $43. The original soapy Acqua Di Parma is a classic, so I thought why not. Even watched a few videos on this Colonia Club juuuuuuiiice- those young fellas loooooooved this. Ugh. This. Smells. Like. Nearly. Everything. At. The. Fragrance. Counter. At. A. Department. Store.

Off to eBay it goes. I need a time machine to go back to the 1980s and buy up all those spectacular power house masculine fragrances.

Put this is one of the myriad YSL bottles and you’d never be able to tell the difference.

Pass me some ibuprofen for my headache…

Edit….well, the night I sprayed this I got three separate compliments- go figure . I’ll keep this. I still think this smells like a lot of “department store” fragrances…but I’ll try it again.",07/22/22 16:44,TheTrumbs
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This is the perfect example of how to make a classy, masculine, mature fragrance without smelling dated. I’m in my late 20’s and get compliments on this every time I wear it. It really is a herbaceous and uplifting fragrance without relying ultra heavily on citrus. When I think of a country club or polo, horseshoes, tennis, insert any other old moneyesque sport this fragrance fits the bill. Does it have mega eternal lasting power? No. But who buys an sports car and complains about gas mileage. Know what you’re purchasing and why you purchase it. This is a 9/10 for me.",07/11/22 15:47,ReminiScent

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"It's a good scent but not great or stellar in my opinion. Most reviews here brand it to be the greatest thing since the internet but that's not what I feel. This is basically Gillette shaving cream/foam in a spray bottle. It's classic/manly and robust. It is very green but more of the deep kind. Opening is fresh and brash but settles for a more reserved kind of green scent.
If you want more of a diverse green then go for Paco Rabanne Pour Homme. This is a more serious kind of barbershop scent. Performance is stellar for me. I wear it to my clinic at 8 in the morning and I can still smell it at 6 in the evening.",06/28/22 20:38,Ajaysinghchauhan

If you have ever muddled mint leaves for a drink or simply rolled/crushed a mint leaf in your hand, you will immediately recognize the very natural smelling mint in Colonia Club.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Blind bought a bottle of this I see still available at $60 per 3.4oz. Either I will love it as I love Colonia and Essenza or will sell on later now that it’s discontinued. Will update soon.

Update: from the first sprays I can understand why they discontinued this. The opening smells strange and does not lend itself to sampling in stores and driving purchases. Because for The first 30 minutes or so this is a muddled stinky mess.

I first smell that classy colonia citrus blend in the background but it is quickly overpowered by a Discordant herbal note that somehow is minty but not. It is so herbaceous it is almost like when pulling out nettley stubborn weeds that are bitter, sappy, and pungent. Some reviewers call it spearmint rather than peppermint but either way it is not a clear fresh mintiness. It is mint mixed with some kind of bitter musty green or almost pine smell that just does not smell nice.

Once that recedes this smells fine but nothing special or memorable. It takes an hour to get there and it’s not worth it.

I feel like they really missed an opportunity here. Taking that classy breezy movie star Mediterranean Vibe of Colonia and crafting it into something sporty and evocative of old money equestrian pursuits could be a smash hit of a fragrance. Kind of showing Polo Ralph Lauren how it’s done. But instead this is an obvious embarrassment, so obvious it had to be quickly discontinued.",05/19/22 07:44,jaxxin

Colonia Club is not typical summer fragrance, does not fit to the gym or office environment, but it fits well to skiing or mountain climbing.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"You better really like mint to buy this. It is very heavy in this note for first couple of hours.

Above average fresh green DNA that bucks the trend of citrus freshies. As already stated, this is the heaviest I’ve experienced the mint note. I’ve grown to appreciate it much more after wearing it a number of times,…but, initially found it jarring and abrasive. The mint note tames on dry down…but it retains its minty freshness throughout. It blends with the lavender/geranium/vetiver trio. Although I would wear Le Male Fraiche before this on most days, I’m happy I purchased this.

Longevity and projection are average overall. Although best for spring, one could actually wear this year round by varying sprays.

As always, sample before purchase…I think it nice but not a masterpiece. Also need to be a big fan of mint to enjoy this one.",04/22/22 09:57,MNadz

Acqua Di Parma have just replaced this fragrance with one in a different bottle (clear), with a similar but different name (C.L.U.B.) and with different notes.

I messaged Acqua Di Parma directly and they confirmed that it is an entirely different scent and the original Colonia Club is now discontinued. Grab it whilst you can.

P.s. This is an amazing scent, super under-rated, and one of the best from ADP in my opinion. I’m so glad I got a bottle of this whilst I could. Minty, green, aquatic, gentlemanly goodness. Real shame to see it go.",03/16/22 06:58,TheSniffer
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Opens with a sharp mint. Give it about 30sec-1min, and you start to pick up the bergamot and citrus notes. Mint becomes more of a green fresh scent that blends well with the citrus. In the background, you have a masculine barbershop-fougère backbone. Not sure why it’s labeled unisex. I get over an hour of good projection. I get about another hour of elbow length projection and another 2 hours of a skin scent. This is great for spring, summer, and fall outdoor activities. Overall, I love this fragrance and too bad it’s been discontinued

Therapeutic freshness. To me this associates with the golf clubs, golf balls, bags, golf carts, caddies, just scenic greenery all around.

I really like the freshness Colonia Club offers, and the longevity and projection are very nice. If it had a little less lavender and a little more vetiver i would give it a 5 out of 5, but since the lavender is a little too strong, i will give it a 4 out of 5.",11/23/21 11:29,GIT
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Club from Acqua di Parma is one of my biggest fragrance discoveries in 2021. One of a kind masterpiece, and still a hidden gem.

The genius inclusion of Ambergris in the old-school green scent genre from the 1970s is what takes Colonia Club on a whole new level, and makes it contemporary, unlike the original 1916 edition.

To my nose, mint dominates the fragrance, and that salty note is to die for. Thankfully, the saltiness is not amplified as in for example Profumum Roma Acqua di Sale and is closer to something we have already seen in Giorgio Armani's Acqua di Gio Profumo or Tom Ford's Costa Azzurra.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I love this fragrance! It’s a fresh barbershop fragrance for people who don’t like old time associations of that type of fragrance. It never overtly smells of barbershop. Even Sedley with its modern mass appeal twist is more traditional than this one. I wore this once on a night out and had close to 10 compliments! This is not to say this is a “clubbing” scent, but it is to highlight just how versatile this is; yes it’s fresh and uplifting, but it’s not a wispy citrus and it always gives you a cool confident aura. It carries the confidence and respect of something traditional while maintaining a modern sleek allure- hmmm seems like it captures young Italian fashion.

Anyways I must disagree with the note pyramid. I totally understand why people speak so much of the mint, because of a sharp green feeling at the top mixing with the citrus. But I do not detect mint as strongly as others- there is nothing here that can remind you of toothpaste, not herbal, not mint candy, the cooling effect is present but not dominant. Rather I would want to say this is dominated at the top by petit grain, zesty lemon, and behind this is the mint- definitely detectable but only used to “cool” down the sharpness of the top. This can be summed up saying this is not a mint dominant fragrance but if you don’t like mint you won’t like this.

The zesty character of lemon is slowly replaced by a more mellow bergamot coupled with a mildly sweet lavender. Wow I love the levels of lavender- not enough to be prominent but it smooths the fragrance oh so nicely. It is still green and uplifting with a touch of citrus for many hours, the top is not too fleeting.

From about 30 minutes in I can detect ambergris holding the whole fragrance together. It has a salty waxy cloudy feeling. If you look for it you will smell it distinctly, but I think for most people it’s a more that tends to “hide”. Even if it’s prominent it’s not the type note the nose identifies easily, it just adds a bit of flavor. It’s like eating a salted chocolate chip cookie- the salt is crucial and prominent but most mouth focus in on the sweetness and richness of the cookie rather than the salt.

I must say to my nose this is ambroxan. Forgive me if this is actual ambergris but to me this has the smell of ambroxan. Do not for a second think it’s an ambroxan bomb or a “blue” fragrance. Here the ambroxan serves its role beautifully, here it is really mimicking ambergris.

Any age can pull this off but I think this has a special appeal to 25-40yrs old. It feels like a really cool put together guy with a bit of traditional masculinity walked into a house of LA influencers. His character seems exceptionally weighty in this environment. At once both the most reserved and yet the one with the largest character and personality.",09/25/21 09:06,waldoseye
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,This is a very fresh and green scent. If you don't like mint in fragrances you will not like Colonia Club at all. This is a spring scent for me as the greeness suits the season well. It makes me think of a cloudy spring day after heavy rain. It has some punch and character which makes it a bit of a mature scent. This fragrance is not for everyone which is one of the reasons I like it.,09/12/21 06:13,Grensfall
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I love mint in fragrances , I have nearly run out of my PDM Sedley so ive been looking for a possible replacement. As Sedley is hard to find here in the UK for a reasonable price, it smells great but not £200 great!

I tested colonia club side by side with essenza. The minty greenness in club is just perfection. Essenza would be ideal for a guy abit older who possibly wears suits to the office, I usually dress more smart casual. Anyway I put Colonia club on for a daytime date and the women I met couldn't stop sniffing me and while outside she kept trying to catch whiffs in the wind. She said it was the best scent she has ever smelt on a man !

Considering Colonia Club flies under the radar and is not spoke about much on youtube, it can be found at discounters at a great price. I can get like 2-3 bottles of club for the same price as 1 bottle of Sedley, I actually think Club smells of slightly higher quality.

I think I have found my new minty signature scent 10/10",08/31/21 14:27,Kadafi
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This is in my humble opinion and much to my regret not a good one from one of my favorite perfume houses, Acqua di Parma. Colonia Club opens up in a bitter mint and pine blast. It can be a refreshing wake up scent in very hot weather, but there are many more pleasant and better green fresh day starters for those hot days. Fortunately the first dry down is a little more pleasant. But still the bitter mint and pine keeps on bothering the more pleasant ingredients that are waiting to come out. There is neroli, lavender, mandarin, musk and vetiver in the dry down but the damage is already done and ruins the whole proces. This has fortunately some ADP quality in the final dry down that withholds this fragrance from becoming a cheap and bad Pino Silvestre clone. And if you like bitter piney fragrances in the line of Polo than this could be something worthwhile checking out, but for me it's a pass.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Strong mint then green. Decent performance. For me sits behind others such as GIT (lemon/violet) or CW (fresh/ozonic).

Ok im not biased towards AdP at all, but i don't think you can go wrong if Intensa, Futura and Club were the only 3 fragrances a man needs.

I mention throwaway money because the perfect packaging of this gem would be a BIG splash bottle, over 200ml, priced about 40 bucks.

ADP got as close as possible to a really great mint/green fragrance with this one. There is something a bit dewy, redolent of the new greenness of spring, that is captured here. I understand the GIT references- Colonia Club definitely draws inspiration from that classic, but it is miles better than the cheapie clones like Aspen, Tres Nuit, etc. This one avoid the chemical mess that those two eventually devolve into. Strange that ADP labels this as unisex. It is definitely based on a classic and well-known masculine fragrance DNA, but whatever. With the moderate price this goes for on discounter sites, its a great spring/summer option. A modernized take on a classic scent profile, it may skew a bit mature but it just smells nice and fresh with a bit of mellow haziness underneath.",03/17/21 07:01,DrNDJas
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This is without a doubt a rich, complex fragrance best suited for the warmer months, or cooler evenings. The citrus notes come out right away as in all ADP scents. But the mint along with the Musk and Ambergris in the background were quite hard for my brain to compute. I did not really enjoy it. The vetiver balances it all out with a refined woodiness. But unfortunately after 3 hours on my skin this unique product was almost completely gone. Not just a skin scent, but gone? This is a non linear scent that will take you on a wonderful adventure. Unfortunately for me that journey was too short lived. Put it on your body and go for a walk if you can first to see how it develops. For the price I do not see it as a wise blind buy unless you are familiar with wearing ADP products.",03/06/21 01:53,Woody57
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This is a fresh , timeless classic fragrance for the stylish modern gentleman. It opens up with like fresh citrusy soapy then dry down is musky.
This perfume is perfect for the spring, summer and fall. I like Colonia Club Acqua Di Parma.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This is a beautiful but (as is often the case with Acqua di Parma freshies) a slightly short lived old school green fragrance. I also have noticed that the amount of mint varies slightly by batch. I have a 50ml bottle and a 180ml (I really love this fragrance :) )and there is noticeably more mint in the 50ml unfortunately (as that bottle won't last me for too much longer).

It opens with a gorgeously refreshing blast of natural smelling fresh mint which leaves a palpable tingling sensation on the skin. I love mint in fragrances but it can often smell very synthetic (Versace Eros) or be lost within the other notes (Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme). Not here though. It's front an center and smells incredible for about 30 mins

As it moves to the mid and dry-down the mint pulls back but is still noticeable, and the ADP Colonia DNA comes to the fore. Now citruses, petitigrain and lavender are blending in to make a really classy and sophisticated barbershop fougere. It probably works better in it's intended environment of coastal Mediterranean rather than colder northern climates TBH. You do get a bit of the ambergris and musk in the drydown but after 3 hours this has lost most of it's potency and is a fresh and clean skin scent.

I'm in my 30s and on a cool spring day in a shirt and shades by the coast this fragrance makes me feel like a million dollars. It's classy and sophisticated and one I'll have in my collection forever.",01/27/21 04:27,nt277i

Beautiful sparkling opening. Fresh and elegant. I'm usually not a fan of lavender, but this was blended perfectly.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Club is a classic, old school fragrance, but that's not a bad thing. On the contrary, in my mind, it's a good thing when you're feeling nostalgic and want to feel fresh and clean, like on a Sunday after a shower when you're going to lay around the house watching TV. This reminds me of those manly scents I grew up smelling on my father and grandfather, which I loved. The opening is very cold and minty, with bergamot and petitgrain. It definitely is cooling on your skin, which is great in the tropical climate I live in. The tingling lingers for quite a while. The notes of lavender, ambergris, musk, galbanum, and vetiver combine to smell like wet, green plants and cold, clean wood floors. I'm not exactly sure how this works, but it is very pleasing in my hot and humid climate. It makes me imagine sitting in room with cool teak wood floors and a ceiling fan on high, watching the heavy rain fall on the tropical plants outside, causing steam to rise of the earth. Longevity is moderate at about 5 hours for me, with moderate projection. It's a very refreshing scent.",08/03/20 00:37,RedRover
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"AdP Colonia with a minty green twist. Clean, fresh and elegant. Quality ingredients excellently blended. Sillage surprisingly good.

it's green,it's fresh
wearing this is making a statement

it smells luxury and class

green fresh luxurious forest vibe

I thing I could wear this indoors but outdoors is where it becomes magnificent

gives you a nice scent bubble and a nice silage when the catches it

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I just got this fragrance. It's my second foray into the house of ADP. Colonia Club is nice but I was expecting a bit more (especially after owning Essenza). I get the comparison with Cool Water but only in the opening. On my skin, it opens up with a clean, fresh, herbaceous, natural smelling fresh mint and dries down to a slightly sweet mint and lavender combination. I think the lavender dry down makes it more of a mature scent however it's by no means an 'old man's smell'. Other notes I get are ambroxan which is present in the opening giving an ever so slightly salty/aquatic/shower gel vibe and citrus both of which aren't as dominant as the mint and lavender to me. That's pretty much all I get as far as the notes go for now. Overall, this is a clean, pleasant, inoffensive, herbaceous easy to wear fragrance suitable for any occasion.",06/17/20 11:46,Rich28
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I’ve tried a couple of the AdP Colonia bit can’t wrap my head around their popularity.

This one kind a reminds me of Ralph Lauren Polo Sport.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Acqua Di Parma Colonia club opens with a moderate projection of neroli, mint, bergamot, and petitgrain. The petitgrain is a prominent note and it feels green with a citrus touch, a tone similar to pine mixed with vetiver; the neroli is also citrusy but bitter and sharp and mixes well the lemon and bergamot. The mint adds its green, fresh and aromatic accord to the blend. The opening notes are a citrusy sharp and vibrant green. In just a moment, the lavender adds its floral clean-like aroma, but it is just a touch. The vetiver joins the blend bringing its strong, sharp, green, freshly cut grass-like accord. Both, the ambergris and musk start developing their accords boosting the green accords more than the citrus accords. The ambergris has a faint mineral and animalic accord. At this point, the citrus accords have subsided a bit leaving the green accords to dominate the fragrance. The most important change from the opening to the dry-down is the change from citrus and green, to a green and citrus fragrance and the development of a noticeable musky accord. The color of the bottle could not tell more effectively the type of fragrance that is in it. Once Acqua Di Parma Colonia Club has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, sharp green (vetiver, petitgrain, mint), citrus (bergamot, lemon) fragrance with noticeable slightly animalic musk and soft lavender accords. The fragrance feels classy, cold, earthy, exotic, grassy, herbaceous, mature, rich, sharp, unisex, and mildly pleasant.

BATCH REVIEWED: 2020.
WOW RATING: 9/10. The strong green and musky accords are impressive.
DISLIKE RATING: 5/10. Some people will find offensive the strong green and slightly animalic but prominent musky accords.
UNIQUENESS: 9/10. The combination of green accords makes this fragrance very unique.
MASS APPEAL: 1/10. Strong green and musky fragrances are not mass-appeal. Its green and musky nature give it a classy and old school vibe that younger men will find unpleasant.
PROJECTION: 3/10. Moderate, about 3 feet around the wearer.
SILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet behind the wearer.
APPLICATION: Four atomizations will suffice.
LONGEVITY: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 hours with 1 hour of good projection.
SEASONS: Spring, summer, and fall.
OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, casual, clubbing. In moderation, this is an office-friendly fragrance.
VERSATILITY: 6/10. Relatively versatility, it can be worn for many occasions including the office.
GENDER: Unisex. The green and musk accords are neutral.
AGES: 40 and up. Green and musky fragrances are better suited for mature wearers.
RECOMMENDATION: Enjoying this fragrance requires a well-defined appreciation for green and musky accords and fragrances for mature wearers. If that is the case, then this is a good buy. Others may want to consider alternatives.
BLIND-BUY: No, sample it first, the musky accord is peculiar.
SIMILAR: Acqua Di Parma Men Colonia Essenza EDP is another very musky fragrance that combines citrus, fresh spicy, white floral, woody, and musk accords.
SUMMARY: A moderate projection, sharp green (vetiver, petitgrain, mint), citrus (bergamot, lemon) fragrance with noticeable slightly animalic musk and soft lavender accords. The fragrance feels classy, cold, earthy, exotic, grassy, herbaceous, mature, rich, sharp, unisex, and mildly pleasant.",06/08/20 20:45,piyux
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Got myself a decant of this. Wore it twice to get an idea. It has a very nice citrus opening - very pleasant & uplifting.

It also has that icy hot cooling effect of eucalyptus or menthol on my skin. There is a minty effect going on but it's not sinus clearing.

It dries down to an aromatic woody scent for me. Nicely blended, a tiny bit ozonic which makes it feel a little ""designer"" to me but still not a bad scent.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Got a bottle of this.. another blind buy (nearly all of my purchases are and because I bought essenza a few weeks ago and I really like it) ... and I’ve gotta say that, although I only applied it 10 minutes ago for the first time, I really like it. Fresh, green, cooling Citrus and mint.. and yes, as others have pointed out it really does have a cooling effect on your skin.

I have Essenza as well and I really like that too, and I’m surprised to say it, but I think even in this early stage, I like Club equally if not more than essenza... it’s got a really nice zing to it.

It’s funny.... A few weeks ago after purchasing essenza I sprayed it a couple of times on my neck/collar area and then a few minutes later put a couple of pieces of peppermint chewing gum in my mouth and started chewing.. the mint from the chewing gum mixed with the essenza in my throat/nasal passages and it smelt like a really minty fresh boosted mix of essenza and I thought “they should add mint to this essenza stuff”... well now I know that with Club they already have!..

Can’t stop smelling my wrist and I’m looking forward to seeing what the dry down is like and how long it lasts on my skin.. hopefully as long/or even longer than essenza...",01/05/20 01:55,Scent it flying

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I've spent a lot of time with my decant of this fragrance. At first, I didn't get good performance with it. But the more I wear it, the longer it seems to last on my skin. I think that has more to do with my nose than it does the fragrance or my skin. Anyway, it's a beautiful fragrance and the most spring-oriented fragrance in the AdP line up, in my opinion.

It's very modern and classy. My girlfriend thinks it smells like something a young person would wear, and I think she meant it smells sporty and fresh. I think anyone over the age of 20 can wear this one.

Yes, it's comparable to GIT, but I think this is better and more unique, due to the refined mint accord. I think I'm gonna buy a full bottle.",10/10/19 09:06,agonzony

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"When first sprayed, it actually has a cooling effect on the skin! It perfectly compliments the smell. This is country club gentleman all the way. It's fresh without trying to be fresh, if that makes sense. Not in-your-face fresh.

It's my favorite ""green"" scent. There's a hint of mint, too. Others here describe it well. Easily office friendly, very professional. No one could flat out hate it!

It's one of the few fragrances out there that I smelled in the store and thought about for months how I really wanted it, sparingly spraying my tiny sample and feeling as giddy about it each time as I did the first. Finally saw it half-off from an authorized retailer, and I pulled the trigger; should've bought the 100 mL. I should add that I own over 50 fragrances, including from high-end heavy-hitters Tom Ford, Creed, Clive Christian, Giorgio Armani Prive, By Kilian, etc.... And if I'm being honest, few of them blew me away the first time like this does and still does.

Longevity is better for me than people here. 7-12 hours. 5 hours if I'm getting really hot. Perfectly acceptable for a fresh fragrance that isn't even an EDP.

10/10 scent, 9.5/10 longveity, 10/10 sillage and performance. Highly recommend, blind buy worthy.",08/15/19 19:16,MrBolton
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"One look at the bottle will basically tell you what this fragrance smells like. Colonia Club has the basic AdP Colonia line DNA, but it goes in a greener direction.
The primary note is a multifaceted take on mint. It's earthy, as though it is still in the ground, and is slightly pungent. It lacks the coldness of peppermint or spearmint oil, and smells more like you just crushed some fresh mint in your hand. Lavender begins to rear its head as the scent dries down, and rings true to the smell of pure lavender oil. The neroli is not as prominent as I was expecting, but it's still there, and the lemon is more forward than the voted main notes would indicate.

Performance is moderate, but that's to be expected. I get maybe 6 hours from it, and it's a skin scent by the end of the first hour.",06/23/19 13:33,jeremyn87

Used, enjoyed, did not really move me as such, currently no plans to re-purchase as a result of that. Nice bottle, nice advertising campaign. A solid 7 out of 10.",05/25/19 10:33,Old School Tie
Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Over the 5 flankers of the original Colonia , it's the only one that can really be called a flanker, and not just a ""copy with a twist"".

That said, for currently $90 online, I expect more from a fragrance than other frags that do the same job (Dunhill Icon Racing $45, Cartier Roadster $25), and sometimes in more modern way (Carven L'Eau Intense $30).

I have to echo other reviewers in that it's good in quality, but poor in orginality, and targets younger crowds: just another drop into the sea of fresh green and sweet fragrances. That said, if you don't already own any, it may be worth it. Just keep in mind that without the AdP label, it would probably retail for half its price. A pass for me.

IMO is not a light scent but fresh, manly not unisex IMO, nothing original but a really nice green twist to classical Colonia. Recommended 100% for Spring and summer as well. Performance surprised me, Assoluta uses to last 3-4 hours on my skin, Essenza 6-8 hours, Colonia Club lasted +12hrs (6 sprays, spring, 20ºC).",04/13/19 12:36,goliatrgs

UPDATE: Bought a full bottle and wore extensively. Noticing more of the cooling mint scent and feel. Also the soapy vibe, like Essenza but less pronounced and definitely less tangy.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"The opening of Colonia Club is very reminiscent of Issey Miyake’s original L’eau d’Issey - lots of old school bright citrus notes, nice on their own - but AdP’s offering really comes into its own when the mint leaves come forward - really well crafted, crisp and green and fresh - that is backed up by a lovely smooth vetiver just at ‘the back of the room.’

I can see this being applied post-sauna at a clubhouse, just before Cocktail Hour. It has decent projection, even in colder weather - my girlfriend could smell it at arms length even in a sharp wind - so drinks on the veranda on a cold evening won’t kill it. A few sprays lasted close to 6 hours on my skin on a cold January day/evening.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I'm impressed! Colonia Club is essentially Aqua Di Parma's answer to Yves Saint Laurent's take on Barbasol shaving cream - Rive Gauche. This is the Italian version, inspired by Proraso. Super fresh and masculine and dare I say a little sexy. Colonia Club shares that magic with Rive Gauche where it smells very fresh but also slightly dirty and macho at the same time.

High quality too, and that mint top note... probably the best mint note I've smelled in a fragrance to date and the fragrance evolves nicely from there, definitely no boring linear scent here.

If you like Rive Gauche or similar fresh fragrances like Green Irish Tweed, you'll almost certainly like this. If you also like Italian scents in general, I can pretty much guarantee it.",11/09/18 17:25,edge42

Descent into Acqua Di Parma Episode 2: Yes I used Descent because it has ""scent"" in it.

Today I tried a sample of Acqua Di Parma Colonia Club. I sprayed on more than I usually spray this brand. I initially smelled a citrus with a strong lemon smell. After 15 minutes or so I think it smells as if its a higher class Tommy Hilfiger's Tommy fragrance. I'm new to a lot of Fragrances and that is the closest thing I can think of it Colonia Club. I like it a lot. If I had to only wear one brand of fragrance Acqua Di Parma would probably be it.",08/13/18 10:25,echo4kilo

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"This is a beautiful green fougiere fragrance that is to Acqua di Parma what Green Irish Tweed is to Creed (although the two do not smell similar at all, and I prefer the Colonia Club). As for the scent, it's in the same genre as Amouage's Beach Hut Man and Coty's Aspen to my nose but different than both. It opens with a very beautiful fresh green accord of very natural smelling spearmint leaves (the mint in this is as natural as YSL's Live Jazz and Lush's Dirty, and is noticeably spearmint rather than peppermint). The mint is so prominent in fact that it produces a noticeable cooling effect on your skin (just as is the case with Lush's Dirty). But the mint is not the only thing there, and is united by notes of to my nose galbanum (which smells like grass), petitgrain, neroli, vetiver, lemon, and a very strong green bergamot accord that almost smells like limes. It's very green, very cooling, and very fresh. It also smells both modern yet refined and sophisticated at the same time to me, like they took the classic fougiere (fern-like) cologne formula, made it modern but also of natural-smelling ingredients so it smells high-class. It definitely leans masculine; it smells like what a gentleman in a tuxedo or someone on a golf course would be wearing. On the drydown I smell a small hint of seawater and ambergris accord that makes it sort of aquatic in nature, but in a good way. It's as if you were walking in a lush green forest with fields of spearmint and it started raining. The scent overall is pretty linear from opening to the end however. Sillage is moderate (as is the case with all Acqua di Parmas in my experience), while longevity is also moderate at about 5 hours (better than most Acqua di Parmas though, except for Colonia Oud and Leather). Overall, this is my favourite fragrance from the historic Italian Acqua di Parma house, followed by Colonia Oud and Fico di Amalfi. In fact it's one of my favourite fragrances overall of all time.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Here I am at last - reviewing my signature!

Reading some reviews comparing it to Green Irish Tweed and Cool Water are a wee stretch for me (sorry - I own all three and I still use Cool Water today after 20 years). Especially in contrast to what Lo-fi said. They are at best somewhat similar.

Keeping it simple, to me GIT is like honeyed lemon verbena with some flowers, and thats it nothing else.

CW again in simple terms is Fresh Aquatic, Lemon (not even in its pyramid), Lavender with SPEARMINT not mint in the back ground with a pinch of tobacco and coriander.

Colonia Club is like a Sweet Lime Soda in a can with a pinch of tobaccy and lavender and a little musk straw to sip it with a clean mint always present in the back ground!

Alternatively amazingly its also a dead ringer for Guerlain L'Homme Ideal EDT if you replace the cherry with lime/bergamot (not EDP which has less musk more cherry). I know this is almond and tonka bean in Ideal but this is what it smells like to me from a non technical point - I also own them.

CC is an EDC so only has a small percentage of oil compared to CW which is an EDT or GIT which is an EDP hence higher oil content. Ironically I think it is reverse world!!! I find GIT to reek of quality but have a low to moderate silage and reasonable longevity and CW to smell cheap in construction (at least the last one i bought - infact it smells vinegary on first spray) and to have a decent longevity.

CC on the other hand... after dry down (admittedly I do spray a lot) it smells of sweet lime (not bergamot) mixed with a layer of lavender, coriander, maybe cedar, amber and mint over the top after 15 minutes a bit of powdery musk presents itself . The mint does cool you but 50cm away its the only fragrance I know that just smells of all the combined. Its very textured and even though its a cologne the ingredient quality basically means that it lasts 6-12 hours for me AND its completely linear - I'm not sure that it changes. Its not an in your face perfume yet I can smell it more easily from a distance than most - I don't know why. AND this is coming from someone whom doesn't really like musk or powdery scents (not that they are dominant).

Its kind of a mature scent for smart casual dressed guys in their 30's and above (imagine Panerai watch, polo top and chinos) or someone confident in a Tom Ford or Brioni like Daniel Craig, George Clooney or Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy as the CEO of GE in 30 Rock would wear - not loud but a mix of warm, cool, formal, casual.

So I love this scent because I can wear it in winter as the musk lavender and amber are somewhat warming and the mint and lime keeps it fresh like I just got out of a shower in a waterfall with naked women (actually it reminds me of Norsca maybe lol).

I recently bought Jacques Fath Green Water as someone somewhere mentioned it was like Colonia Club dialled up to 11 - he was spot on except its simpler - just Lavender Mint and Lime.

I sprayed each hand before I started typing this 60 minutes ago with distractions with CC and CW. CW has already faded noticeably and changed whilst CC is still powering on at the same level with the same presentation...

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Colonia club IMO is One of the best and most elegant fresh fragrances you can get.

Extremely high quality, beautiful and pleasant. Beautiful citrus with ultra cooling green mint backbone. Very cooling, masculine and refreshing.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Got a spray at Niemans the other day. Definitely agree that this smells like GIT at first but with a slight menthol and mint overtone which makes it a little more harsh. There were a few times in the first hour that it sort of reminded me of a urinal cake. It wasn't too off-putting and didn't last long, but I definitely had that moment where you go, i recognize that smell, I wonder what it is... oh, now I remember. After dry down, it was too powdery for me and my wife hated it, so it's a no-go but it was close. I liked the forst 2/3, but the base lost me.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"I got this as a 1.2ml sample. It's unisex but struck me as being more masculine than feminine. It starts with a sort of mossy/mouldy mint fragrance - not a particularly fresh mint. It also produces the ""cooling effect"" sensation described by others - akin to having toothpaste wiped on you - not pleasant - and lasts about 45 mins. This belongs in the 'sport' class of fragrances to me. Next a quite pleasant vetiver scent appears and persists to the end, becoming muskier with time. Lasts a good 8hrs, sillage is soft to moderate. A reasonable, sporty, scent for men in my opinion. Not for me.",07/26/17 10:28,Lesh

I get good longevity and sillage with this, and receive compliments every time I wear it. I personally prefer it as an evening fragrance, but that may be just me.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Green with Envy..!! Certainly the mantra of this beautiful creation from Acqua di Parma… I preface this review stating I am a huge fan of the Acqua di Parma line, housing several in my stable of fragrances. The Colonia Club edition is a blend of mint, citrus, and floral notes where the end product is a nicely done fragrance that I find intriguing and appealing. Acknowledging some of the negative reviews, this fragrance is not for everyone. Sample it prior to purchasing the bottle – AdP has historically been quite generous providing samples to inquiring minds (and noses..). I would offer that Colonia Club tends to have more of a masculine vibe, but for those that like a feminine fragrance, but daring to try something out of the comfort zone – go for it..!! You may like it..!! Additionally, I would suggest CC may appeal to a more mature audience. When wearing this gem today, I was reminded of more dated and distinguished fragrances from yesteryears gone by. Oh, to reminisce… (where did all the years go? – but I digress..)

My final tally for Colonia Club is 4.2 stars out of 5. I am a fan of Acqua di Parma. That said, while Colonia Club is not my favorite in this line, it does offer something different which I like. It is very appealing, distinguished, and worthy of a test drive… For those who are “Green with Envy”, definitely recommend adding to your collection.

Enjoy your day and Happy Fragrance Hunting…",10/04/16 08:23,OCNBreeze7

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Club is my favorite among the Colonia line.

It opens with bright fresh strong mint and some 30 minutes later settles with lavendar, musk, almost tobacco-like. It stays for 7-9 hours.

The only thing that bothers me is the cooling sensation on the skin (like those body wash and shampoo with cooling effect). However you won't really notice it unless you overspray.

Not all bad I guess.. it only means the mint is a real deal. This is hands down the minty-est mint of all mint perfumes I have ever tried.

Colonia Club Acqua di Parma,"در اولين نگاه ، شيشه اين ادكلن بنده رو به ياد سبزي و خنكي انداخت و ميشه گفت از اين نظر ، طراح شيشه در كارش موفق بوده .
به نظرم رايحه اش اصلا پيچيده نيست و داراي شروعي بسيار شاداب و با طراوت مركباتي به همراه حسي گياهي اسطوخودوس و يك عالمه نعناع و مقداري گلي هست . رايحه نعنايي در ابتدا بسيار قوي است . طوري كه حس ميكني مخاط بيني ات و منافذ سينوسهات حسابي خنك و باز شده اند . صرفنظر از رايحه زيبا و قشنگش ، تقريبا همون حسي رو داره كه وقتي لوله ويكس رو توي بيني مون ميكنيم و نفس ميكشيم .
پس از اين مرحله رايحه شمعداني در زمينه اي قوي از مركبات و در مرحله پاياني هم رايحه وتيور رو داريم .
به همين سادگي .
اين مسير رايحه پراكني رو در خيلي از ادكلنها ديديم و چيز جديدي محسوب نميشه . ولي از يك موضوع نميشه گذشت و اون اينكه ، حسي كه بعد از يك روز كاري گرم و پر فعاليت و بعدش يك دوش گرفتن و بعدش اسپري كردن اين ادكلن ، به آدم دست ميده ، واقعا جالب و دوست داشتني و مفرح و زندگي بخش هست . مخصوصا اينكه پس از اسپري اين ادكلن ، در محل اسپري شده ، حس خنكي زيادي بوجود مياره . درست مثل حسي است كه بعد از مسواك زدن ، خمير دندان روي پوست بوجود مياره .
به نظرم قيمت بالاي اين ادكلن ، با توجه به خاص نبودن اون و همچنين وجود ادكلنهاي با رايحه هاي مشابه ديگر، اصلا توجيهي نداره.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"The vetiver is there right from the very beginning, well blended with the citruses. But I would call this aromatic much more than a citrus composition.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Having just reviewed the venerable original Acqua di Parma Colonia yesterday, it felt entirely fitting that today I turn my attention to Colonia Futura. While I truly appreciated the classic essence of Colonia—indeed, it presented perhaps one of the finest representations of a traditional barbershop men's fragrance I've ever encountered—I simply couldn't overlook its disappointing performance. With Futura, I'm keen to observe how this iconic DNA is reinterpreted for a modern sensibility, and more importantly, if it manages to resolve the longevity issues that plagued its predecessor. Let's get into it and find out.


Opening:
The opening is a striking fusion of aromatic freshness, bright citrus, and robust woodiness. The primary notes that immediately announce themselves are lavender, vetiver, lemon, and bergamot. Lavender and vetiver are the dominant forces here. The lavender first greets my nose with a familiar, softly powdery, and subtly spicy aromatic accord. It shares the essence of the lavender used in the original Colonia, yet it's not quite as assertive. This is because the vetiver steps forward with equal intensity, bringing an intensely green, almost bracingly sour woodiness. While I've encountered my fair share of vetiver notes previously, this particular iteration stands out as remarkably astringent. Next, the lemon and bergamot contribute their citrusy accents. As expected from two citrus notes, they share a common bright character, yet they are distinguishable: the lemon offers its characteristic juiciness, while the bergamot provides its underlying aromatic and spicy undertones.


Dry Down:
The dry down largely mirrors the opening, remaining steadfastly citrusy, assertively woody, and distinctly aromatic. The primary notes I continue to discern are lavender, vetiver, lemon, and bergamot, with lavender and vetiver still holding their prominent positions. In fact, the dry down is essentially identical to the opening, with the only discernible difference being a gentle fading of the lemon and bergamot. As such, I would characterize this fragrance as fairly linear in its progression.


Performance:
The initial projection is moderate to strong, extending its presence about three to five feet. Sillage mirrors this, leaving a noticeable but controlled scent trail. After just a few hours, the projection had softened considerably, becoming very light and sitting closer than arm's length. The scent trail, by this point, was only faintly perceptible, to the extent that I would essentially classify it as a skin scent.


When to Wear:
Colonia Futura is undeniably a spring and summer fragrance, ideally suited for daytime wear. Unlike the original Colonia, this interpretation leans more distinctly into the warm-weather category. However, it retains the same commendable usability as its predecessor, proving versatile enough for virtually any occasion, whether casual, formal, or for a professional setting in the office.


Blind Buy:
I wouldn't necessarily label this a safe blind buy simply because of its pronounced vetiver character. To truly appreciate this fragrance, one needs a genuine affinity for vetiver. However, if you enjoy the original Colonia and have a strong appreciation for vetiver, this could be worth exploring.


Final Verdict:
I can certainly recognize Acqua di Parma's intention with this particular fragrance. They aimed to modernize their original Colonia DNA by weaving in a substantial amount of vetiver. While I can appreciate the creative effort behind this endeavor, vetiver is simply not a note I typically gravitate towards, especially not to this degree. As I noted, the vetiver used here was exceptionally strong and rather astringent, to the point where it largely overshadowed the other notes in the composition. Furthermore, the performance for Colonia Futura offered only a marginal improvement over the original and still fell significantly short of what I would deem acceptable for its price point. Colonia Futura currently stands as, and will likely remain, my least favorite Acqua di Parma fragrance I've experienced. I have one more Acqua di Parma to try tomorrow, and I'm earnestly hoping we can conclude this series on a more positive note.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Hermosa actualización de la colonia clásica con una lavanda maravillosa y trabajada para dar un aire muy maduro.

Fresca, seria y elegante. No es para compra a ciegas, no es unisex, no es un cítrico limpio y con Tonka o almizcle que le brinde toques más dulzones o vibra de perfume comercial. Es un aroma casi fougere intenso y para hombres de 35-40 en adelante en mi opinión. Yo ya casi tengo 40 años y la disfruto muchísimo. Para el día a día con un toque semi formal o hasta una ocasión elegante o reunión formal en verano o primavera siento que va perfecta para alejarse de los típicos polo blue, Acqua di gio, Versace pour homme y más perfumes cítricos/acuáticos/marinos de estas épocas. Aclaro que tengo y disfruto esos perfumes pero esto va un poco más allá. Muy recomendable. Prueben antes de comprar.

I get lively Grapefruit and lemon not a huge deal of spice but something in there pops. The mid is where the lavender comes into play and again such a stunning natural unsweetened version.. the vetiver in the base holds it altogether in what if it lasted longer than a hour or two

And I wanna clarify that I dont mind fragrances that are somewhat mature like colonia essenza or eau sauvage. But this right here is extreeemely mature, if you dont think its mature than you just dont find any fragrance mature as you dont place an age limit on it which is fine but my personal opinion is that even if youre 40 this is too mature for you... I dont get much citrus, if I had to explain the smell it would be the smell of rosemary but like 5 mins before I wrote this I smelled actual rosemary from a garden and the cologne, the cologne is a much much more potent smell so its not as pleasant as actual rosemary. Anyways that was a chaotic review but yeah, DONT BLIND BUY. Arancia di capri remains my favorite from the brand.",03/19/25 09:51,DinoPal
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"I've been fascinated by Acqua di Parma fragrances for a while now, as their offerings seem to align with my preferences for old-school, classic scents. With that in mind, I’ve made a couple of blind purchases and tested several decants this year. My first blind buy was Fico di Amalfi and I was not disappointed, so encouraged by that success I considered Colonia (original), Colonia Intensa, and Colonia Futura. It was not an easy choice, but I eventually settled on Futura.

Unfortunately, my initial experience with Futura wasn’t as positive as I’d hoped, and I found myself struggling to pinpoint exactly what I didn’t like about it. When I encounter a fragrance like this, that I find hard to evaluate, I tend to wear it for a few weeks, hoping to understand it better. My immediate thought with this particular fragrance was that perhaps my sense of smell was a bit off when I first tried it, and in fact I did find it improved over a few days, so I think there was an issue in that respect. In saying that, I’ve now worn Futura several times and I’m still not convinced by it.

Futura opens with a citrus blend of lemon, bergamot and grapefruit, but I find it hard to distinguish any of those notes. I know it’s citrus, but it’s not sharp, zesty or realistic to my nose. Instead, I find it to be a musty sort of citrus smell. It does have a slight twang to it that I assume to be the pink pepper note, but once again it isn’t easy for me to place it. And there is also something there in the opening that reminds me of the smell of mouldy bread. I have experienced this mouldy bread smell in another fragrance that I should have enjoyed based on its notes, so I’m quite prepared to believe that this is something specific to how I interpret certain combinations of notes. Along the same lines, the very first time I tried Futura, I got a burning plastic smell, but I've not had that since. I've read that Futura contains some Ambroxan and that might be the difficulty I have with this, as it is something that I seem to be sensitive to.

Thankfully, where I’m concerned, the initial stage of Futura’s development passes within a few minutes on my skin and I then find it improves considerably. Gone is the indistinct citrus and mustiness and in comes aromatic and herbal accords, which I find slightly reminiscent of a doctor’s waiting room.

As it evolves further, it is mellowed by a warm smokiness. For me, this middle stage lasts around three hours, before a final stage in which I get something akin to a fruity boiled sweet, which ultimately turns to vetiver. In total, I find Futura lasts six hours + on my skin.

Overall, while Colonia Futura certainly evolves over time and improves on my skin, it hasn’t fully won me over and I'm finding it difficult to rate it. At times, I'm really not that keen, but then I do quite like the latter stages of this fragrance.

The reminds me of scent are pretty accurate too. But I don't think it's worth getting it at retail price. Resellers/Discounters price yes. Good for a sunny and warm hot day.

It's projection for this fresh herbal like scent is pretty decent, better than a few flora Edp under the brand. 2-3 sprays on arm and forehand and it projects at least a feet or two, not too bad.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Bitter, herbal, green citrus fragrance.

Maybe it's the citrus selection or the blending method but this opens with a very bitter, astringent citrus note. I love it. No sweetness here. Like complaining of thirst on a hot day only to sprayed with bitter lemon-infused water.

Within half an hour, it takes a greener feel drying down to a faint herbal, woody smell.

I know it's an EDC (so it shouldn't be unexpected) but longevity is an alien word for this fragrance. I had to respray every 3hrs as it was barely noticeable on the skin after that time.

Longevity is my only complaint. If this performed better, it would be a love for me. Great fragrance for a hot summer (or spring) day but you'll need a decant if you're going to be away from home for a long time.",09/08/24 00:11,ademaria

My only complaint is that I wish it had a bit more staying power.",08/27/24 10:01,JoeBread
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Found a bottle full bottle of this at my local flea market for just 30 clams. Colonia Futura is my first step into niche fragrances and I absolutely love it!

opens up super citrusy and slightly spicy. As it dries down I get a mix of herbal floral woodiness with some zing still in the background. I find this to be very classy, smells like something my dad would've worn. That being said this probably isn't for the younger crowd. Not sweet at all and I probably would've hated it a year ago but my nose has changed a lot during my fragrance journey. It smells very familiar but I can't pin down exactly what, It kind of just reminds me of older fragrances.

I wouldn't say this stands out so much that you need it in your collection but for the price I got it, it was hard to pass up. I find it to be very versatile and nonoffensive and I love the scent profile so I will likely be wearing this often.

This was a very nice first step into niche scents for me and I would love to try more fragrances from this house.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"A mouth watering and light citrus opening that slowly transitions to a rich and long lasting vetiver. Perfect for casual wear.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"This is a nice and refreshing summertime scent, but I wouldn't call it unisex, because it contains many features of old-school masculine colognes. The scent description above is correct: it opens with lemon, bergamot and pink pepper, and I bet there's also some neroli in it. After some minutes, lavender emerges as the main note, aided by spices, herbs, and the still omnipresent bergamot. The closing note is a green-lemony vetiver. It doesn't project very strongly, but its fresh and somewhat sharp presence is felt nonetheless. I'm not sure that it is worth the asking price, because there are hundreds of similar scents in all price categories available worldwide; but other than that, the scent is nice, versatile and office-friendly. Due to the aforementioned vintage-cologne association, I would say that it is better suited to mature men, whereas Zoomers might find it too grandpa-like.",08/16/24 05:59,LadyIva

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Phenomenal quality.

Another reviewer below compared this to Terre D'Hermes and they are correct.

This is a beautiful citrus blast; the citrus here is that organic, gritty lemon rind. This is in comparison to say Versace Pour Homme where the citrus is smooth. Both great but very different.

Longevity is excellent, it lasts for hours with only two sprays.

Unisex but slightly masculine leaning.

It's quite linear to me. It hasn't changed much on my skin; the citrus and vetiver are constant.

I strongly recommend this but if you have Terre D'Hermes Eau Givree it might be redundant.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Wow, where has this been all my life?

Zingy citrus on a bed of smooth lavender and crispy vetiver, inflected with pink pepper and sage. Aromatic and beautiful in its simplicity, exactly the type of fragrance I enjoy. The ingredients in this smell exceptionally natural, as with all ADP fragrances.

This is understated casual sophistication. I'm headed to Sicily and Portugal in September, and I already know this will be my daily driver on that trip.

This is one of the best in the ADP lineup.

Edit: I'm surprised nodody is mentioning that much-appreciated oak moss in the late stages of the dry down. It's strange that it is not included in the listed notes above, as it's most definitely there.",06/07/24 07:10,delancy
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"It's a vetiver bomb, fresh and citrusy, with a spicy green plant sharpness, spices, grapefruit, and lots of lemon peel. There's also something of propolis and citronella. It's an entire core of vetiver surrounded by sharpness and freshness. Definitely, it's the spiciest and most aromatic in the line, just as Colonia Pura is the most floral. It also tends more towards the masculine side. Especially in its opening, it has a bit of the citrus note from Dior Homme Cologne (probably my favorite citrus note), but Colonia Futura lasts much longer on the skin. It's like Terre d'Hermès with its citrusy vetiver, but replacing the very ripe, almost overripe, orange of Hermès with lemon and lemon peel.

It's the offspring of the original Colonia (light musk, vetiver, bergamot, and moss) and the original Eau Sauvage (sharp lemon, vetiver, moss, vetiver, lemon, and vetiver). As mentioned, vetiver, vetiver, vetiver—earthy and sharp, it even reminds me of string instruments like cellos and violins with their varnished wood (a very pleasant association, actually).

Contrary to the line's reputation, this one lasts for hours on the skin, remaining fresh and sharp. It's a pointed and delicious perfume.",06/05/24 10:03,danilodeathayde
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"After depleting my sample, I've got a giant 6oz bottle of Colonia Futura on the way. I've been searching for a natural, citrus forward scent for the mornings, as I love a blast of citrus to rid me of the demons. But not one that hangs around like a demon. Like a bowl of grapefruit or large pour of orange juice to set the day off right.

Although there's no orange in this, it's all lemon with grapefruit playing second fiddle. Very natural, realistic, and non-synthetic citrus which sticks around just barely into the heart. The lavender isn't hairspray like, powdery, or barbershop-y. The vetiver is not smoky or too sharp, but a light, crispy green. This is hard to find!

The herbal, green, and aromatic heart and base sends this into love territory for me. It give this some legs and depth that I feel makes Colonia Futura timeless. Hence the quibbles with the name—this is way more timeless/classic than futuristic, as there are no oddball notes that call to mind what we dream of when we hear the word ""future"". I do love good synthetic or weirdo notes when used purposefully (think Comme Des Garcons) but there is absolutely nothing synthetic, artificial or futuristic here.

Being purportedly 99% natural ingredients (1% to stabilize the formula according to their website) what does make this feel more modern, (rather than the bombastic base notes of the 70s and 80s) is there is no funky or chemical base that sticks around for ungodly amounts of time. Colonia Futura is a bit softer in projection for it, but longevity is still around 6-8 hours until it almost fully disappears. Most of it's time is spent close to the skin, but a bonus is I do not go anosmic nearly as easy as louder aromachemical driven scents. It also doesn't feature any heavy, dusty, musty, animalic (that I do like in moderation) notes that can turn some gentlemanly classics sour on my skin.

This is a feature and not a bug for me, as I can get a lively spritz in the AM with coffee, and be fully in the clear to wear a different scent in the evening without any interference. Plus, the polite nature of this ensures you will not be known as the person who wears way too much perfume. The flipside of the nuance and more reserved composition is this may come off as uninspired or too middle-of-the-road for those who are fragrance thrill seekers or performance kings/queens. I say queens, because I do think this has gender neutral appeal, for those who like natural perfumery and the listed notes, definitely give this a shot.

Overall, I love this a little more each time I wear it. The citrus opening is bracing (a plus for me) but smoothly gives way for a very satisfyingly simple lavender>sage>vetiver segueway that makes this extremely versatile for any season or occasion. I can't see myself getting sick of this at any point, hence buying a big ole bottle. It makes me feel like I have my life together!",05/13/24 11:41,MaxMellows

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Futura is an interesting name for a scent which doesn’t feel futuristic or modern in the slightest, instead rather demonstrating a very classic and old school fougere scent profile. That’s not a criticism at all however, I actually think the scent is quite beautiful.

The lavender in here is front and centre and smells photorealistic. That sharp green floral aspect is made even sharper by the juicy addition of lemon, bergamot and grapefruit which give it this classical men’s aftershave feel. A touch of dry sage and clean Vetiver round everything out very nicely.

This scent is technically brilliant. If you love classical fougeres this is a must try, especially for the price it can be found at. Albeit a simplistic scent profile, it does this masculine perfume family incredible justice.",04/19/24 11:12,RGH01

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"I hold the opinion that this brand is so perfectly positioned and marketed. The type of gentlemen that you assume wear and regularly purchase these fragrances are the type whom the phrase ‘Signature Scent’ accurately typifies. These scents are worn like an extra item of clothing or accessory. Nothing is dominant, all harmonised.

This fragrance is very much that, not outstanding not invasive or brash. Just there like a white pocket square with subtle yellow pin dots. Or like a very plain, very light blue neckerchief worn with a white linen shirt. Imperceptible but present.

I think I like it, but I also am certain I don’t think I care too much about it to wear it again.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"I really like this more naturalistic take on the original. Rather than blended into a soapy freshness the lemon, sage and vetiver all smell like themselves, yet the base of the original is still underneath and reveals itself after a couple of hours. It’s slightly medicinal, but I like that. There is also a salt and mineral quality that isn’t mentioned but makes this feel more oceanic than its brothers, and perhaps some cypress as well to make it extra crisp. No sweetness, little spice no florals either really. Colonia stripped down to its essence and taken to the beach then. It reminds a bit of the Italian minimalism often created by Profumum Roma. Might be my favourite of the line.",01/21/24 16:57,NoClock
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"I completely get the comparison to eau sauvage but this is so much better in my opinion. Maybe eau sauvage before reformulation? But not the current eau sauvage.
Initial opening has this crisp bright herbaceous citrous punch. Very uplifting and refreshing. After 15 minutes the middle notes come out to play with the top notes. The herbs and spices reveal themselves with a green welcome, a bit of florals too, maybe geranium or a slight light sour rose? Then when it settles and starts to dry down, you feel the lavender and sage wrapping everything so beautifully and set its course on a bedding of vetiver and very faint white musk.

It is a happy scent. I normally don't like old school green scents but this one made me change my mind. I am happy that i have it in my collection. 🤍",01/07/24 16:23,Perfumist007

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Strange no one has mentioned Creed Viking.

As soon as I put it on, that's what I thought of definitely more than eau Sauvage etc. In saying that, the DNA is similar but once the opening notes leave it doesn't resemble Viking as much.
This is like if Viking was a super sport/rock star, had a child who become also a somewhat similar successful career then they had a baby with Eau Sauvages child to create a similar DNA to both but both having different traits of its own, as for becoming a super star this perfume will not become that.

Here's why, this is not a mainstream DNA anymore that era has passed but for those who do like this DNA it will be a great fragrance.

I do really like this and believe this is a friendly more rounded and subdued Viking/Eau Sauvage. I will wear this in the office and I believe it can be versatile. It doesn't scream look at me nor drop kick others in the nose as if Chuck Norris just walked past and didn't like your face.

This is quite a beautiful fragrance, the selling point of 99% natural ingredients well its hard to tell but it does smell of quality and luxury. I got this at a steal of a price, I wouldn't pay retail for it ever. I have been on the fence about this fragrance for a while and glad I got it.

It's in my top 3 from Parma after Mirra & Essenza.

The breakdown:
DNA - 9 - Not unique but well blended
Appeal - 5 - Could go either way depending who you ask. . .
Longevity- 7.5 - Decent on this front
Projection - 6 - sits close to the skin after 10mins, not a bad thing though
Sillage - 7 - Unsure but assume it has a nice sillage

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Initial notes:
Please be advised that this is natural ingredients fragrance. That means initial notes are bit harsh with terpenes for a couple of minutes.
Great bitter lemon, nearly tonic with chinchona comes in quickly.

Mid:
Sage, bay leaf, resin, grapefruit pith — slightly in the vein of Terre d’Hermès.

Base:
Very tart vetiver, slightly toasted. Geranium too?

Performance:
Excellent for a cologne in terms of both longevity and projection. Not a particularly strong sillage it seems.

Value:
It’s worth looking around for good offers. Up to 80-100 $/€ differences. I got 180ml for 90€ but saw it in shops for up to 180€.

Meta:
Natural is one buzzword and I like that thought. It feels and smells rustic and a bit unpredictable like nature itself. It is both classic and new/modern at the same time.

Thoughts:
Great summer scent, but good base makes it suitable for both colder and more formal settings too. There are enough hints of oomph for evening wear, but if you insist on sweetness for winter this is not it. It is dry but in the same way that a fruity white wine is normally perfectly dry.

It also seems to avoid most categories, Someone called it a colonia fougère which I thought was quite accurate. Very exciting.",10/24/23 12:04,Opato

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Futura is a pleasant, good-quality warm weather scent. A flanker of sorts of Colonia, the focal point of this house, CF can be best described as a cologne-fougère. Featuring a bright, fresh citrus opening and developing into a lavender-led vetiver scent, it is an elegant masculine spring/summer scent.

CF opens with a bright citrus accord, radiantly fresh and reminiscent of Colonia. I get zesty lemon and tart grapefruit in particular. It quickly becomes aromatic thanks to the herbal notes that follow. Lavender is quite prominent for a time, complemented by soft peppery spices, paving the way to the vetiver-dominant drydown.

The vetiver is dry and woody, very aromatic and slightly earthy. The vetiver used here is top-quality, bringing to mind Guerlain Vetiver, the gold standard of vetiver scents. The faded citrus lingers, and this alongside the spices complements the vetiver to perfection. It is aromatic and restorative, but also a wearable, casually elegant scent. It fades to a musky vetiver skin scent. Sillage and longevity are moderate.

Light and fresh for warm weather, CF also has more body and better performance than a classic cologne, making it ultimately transeasonal. An excellent fresh fougère, this is a great everyday masculine scent that is a road less travelled. 4.5/5.",09/16/23 06:24,Enrium

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"This is literally the only Acqua Di Parma fragrance I like, long term.
Several of their fragrances are nice and pleasant at first but the dry down is always disappointing to me.
I just brought my bottle out of storage for summer and was moved to write a review.

This is a star in that it is not the same-old stank musk base that so many fragrances are.

It is bright, crisp and classy.
Opening is a dry, peppery citrus mix.
Also, seems like there is Angelica or juniper in there but the notes are not listed.
Pretty linear wear, which I appreciate because there’s nothing more disappointing than spraying a perfume, loving the smell, spending a lot of money on a bottle and having it change to a completely different and off-putting dry down and/or lasting note.

Good on ADP for having the guts to release a fragrance that doesn’t smell like vanilla, Tonka, musk, oud or syrup like most.

SAGE live and pumping in the sun & soil

Lived in the sierra foothills of CA for a bit & this instantly takes me back to swimming in big Chico creek late August surrounded by sage, foxtail (dry golden grass) & manzanita. The scent of the pine forest up the hill washing down with the cold mountain water.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Futura?? More like Colonia Pasta… If “99% all-natural ingredients” is futuristic, weren't all perfumes 100% natural until the IFRA started banning the natural stuff? Whatever. Either way, the name is way off from what this is: Masculine vetiver citrus as traditional as it gets! The sage comes to the fore after the beautiful lemon opening. I rate the sage as the strongest note in the late opening/mid. Dry, sun-sweetened sage in full glory. It’s quite bracing and smells natural. The citrus hangs around in the background longer than I expected, and of course the vetiver comprises the lingering base. This is a pungent, sharp vetiver- nothing smoky or earthy at all.
Futura is a simple, natural, beautiful Italian men’s fragrance. If you enjoy classics like Chanel Pour Monsieur, Loewe Pour Homme, or Eau Sauvage, I can’t imagine you wouldn’t love this. Perhaps the perfumers at ADP have not learned from the past and are doomed to repeat it. For those of us who love this kind of fragrance, Ignorance is bliss.",05/05/22 17:14,DrNDJas

C.L.U.B. Is a lot different from Club. I prefer Club, and find the new version to be a more modern and youthful reform of the original while not strictly adhering to the dna of the original (albeit I do catch whispers of the og in there somewhere)

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"@ts01 the Club is nice. Minty, fresh, and a bit classic/old school. I am enjoying it at the moment and while I find it to be somewhat one dimensional compared to others in the ADP line (including its replacement C.L.U.B., which is significantly brighter/more modern), I’m nonetheless really enjoying it’s herbal and very natural green vibe… it’s like a sophisticated and very un-synthetic take on Brut (which I’d love to find a niche version of) in some passing regard.
Regarding Futura, I’m not sure why both myself and the sales associate got the pickles note… it’s seems perhaps that the sage may have been a bit concentrated in the direct blast to the back of my hand that I used to test it., or else the wood note somehow soured (?).. I really dug the liveliness of it, but the pickles vibe was legit and undeniable to us. I get how that assessment may offend some, but that was the impression we got at the time…Will try it again soon to see if the impression persist, otherwise I’ll acquire Essenza or Cipresso at some point this week as they both tested rather nicely for me. Just wished ADP as a whole had stronger lasting power.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Futura is very much a well thought-out, smooth vetiver scent, so not your traditional colonia based on citrus or soapy neroli notes.

The opening is a bit misleading and comes across as really harsh. In fact I’m not even sure the citrus in the opening does the overall fragrance much justice. Luckily that aspect doesn’t last.

Once the heart notes start pumping out, the fragrance smooths considerably and turns very green. The sage and lavender provide this part which is where things turn quite pleasant to my nose. There is also the gentlest of sweetness at this point supported with a faint hint of woodiness below it. It stays very green. In fact by this point, you may wonder if you’re dressed in camouflage or lying in a herb patch.

The vetiver enters with some moss, but these aspects simply underpin the green sage and lavender accord which sits on top throughout. The whole accord makes for a herbaceous, aromatic green scent.

I can’t wait to put this on in the warmer months, but even in the winter it has proved unique, vibrant and uplifting. In my opinion it’s everything that the hash-up known as Colonia Club should have been. My faith in AdP may just be restored with this scent.",04/26/22 13:20,rum
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"This is a Fragrance for those with taste. When I was new into fragrances I disliked this, I preferred mainstream brands like invictus or sauvage.

This will instead get you recognised as a classy, clean and sophisticated man.

As for the smell it smells fresh and citrusy mixed with pepper. The vetiver comes in the dry down as it settles.
Longevity isn’t bad but it doesn’t project for that long, I’d give it an hour/ hour half projection.

It is a very formal, office scent, that is well suited for warm and hot weather during daytime.
Sillage, projection and longevity are average; but the quality of the very natural smell is excellent.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"25-Female. I smelled this at Nieman Marcus and after spraying the tester paper just 2x, I immediately recognized an aroma that I love so deeply: oakmoss. I'm very new to the niche Perfume world and have tried now about 50-60 perfume niche samples up to this point, so im still learning about scent ""profiles"" and notes, but several years ago I discovered oil perfumerie ""For Strange Women"" (earthy, animalic, antique and witchy type scents) and without knowing the whole ordeal in the Perfume world about oakmoss, I fell in love with it in FSW's scents (see: November in the Temperate Deciduous Forest which features mushroom, oakmoss, etc.) So naturally I have been trying whatever niche perfumes I come by that feature oakmoss in the formulation and I thought that this one would be a fave in my ""fougere"" stock because it smelled so wonderful in store, but I bought a bottle secondhand and while officially wearing it on the skin, it seems to really be lacking something. After 5-10 mins, the crisp citruses are gone and I'm left with a very weak oakmoss scent (very sad). I really don't think my skin composition pulls out the Vetiver very much because I have a few Vetiver scents and this one bares no resemblance to them. Someone in the reviews compared it a bit to TF Grey vetiver (which i love) and i personally cannot pick up any similiarities between the two. Colonia Futura could have had a lot of potential, but for me (could be my body chemistry), it falls very flat. It doesn't eminate from my skin beyond a couple inches after 20minutes of wear, and it seems to lack a lot of depth you'd think it would have based on the notes. It's definitely a very light ""fougere/chypre"" which makes it wearable for those intimidated by the typically bold and intense earthy scents that define these profiles. I also don't find this terribly masculine as others said. It's crisp, light, and a tad earthy which could fit anyone depending on what you like. Anyway, I had higher hopes for this one, expecting a heart of rich oakmoss, but its honestly disappointing. I'll still use it, but only for the purpose of not wasting it. I have many other perfumes that do what this can't. Several of my oil perfumes from For Strange Women definitely trump this one by far.",02/21/22 16:52,Tnbarthule
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Persolaise interviewed Paola Paganini from Acqua Di Parma on his YouTube channel and she briefly discussed Colonia Futura. (She is so charming!) She says it's all naturally derived fragrance compounds and quite specifically a project by Acqua Di Parma to pursue sustainable fragrance based on naturals, the old fashioned way. So I bought it blind. The ingredients even include OAKMOSS.

Well it smells great and not like anything I know today. Futura is rustically bracing and reminds me of something very fresh and fragrant but certainly NOT a designer fragrance. Possibly a bug spray or scented soap from my youth. A hippy might enjoy this. I wouldn't say its a simple composition rather its uncomplicated smelling and a bit like Italian and especially Spanish cologne splashes - those big bottles one can buy in supermarkets to use in summer months or after a bath. I can imagine this being rejected by many noses today. Or some might feel its not worth the price, in comparison to those budget cologne waters. My nose adjusts quickly nowadays so I like this for now. Wait and see if that likability endures. The opening alone rewards any effort to experience it. Don't pass up the opportunity to spray this on if you see it at the fragrance counter. Also, Futura surely can be something to spray onto another fragrance that lacks a dynamite top.",01/20/22 10:46,Mystères du Château de Dé

Nothing very new but a pleasant Cologne, unisex leaning masculine gentleman side. Could fit all year. Reminds me of Uomo by Lorenzo.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,Grassy Vetiver with that signature Colonia opening. Citrus is short lived and vetiver is what i get after 5-10 mins of spraying the fragrance. Slightly powdery green notes with clean vetiver. Quality is top notch just like every other ADP. For me this one was not something special. It has a slight resemblance to TF Grey Vetiver in the composition of the fragrance but TF smells a bit modern and retains its freshness for a longer time.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"As much as i like the various offerings of Acqua di Parma (Colonia Assoluta and Intensa being my favourites), this Futura is quite 'meh'.
Forget the pyramid as it has been displayed above: no big citrus, no bergamot and no pepper detectable here.

Futura is a vetiver fragrance, with grass, fir and juniper all along.
In a word, a light fougere.
It is indeed green and refreshing, but not a cuddly drydown nor calming as its siblings are.
It is dry. Like a phrase Hemingway would write.

Very masculine (i really cannot pull it off, and bear in mind that in summer with these torrid temperatures I sustain mainly on fresh cologne, even masculine ones), as I said vetiver takes the lead front end to back end.

Longevity nil. Sillage... in your bubble, for half an hour.
To me, a huge pass.",08/11/21 09:46,LaContessina

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"It’s nice...but nothing really unique. On my skin, I get a vetiver dominant scent. If you really enjoy ADP’s beautiful citrus openings, this one might let you down. It’s pretty earthy from the start.

Opens with a gentlemanly soft citrus. As it dries down, the spicy lavender/vetiver takes over. As it dries down more, if becomes a soft earthy vetiver scent. Gentlemanly, professional vibe…not really a casual scent.

Longevity was 6/7 hours on me. Projection is average. Certainly masculine and one could rock this year round...although best for warmer months.

Overall, it’s not bottle worthy for me. It’s nice...but I already own a few fragrances that do what this does. I’ll enjoy my healthy decant...but that’s about it.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"maybe the name ""futura"" is not the best, the fragrance in itself is nothing really new, but i have to say this is a different take on the a.d.p. colonia line, more green and herbal, and the most important thing to point out is....futura smells AMAZING!. fantastic opening with bergamot, lime and grapefruit. the drydown is great with a beautiful lavender and, most of all, vetiver. the note of vetiver is the protagonist of the drydown and i understand the comparison between terre d'hermes(edt and intense vetiver) and futura. t.d.h. in my opinion has a better performance, but futura is definitely more natural smelling. both are great, but futura has that italian gentleman vibe with a soft ""sense of humor"", it's not too serious and formal. i love this scent, one of my favourite of the a.d.p. line, and the price of the tester is very affordable. performance is good, slightely above average: good projection in the first 1,5 hour, then more silent. longevity about 6-7 hours, not bad for a summer scent. for casual and formal situations, for a well dressed man over 30. glad to have it in my collection!
acqua di parma futura ha un nome altisonante, forse non porta niente di futuristico ma bisogna dire che è un pò diverso dalle colonie della stessa linea e soprattutto odora divinamente! mix riuscitissimo di bergamotto, lavanda e vetiver, tutto molto naturale e ben orchestrato. non per giovanissimi, io non lo sono e quindi ci sto a pennello. ottimo acquisto!

A very intoxicating summer gem. I plan to use it this summer in mid Dalmatia where it will be perfect.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Futura is the latest in the Colonia range. It takes a slightly different turn to most of the recent ones. It opens with a projection that is moderate for the first 60 - 90 minutes before becoming a skin scent and lasts somewhere between six and seven hours in total.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Futura opens with a burst of vetiver, sage, lavender, lemon and grapefruit. I wouldn't say there's any bergamot and I never got any pink pepper at any point. It opens as a herbal citrus. 20 minutes in it becomes noticeable that the vetiver is a very earthy one, and a dry earthy one at that. 25 minutes in and the lemon and grapefruit top notes are fading fast and the vetiver is the clear dominant note. Around two and a half hours in you have a herbal core sitting on top of the dominant vetiver with a tiny bit of grapefruit on top, all with a very intimate sillage. It fades significantly so that four hours in you have to smell your arm directly in order to smell the perfume. It lingers for another two to three hours.

This one goes well layered with Acqua di Parma Colonia Assoluta in Villa where the latter's cypress in the woody notes offsets the dryness of the earthy vetiver in Colonia Futura, and the spices and flowers in Assoluta in Villa give it a brighter, more balanced, more nuanced effect while staying resolutely traditional.

You can also layer it well with Acqua di Parma's Chinotto di Liguria. There is a brightness and bitterness that works well by combining the chinotto with the lemon and grapefruit at the top; the geranium, jasmine and cardomom work together and complement each other well in the heart notes; and the patchouli and musk add depth and richness to the base without drowning out the vetiver. Again, this combination remains resolutely traditional.

You could also layer it with AdP Bergamotto di Calabria to give it a dose of bergamot led freshness at the top and warmth in the middle but it can be a bit hit and miss depending on how you get along with the flowers and ginger. Nevertheless, the effect of the citron in Bergamotto di Calabria really enhances the opening of Colonia Futura and takes it in a different direction.

In short, Colonia Futura works much better when you combine it with something that enhances one of its main aspects.",04/05/21 08:24,mutatismutandis

Performance is good, last longer than any from the family, and silage is slightly better as well. It's nice and fresh, clean and airy, if you into vetiver this is a must.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"I like the concept of a fragrance made of 99% natural ingredients. I bought a bottle and really wanted to like this it and be my go to Acqua Di Parma. Unfortunately it is not as nice as the original Colonia, Essenza, Pura, or Intensa.

It is very herbal: the sage is very present throughout and almost overbearing. If you like herbal fragrances this would be great but is quiet a step away from Colonia (soapy, classic) Essenza (Neroli twist on the Colonia) Pura (more floral with ozonic notes) or Intensa (more woody with leather).

I did wear it just a few days and somehow I feel that it is too underwhelming. It doesn't make you smell great or soapy/clean so if you are planning to blind buy I would say don't do it. If you are looking for a floral, nice and modern one I would go with Colonia Pura. Of course the classic Colonia is a great option too. Both blind buys for me but not in this case. Some previous reviews mention this being more for an old/man or woman. I don't think this is the issue here: is really the herbal/sage taste that would be a turn off to many people.",10/11/20 04:39,commodore64
Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"A worthy variation on the theme of AdP’s Colonia. The opening is more similar to the original than to Essenza, but it is more astringent and slightly bitter. Lemon, grapefruit, and bergamot dominate in the first several minutes. As the astringent opening mellows, clary sage mingles with the bitter grapefruit notes to create something special. The blend of bitter and herbal notes almost suggests black licorice, as interpreted by AdP. Lavender is present, but not overpowering. Over time, the citrus fades and a restrained vetiver joins the mix. I like it more every time I wear it. It’s like a less powdery Colonia or Essenza without the neroli. Not groundbreaking, but compelling nonetheless.",10/03/20 23:44,To the Tower once more

Citrus-salty sparkling opening, incredible incense-like lavender-herbal middle, and a deliciously ""smokey"" vetiver note at the end of a beguilingly well-developed offering from ADP. This fragrance is a classic case of great ingredients working synergistically to create something where the sum is greater than the parts.
And, while leaning towards being a skin scent, this stuff still has considerable saying power. It does not, however, scream at folks when you enter the room. I LOVE smelling this relaxing yet energizing scent; and have received a number of compliments on it. Plus, because of the amazing mixture of notes and dry down, it's a year-round scent. This is not *like* ADP's other colognes -- except in a distant cousin sort of way.

Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma,"Wow - I tried this today at Harrods and really loved it. I can be quite difficult with my perfumes, especially with fresh citrusy perfumes and particularly with some of the AdP perfumes. But this one surprised me. In spite of my already ridiculously huge perfume collection, this one has a given spot in the fresh-herbaceous category.
It's composed of three overlapping accords that perfectly tie into and reinforce each other. First accord is the citrus top note. A perfect marriage of bergamot, grapefruit, lemon with a hint of pepper to spice things up. The top note is really well balanced and not too sweet, leaving a slight bitterness at the end. Then the heart is made up the dynamic duo of clary sage and lavender. Here the the herbaceous notes perfectly merge with the bergamot to add some depth to the volatile citrus notes, almost pulling the citrus down and together whilst also lifting up the woody earthy accord that makes up the base of the perfume. Out of all the perfumes that I have tried so far this year, this is one of the best. It is an outstanding perfume and remarkably balanced. Worth trying.",08/29/20 16:35,Cragrat

Futura started out with a blast of mint at first, and was very fresh and citrusy. And I liked it, it then evolved into a much deeper and complex fragrance with some woods and although not listed, i get vetiver. Right now sniffing arm i can tell you its a very classic, refined and elegant fragrance, perhaps to my mind geared to the older (the touch of lavender is that association, to my nose anyway).

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The green mandarin at the opening is fresh and pretty, but it fades quickly and the neroli becomes dominant (not a good thing for me as I don’t love neroli). I love both ambrette and patchouli but I’m not getting much of either one—mostly a fresh white floral similar in my mind to many designer offerings. It’s nice, and I could see people being perfectly happy with it, it’s just not for me.",06/23/25 10:03,josephinamaria

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Smelled this at an airport in Italy in 2023 Nov. it was on my wish list for months and I finally got it. Such a lovely floral fragrance.

I just wish it lasted and projected.",02/06/25 02:50,HooperG
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is a mild fruity floral for young peeps. The titular osmanthus (which smells like apricots) is only detectable at the very end of the scent's development, so the name is kinda misleading. The fragrance lasts a fair bit, but its projection is abysmal - literally half an hour after application it turns into a skin scent. Not worth the money.",01/31/25 15:06,LadyIva

I'm definitely getting a white gummy bear scent as well lol. i quite like it, but you would think it would have some longevity at this price point. i believe it lasted no longer than 3 hours.",12/23/24 10:19,pengedyr
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Aqua di Parma’s Osmanthus EDP is a beautiful, light, aethereal, sweet floral with strong fruity nuances and a subtle spiciness.

The star of the show for me is as expected the osmanthus flower, combined closely together with peony, pink pepper and a very bright mandarine. The ambrette creates a soft, velvety base, together with a clean patchouli leaf. Everything is very smooth, flawlessly blended and perfectly balanced.


It’s perfect for spring and summer season and smells very pretty and feminine. Is it worth the hefty price tag though? Not quite sure because of how it performs. Yes, patchouli in the base usually helps fragrances with longevity, which is moderate for this scent, but sits close to the skin. It’s an intimate scent but nonetheless very beautiful!

I am sold if I could get it for a decent price that would match in my mind the mediocre performance!",10/04/24 10:06,Maya lilac
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Lacks body and falls a bit flat. There are light florals and sugary sweetness on top and an amberwoody/musky/patch base but nothing in between to connect these poles so the scent comes off diluted and poor with a dominating earthy muskiness. Initially I also get a hint of halitosis.
Not bad but nothing special either, especially considering the price. Recommend sampling first.",09/13/24 14:09,Blueberries
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,I don’t like the mandarin on first spray. It’s green and smells slightly fecal on my skin.

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I am obsessed with Acqua di Parma. I got my s/o Sandalo and I’ve been trying to collect Acqua di Parmas different scent offerings ever since. I like Osmanthus. It’s an aquatic floral, citrus scent with pink pepper to add that bit of spice to make things interesting. I think it leans feminine but I know some young men who wear it and it smells amazing on them too. It is interesting enough to not be boring, but inoffensive enough for a variety of palettes",05/15/24 17:06,COLOREDGIRLSHUFFLE
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Pleasant enough, but lacking the airiness that I’ve come to expect of osmanthus. I tried this and Yuzu from the same brand. This was initially softer and nicer but the Yuzu developed better over time while Osmanthus simply faded. I wouldn’t spend £250 on this, I would probably prefer the l’Occitane Osmanthus or Shay and Blue White Peaches.

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,Beautiful summer floral. It’s the PERFECT “fresh out of the shower” scent. It smells like an expensive hand soap you put in the guest bathroom and forbid any members of the household from using. Unfortunately it lasts about as long as actually being fresh out of the shower or the scent of hand soap. I wish I could justify the price but I feel like needing to reapply every hour or two would mean spending $300 on a bottle I’d run out of in a month.,08/22/23 16:25,ljsmith
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Really nice wearable floral. On my skin, the osmanthus goes in more of an apricot direction (rather than any leather). Distinctive enough to not be a generic (boring) designer wear, but safe enough to wear on any occasion.",07/08/23 05:55,Ilikewhatilike
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"ADP Osmanthus smells like high-end hotel shampoo. I don't usually go for fragrances in this genre, but I really do enjoy Osmanthus, especially that lovely dry-down! This is florals done very well & the patchouli in the base isn't harsh, it actually blends quite nicely.

Osmanthus is a perfect everyday fragrance, especially in spring. This isn't a big statement grabber so she's definitely an appropriate perfume for the office or any type of environment where you don't want to offend anyone.",06/14/23 00:49,Xela_529
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"this fragrance is stereotypically more feminine because it's a sweet white floral, which i feel like most people associate with feminine scents, but i could totally see a guy rocking this during the summer heat and just smelling so refreshing.

to my nose, i'm first and foremost hit with tart, juicy mandarin, and it's tied down by the white florals, which help give it a powderiness as well.

it's a beautiful scent, very simple and easy to digest. i could totally see this being someone's signature summer scent. but i just can't see myself buying a full bottle of a citrusy floral for $300.",06/06/23 18:51,96am
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Understanding the house Aqua di Parma for what it is, I really do love Osmanthus. I've owned and loved Magnolia Nobile, as well as a few other Acqua di Parma fragrances, so I know this house's signature notes and I know what to expect. Typical for this ""line"" of perfumes, as well as most of the Aqua di Parma fragrances, Osmanthus does not disappoint because its notes are simple, high end, expertly executed and well defined.

Osmanthus is no exception with definable top notes that are citrusy & spritzy neroli and green mandarin orange. These opening notes beautifully blend with middle floral notes of peony, other gentle white florals & ambrette (musk mallow). Something that tickles the nose, which I assume is pink pepper makes an appearance. And all of these lovely fragrances & ingredients perfectly land with Osmanthus, more musk and slight patchouli.

Now, I'm reminded by some folks that this Osmanthus doesn't approach the fragrance of the real thing. And I'm not quite sure I've ever experienced fresh, true Osmanthus. But whatever it is, Osmanthus is a lovely, ethereal, soft & delightful perfume fragrance, surely not offensive in any way.

I would never define this fragrance as unisex, as it reads completely feminine to my tastes. Unfortunately like many Aqua di Parma perfumes, longevity isn't great @3-4 hours, silage is moderate.

I love Osmanthus a whole lot. Just not sure if it is full bottle worthy ONLY because of the price point and because of my history with Aqua di Parma fragrances. Sometimes, I just need a brief departure.

In general, this perfume is a 9/10.",03/18/23 12:01,tonileefiore

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is a really good one. I agree it's waayy overpriced but damn it smells so good! Will probably get an FB for the scent alone. I saw this being compared to Inle so I checked its notes and the moment I saw jasmine note, I'm out. I won't even bother comparing both scents since jasmine note is headache inducing to me.

I adore Osmanthus the way other people adore and repurchase Jo Malone's Wood Sage & Seasalt despite the performance lol. Will probably have to douse myself in this to last long on me lol.",11/26/22 13:13,ryoshiho97
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The top note is fresh with mandarin and the osmanthus comes out after a while. I like it and it is my daily perfume for working. It is not aggressive at all.

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is a soft white floral and fresh scent. Its main notes are osmanthus and neroli. That's about as much as there is to say about it. It is nice, however, as the simplicity of it is pleasant.

The performance is decent too. It felt very intimate on me, I couldn't really notice any sillage. It lasted for about 4-5 hrs at most on my skin. It is quite overpriced imo, and not worth it, unless if you have a lot of spending money.

6.5/10. The scent was nice but wasn't necessarily special. The performance wasn't more than average.",12/23/21 13:38,JessVanEgg
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"First thing first, as an Asian I can safely say that this is a Western perfumer's interpretation of osmanthus, and not a true recreation of the osmanthus scent. That said, I do think it's a pleasant one. This perfume has really strong projection and lasting power, so a word of caution to people who have sensitive noses: spray sparingly.

When I first wore it, I sprayed it on my collarbone and was greeted with the most overpowering, cloying scent of cheap jasmine essential oils. The longevity was good so unfortunately it gave me a headache the whole day.

Thankfully I gave it a second chance. This time I sprayed less and chose to spray it on my inner elbow instead of collar bone. That did wonders! I still think it smells more like a mixture of jasmine and magnolias, but it's pleasant and very feminine. However, it is on the expensive side, and I wouldn't pay full price for a bottle of it.

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"The osmanthus is a little shapeshifter in this EDP: at times I detect the leathery nuances of osmanthus absolute, at other times the apricot side. However, the osmanthus is always hidden behind sharper citrus and floral notes, and as I prefer the warmer and sweeter side of osmanthus, I did not find what I was looking for in this fragrance. All in all it is a nice fragrance if you are looking for something refreshing with citrusy and floral aspects, but I would not recommend it if you are looking for an osmanthus-centric fragrance.",09/03/21 08:08,KöbiD
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This smells so good when you first spray it, nothing like the top notes shown here but more like sugary sweet bubblegum osmanthus (not like the pink bubblegum, more like that really hard rubber-y gum that loses its taste in about 30 secs). As soon as it changes, it's disastrous. You know when you catch a cab on a hot summer day and the air freshener hanging off the rearview mirror has this like synthetic, loud smell that ends up giving you a headache? If you want that experience in a bottle, you can spend a whole lot of money on this perfume. The dry-down gives you some more osmanthus again and that's pleasant but you can tell it's still perfume-y in all the wrong ways. In short: generic, synthetic, overblended, smells much cheaper than it really is. If you're an osmanthus lover like me, I'd look elsewhere.",08/28/21 13:15,O+M+D
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"If you know how real osmanthus flowers smell and you are looking specifically for that in this perfume, you will probably be disappointed. The osmanthus scent here is more fruity than floral - it has an apricot character and is not too sweet or dense. Combined with the mandarin note, this perfume is a pleasant fruity floral and is easy to wear for spring and summer, but it does smell a bit synthetic (which I am okay with. )

HOWEVER, in my opinion, a scent that is very close to real osmanthus flowers (such as Serge Lutens Nuit de Cellophane) is probably more suitable as a room scent than a personal fragrance, because the sweet and dense (almost a little bit dusty) character can easily get cloying as a personal fragrance.",08/05/21 01:14,Murmur123123
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"On tester paper this smelled like peach/apricot tea. On my skin this pulled weirdly medicinal.

When I read the notes before receiving it, I thought I was not going to like it because I generally do not like floral fragrances. But I was so pleasantly surprised! To me, this is a ""fizzy"" floral; fresh and clean with the floral notes thinly veiled in the citrus and pink pepper. My only complaint is that it disappears after a couple of hours on my skin.
One other thought: To me, this is a VERY feminine fragrance and I would have a hard time envisioning it for a man. Thank you!",12/10/20 00:57,kmeid2

I am not really blown away by the Osmanthus note, but it does show itself prettily as it dries down. I was looking specificallly for Osmanthus fragrance, and this one does not quite scratch that itch for me. If you’re into Osmanthus, I recommend Perris Monte Carlo as a good, accessible, satisfying interpretation.

Osmanthus Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I’ve always had a goal of finding fragrances that remind me of my travels. Acqua di Parma’s Osmanthus is the Christmas that I spent in New Orleans. If you stroll through the Garden District in December, you will frequently get wafts of the blooms of the sweet olive trees - AKA osmanthus.

And this is as natural smelling as you’re going to find. Truly an archetype for accurate note representation. Sublime.

That being said, I wouldn’t blind buy this if you aren’t already familiar with the osmanthus flower. I do think I may have written this one off as being too intensely floral for my tastes had I not made the NOLA association and sought this out.

Mostly linear (no white musk in here), masculine, projects nicely, last long and it seemed like almost everyone likes it even though it is a niche scent that is somewhat unique. This is very very close to perfection. For such a natural citrus fragrance that has strength and prestige it is actually priced good compared to some of its peers due to the large bottle (price per ml).

Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,Note di colonia ii is a nice offering from acqua di Parma. The cardamom and Guiac wood here work well. This is a natural smelling fragrance that would work well in most weather. No real citrus to be found after it dries on skin the initial citrus notes just pull this into the air upon application and are gone leaving the wearer with an airy smooth wood effect. The basil in here adds a touch of contrast which works well here as it’s not completely photorealistic basil but just adds a mild green touch and connects whatever citrus present in the initial opening to its woody dry down. This scent is very close to skin and projection is faint. This is after all an EDC concentration. People may not notice this any more then they would the smell of soap on a person after a shower. It is however of superior quality compared to 90 % of things in my collection. This was a blind buy for me as I found it at a great price on Black Friday. I would never purchase this at full retail with that said the scent is wonderful and the bottle is stunning. I’d say this is more for collectors not the casual enthusiast. I’d say the closest thing I’d compare this to for reference is Ormonde man. Not the same scent but one could easily replace the other. Spring /summer smart casual or daytime dressed. The bottle though!!!!!!,12/31/22 17:55,Mrrob
Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,"This is really very special, but the notes in the perfume pyramid are a little deceptive. You would assume (particularly given that this is an ADP release) that this is essentially a citrus-heavy fragrance that, once those citrus notes have gone, evolves to a woodsy dry-down, as is the tried and tested formula for hundreds (at least) of other fragrances. In fact, aside from an opening 60-second burst of bergamot, I get very little citrus from Note di Colonia II which instead arrives almost straight from the bottle with a full-on Guaiac experience pushing straight through that citric top-line.

The Guaiac here is dense and dry but also super-smooth with none of the rubber/tarmac notes that can plague that note - it's a clever conjuring act, in fact, to present Guaiac as full-on and rich as this without it lurching into harshness. Nestling behind this is a clear herbal element coming from the interplay of basil and cardamon (I pick up hints of thyme, too?) which adds a depth and dimensionality that is perhaps serving to harness the Guaiac.

Slowly a creamy, almost coconutty sandalwood joins the party to partner the Guaiac and the interplay between these two kinds of wood is just beautiful and, for me, the absolute highlight of Colonia II. The quality of ingredients and sophistication of the blend is clear throughout.

Highly recommended for lovers of pure, natural (or at least natural, non-synthetic smelling) wood fragrances.",08/08/22 08:24,Jovian

Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,"Note II begins with a somewhat stingy, bitter leathery nuance. It is considerably brute, but sadly lacks attraction. I find it very gloomy. The fragrance is imbued by bitter botanicals to give it this effect. There are some resinoid notes in the backdrop that add an almost hazy, abrasive undertone. It combines with the woodsy and spicy accents to create a deep, brooding anti-ambiance, if I could describe it.

The citrus element isn't incredibly dominant. It's more of a fixative application, but you can certainly tell it's the bitters of orange stirring at the center. It makes the oversoul even more heady, and dare I say, off-putting.

I hate to use that word, but for what it would suggestively be attempting to accomplish (being a brute fragrance)—it is a vulgar, crude blend that I can't find any style in at all. It's like you're wearing a fine fragrance; and you finish using the bathroom; and you slip and fall, and your arm dunks inside the bowl leaving you with this.

In my initial impressions of Note II, it had a striking similarity I couldn't quite recall, and then it came to me looking at the notes: It strongly resembles a cross between Fan di Fendi Pour Homme & Fan di Fendi Acqua.

I wasn't really big on either of those, but to each their own. More importantly, I don't feel that Acqua di Parma really did anything significant to improve upon, or improvise these formulas. It doesn't seem to have any Acqua di Parma bespoke touch in any noticeable fashion.

The most enjoyable aspect of the fragrance was when it died down rather quickly. Something in the style of an Eau Fraiche. Let's be empathetic though—that's not a good thing to be celebrated at all. And certainly for the honor suggested of this line—a blatant lie.

Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,"From the 4 that I tried this one leans more toward masculinity, feels like old days scents gets a bit modernized, herbaceous woody and fresh with a bit of depth, the old style gentleman cologne, the scents are elegant and very nice and enjoyable, nothing ground breaking but nice to enjoy the modernized classic type of scents and to put your self in aura of simplicity elegance and class.

Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,"This (along with Note di Colonia I) was love at first sniff. In fact, the whole collection is superbly done. Shop around, the Note Collection be purchased at prices that mere mortals can afford. I hunted it down like a bloodhound, I was a little obsessed!

I have been a fan of AdP Essenza, a classic eau de cologne that epitomizes tuxedoed elegance, but other AdPs, while nice, never really excited me.

So I wasn't expecting the beauty of Note di Colonia II. Dry, sparkling, woody and slightly herbal aromatic that radiates class and sophistication without smelling nostalgic. Appropriate for all occasions, anytime, but I imagine it's cool dry citrus and woods would excel in heat. Not listed in the notes, but I think might be there, are pepper and something bitter, perhaps tomoato leaf, so so perfectly blended that no one note stands out. Nothing about this feels synthetic (although longevity suggests otherwise).

I get decent longevity, not a beast mode scent. This is better for night out at a concert, or a lovely dinner alfresco, than for a night out clubbing.",08/21/19 15:35,scott.lauze
Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,"One can feel that this one is a step up in terms of quality compared to their regular line.

While it is a very nice blend, the current retail price ($470) is simply ridiculous for that juice. One can have MUCH more interesting fragrances for that price.

Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,"This is my preferred one of the 3 and I bought the 150 ml bottle while still testing samples of #3 and 1 at home in various conditions, I'll buy them probably, too. BTW I don't understand how it is possible to write a review on a niche frag without having a significant sample at home - not even enough for me to write a review - or the full bottle: then only I can write about it. But maybe I'm still having much to learn ...

The opening is a magic combination between a set of citruses and an association between a soft cardamon and basil. Basil plays an original role as it adds a deeper and somewhat heavier effect to the citruses which are therefore difficult to individualize.
The Guaiac wood is present from the very opening with a definitely nuancing effect, just like the soft muscs' effects and a never invading sandalwood & vetiver. The citrus notes disappear only after several hours as magically as they opened, but in this composition everything is smooth, soft, and progressive, leaving no surprises. Even after 8 or 10 hours, the delicious skin scent is very close to the opening and its soft and peaceful evolution.

The longevity is impressive, and this is definitely not a Cologne in the common sense. The quality of ingredients and probably their concentration place this frag at least at the level of an EdP.

I don't quite agree with the sequential 3-act analysis of these scents symbolized by Puccini's opera Turando as presented by AdP: I rather feel that this example of modern parfumery plays with variations around a very original theme, maybe reflected by the central theme of Puccini's composition at the time.

Though I usually prefer floral scents, this is a true masterpiece as its softness and first class combination of non floral ingredients combines modernism with classicism in a very very original way. Great job for a first niche line, thanks AdP !",04/05/17 15:19,orpailleur
Note di Colonia II Acqua di Parma,"FIRST SNIFF: I was introduced to this part of the line by the ADP SA who was tending the perfume bar downstairs at the Houston Neiman's store. She laid out the three scents in this grouping and had me smell each in order. I was informed prior to smelling them that each one is stronger and more full bodied than the last. So the first in the series would be the lightest and most understated.

Like the first in the group, it immediately obvious that this is a well crafted, well-made scent. BUT, I'm immediately reminded of (at minimum) a dozen other scents made between 1998 and 2008 that had the word ""Sport"" or ""Black"" preceding or following the name. Apart from the fact it is well made and elegant, there are a few redeeming elements that give it an edge of sophistication and intrigue. For example, there is a hint of guaiac and an interesting musk that give it a bit of cleverness.

THE PICTURE IT PAINTS: This scent would be the crown jewel of a trust fund kid, whose taste in fragrance was informed exclusively by his tastes and exposure in HS and college. Only now, he wants something NO ONE else has (...but accidently he has made himself smell like everyone else did/does , just in a much more expensive and exlcusive manner.

IN THE BRAND FAMILY: Because the bottle is Lalique and it is so limited it may be worthy of a collector's cabinet. Or in the guest bathroom of your country club -- But if you are a niche lover this is not the star of the line. Niche lovers should reach for the dark brown colored ADP bottles IMO which hold the ingredient collection.

Full Bottle worthy? - NO
Sample worthy? - NO

PARTING THOUGHTS: Like an unbelievably well-made Crew paddle. The wood is expensive, rare and perfect, the craftsmanship is masterful with tedious attention to detail and the end product is awe inspiring, but the utility and need for such a piece, non-existant. It should have been left affixed to the wall of your bedroom or country club. In terms of the stereotypical sport scent of the 90' and 00's this is a masterful and undeniable specimen.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Sometimes opinions change over time, and that has certainly happened with Quercia. My previous review was based on a decant that could have been reformulated since. At any rate: What I found a bit annoying and synthetic a year or two ago has changed to the extent that I bought a full bottle and I am very happy about it.

Quercia is a modern fougère in EDP concentration that strikes a balance between oakmoss and coumarin that I absolutely love. While my decant from a few years ago had a somewhat plasticky connotation that got too much over a few hours wear, it is not present in my current bottle.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Today, my Acqua di Parma journey continues with another offering from the ""Signatures of the Sun"" collection: Quercia. As its Italian name translates to ""Oak,"" I'm stepping into this experience anticipating a robust, unequivocally masculine woody fragrance. While yesterday's review for Yuzu left me wanting more due to its surprising feminine lean and delicate performance, I imagine Quercia will be its bold and assertive opposite. Let's delve in and see if my assumptions hold.

Opening:
The opening is citrusy, spicy, and aromatic. The primary notes that announce themselves are lemon, Calabrian bergamot, cardamom, and pink pepper. Cardamom and Calabrian bergamot are the immediate stars. The cardamom is what my senses first register, with a powerful blast of warm spiciness, elegantly accompanied by an underlying aromatic quality. This isn't the tempered, designer-friendly cardamom found in fragrances like D&G The One; this is a far more assertive, confident expression of the note, with a heavy emphasis on its spicy and warm facets. Trailing behind this is the Calabrian bergamot, which provides a healthy dose of luminous citrus, infused with the characteristic aromatic and fresh spiciness for which bergamot is known. Next, the lemon and pink pepper join the chorus. The lemon builds upon the bergamot's citrus foundation, adding a brighter, more tart accord than the bergamot could supply alone. Lastly, the pink pepper contributes an additional layer of fresh spiciness in the background, a subtle, tantalizing prickle that comes close to tickling the nose, but never quite does.

Dry Down:
The dry down is spicy, warm, and sweet. The primary notes I now discern are cardamom, tonka bean, moss, and cedar. Cardamom and tonka bean become the most prominent players. The cardamom remains a highlighted note, carrying the same warm, spicy, and aromatic accord from the opening. However, it is now met with equal force by the tonka bean, which unfurls a blanket of sweet warmth, effectively tempering the cardamom's tenacious nature. This harmonious duo is then complemented by the subtle contributions of moss and cedar. The moss manifests as a nuanced, earthy woodiness, adding a layer of depth to the predominantly spicy and sweet accords. Lastly, the cedar provides an additional woody texture, with just a delicate touch of that ""pencil-shaving"" accord that is so characteristic of the note.

Performance:
The initial projection is strong, reaching a distance of around six feet. Sillage mirrors this strength, leaving an easily noticeable scent trail. After approximately three to four hours, this robust projection held steady at about four to six feet, and the scent trail remained distinctly perceptible. At the seven to eight-hour mark, the projection had settled to about arm's length, and while the scent trail was fainter, it was still present. The fragrance eventually receded into a skin scent around the nine to ten-hour mark, demonstrating a respectable longevity. It is worth noting that this does seem to be a fragrance that one could go nose-blind to, as evidenced by the fact that I felt like it wasn't performing at all after a few hours, but my wife confirmed that it indeed was.

When to Wear:
Quercia is an archetypal fall/winter fragrance, versatile enough to be worn in both the daytime and evening. The scent profile of Quercia is remarkably adaptable, and I could envision it working effortlessly for casual outings, formal events, or special occasions. The only environment where I feel it wouldn't quite fit is an office setting, simply because its projection and character are a bit too assertive.

Blind Buy:
I find myself without a direct comparison in my collection that could adequately capture this fragrance's essence. However, if you are drawn to sweet and spicy scent profiles with a confident, assertive nature, Quercia would be well worth your consideration.

Final Verdict:
Quercia turned out to be a rather confusing experience, for a couple of distinct reasons. The first: its name literally translates to ""Oak,"" yet there is no discernible, dedicated oak note. While oakmoss is present, it never truly takes the spotlight, manifesting more as an earthy undertone rather than a primary woody accord. The second reason: the fragrance itself never struck me as particularly woody. From the opening and extending well into the dry down, it was a profound expression of warm spiciness, with cardamom serving as the undeniable highlight. In the dry down, it inherited a beautiful sweetness from the tonka bean and a mere touch of woodiness from the oakmoss and cedar, yet the overall impression remained predominantly spicy and warm. Moving on to performance, Quercia was entirely on par with what I experienced from Oud & Spice. It delivered a strong projection and a noticeable scent trail for at least the first few hours, and its tenacity continued until around the nine-hour mark, where it gracefully settled into a skin scent. In terms of usability, Quercia proved to be far more versatile than I had initially assumed. While it is undoubtedly a fragrance for cooler weather, it is adaptable enough for virtually any occasion outside of an office environment. Quercia isn't what I would call a mass-appealing fragrance destined to solicit an enormous amount of compliments, but I also don't believe anyone would perceive it as ""bad"" or challenging either. To conclude, Quercia is my favorite Acqua Di Parma I have reviewed thus far, yet it still didn't quite wow me enough to warrant the purchase of a full bottle. I have plenty more ADP fragrances to explore, so here's hoping at least one of them leaves an indelible impression on me.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is one of those that the main accords breakdown actually gets really accurate. Everything everyone else is saying is accurate for this too.
This is not a strong cedar, patchouli fragrance FYI. It is slight citrus spicy aromatic and for sure reminds me of a better version of a body spray I wore when I was 16-20. I was not into fragrances at that time and admittedly did not have the best concept of personal hygiene. I was clean, but these days I take pimp showers, exfoliating and cleansing my whole body, then lotion and fragrance. Even though I was a scrub back in the day, I wore stuff that smelled like this and got mad ass fr. Don't dog the body spray. However, those body sprays don't last but a couple hours and this is a great 5-7 hour fragrance. Explosive at first, but tones down to a nice scent bubble of 3 ft. I have a bunch by Acqua di Parma and this is probably top 5 for sure. This is definitely a man's scent 30 and up.

Sort of intriguingly herbal, with a gently sweet undercurrent that comes out more in the drydown. But after wearing it for a bit, I quickly started to hate it. It kind of smells like a men's deodorant or body wash to me, and it's pretty strong. There's also a weird, sharp, chemical smell in it that I'm struggling to put my finger on. I got the same strange, harsh smell when I tried on Blue Moon Ginger Dash by Kilian.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I've worn ADP fragrances for years and have owned most of them, and tested all of them. Most people sleep on this one, but it's low key pretty good. You must like tart (pink pepper, lemon, bergamot) fragrances to enjoy this. This is a modern ADP and not the classic variety, which are even better and are being discontinued 🫤. It's got some base ambrox but it's not dosed into the stratosphere.

Oakmoss (evernyl), Geranium (very slight mint) and petigrain give it an another reserved green layer, and a little patch give it some depth, but still suitable for the heat. My only beef is the tonka sweetness in base. I could do without it. It's a cousin to the extremely expensive Mousse De Chen and easier for most people to wear.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Leathery warm spice petitgrain fougere

Quercia is much more than I expect. Having sampled most of AdP in a period of 2 weeks, I remember arriving at a point where almost all AdP fougeres (the OG Colonia aside) smelling near identical, dry fresh and then green woody and stark with a bland vintage evocation in the background desperately trying to convince me it would make me smell like a character pulled out of the golden age of Italian cinema.

Then I got to Quercia. Confused by the name, as my Italian doesn’t encompass the name of individual trees (oak in this case), I knocked me out of the redundant fougere trance and made me pause for a second.

First of all, let me begin by saying Quercia doesn’t smell at all like the oakmoss it promises to be, or rather minimally so. My father still wear numerous vintage fougeres and I can confidently say it is not an effective replica of the real thing.

However Quercia is nonetheless lovely. From the start I get a bitter green herbal essence, petitgrain mixing with warm spices mixing with the leathery patchouli faux-oakmoss that remind me a bit of the last few hours of Aventus. This is contrasted beautifully with an intense tonka/coumarin creamy sweet softness, the end result sitting somewhere between Endymion Concentree and Trumper Spanish leather. Tastefully vintage, substantial but not overbearing. Excellent.",10/06/24 23:17,derby2169

There's leathers and ouds and sandlewoods and all kinds of citruses and florals for more specific scents/occasions.

But until this one I'd argue that their wasn't a good more generalist relatively masculine ""cocktail hour and later"" option from ADP. They have very different scent DNA,

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"""Quercia takes you on a walk through a forest of oak trees where the mysterious green scent in the air inspires a fresh and earthy sensation"". Well, I am rather taken on a walk through an airport circa 1993 either near the duty free or alongside business men aged 40-55 (at the time). This is maybe unfair, because Acqua di Parma has tried to modernise an otherwise well tried style. But to me, there is simply too much Cool Water and Wunderbaum car perfume, connotations that were way too common for me to fall in love with this.

To begin with, I become very curious as I take in the first impressions, because I used to love the good ones of this category. But the drydown is a dissapointment. Where in my memory the good ones must have had sandalwood or something to support the moss (oakmoss needs to grow on something solid after all), what I get here is a recurring synthetic baseline – ambroxan I suppose. It is exactly what finally made me sell my Dior Sauvage Eau de Parfum, and that connotation is vividly present here as well.

If you are younger, >45 and lack the airport experience of yore, I suggest you give it a try if you have the money, because many will love this. The oakmoss dupe is quite nicely executed, but the supporting acts takes too much of my own attention, alas.",01/30/24 02:08,Opato
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Quercia is an aromatic woody scent with citrus and spices throughout. It is also an oakmoss-dominant scent, a rarity among modern mass-market perfumes. It is an underrated gem in my opinion, a masculine scent that despite being safe and familiar, is set apart by its quality.

Quercia opens with a tart, even slightly sharp citrus accord led by acidic lemon. Soft spicy notes follow quickly, adding a nice counterpoint. Petitgrain adds fresh green woodiness, bringing things to aromatic territory and paving the way to the rich woody-mossy base. Peppery geranium adds to the herbal greenness.

The oakmoss is clean rather than earthy, reminiscent of fancy hotel soap bars. Sometimes mossy chypres remind me in part of soap like so, but rarely so overtly. The woodiness of the base too is cleaner and more refined than scents of a similar profile. Restrained patchouli adds some earthiness, and The tonka bean keeps things very smooth and refined. It is very aromatic here, somewhat Sauvage-like, but much less synthetic. It fades to a woody, slightly musky skin scent. Sillage and longevity are moderate. It is a transeasonal everyday scent.

Quercia is masculine-leaning in my opinion, reminiscent of popular designer scents, but better quality and more natural-smelling, despite its cleanness. Very nicely composed and pleasant throughout, I would enjoy this on a man. 4/5.",11/22/23 11:20,Enrium

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I think this perfume starts out quite masc, but after time it settles into a nice unisex woody, mossy, mysterious scent.",07/20/23 04:50,Return2Scenter
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is one of the less interesting offerings of Acqua di Parma to me.

Don't get me wrong, it's a really nice and classic, high-quality men's cologne. Mossy, woody, peppery with Acqua di Parma's signature lemon base. I feel this would be a risk-free likable gift for a gentleman aged min 30 to 40 and above. Perfect everyday scent for office or daytime weekend outings.

I want to believe any scent can be unisex, but the only way to pull this one off as a woman to me would be if you're rocking a bit of a gender-bender formal to semi-formal style imo. But I can't see it fitting, say, with a summer dress, people will just think some of your significant other's fragrance transferred to you when you hugged him.

To me this is a bit of a dad's birthday gift or fathers' day gift kind of scent, but a really nice high-quality one.",06/29/23 05:07,latafan
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,This is a polarizing scent. My friend loves it but I find it kinda boring. It's mostly oakmoss (quercia = oak) and some warm spices after the classic aromatic citrus opening that acqua di parma does well. This is probably the only acqua di parma scent that let me down.,03/15/23 22:13,Granny Autismo
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I bought this as part of a sampling set, whilst the fragrance is described as unisex I would say it’s very masculine to me. I can just about pull it off as a woman but it definitely smells like a very expensive men’s scent. The ADP description describes walking in a forest but I honestly get “well groomed, handsome stranger who walks by leaving an intoxicating scent behind that you can’t stop thinking about for days after”.",01/06/23 08:19,ETaylor86
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Reminds me of a fresh night spent in the forest, with oakmoss undertone and casual sweet whiffs of fresh herbs. I find it very pleasant, alluring and quite inoffensive. The quality is top notch you can tell immediately that is packed with natural ingredient. It sits in the same category of Lalique Equus for me. These kind of fragrances that you put on and you are immediately taken back in time, when you were in the nature... Is not a blind buy safe kind of fragrance though especially full retail. With a nice offer at discounters might be blind-buy worthy",01/03/23 11:15,MrRainero
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I bought this at duty-free (about half of my collection is from there at this point) about three months ago as a gift for someone else, but upon smelling it a second time and realizing the person I was going to give this to probably wouldn't appreciate this vibe, I thought, screw it, I'm keeping this myself. And so began my first experience owning an Acqua di Parma cologne. My impressions? A luxurious office-safe fragrance. Almost reminds me of one of the Dior Homme fragrances, ever-so-slightly, as it evokes a similar vibe, but Quercia is darker and richer. There's something intriguing about the drydown. It's indulgent. You can tell the elements used to concoct this are of superb quality.
I will say though that despite being marketed as unisex, to my nose the scent profile is almost exclusively masculine. However, if you feel confident that you can pull it off, regardless of gender, then you probably will.

Honestly, if I were a hotshot CEO, I'd wear this every day. Right now, as a college student, I'm saving it for important deadlines like final reviews/presentations or internship interviews, especially those around this time of year (mid-to-late autumn). I find that the scent can be on the mature side, but if you're young but a more serious type person, or are just professionally active or highly involved in your industry, then consider making this your scent.

This was my first Acqua di Parma fragrance (though I have tried the shampoo and conditioners at hotels: they're a MUST BUY), and I definitely wasn't disappointed. Given the niche prices, I came to expect this quality of a scent, but this definitely has a certain edge, a nice universally-safe feel to it, a quality that perhaps other niche fragrances don't possess. In my opinion, everything The One by Dolce and Gabbana should've been (I might be too soon to speak since I haven't tested any of its flankers). If you need something that's pleasant to every nose, opt for this.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This is my favorite of the Signatures of the sun line. A classic. Smells Ultra good and always get compliments. This is a mature scent, not for teenagers for sure. I believe a mid 20s guy can pull it off, its smell so good. Powerful, thick, luxurious and natural. It’s a mixture of modern/old-school vibe. This version is more woody and spicy than the original which I have currently. I can picture this as a more powerful, natural, updated version of the original Chanel Allure pour homme scent. ADP always delivers in there scents. Mancera, Acqua Di Parma, Bottega Veneta and Bvlgari are my top brands I buy . So I always look at these brands first for new releases. Highly recommend this for the casual or formal man.",08/31/22 10:39,clintjr82

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This opens up with excellent tangy and tart citruses which ADP does really well, but the drydown is the best part if you love oakmoss, albeit, synthetic. This has a nice hit of oakmoss along with tonka sweetened creamy woods. Reminds me of 19-69 L'air Barbes oakmoss but Quercia is longer lasting.

Perfect with a white dress shirt siping a gin and tonic or a mojito in the sun.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Been comparing Quercia vs Oud vs Sandalo. They're all very very nice for brisk fall and winter weather. Quercia is the freshest and the most citrusy of the bunch. Not as creamy, woody, or dark as the others, but has those elements as well.

Citrus opening drying down to a dry, warm, woody backbone with a hint of leather and sweetness. Very nice. Not as creamy and sweet as Sandalo. Not as oudy and woody as Oud. Has shades of both, but entirely different and maybe my favorite. Weaker and less sillage than those as well tho.

Scent: 8.5 / Sillage: 7.5 / Longevity: 7.5 (3/4/2022)

UPDATE (11/29/2023)
Revisiting and comparing to Oud and Leather. Leather is a smooth luxury black leather, dry and stark. Oud is a smooth clean oud that dries down to a slight bit of funk. Both have a lot of similarities. Quercia is an outlier as I remembered...brighter, more citrus, more traditional lavender and oakmoss vibes. Only the slightest hints of the Oud and Leather vibes. While it's the easiest to wear...it might be the least unique and special.

I'm a bit torn bc I'd like to get some more of this, but I have many others that fit this mandate. Oud might be the best one to double up on since I don't have many Ouds and dark woody frags.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I have since retried this remake of AdP Quercia (Ingredient Collection) and to be honest, for me and on my skin, it’s lost all the charm of the original. Black-Bottle Quercia is definitely more unisex and ‘cleaner’ but to my nose it smells more artificial and has lost both the complexity and that ‘dark mossy’ masculinity of the original Quercia… shame, really.

I fear the Ingredient Collection has also been discontinued as it has disappeared from the AdP website.",07/16/21 04:17,monkey500
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"My wife has the black bottle. A candied, spicy opening drying to wood and tonka. Decent performance. Autumnal? To me this is a very good, classy, sexy fragrance well worth owning, suitable for special occasions. Very few others will be wearing it I suspect.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is different when wet and dry. It smells very pleasant, a vanilla and moss once you spray it, but after 30 minutes, it smells more of patchouly and cedar to me. It’s very warm and spicy, perfect for colder days.

The longevity is alright, around 5 hours. The sillage is moderate at first, but more intimate as it dries. The scent is more masculine, but it is still nice to wear as a unisex fragrance. It is though in my opinion overpriced.

Review
======
Bought this fragrance recently after going into a high end department store in the UK (twice) to smell the Acqua-di-Parma signature range, Quercia-Eau-de-Parfum was by far the best smelling to me out of the range even more than the popular Oud EDP, its taken me a week to finally commit to purchasing Acqua-di-Parma Quercia given its high price tag for 180ml, but i just couldn't get this fragrance out of my head, i have quite a large collection now, not as big as some but bigger than most, I found this fragrance to be a revelation in the opening which is far superior to many expensive fragrances i have smelled, Quercia has a dynamic and complex dry down owed to the fact that this uses a lot of natural ingredients and you can absolutely smell the difference, the longevity of Quercia EDP is fantastic lasts all day on me and is a skin scent 24+ hours after, the projection is also excellent giving me 2+ hours of a 4-6 feet bubble to 1 feet after the 3-4 hour period.

This fragrance just screams class and sophistication with a modern twist, you can wear this fragrance dressed up or dressed down its not limited in that regard, when wearing this fragrance you will not smell like everyone else it may share similarities with some fragrances but you can just smell a lot of naturals in this from beginning to end, Quercia EDP is like going from smelling in standard definition to high definition is the best way i can describe it, you pick up on more nuances in the fragrance from start to finish, people who understand quality will recognise this fragrance as being such and compliment accordingly, i would say this is a safe fragrance for 28+ age group.

This fragrance should be on your radar when next you go shopping, i know its a little pricey but its a fantastic offering from Acqua-di-Parma in my opinion one of their best in the Signature line and one of the best i have smelled in a long time and I'm now a happy owner.

Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Its a strange one. Splits me right down the center. The opening is amazing, stunning infact. The dry down isn't quite as nice and then it starts getting irritating.

Most of us buy a fragrance for the top notes...and thats when this is at its best",05/23/21 02:47,Aliahmed
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,The opening to this is so good. Dry down not so much. It actually repulsed me which is surprising considering how much I love the opening. Will update after more wearings if necessary.,04/25/21 07:36,Kre8tor
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I've been wearing this for a month now, in Dec/Jan, and the weather has been both humid and dry and cold to cool, (28°F to 58°F). Its character changed somewhat according to the temp and humidity. On my skin, I've gotten 8-10 hours of performance. It starts out smelling spicy and sweet, then moves into this very rich, creamy, vanilla/almond phase. It enters into Gormand territory, and I love it. Compliments have been ""good"", ""have you been baking?"", ""what smells so delicious!"". Sillage seems to be about 5-6 feet. When the base notes take over, it has an earthy character grounding it. When I started doing some physical exertion, it really came to life, and that's when it really started to shine.

For me, this is well worth the price.",01/14/21 22:11,Gabriél_de_ATL
Quercia Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I bought a sample pack of the whole 'Signatures of the Sun' line and I'm slowly making my way through it. I already purchased a full bottle of the Oud, which is by far my favourite. The leather seems quite popular too.

Generally speaking, AdP fragrances are very natural smelling. This seems like the youngest offering, which they may have achieved by adding a few more synthetics (ambroxan?). It still feels very refined, quite bold and sharp with a few rough edges, which is generally a profile that appeals to me but the scent still feels like it's missing something. I think this would work very well for casual daywear or to the office but for the price you can definitely do better.

___________________________________________________________


I completely disagree with 'Aguirre' - this fragrance is a lot of things, but ""dull, unremarkable, and has no character"" it is definitely not!

Today I got the opportunity to try some of the new Acqua di Parma-Fragrances. At the counter 'Osmantus' and 'Vaniglia' were the ones, which stood out for me, but the sales person insisted that 'Quercia' was the most outstanding of them all. So I tried it. It starts with a powerful note of cardamon, which turns into oak and bergamot.

However the real face of this fragrance is being revealed later on - the Cedar, Patchouli and pepper take over and form a very well blended and captivating fragrance - quite unique and mesmerizing. Like a magnet it pulls you into it's sphere and doesn't let go.

Longevity: - 8/10

There is something to enjoy with both of these interpretations and I am finding it hard to choose which one to buy - they are both on sale. Rosa Nobile has a light, airy feel about it, more girly.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This opens with a lot of citrus. But it’s not sharp. You get rose right off the bat it’s beautiful.
Drying down you get the peony And Lily of the valley. Still all the Rose citrus coming through.
In the dry down at the very bottom, you get the cedar And the rose is still going, and the citrus fades a little, and you can smell the powdery violet I think that’s why people think this smells masculine. And absolutely a man could wear it.
As those are traditional, male notes, cedar violet citrus. But I’m still getting the rose and it’s a sweet rose not a masculine rose. This is so well blended that anyone could wear it. It’s so gorgeous. I don’t know why people think this is weak or A simple rose, perfume. It is certainly not.
It’s one of those fragrances that you can feel what the nose was doing every step of the way and it flows. It still has that aqua di Parma DNA with the citrus.
Just lovely I’m surprised by how much I like this.
The middle is my favorite part citrus peony rose a little cedar. The mix of the rose and the lily of the valley gives you a little white floral vibe, but not too much if you don’t like white florals this is not that. It’s just enough.

It’s interesting that somebody said that it could be masculine, maybe it is the freshness and the cleaness? Definitely not masculine to my nose, just the most classy beautiful woman scent.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Rosa Nobile is a pretty, realistic, fresh yet sweet rose scent, best worn in warm weather. Classic feminine elegance aside, it scores bonus points for me as it evokes childhood memories.

RN is rose-dominant from initial spray, light, fresh and natural-smelling, like rosewater in perfume form. There is some citric freshness up top, complementing the rose. Bright yet well-rounded, the rose here is lovely.

As it develops, the sweet orange note becomes prominent, forming an irresistible sweet accord with the increasingly jammy rose - it reminds me of a sweet treat/cake from childhood, but frustratingly I cannot put my finger on it. Nothing encourages me to buy perfume as much as such scent memories do!

It becomes powdery as it develops, with some violet emerging. A nice hint of greenness is evident in the background too. It becomes musky as it dries down, with soft, warm amber-vanilla evident as it fades. Sillage and longevity are moderate.

A beautiful sweet yet lightweight rose scent, this is elegant, feminine and beautifully balanced. Bonus points for the Proustian factor, but a really good spring/summer rose scent. 4.5/5.",06/28/23 10:53,Enrium

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"A lovely, modern peony-rose. Smells very quality. I am not usually able to wear a strong peony note, owing to the aquatic presentation of most of these. Calone, methinks. Even so, a good floral if you like this category of scent. My personal favorite would be Paul Smith Rose, with it's mild-mannered peony and pink rose and detergent-style musk. It is perhaps even a trifle less 'realistic' rose even than Rosa Nobile, but as a modern peony-rose interpretation it never goes aquatic or sour or nasty in any way and lasts, with powerful projection. Win-win.

I must add, however, that applying Rosa Nobile at bedtime rendered a clean, perfume dry down next AM. So I think longevity is rather good, always a nice thing to have. She has my respect, if not my love. Rose scents with lasting power are, after all, hard to find!",04/25/23 14:06,drugstore classics

This is also quite aquatic as well. Roses in nature do not smell like this. I grew up around all kinds of roses. Heirloom roses, wild roses, tea roses.

This is a pungent synthetic juice, a chemistry experiment that went wrong.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Absolutely beautiful for the rose lovers. If you can grab this for a deal I would say go for it. I like a dark rose but sometimes I need a daytime rose for running around. My toddler loves this on me, so I’m grabbing all the bottles! 😉",09/25/21 16:39,Aprettygarden2
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I’ve enjoyed the regular citrussy refreshing cologne from Acqua di Parma, but its taking me years to get through this bottle of their rose scented version. I’m partial to rose fragrances - I grow many varieties of damask roses - so I’m fussy about how rose aroma is captured in fragrances. This fragrance is just too sweet for me, the rose scent seems unnatural, lacking the refreshing qualities of cologne. Fair quality, just not for me.",09/06/21 15:16,loisellett
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"It’s a fairly pedestrian rose scent. For some reason it makes my skin burn slightly on the sprayed sites.
Nothing remarkable and to me it’s not like A la Rose by MFK which I adore. This one is a bit colder and peppery and smells quite common. A la Rose is much more creamy, nuanced, and more luxurious.

An hour after I sprayed this, I started to get a headache.
My hubby thinks it smells like rose scented air freshener. 😞",08/10/21 20:26,yujinclara
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"On first spray this made me think of something from the Dior rose lineup. I can't remember which one, but it also has that mandarin/rose/pepper combination opening going on. Anyway, coming here I see that Demachy created it, so no wonder it reminds me of a Dior fragrance, since he created the fragrances there. His style is clearly exhibited here too - initially. But after it dries down completely I agree with RainbowGirl 100%. It smells like Paul Smith's Rose on me too, and performs about the same. Honestly, I couldn't get past that association, especially considering the massive price difference. You can pick up a bottle of Paul Smith Rose for $25 on Fragnet, or you could pay the $90 being asked for essentially the same fragrance. For me, it's a no brainer.",08/06/21 14:28,Anamandy
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I own a travel spray of this fragrance, and although it is a beautiful rose perfume, I never purchased a full bottle.

The opening is fantastic. A beautiful orangy rose, with a hint of pepper, to make it feel classy. A very simular opening to Penhaligon's The Coveted Duchess Rose.

I love orange mixed with rose. It makes the rose smell fresh and light. Like smelling an authentic fresh rose in a garden.

When this settles, it reminds me of Paul Smith's Rose (which I may review next, to compare.) The rose is mixed with peony, which makes it stay a fresh rose, even after the citruses have faded. I get a hint of the violet, and a hint of greeness from the lily of the Valley, but very light. Supporting roles. Just enough to make you feel you are in a garden.

At this stage, nose to skin, it reminds me of something... like a HINT of watermelon rind? Maybe the white fleshy part of the watermelon? But still rose dominated. Zero soapy. Zero potpourri smelling. Super fresh, and a little green.

The projection is okay, but not great. I can smell it around me, but lightly, and it doesn't last very long. Maybe two hours on my skin. Which is why I never purchased a full bottle. I also own a full bottle of Paul Smith Rose, which is super affordable, and also a beautiful fresh rose.

If you love a fresh garden rose, and you have your heart set on owning an Acqua Di Parma scent, this will be a great addition to your collection, and a safe blind buy.",06/26/21 07:41,RainbowGirl

At the moment I feel a beautiful, fresh rose. I also liked A la rose, which reminds me a lot of this one, but I still feel enough differences to justify its purchase.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I blind bought this based on the reviews. What a mistake.
This perfume gave me a headache and I returned it. To me, it is nothing like a ""soft ballerina"" as other reviewers have mentioned. It is a strong in-your-face older Madam wearing red lipstick (some on her teeth) that speaks to you a little too close to your face and is wearing a purple fur coat. She loves calling everyone ""dear"" and ""darling"".
All in all, I couldn't distinguish the notes that disturbed me but it sure wasn't what I was looking for: a rose solifore.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is such a pretty rose. Its like natural pink roses mixed with the sweetness of rose scented cosmetic products (not ones loaded with essential oils). It’s sweet and dewy smelling on my skin. Often, I find that simple rose fragrances can go sour like stale dried up rose petals. I get that with fragrances like The Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose and Aerin Rose De Grasse.

So I’ve been trying fruitier and sweeter roses to compensate the sourness. That not what I wanted but was a way for me to handle rose in perfume.

Rosa Nobile is softly sweet and slightly powdery. It smells so delicate and feminine. I honestly thought I was going to hate it and prefer Magnolia Nobile. This is my type of rose. It’s simple but I guess like simple.",09/04/20 15:34,danygurl06
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"For a moment at the start there is a great natural rose note surrounded by some green, and other soft floral. But at the center is that sweet, fresh, just stuck your nose in a rose, genuine smell.

But the delicate fresh scents fade within minutes and what's left just smells like a generic soft floral. Like a quality bar of soap.

Nice for the guest bathroom soap, but not tempted to wear it.",08/11/20 15:23,Snippet
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is an ultra feminine lovely fragrance. The rosey opening is gorgeous and I wish it maintained more of that personality in the the Drydown, where it loses much of its character. This perfume is like a soft ballerina fragrance yet really projects, probably at least an arm’s length.I just wish it had a little something in the Drydown, more of a depth or edge, that makes this not smell as generic and synthetic as it does compared to the magnificent opening. I would buy this if I could find an affordable bottle but it’s quite expensive for what it is. I much prefer this over magnolia nobile which is kind of mature and stuffy.",07/29/20 11:51,AdeleHugo
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"unfortunately I'm not a fan. I love rose perfumes in general but this doesn't work for me. I can tell there is a nice rose in there somewhere but the opening is too sharp and green and there is too much pepper and the dry down is too musky for me. I didn't really get a proper hit of rose at any point, I felt like I was searching for it amongst the other notes. It smells almost masculine to me. I've tried most of the ADP nobile range now and the only one I really enjoy is the Gelsomino.",06/17/20 09:36,RosieRose16

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is a perfect rose scent in my nose, it smells absolutely wonderful on my skin!!

I got the rose foremost and than the peony. Is there any musk and pepper in the background?? Naaaa...

I also have some other rose perfumes that I love dearly, but, they are at my large storage on the other side of the country, so, I only have this little beauty with me now.

And, I love it, and, I think it is perfect for everybody!

I am very allergic to some kind of perfumes, but this one I can dig my nose as deep as I can into my skin, and, I don't got any allergic reaction from it, or either the astma.

It last for many hours on my skin, so it's def a solid 10/10 !!",05/20/20 16:00,Mona Lygre
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I tried this for the first time today. I am a big fan of three of the other ""Nobiles"" - Magnolia, Gelsomino, and Iris, so I expected good things from the rollerball I purchased. My very first reaction after I applied it was ""No!! Another super sharp rose!!"". Absolutely not to my taste! But of course I waited, and within 15 minutes, it all softened into a pretty, pink, somewhat fluffy rose fragrance that I find charming. It doesn't feel old fashioned to me, as I don't find it powdery. The citrus sort of lifts it up and the lily of the valley provides a touch of green freshness that is not the least bit bitter. It fits well within the collection. The only one left to try is Peony.
EDIT - I now own Peonia also.

The question I must ask myself now is do I want or need a full bottle? I would love to have it to add to the collection but I'm not sure I am willing to spend that much on it. A gift would be nice, and if I find a bargain, I might be tempted, but for now I am happy with my travel size.

Silage and longevity are moderate.

Fresh and pleasant, easy-going and not overwhelming, I would even call it delicate and as it names suggests, purely noble.
But...
It would be a great perfume if, at least on me, its duration was not so disappointingly short.
After three, maximum four hours, it just disappears from my skin. Also, this really beautiful first impression of a soft rose changes somewhere in the middle of its life and becomes something like a synthetic rose smell, which I truly hate.
If it had kept its first notes character, and despite its short duration I would call it great and I would rate it differently.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Rosa Nobile is not a unique rose scent, but with that being said, it doesn't need to be. Easy to wear and love, this fragrance has everything that you could ever want. I would go so far to challenge those that usually detest rose fragrances to try and turn up their noses at this little beauty.

Rosa Nobile is a beautifully balanced blend of pink, delicate roses and tart peony. It starts as a fresh, dew-kissed floral before drying down into a powdery, cedar base.

I think Acqua di Parma does an excellent job with their soliflores. The perfumers don't over complicate things, which is one aspect I appreciate. Rosa Nobile takes this fragrance house to new heights with an extremely wearable and inoffensive offering. It is the epitome of Spring to my nose.

This fragrance has quite a following, and it's easy to see why. Many describe Rosa Nobile as pretty, beautiful, delicate, modern and luxurious. These are my thoughts exactly. It does deserve the hype and I would love to smell this fragrance on more passers-by. I think it's a much prettier rose when compared to the infamous Chloe Eau de Parfum.

Men seem to love Rosa Nobile on my skin which is another tick in the box for this masterful scent. I did try a number of fragrances from this house at the start of my perfume journey, but for some unbeknownst reason I put Acqua di Parma on the back-burner for a while. I am keen to start exploring this line again, especially now that I have experienced first-hand how wonderful Rosa Nobile turned out.",08/04/19 06:54,missk
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I have not smelled a rose like this before! It is spicy and sexy but somehow still a bit subtle and mysterious.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I was searching for a rose similar to Maison Francis Kurkdijan A La Rose. My reason being the sillage on MFK is so so light and I couldn't justify spending that much on something that disappears within the hour.

So I bought a tester of Rose Nobile on a whim not expecting it to match up to the gorgeous MFK scent. But it actually does! It is surprisingly close bar a few subtle differences. The citrus in Rose Nobile is definitely more orangey whereas MFK is more lemony. Both a fresh crisp roses which is exactly what I was looking for.

The main difference is the better sillage and longevity with Rose Nobile. And of course, a cheaper price tag. Although a piece of me is slightly gutted to not be buying the MFK, I am so pleasantly surprised with how beautiful Rose Nobile is. Very pretty for spring and a rose for those who don't like them dark and sugary.",04/24/19 06:11,marinaw90

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Gorgeous pink rose that hits just the right spot between classic and contemporary, powdery and fresh. Pure joy in a bottle! Lovely for layering too -- I especially like it over original Stella to supercharge the rose.

Sillage is good on me for the first half hour, then drops dramatically. Longevity is poor to average but so far the best of this style of rose I've yet found. :)

Editing to add that after wearing for a week or so, I'm able to detect the lovely green/naturalistic/garden-y notes throughout this. It's really interesting -- at first it seems like a simple rose soliflore, but slowly you start to perceive the rest of the garden around the roses.",04/01/19 16:45,florally
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Oh how I love the opening of this. It's a gorgeous, complex, fresh rose. The rose smells real, but there are other flowers and scents supporting it in just the most lovely way. I could inhale it for hours.

Except I can't. It doesn't have a scent progression so much as pieces just start falling away, exposing a base of fake, detergent-smelling rose.

If someone can recommend something that holds onto the opening of this or has a more pleasant progression, I'd appreciate it. Especially before June 2019 (I'd like to wear it for my wedding).",03/19/19 04:22,GirlyScientist

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Much, much better than MFK, which I had such high hopes for. This is a real rose-focused perfume where the rose is restrained but persistent even into the drydown, which is uncommon for modern rose scents e.g. Chloe's.

This reminds me of a fine French rose scented soap, like Rance's. Someone else called it ""sunny"", and I'd agree with that too. I couldn't take the fruity sharpness and fuzzy modern musk drydown of MFK's. This one is perfect. And I say that as someone who's been unimpressed with the other Iris Nobile flankers.",12/08/18 12:49,noisome
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Rose Nobile is Another floral in a Nobile series. (My favorite from this line is by far Magnolia). It is a stream of pink rose and peony for the first hour or so, which melts into a nice floral bouquette heart and base notes.

Decent sillage and projection, you definitely get noticed by a nice trail of flowers. It might not be the best office scent though.

this is all about a delicate,subtle rose with a hint of soft musk..I can't detect other notes and I don't want to,I just want to douse myself in this lovely pretty rose,but for sure there are other notes here,adding freshness,a touch of clean powderyness and giving unnoticable spice,taste and a delicate silky sweetness to the overall combination
I can just say I loooovvve it,love,love..very lovely to wear during springs but it's also wearable in summers and falls..it stays on my skin pretty long with moderat sillage
my only sadness is about my small,miniature size bottle,I don't want this gorgeous rosey dream to end,never ever
this is a must try for rose lovers",05/14/16 06:09,Soofiya
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This rose takes its time to bloom. At first I got absolutely nothing but after a few squirts and may be an hour or so later, I started to get a subtle rose. It is lovely and delicate. Not sure if it is worth the price tag though.",04/22/16 13:42,shwetadwivedi
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,Rosa Nobile by Acqua di Parma is a Floral Perfume with a lot of Rose and a bit Citrus and Musk Scent. It is a fragrance that is suitable for Spring and Summer the most. Since it is EDP the longevity is significant and the projection is moderate. This a superb perfume for daily usage in any occasion but not for outdoor activities.,03/22/16 06:36,amirali0072000
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"What a beautiful rose perfume! It is absolutely gorgeous. I have been searching for the perfect rose scent for a while. I have tried a lof of perfumes from Red Roses to Lipstock Rose, from Serge Luten's roses to Diptyque Eau Rose, Stella and Paris. In my opinion none of them smelled even close to fresh living roses. There is a beautiful period house across the street from my apartment. Every summer, in the front-yard of this building there grow the most beautiful roses I have ever seen. They are large, warm, fresh, lively, flirting, inviting and colourful. Whenever I walk pass I stop and smell those beautiful roses which to me are the most precious jewels of our neighborhood. Now we are in the middle of the winter. The rose bushes are tucked away under the glittery quilt of snow. I spray my Rosa Nobile once and see and feel the delicate rose petals open up slowly and let their beautiful scent warm the cold air.

I know that it is not possible to create a perfume that smells exactly like fresh roses, but Acqua Di Parma seems to have captured the beautiful spirit of a young living rose and put it in a bottle. I liked this perfume when I sampled it but to be honest I did not think I would fall in love with it. Now I have my own bottle and feel I am madly in love. Like all the lovers in all the beautiful and promising love affairs I genuinely hope ours will last forever and ever and ever.",01/20/16 07:50,Lille Rosse
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"I love this. All in all I love rose scents and we can see that there is enormous amount of rose fragrances nowadays, but i can tell that only few of them are really beautiful and very special. This is undoubtedly one of them. Very noble, suitable for all ages, long lasting, sexy....even i can tell for all seasons. This is special one..It can be warm and cosy..and in hot weather its like you're calm in the garden with somebody or smith that you really love. I would say that this scent harmonies me.

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"After a brief citrus opening, the first two hours of Acqua di Parma Rosa Nobile are dominated by a combo of pink rose and pepper. The pepper is quite strong on me, rendering the rose dry and kind of masculine, which is quite unexpected, and I find it very intriguing.

However, after the pepper fades, Rosa Nobile then turns into an aqueous concoction of limpid rose, peony and salty musk with an occasional whiff of citrus. Pretty and approachable, but not as compelling as the first two hours to me. The rose becomes slightly more jammy in the late dry down and the aqueous characteristic also wanes a bit, but overall, the fragrance stays linear throughout.

The sillage is relatively soft and the longevity is around 10 hours. I was positively surprised by the more unisex combo of rose and pepper during the opening. However, while the later stage of modern rose is no doubt very pretty and versatile, I'm not sure it stands out among other similar and more affordable dewy rose fragrances out there to warrant the price.",07/20/15 13:45,StellaDiverFlynn

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Lovely modern, not 'borrowed from granny' scent at all, but not exactly what I expected. I don't get any of the pepper or spicy notes. On me it's more of a balsamic rosewood with nice citruses in the background.
I like that it's not too heady-floral (these kind of scents gives me hedaches!). Nice, contemporary rose without being soapy. I like the rose not being artificial, it's very soft and natural but again, more of a rosewood than dewy rosebud opening up on a sunny morning.
I would consider it a transition time perfume - wouldn't use it in the height of the summer or on very cold frosty winter days, but it's very lovely in late spring and autumn.
My only complaint is that it lasts on the skin for 5-6 hours but when applied very quickly goes from citrusy opening to rosewood-y drydown.
Not offensive in any way, nice everyday scent if you work with people (office, reception, front of house, retail etc.). More of a daytime than evening/going out fragrance.

After trying three diferent EDPs from the Nobile Range - Iris, Magnolia and Rosa I can say that Iris is my fave (own a 50ml bottle and would definitely repurchase when run out), Rosa second favourite (would be happy to get more samples or get a bottle as a present) and Magnolia is the one I like the least and wouldn't care for a sample or a full size bottle. That should tell you all about my taste when it comes to Acqua di Parma inventions :-)",06/23/15 13:51,tunya
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"If you are on the fence with this one- wear it several times in different weather. I really love this in 80 degree weather. I adore rose, and this is the queen of my rose scents. If you are looking for realistic rose with a hint of citrus supported by gorgeous jasmine and musk, look no further.

This is, in my opinion, top-shelf, high quality eau de parfum. I can tell because of the way the fragrance develops- it has a gorgeous natural rose and citrus smell for the first hour, fades a bit into the other supporting flowers (jasmine, violet, peony) the second hour, and in the remaining hours you are left with the most beautiful rosey skin musk ever.

While wearing this, I get a feeling of royalty and nobleness- like it could have been worn in the 1800's by the feminine royalty of that time. I should have chosen this as my wedding scent 3 years ago (instead of Bvlgari Rose Essentielle). The longevity on my skin is easily 8-10 hours.",06/13/15 06:44,Eaugirlspirit
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Firstly I have to point out I'm very ' fickle' on perfume, whats my ' perfume forever' one week, will be cast to the bottom of a drawer the week after....and secondly I never buy ' rose' scented perfumes, I simply do not gravitate towards rose, so I cannot understand why I am so besotted with ' rosa', I disagree with previous reviews which state its to ' simple' on the contrary on first blast I get rose, not so artificial it repels, rather soft, mixed in with a rather expensive ' powder smell' , over 30 years ago my dear grandmother would let me play with her make up bag, it smelt of ' vintage cosmetics' my grandmother has been gone a long time so I guess Acqua di parma Rosa, reminds me of this subconsciously, ' 1950s, make up, all powdery and cream smelling', the rose smell has a mere hint of ' spice', and a waft of ' green freshness', it lasts a long time on my skin, its comforting, warm, like walking through a park in summertime, roses, grass, a gentle hit of sun on your skin, you can smell its quality, I really still can't grasp I'm enthralled with a ' rose' fragrance but there you go!! Some how I think this may just keep my interest up longer than expected, I'm also shallow enough to be totally impressed with the bottle, elegant , almost retro, hint of pink liquid, and to the point gold label, my fav perfume bottle of recent years ( just edging out Tom Fords bottles' ) worth a try especially if you are a ' rose' lover or indeed not as the case may be :)",03/04/15 11:35,flowermom

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"This is a lovely gentle fragrance-I found the rose less prominent than the other notes though, to me this was a sweet and almost gourmand fruity citrus. The sillage is minimal and the longevity poor though, I expected this to be deeper and more 'solid', and its not, its a light delicate wisp of a scent. The musk didn't really come out at all. On me this was very light and more of a summer or spring fragrance. I love rose notes, but I think others have done them better than than this (although this is still lovely). I prefer L'Occitane Rose 4 Reines or Van Cleef & Arpels Rose Velours for a more defined rose note.",01/01/15 10:55,mabelcruet

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Can I dare and say I'm a little bit bored with the term ""nobile"" here?
I wanted to try this Rosa Nobile anyway. I saw the beautiful bottle at a counter and couldn't help spritzing.
I like their Magnolia, don't care much for the other ones in the line. All in all a tiring line.
Rosa Nobile makes no exception.
It opens with a very subtle yet present rose smell, quite close to natural and lovely. Peony is also there and the tiniest amount of pepper. The first fruity notes last the time of a blink, which is not wrong in a rose scent.
It smells lovely for a while, let's say 1 hour, no more, not too intense but present. Then it fades and fades and never seems to come to a more substancial drydown. It's all about rose from start to end and it would be a nice thing if only it was a somptuous rose. Instead it's so faint that it could be taken for you average rosy scent from drugstore, only a little more elegant.
Not a great deal for that price.",10/30/14 11:19,Mellyhelly
Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Rosa Nobile I is a pretty fragrance,very well done, but it is different from what I was expecting. Rosa Nobile opens with prominent bergamot and mandarin, a sunny Italian prelude, followed by a swath of sharp pepper.

After the pepper a lovely soft rose enters that is just divine. I wish this phase of the scent lasted forever, but the rose note gets a bit overwhelmed by peony, lily of the valley and violet during the mid-phase of the development. The musk in the drydown makes this very long lasting on my skin and a bit powdery as well. The cedar is there as a balancing note but it is not prominent for me like it is for some others.

This citrusy floral mix with musk and cedar lasts and lasts on my skin for over 12 hours. It has good sillage for a few hours and then moves to a skin scent. It is a pretty fragrance and worthy of the Acqua di Parma name. At first I thought the rose disappeared in the drydown, but actually it does not, it's just very soft. This fragrance seems to be a crowd-pleaser. I have had 2 people ask me ""what is that wonderful perfume you are wearing today?"" when I have on Rosa Nobile so it must have more sillage than one may think!",10/24/14 18:02,rickyrebarco

Rosa Nobile Acqua di Parma,"Purchased this today. I was very excited to smell it as I'm a huge fan of Magnolia Nobile and rose is actually one of my all time favourite scents so, when I heard Acqua di Parma had made a rose fragrance in the Nobile range I was beyond eager to try it.

I am not disappointed it at all. It's a deeper, muskier rose than perhaps I was expecting but this actually means it has greater scent payoff and longevity, or at least it did on me, still getting wafts of it 5 hours on.

It does remind me a little of Serge Luten's La Fille de Berlin in that it has a heady, jammy note to the rose, it's quite delicious. This isn't a powdery or green rose, it's a deep, plush, velvety rose with warm tones that remind me of a huge, billowy rose bush on a midsummer's night in Sorrento - you get the jist!

I don't think this will replace Magnolia Nobile as my signature scent, I just feel Magnolia Nobile is more of an all-rounder, possibly more elegant, suitable for any occasion fragrance, whereas I'd save Rosa Nobile for evening or Autumn / Winter wear personally.",09/13/14 10:40,Pixie1104

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I'm not sure if this is a summer scent or a balmy fall scent. Why not both, I suppose. It sort of lacks the cooling effect one would want during the summer to balm the skin and soul of oppressive heat, but it is still very fresh and invigorating. Monsieur Duchaufour has done a masterful job of creating a cypress accord that lasts quite a long time, throughout most of the life of the fragrance - a tricky feat for sure since cypress and pine notes have a tendency to disappear quite quickly. He accomplishes this by showing the different facets of cypress through each evolutionary step of the perfume. In the opening notes there is a beautiful mélange of herbs - notably rosemary, basil, and sage - combined with grapefruit that together delivers the very green herbal and also somewhat astringent and sulfuric qualities of cypress. After these dry down, which happens quite quickly, we're onto a more floral and spicy heart of jasmine and white florals, lavender, and coriander and cardamom, which together deliver the softer and drier side of cypress; the indolic jasmine and white florals give a smooth and fragrant feel, the lavender an aromatic and herbaceous lift, and the coriander and cardamom the spicy and resinous qualities. Just superb. By the time you are able to pick out what is going on in the heart, the base ingredients pick up their instruments and begin playing their notes of real cypress and pine oils, spicy cedar, and bright and earthy patchouli, oakmoss, and vetiver - the real deals in what would and should be a cypress/pine-forward perfume. High quality materials in the deft hands of a technical master is very nearly always a sure thing for a great perfume, and CdT is no exception. It gives this tremendous and evocative feeling that I've spent an entire day in a Tuscan cypress forest condensed to a matter of a few hours. The beautiful, cool, and dew-soaked morning when the sun first starts to evaporate the water from the cypress trees and the air, the wet herbs and earth taking their last big drink of the day, and the light begins coaxing the trees to life; the warm afternoon when the growing heat of the day encourages the cypress trees and wildflowers to begin releasing their oils; and finally the beginning of the evening, after the heat has been its most oppressive, the aromatics of the hot trees and the warmed earth have given all that they have to give and all start winding down to the cool evening preparing to do it all again tomorrow. Maybe I'm aggrandizing this perfume a bit; I've always had a big soft spot for green perfumes centering around cypress, pine or the like - so a beautifully executed perfume like CdT is going to be an easy win for me. I can live with my bias, and I can certainly live the rest of my days with this perfume.",06/06/25 10:09,Nathan86
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"The Acqua di Parma line is new to me, having only recently sampled some of the cologne and EDT/EDP offerings, and overall it does feel like the ingredients are natural and high quality. Cipresso di Toscana is probably my favorite in the AdP lineup (I've still to sample the entire range). I liked Mirto di Panarea as well, which was my top choice from this house until today when I sampled CdT. CdT to my nose, has a dark/smoky tinge probably from the pine or cypress (not sure which, some other pine scents don't have the same smokiness) that reminds me of Mon Vetiver by Essential Parfums.
Overall, the scent is a 9/10, but the longevity and projection do fall short, which being an EDC, might not surprise anyone but I do kind of expect better performance if the prices are more like EDTs and EDPs.",05/31/25 08:58,Icyspicy

As the day warms, the earthy aromas of lavender and cypress rise from the trees, mixing with the soft breeze. By evening, as you rest near a rustic wooden bench, the grounding scent of pine and cashmere wood fills the air, capturing the essence of the tranquil countryside around you.",08/24/24 13:53,Jetpack
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Described in one word: Crispy. I'm a big fan of fresh, summer ready fragrances that achieve light, invigorating profiles without relying heavily on the usual notes. Think citrus, colone, ambroxan, aquatic notes etc.

Cipresso di Toscana achieves freshness using tricks from the past, while managing to stay current enough. Freshness in the classical sense. Herbs, conifers, flowers, a freshness that is inspired by nature. I think this almost certainly features aromachemicals, but the overall feel and impression is a natural one. Seems like Acqua di Parma pulls this off pretty well across their line.

While it opens up with a piercing barbershop sharpness similar to Cerruti 1881, it quickly settles into a crispy green and invigorating heart that smooths out quickly. The cypress is there along with some other snappy green nuances, a little spice, and very blended floral lightness that exists without my nose picking up any obvious jasmine, lavender, or lily of the valley that's listed. If you despise flowers in your fragrance, the floral notes here shouldn't be a problem. I think they just provide a little lift and give an impression of ""fresh air through the trees"".

As it further dries down Cipresso reveals some of the slightly warmer base notes which maintain the natural theme. It does have a very slight hint of shaving cream, barbershop vibe in the base as well, but nothing like Azzaro PH or Drakkar. Also much sharper, and lighter in feeling than something like Z-14, which I like but reminds me of wood panel office parks in the 70s/80s. My gripe with some of older classic is they can feel muddy or dark brown in color, but Cipresso maintains a uplifting green presence. It doesn't scream 80's or Dad's aftershave to me, but then again I am a dad to-be in my 30s. So, take that with a grain of salt.

The base is very long lasting and warms up and darkens slightly, and sticks around as a closer to skin scent for a good 12 hours. The heart notes stick around too if you get some on fabric or your shirt collar. I think performance gripes here are a bit overstated, if you can make peace with the low to medium projecting scent. This is one of those weird ones that seems to wax and wane throughout the day, and almost gain strength as it sits on skin. I'll lose the scent sitting in place, but catch whiffs as I move through spaces or get active. I think any addition of fixatives would change this scent, and I'd much rather have this light and crisp profile than to have it end up a chemical mess on dry down.

In summary, I highly recommend this for fans of classic men's fragrances with a more natural and (slightly) updated feel. Cipresso is a bit more sober and serious. Yet the coniferous, gently spicy, and green notes give it a casual side that lends to evening and weekend wear as well. More versatile than some purely summer fragrances for these notes and the warmer/darker base notes that mix in. I'll be mixing this one into rotation throughout the year for when I want something mature and crisp, but not too conservative.

Did I mention it's crisp?",08/19/24 09:13,MaxMellows
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Discontinued for a good reason. This is a much ""lesser"" interpretation of the Italian cypress, compared to Tom Ford's Italian Cypress.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Cipresso di Parma by Acqua Di Parma was a fragrance I had to give a chance as I am a huge fan of the Blu Mediterraneo line and a discontinued fragrance from this collection piqued my interest. However, I feel like this fragrance while an odd one out from the line doesn't really smell as great as the others and I can understand why this fragrance was discontinued. This smells like walking through a forest and passing by different types of leaves and trees which some people may like but again I wouldn't prefer it to the others in the line. The lavender from this fragrance is what makes this fragrance stand out and is what makes this smell good overall but I feel as if the other notes feel artificial so it can be a 50/50 for some people when smelling it. You could also say that when you smell this fragrance it may smell like a grassy and empty field that reminds you of memories from visiting the park or garden from the instant combination of different greenery in this fragrance. Just like the other Blu Mediterraneo fragrance the price is pretty modest for a niche fragrance as I was able to get this for around $150 so it's a good intro to unique fragrances.

The longevity is a bit surprising as a summer EDT fragrance which usually doesn't last long however this fragrance lasts around 5 hours on my clothes and skin which is way more than what I expected from the start. The sillage is however very weak and I can only really smell this fragrance at a very close distance so nothing really surprising for its sillage. Overall this is an average fragrance with a hint of uniqueness with strong green notes and is a great introduction to new fragrance enthusiasts.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I recently discovered this lovely gem.

It reminds me of scents like Halston Z-14 and Ralph Lauren Polo (Green). To me, there's something very nostalgic about it. I guess, the men around me when I was a child, back in the early 80's, smelled similar. Thus, this is my perception of what a real man is supposed to smell like and I love it. I feel, I gravitate more and more towards these old school type of fragrances.

I don't understand the criticism about the longevity. I've worn it a couple of times now and it lasts, especially on clothes. I sprayed it around 19 hours ago now and I can still smell it prominently on my shirt. The other day I sprayed it on my arm and also got a good 8 hours of a nice whiff now and again.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I remember when I first started collecting. I always liked cypress and pine as favorite notes. This was discontinued. Glad it's back!
It was a blind buy. I heard it had a lot of anise, which is often too sharp and bitter for my taste. I was glad at first impression, I got the anise, but it's perfectly blended with the citrus. It felt a bit peppery, like the Blenheim Bouquet structure of citrus, pepper, lavender, conifer.
A lot of cheepos have poor synthetic cypress. But the cypress and pine are quite good and recognizable. The cypress took some time to be really noticable, around the mid.
It's fresh and spicy in an Italian way perhaps.
Love the conifer base.
Will be best in Summer, but has good enough projection to be enjoyable in Winter.

Just a side note: Clive Christian Cypress, is the best quality, realistic cypress I have found.

PS: Just put it as my signature for Summer. It takes 15 minutes to settle to a harmonious fragrance of spicy, green, conifer fougere.
Fresh yet has warm spicy touches.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Cipresso di Toscana is an aromatic fougère, masculine and barbershop-like, but underwhelming. The green woody goodness I was expecting fades fast, leaving in its wake a generic, soapy aftershave.

CdT has a promising green opening, with a realistic pine accord and a strong lavender note - so far, so fougère. It is quite herbal here, and as it develops, a peppery undertone becomes evident, complementing the greenness and keeping things aromatic. Woody notes follow, a natural progression from the green opening.

However, this all happens very quickly, and after about half an hour, it fades to a musky, soapy, barely-there skin scent that isn't even that pleasant. Sillage is intimate and longevity is weak.

An aromatic, masculine-leaning freshie for hot weather, CdT shows promise initially but ultimately falls flat. Disappointing and definitely overpriced. 2/5.",09/08/23 11:17,Enrium

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"A beautiful fresh, green fragrance - the cypress note is obviously dominant, but it's not one dimensional or piney. The florals and citruses balance it out a bit so it's not too mature or barbershop-like, but still leans heavily masculine. It's more alpine forest to my nose than Tuscany, and if oversprayed perhaps a bit too heavy for summer, but looks like my next spring/autumn choice.",07/04/23 11:38,es_paradis
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I have tested Acqua di Parma Cipresso di Toscana for a second time on paper, yesterday.
At the same time I tested Chanel Paris-Edimbourg, another Cipress based fragrance.

Curious thing: If I smell first Cipresso di Toscana and then Paris- Edimbourg, I am not able to smell the Chanel. If I smell
Paris- Edimbourg first, I still can smell the Acqua di Parma, which is stronger to my nose.
I have been on the fence with Cipresso di Toscana simply because the ratings on Fragrantica are lower but on paper it does pretty well. It's stronger than the Chanel and I also enjoy the scent more.
Furhermore the price for the Chanel has been increased this year from 83€ to 98€ for 50 ML.
Makes it an easy choice.

It will be my 15th Acqua di Parma. Just as many as I own from Chanel. Although I have finish and not replaced a 16th Chanel, being Bleu De Chanel EDP. So Chanel stays in pole position.",05/08/23 03:14,Louismanuel
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Highly disappointed. I was expecting a green/citrus freshie and what I got was soap, aftershave, old man DNA fougere. Not a bad fragrance, objectively, just definitely fits a certain demographic of man and that's not me.
The opening is sharp, piney, and VERY aftershavey; the dry down is more mellow oakmoss. The barbershop comparisons are apt; although ""barbershop"" can mean different things to different people. Bad blind buy unless you are an older gent and well acquainted with this type of genre. It's not a blue scent, and not something I think would have great sex appeal.",04/29/23 06:47,MZMpac81

AdPs Blu Mediterraneo line first came out while I was living in a small town in Tuscany. As a fan of this house, I immediately investigated the new line at a local boutique, and Tuscan Cypress resonated with me greatly. It was EXACTLY the scent of the town I'd been living in and what I loved so much about the ""air"" and atmosphere around me. I purchased two bottles right away, and over the years, it became harder to find. I have a few from this collection, but CdT is my favorite. During my time in Italy, I traveled to many regions and towns throughout the country, and Blu Mediterraneo does an excellent job in capturing the ""essence"" and vibe of each of the locations in its lineup both through using extraits indigenous to those regions and in transporting you there, yourself.

Smelling the natural extract it smells intensely aromatic, not dark but rather dry, cold, and green, not even remotely similar to vetiver.
This is one of the few cypress fragrances which portray cypress spot on.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is a bit of a departure from most of the other ADP Blue offerings (almost all of which I have really enjoyed). I've worn it several times now and every time I spray it I have an initial blast of piney loveliness followed by a perfectly pleasant but very familiar lasting aromatic, sweet, woody smell which gives me strong flashbacks to teenage changing rooms in the '90s. To me this smells very similar indeed to a Lynx (or Axe for those outside the UK/Oz/NZ) body spray, it's been too long for me to put my finger on precisely which one, possibly Java? Tempest? Nevada? Mirage? Maybe Apollo? it's 100% one those old ones from the '90s. I searched to see if anyone else has made this connection but it seems to just be me so take all of this with a pinch of salt but I swear it's very similar.

This is not really a criticism, the smell is nice, especially after a few hours when it's settled down but the familiarity for me is so strong that it feels positively retro whenever I wear it and I worry that if I ran into an old school-friend they'd think I'd been hoarding discontinued Lynx products all these years.",07/11/22 07:05,MagicBez

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Cipress di Toscana has a very sharp and penetrating opening with a strong initial sillage. The opening gives you pine, cypress, petitgrain, a hint of lavender, a greenish tinge that feels close to sage, and something a little spicier as well as a hint of citrus that feels half way between orange and lemon and grapefruit. The petitgrain and pine combination can be a little headachy for me, but then petitgrain and I tend not to get on very well together. The licorice note (star anise) gradually comes through very gently but with increasing presence in the first hour. There's a sort of thin lemon incense feel in the first hour which I presume is the elemi in the background. In the opening hour Cipresso di Toscana feels like a much sharper, much more aggressive version of Tom Ford's Italian Cypress.

Two hours in and Cipresso di Toscana has settled down into a nicer blend, softer, more subtle, and with a correspondingly reduced sillage. There's not a massive development from this point onwards. By five and a half hours in the petitgrain headaches have gone and the scent is a little softer again but it feels more of an okay than a like to me. It's perfectly fine in that there's nothing wrong with it but it's just not good enough to dislodge the likes of similar perfumes (Tom Ford's Italian Cypress, Floris 1962, Acqua di Parma's Chinotto di Liguria) from my preferences among aromatic scents, especially those with leading themes of cypress or pine. By this stage it's just a skin scent but it really sticks to my shirt sleeves.

Six and half hours in the perfume has become a little sweeter. The lavender is more prominent and there's something else green and something a touch sweeter. The fading process is well underway but it really hangs in there - I get about twelve hours from it so if you want durability you certainly get it here by the bucket load!

I think Cipresso di Toscana is one of those perfumes that works at any time of the year but I'd favour it during the early autumn and spring with the cool morning air that warms up. Despite my disagreement with the petitgrain I can appreciate it's an elegant scent. But I think there are one or two which do the cypress - pine - aromatic better.",09/15/21 16:45,mutatismutandis
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"If you crush cypress needles between your fingers and smell them, that's exactly what this smells like.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Brilliant stuff from ADP. A clean, piney top with the characteristic soapiness in the drydown.
I have no idea where fragrantica got their fictional note list from. According to ADP’s website, the notes for this fragrance are:

Top: orange, elemi, star anise
Mid: lavandin, clary sage, petit grain
Base: cypress, pine needles, fir balsam

The longevity is solid with this one, more so than others in the Blu Mediterrano line. Cipresso's piny qualities are quite different than other masculine pines like Polo, Quorum, One Man Show, etc. Do not be quick to dismiss it if you haven't cared for piney scents before-this is all done with debonair nonchalance, as if the fragrance is carried to you on the breeze rather than condensing thick in a murky miasma in a coniferous bog.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Mature, elegant, old-school classy.

Im Italian irl and this smells Italian, but not sure in the best way. This scent is before the 1970's boozy era of frags, so im getting a classy semi-wealthy enjoying life as a financially free man of the 1960's.

Its good, buuuuuut, it's not going to garner you any compliments in 2020, it smells like an older gents skin DNA, you know when a guy wears a cologne for decades and it just melds with his natural body scent (like my dad...lol may he rip). It gives off a light yet rich barbershop/soapy scent + a lil dry small florals in the mid notes.

I think you'd need to be in the right situation to wear this, im thinking while on vacation in Italy, driving a convertible from town to town with your sunglasses on and the wind blowing through your hair vibe. It's dated, yet, kindly beautiful. I'd recommend 'Sedley' from PDM as a superior frag in this genre.

Cipresso Di Toscana was one of the first I tried and it was not an immediate love. The first time I sprayed it on it was on a very hot day and the scent simply didn't stick well with my skin. The next time it was a totally different story. While I couldn't smell much of the citrus, the cypress was obvious from the get-go. As time went by, a smoky note came through and stayed for the rest of the wear. This is one of the most long-lasting in the line, a good 3-4 hours.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"This unisex scent leans very masculine on me. It's spicy and sharp with conifer notes. This scent is dark green.

There is something very calming and serene about this fragrance that reminds me of cloud-soft over-sized hoodies, holding a cup of coffee or hot tea with both hands, and reading a book by the fireplace in winter (though I think this fragrance can work in any season).

I really like it a lot, but would like it so much more on a man. If I smelled a man wearing this, I would be very attracted to the fragrance and I might even start a conversation with him. It would definitely be catching for me.

Unfortunately, silage for me is very soft. I ended up spraying it on my shirt to correct this and it projected much better. Longevity is moderate.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I've had a bottle of the post-relaunch perfume for about 2 weeks now, and I'm very satisfied. It's still the same Cipresso di Toscana, and it's beautiful. Some friends of mine describe it as a barbershop fragrance, and there are certainly people who think it's nothing special; yes, it's an aromatic fougere and it smells like the 1980s. However, it's everything people wished they had back then. I think Bertrand Duchaufour took an old style and created something that would have been the envy of his colleagues back in 1985. When I smell Cool Water, it's dull, but Cipresso di Toscana is happiness. It has elements of the sea and the pines lining the coast. It's inspired by Italy, but it reminds me of the beaches of Virginia, where I'd go every summer as a boy. Pines grow on the barrier islands, so pine naturally goes with marine notes to create a seashore complex. This fragrance transports me back to that time in my life.",05/18/19 01:02,drkool_phd

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"To me, as a women, Cipresso di Toscana feels like an olfactory equivalent of boyfriend jeans (which are no favorite of mine, but that's not the point I want to make).
This is unisex and has notes that are typically used in male fragrances. But they're blended into something smooth, light and slightly sweet that would never feel like I've doused myself in my boyfriend's cologne. It feels soothing and natural. So, it's easy to wear even for women who don't usually like masculine scents, but I could imagine that it also smells very nice on men.

This has nice aromatic notes. A coniferous opening, lavender, fresh herbs and spices. Later in the drydown it's a bit woody. I'm kind of surprised there is not a single sweeter note listed, maybe it's just my skin, but on me the base definitely smells a bit vanillic and warm besides the refreshing and herbal notes.",06/01/18 15:40,SailorV

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I've tried the majority of the Blu Mediterraneo line by now, and so far there hasn't been a single one I didn't at least like. Cipresso di Toscana is no exception: it's great, very natural-smellig, more aromatic and herbal than woody, even a bit spicy as it dries down. Actually quite succesful in evoking a hot summer's day in a coniferous forest full of herbs!

There's only one problem, which isn't really a problem since it's been discontinued, more like a relief: it's not quite unisex enough for my taste. Of course there's no gender to smells, and I only really dislike uber-masculine fragrances with their macho in-your-face vibe, which this one definitely isn't guilty of: it's rather subtle, and very nice. But it is does lean more towards the clasically masculine, which means I think I'd appreciate this more on somebody else than on myself.",01/22/15 23:25,dsty

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"I recall this being very weak, but I wanted to give it a fair shake again. Initially, I'm getting a lot of coniferous notes, but it's been sweetened and tamed by the addition of fruity notes that seem all too reminiscent of men's designer fruit fragrances. Even a bit of the old dreaded melon is here, and our old friend the Curve ass-leather note, all over synthetic woods. This is very disappointing, and to me seems very uncharacteristic of a respected niche line like AdP (not that any of their others have impressed me very much!). As the base approaches, I'm presented with the same cheap cherry/wood scent as the new version of Dunhill, which to me just feels like an easy cop-out. The sweetness isn't strong, but it's too full of fruits and honey, and ends up being no better than what you'd find in a run-of-the-mill designer scent. It has a bit of the ""moneyed"" vibe that their Colonia Intensa has, and that helps a bit, but overall I just don't find it to be worth the niche price or the niche brand. Geir does it better, and stronger. Looks like I better move on to their Fig one!",09/25/14 17:28,Redbeard
Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Having sprayed it first, it really smells masculine, but in a beautiful fresh just-out-of shower way. I detect pine, citrus and rosemary, and yes, perhaps the very first impression is shaving foam.H However, after just a few minutes it transforms into a cloud that can be described as aromatic awesomeness of herbs and salty seawater with a bit of a barber vibe.

Although pine and cypress are still there, they form the canvas instead of dominating. I detect lavender and rosemary, sage, perhaps a little coriander, but no cardamom or flowers. CdT is on the juicy side, I wouldn't say its a dry pine scent. and it is very aromatic, warm and smooth, hides under your skin and blends with your natural skin scent.

When its settles further, i detect more cypress as well as vetiver and patchouli base, so it does tick all the boxes for me. At the same time I admit, CdT leans more masculine. Stays close to the skin, but staying power is good for summer EdT,4 h aromatic bliss.",08/07/14 10:12,katariina9

I consider it a very nice and natural smelling perfume. The longevity is so and so according to others but i'm not in a position to determine this now. Definitely, a perfume for summer first and all year round for those who do not like heavy artilery perfumes.
I cant see a woman wearing this as the odour of cypress is more or less, masculine...and this is it! it is a masculine perfume for men that reminds pino sylvestre somehow but CDT is much more quality fragrance.

It smells just like cypress trees, and if you really inhale deeply into your skin, you should be able to smell some soft florals and aromatics, but they are disguised so well that this easily passes as a unisex fragrance. My concern with it is that trees sometimes give off a faint scent that reminds me of body odor.

It evolves right away into a very clean and tonic summer/day fragrance with basil, musc and pine. I live in Tuscany where we have Cypress as our regional Tree and I can say TC evocates perfectly the countryside landscapes of my region. I agree with some other reviewers who says it gets a bit ""perfumery"" in the drydown, but nothing disturbing or changing the idea I have about TC. A gentle, clean scent and a good alternative to anonimous aquas.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"When in search of a Summer scent, the contents of these sea-blue bottles seem to be just what you've been looking for.

I almost wrote off Cipresso di Toscana based upon the opening, which to my nose was a typical citrusy lemon and grapefruit fragrance with not much depth. However once settled, this fragrance transformed into something in which its beauty is difficult to describe.

The scent is warm, somewhat herbaceous, sweet, soothing and woodsy. The citruses vanish in a matter of seconds when applied to the skin, making way for a beautiful blend of lavender, pine, jasmine, cypress and patchouli.

Cipresso di Toscana is distinctively unisex, there is enough versatility for this to wear well on both men and women. Some say that this fragrance reminds them of nature and the Mediterranean. I've personally never ventured there, however I do feel as if this fragrance transports me to a picturesque island covered in pine trees, exotic flora and surrounded by clear, sparkling blue seas.

I find this fragrance to be very complex, hence the reason why I enjoy it so much. The absence of harsh citrus and strong fruity accords, places this fragrance in a unique category for a Summer scent.

Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo - Cipresso di Toscana Acqua di Parma,"Sea water..the first sensation at very first sprinkle is of sea water! I love how Acuqa di Parma has such natural tendencies ( in the only 2 that I have tested). Another enjoyeable facet of this perfume is that the florals are just enough, never too forward or sweet, and there are so many individually distinguishable notes-and so many perfectly blended and meshed combinations of scents here. I do love unisex perfumes, this one leans towards masculine. I think it is the lavender, sage, petit grain, all combining together, and then, the added zing of pine and sometimes cypress, that makes it so manly. However, the cardamon here is not so strong, neither the patchouli. The sillage is medium to high, the lasting power is long and excellent. (The spicy notes last forever during the dry down).

Sakura Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"I really enjoy this. Some cherry blossoms can skew too fruity and reminiscent of ""body spray"" and thus unsophisticated. This leans much more floral and ""perfumey"" and musk (the very clean variety) rounds it out and fortifies the other notes; that is, it doesn't overtake, rather it does a solid job as a base note. There is prominent bergamot too - a note I love - it lends an optimistic yet elegantly bright facet to this predominantly cherry blossom fragrance while the jasmine is subtly noticeable as it settles into the skin.

It's very bright and uplifting with a definitive spring vibe, but it is neither a freshie not a fleeting floral: there is substance to it. However, like many of this range, it's neither a powerhouse nor does it stick around for more than a few hours (I wonder if it comes in travel spray form). While it's here though, it's lovely and makes for a perfect spring scent that I'd love wearing for lunch dates with friends or during daytime on a mini-break. 4/5.",04/13/25 21:17,La Dragonessa Rossa

I am not usually very into floral fragrances but this triggered something in my memory... it felt like home. It is a very comforting scent and very unisex in my opinion. The bergamot and mandarin blend beautifully with the cherry blossom, and don't even get me started with the musk. I found it irresistible. After my initial purchase at Jo Malone, I was given a 15% discount in any other product I wanted so I didn't think twice and bought Sakura. I've been wearing both together every day and truly feel more myself than with any other fragrance I've owned. I've read some people say it doesn't last very long on them and for me this is not the case. It is definitely not a beast projector, but it stays on my skin all day. It leaves a nice trail as well, very inoffensive but will have people following you. 3 people at my office complimented me and my dad who is usually into very masculine fragrances said I smelled amazing.

Sakura Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Sakura Eau de Parfum by Acqua di Parma is a beautiful fragrance inspired by the delicate cherry blossom. It captures the essence of spring with its fresh and floral notes.

Sakura Eau de Parfum by Acqua di Parma is like a breath of fresh air with its vibrant and uplifting scent. The fragrance opens with the zesty and citrusy notes of Bergamot and Mandarin Orange, which instantly invigorates the senses. Then, the delicate and floral aroma of Cherry Blossom takes center stage, creating a soft and romantic atmosphere. The fragrance is further enhanced by the subtle sweetness of jasmine, adding a touch of elegance. Finally, it settles into a cozy and comforting base of musk. Overall, it's a beautiful composition that embodies the beauty and grace of Cherry Blossoms in bloom.

It's suitable for everyday wear! Its fresh and floral notes make it a perfect choice for any occasion. Whether you're going to work, meeting friends, or just running errands, this fragrance will add a touch of elegance to your day. The longevity is around 5 hours with moderate projection and you may need to reapply it but the fragrance is so soothing and calming it's worth taking that extra hassle.

Also, if you're looking for a fragrance that won't trigger Migraine or any other discomfort, then you must try Sakura Eau de Parfum by Acqua di Parma.

It's true that it doesn't project nor does it last long but then again, these kinds of scents never do. I might get another sample and come back to this review, I can't get over that opening but I don't see myself purchasing a full size simply because I'm not in love.

Sakura Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Despite being labelled an eau de parfum, this behaves more like a cologne. I sprayed myself very liberally (8 sprays), and the scent was barely detectable an hour later, not even on my clothing. This would probably work well for fans of Juliette Has A Gun or other popular 'skin scent' lines.

The notes are pleasant enough, but the juice is not worth the price in my opinion. Cherry blossom and jasmine actually work quite well with citrus top notes and a musky base, but I have seen all of these notes done much, much better for way less money. It's not disappointing, but it's also not worth it.",12/04/20 20:01,Bergamet

Sakura Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"What you expect from AdP is outstanding citrus opening and Sakura has that, with a watery, juicy, nearly green effect (I often associate with fig) but it's heavily perfumed with a dominant cherry blossom right from the get go, I actually didn't realise just how much so on first spritz, but then this is laden with fresh cherry blossom. Very nice just a bit femme and a little too 'norm' and reminscent of air fresheners for me. This speaks more to the skill and quality of air freshner formulation that it does about this being a poor fragrance because it isn't. There's Nothing wrong with a functional fragrance and the floral musk and jasmine sambac (which isn't particularly prominent) just add to what is a very pleasant and good quality, light, summer floral.

Sakura Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Bubble Gum

For the first 20 Minutes all I got was bubble gum, as if the fragrance had been meant for very young girls.

Sakura Eau de Parfum Acqua di Parma,"Just tried this in John Lewis on Oxford Street (London) 20 minutes ago, and my first impressions are that it's very nice indeed.

It could well be the unisex floral fragrance I’ve been looking for. I’ve been hunting high and low through feminine white florals and the floral end of male fragrance, with limited results. I've just got bored of all the same old notes of so-called 'male' fragrance but I'm still limited by my own preconceptions and olfactory expectations so am reluctant to bite the bullet and wear J'Adore, for example.

Anyway, Sakura...The combined floral notes of the cherry blossom and the jasmine aren’t too overwhelming or overly feminine that would put men off. I think the musk might also keep it 'grounded'.

It's not a big projector though, and I can't see it lasting ages either, but today is a very hot and sweaty day so I'm sure that might reduce both. I would very much like to try this again to double-check.

I wouldn't have called this a 'citrus' fragrance though - it's a floral through and though. Just because it has some fleeting citrus in the opening does not a citrus make.

The other observation is that it's quite linear - once the ubiquitous citruses are out the way anyway. I don't know whether this is a good or a bad thing. I do like the middle/end hybrid, but who knows what could have come?",07/25/19 11:15,Jareth

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Blind buy, was lucky to find 100ml of this discontinued offering, along with a 5ml miniature for under £50 (meaning I could resell at a good price if I didn't like it, with no real risk of loss). First day of wearing.

Love that initial fresh blast like all other AdP.

Shortly after the opening it felt quite familiar to me. I detect some strong overlaps with Armani Code, Dior Sauvage, and Moncler Sunrise due to the peppery notes, and likely the unmentioned ambroxan.

I'd say this is woodier, warmer, more masculine, mature, and reserved than those. It's quieter than Code and Sauvage, but stronger than Sunrise in my experience of testing all three.

I suspect I'll hang on to this one, will make for a particularly good Autumn scent but is versatile enough for other seasons and casual, outgoing or formal occasions.",07/30/24 09:00,olfactsnolies

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Im an oakmoss freak. I also like AdP fragrances generally very much. This might as well be a sauvage flanker. Its garbage and theres no real oakmoss nor is this anything worth even half what it costs. Super generic fake fuzz ""moss"", no performance. Smells like colonia on first spray, then in 30 mins smells like a modern amberwood s***show.

If you want oakmoss, i urge you to look elsewhere. Crazy how nuclear, high quality and natural the Colonia Ambra or Colonia Leather smells compared to this and its the same line somehow.",01/14/24 12:37,Seanhh1986
Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Quercia is a perfume made for a manly man, someone who wears crisp white office shirts—think a Private Equity professional. It’s strong, sophisticated, and unmistakably masculine.

I wore it to delve into this manly world and, although it didn’t quite suit me, I totally indulged in its rich scent. It starts fresh with lemon and petitgrain, moves to a spicy heart of cardamom and geranium, and settles into a warm, woody base of cedarwood and oakmoss.

This fragrance didn’t mesh with my feminine essence, but it was a delightful experience nonetheless. My friend and I explored it in the store and were so taken that I ended up buying a bottle.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"A fresh scent - but not green (ie Azzaro-y) or blue or airy (Issey Miyazaki-y). I dislike those green/blue/airy scents, and this has more of a sense of purity and specificity than scents in that ball park.

There’s oakmoss, wood, some cardamom and lime zest. It is masculine.

It’s simple and doesn’t evolve much (not a criticism). It reminds me a lot of Valiant by Boadacia the Victorious, but I doubt that will help people! They share a lot of he accords, although few of the same notes.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"This one sneaked up and surprised me. I liked the opening but wasn't sure if I was unique and special. When it dried down, I could almost visually see the hidden subtle creamy wafts of tonka and cardamon mix under a layer of woods and citrus. Tickles me with delight.

Opening: ADP vibe of natural, citrusy, fresh opening, but deeper and darker than my usual Colonia or Blu Mediterraneo ADPs. Bit of my Colonia Club green and mint but with added amber and a hint of leather. Pleasant and likable...do I love it? TBD

Drydown: Creamy tonka and cardamon becomes more prominent and layers beautifully with the woods. Love it.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Acqua Di Parma Men Colonia Quercia opens with a moderate projection of citrus, floral, spicy and woody accords. The petitgrain is the most noticeable opening note, it comes as sharp, and green; the bergamot is by its, sharp citrusy, the cardamon and cedarwood mix their notes producing a smooth fresh, vibrant woody-spicy and very aromatic scent, unique and characteristic of this fragrance. The geranium adds a floral touch but it is not as prominent as the combination of cardamon and cedarwood, also, the pink pepper is a soft touch. As the fragrance commences to dry down, the oakmoss becomes noticeable supporting the woody notes; the patchouli is just a pinch and adds a faint green touch; finally, the tonka bean adds its enveloping aroma and sweetens all notes. The most noticeable opening to dry-down changes are, the sharp citrus accords and the greenness of the petitgrain is noticeable during the opening, however, towards the dry-down, it partially fades away and softens; the bergamot is short-lived and confined to the opening; the tonka is more prominent towards the dry-down and smooths the fragrance with a soft powdery-like accord. Once Acqua Di Parma Men Colonia Quercia has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, sweet, cardamon, and cedarwood fragrance with some green, citrus and floral accords. The fragrance feels aromatic, elegant, exotic, high-quality, masculine, mature, modern, nicely-blended, playful, slightly powdery (especially once the tonka has fully set in), rare, rich, sweet, unique, versatile, warm, woody, and very pleasant.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance does go to amouage sunshine man territory with hints of memoir man because of the anise/absinthe effect it seems to be giving off due to the bergamot.

If you're looking for oakmoss to be the star player, this isn't it.

One other significant reason why I tie this with sunshine man is because while quercia is an eau de cologne, It's loud like sunshine man.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"I might be pretty simple in my explanations, but I judge basically all tree fragrances by the smell of fresh-cut trees. Fresh-cut trunks smell quite pungent and harsh, not overly sweet, but also somewhat cold, that many may perceive as a metallic smell. Trees smell in this way rather straight forward, so I would not expect this fragrance to change very much, and it doesn't. This perfume stands out as it does kind of remind you of everything and nothing at the same time.Now that may be because either it is a blend to reminiscent an mature fresh-cut oak or it actually samples heavily the accord that does not have this much prominence in perfumes. I can smell some spices and flowers, but I guess it is for the balsamic feel of it. It is really a solid fragrance with good longevity and performance. What you get here is really an oak (oakmoss), and it is heavy. Forget lightness of flowery and fruit notes. Forget a galore of spices, no, this is a tree. I would actually expect it to be harsher, moister, earthier, but it doesn't go there. It is wearable to an extent and any solemn occasion will do, like theatre, fancier restaurant, cinema, celebrations, funeral, wedding, even for some jobs, and also for hiking or walking in the park, but surely not for clubbing or partying. I would not recommend this perfume to teenagers, but from mid 20's and upwards will do just fine.",01/11/20 10:21,pete2784

Elegance in a bottle.",11/30/19 22:56,112237
Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Amongst the AdP Colonia series (not the newest black but the brown bottles) this is now my 2nd favorite after Sandalo. While Sandalo is a full-on barbershop sandalwood masterpiece one might link it to men over 30+, Quercia has amazing versatility not just on age but also season/occasion.

Another highlight that it's the least linear fragrance of the series IMO. Upon first spray I immediately thought another ""mature crowd"" thing, bergamot, oakmoss and geranium combo - very classy. Within the hour though it changed face into a generic masculine scent in a very good way, generic because it will remind you of some iconic fragrances.

Performance, it just does the trick and lasts, projects but doesn't disturb.

BUT, the price... I think it's way too expensive for what it is but can be found discounted so then it's a great deal.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"This elegant fragrance blends citrus with light florals and traces of wood and spices to elicit a remarkably fresh take on gentlemen’s colognes. It’s for those who are bored with the standard spring, summer, fall fare, who want a fragrance with more body and complexity while still retaining a light and airy effervescence. It’s a blast of fresh air that uplifts and energizes, a scent that in the last eight months has quickly become one of my top spring/summer/fall picks. It’s not intrusive, it doesn’t demand attention, it’s not a beast, it just exudes suave sophistication and modernity—a prefect office or everywhere daytime scent.

On the negative, longevity is not what I would optimally prefer. I overspray in two spots on my neck and apply lightly to my shirt to get 5-7 hour projection. Still, I like it so much I bought a 180ml backup bottle.",04/25/19 09:53,IpodHappy

This is for warmer weather. Quercia's projection and sillage were nice; lasted six hours before becoming soft.. Unisex maybe slightly masculine.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Quercia is a very interesting fragrance... in warmer weather it reminds me of bright green moss in a humid forest with a hint of pollen in the air - in colder weather, the Tonka Beans almost smell like a chocolat chaud in a Parisian café.

Decent sillage - it will dominate other fragrances in the room for the first few hours - lacks the longevity of Colonia Oud - but still remains present for a good 6-8 hours on the skin.",07/17/18 16:49,monkey500
Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"I've found my summer scent! Quercia opens with a delicious burst of citrus, cardamom and geranium, smoothed over by a sweet vanillic tonka bean. The oakmoss gives a brittle, sparkly quality in the beginning which, overlaid with the sweet, hesperidic top notes, calls to mind vanilla ice-cream floating in a glass of lemonade.

As the top notes retreat, the cedar and oakmoss push to the fore and it becomes less citric-sweet and more starchy-powdery, but still with a hint of that soft, balmy citrus in the background. It stays like this at close range for several hours, and I'm enticed to sniff my wrist once in a while to find the lovely cardamom and bergamot still hiding behind the thin veil of earthy moss.

People have compared it to ""Russian Leather"" by Memo -and I can see why, they both have a similar powdery, brackish quality- but Quercia is a good deal lighter and more delicate, making it more appropriate for warm weather.

The price point is the only negative to me. At €175 for 100ml, it is massively over-priced compared to other Colonia scents, which typically retail at €108. Obviously it's marketed as part of an 'exclusive' range, but the ingredients, while nicely blended, don't strike me as that costly to produce. Perhaps the quality of the oakmoss extract used is particularly high? Anyway, I'm on the hunt for a bottle, at a fairer price, if anyone wants to sell.",06/24/18 07:31,Arabian Knight
Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Pleasant enough woody-freshy but a little too far on the masculine side to be wearable to me (female woody niche fan) - just a few steps too far into straight and slightly harsh aftershave-y-ness to truly enjoy. The moss is strong in this one. Bit synthetic at the edges and not quite warm enough for my taste either, though it does soften and sweeten considerably after a couple of hours. Wouldn't object to it on anyone else but it's not right for me, but I was probably barking up the wrong tree (hah!) hoping this might be an oak-centric wood temple like Lutens Chene which just happened to be hiding in plain sight among the mass-market men's EdC category.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Cards on the table, right off the bat for Quercia....This is a really, really good fragrance. Not only does it adhere to tried and tested ideas but it has some suprising extra depth and quality to elevate it that bit further.
Opens with a signature AdP freshness, petitgrain/citrus/verbena but immediately let’s you know that this is a woody fragrance, with earthy tones and plenty of oakmoss, lending a wonderful masculinity. So far so straight forward but the quality of the woody base really does keep giving throughout, those lime top notes lasting well into the drydown and at the heart of this fragrance there’s cardamom and geranium, all giving a kind of Italian vibe. The most surprising thing for me is the very deep drydown after many hours...there’s the soft vanilla notes which I’m assuming is from Tonka Bean.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Quality: 5 out of 5 – It’s a rare masterpiece – LOVE! It reminds me of the wow-factor when I initially smelt Terre d'Hermes Parfum or Xeryus Rouge.

Originality: 4 out of 5 – It’s very original but has some lovely notes in it which then ironically reminds me of some of my favourite fragrances!

Projection (Sillage): 3.5 out of 5 – moderate-to-heavy; people in your vicinity can smell your scent.

Versatility: 4 out of 5 – This scent is very versatile; it works well for either day or night, all seasons, ‘dressed-up’ occasions, for men around 25+.

Value: 2.5 out of 5 – This is a huge splurge for me at £135 for 100ml but I cannot stop smelling my hand! To treat myself on a birthday or anniversary, I’d pay this for the unique factor! But, if you’re going to spend money like this, you might as well go into John Lewis and get the whole ‘experience’ being told the notes and getting a lovely branded bag with a ribbon! 

Compliment Frequency: 3 out of 5 – Unsolicited compliments on the scent were not received. However, I asked two people I know what they thought (I was over-excited by this scent) and both loved it!

Packaging (Bottling): 4 out of 5 – Much thought seems to have gone into the packaging; it’s attractive and highly functional.

Overall Rating: 5 out of 5 – Amazing – This fragrance is not only flaw free, but is a true masterpiece. It surpassed my expectations and should be on a collectors list.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"By itself this fragrance is an upbeat and elegant petitgrain, citrus with a counter-intuitive complex earthy drop.
The pairing of Autumn earthiness of cardamom, petitgrain, tonka bean, patchouli, cedar with sharp citruses seems odd, but makes for a pleasant year round day time scent.
To me, this fragrance has year round appeal for daytime, but by itself is not remarkable. The utility for this fragrance is kind of similar to La Labo's Rose 33 -- but a lot sunnier and earthier smelling.
It smells clean, pleasant, finely constructed and upbeat -- but not really earthy in very alluring way.

I like to layer fragrances, so for me this fragrance served to both fortify and add needed gravitas and dimensionality to Tom Ford's Azure Lime.
Laying these 2 fragrances together kind of liberated each of them into a new arena of sunny mystique, hearty gravitas with approachable spice.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Just got a sample from this. If AdP has an answer to Aventus or Sauvage, it would absolutely be this one..but I would lean more towards Sauvage in terms of what this resembles..unfortunately as it's been done so much that also leaves it in an increasingly generic category. I don't get as much of the ambroxan that Sauvage has so much of, and I'd say this is a more refined scent to my nose, coming across as less of a single 'fresh laundry' note and easier to identify some others. I get a sharp lime note up front that is remniscent of Tom Ford Azure Lime and then the cedar, oakmoss and leather trio are likely what gives me a very slight Aventus vibe that I detect immediately afterwards. It's a great scent and I love this house, but I wouldn't pay their asking price for this one.",03/23/17 15:11,gregk

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Do you remember the 'Green' feeling you got from those mythic 'Oak Moss Bombs' of yore; Paco Rabanne and Polo? The images that evoked pop-culture references such as films like Southern Comfort and Death Wish and you imagined lumberjack shirted icons of 70's Hollywoood films wore such scents to the point where you knew you couldn't possibly wear those same scents in 2017; lest it be in the privacy of your own home for fear of being seen as absurd? Well rest easy my friend; the Oak Moss-focussed men's fragrance has been well and truly rehabilitated and brought into the 21st century. I tested this fragrance with one spray to my left hand and my female colleagues commented very positively on it. I was at first a tad bit lukewarm, but soon found myself wanting to sniff my hand again and again. Bravo Acquai di Parma - a very sophisticated and impressive achievement.",03/17/17 08:13,JohnMc

Similar to dylan blue but better performance. 20hrs on and after a gym session and can still smell this faintly on my arm.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Yes, when i first smelled this perfume i was astonished.
This is a good and well balanced perfume with class.
If you are used to the more common popular perfumes you have to get used to it. If yr used to the more nice well balanced perfumes and the colonia series you also need to adapt to it.
It opens with a woody/citric note with that deep classic smell that is typical for colonia.
Then comes the very anise-like note generated by cardamom and tonka beans. The woody note is prominent along the dry down until the end. The patchouli is very noticeable in the end and I think it is the note that other reviewers here mark as synthetic.
But in the whole run a good well balanced perfume just in the dry-down patchouli is too prominent and tends to make it a bit common or even in the realm of cheap/soapy-like perfume that isn't the case but it tends to it.
This perfume has some good class and is for a gentleman who wants to show his elegance without being too prominent.

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"Fragrance based on a legend of Piedmont is about an immense oak, so Quercia Colonia deals with the scent that represents this vital and long-lived oak.

The central core is an agreement oak moss that during the game is very nice with the company citrus and aromatic touches, but as it evolves and disappear citrus and floral crops out an acid character to imitate oak moss, but it neither comes close (too synthetic and unbalanced).

The fragrance has good durability and moderate wake, but that lacks proper drying qualities (disservice he has done that Acqua di Parma oak Piedmont :))

Colonia Quercia Acqua di Parma,"I just recieved and sprayed a sample of this so here goes!

Quercia opens up wih a strong lime note accompanied by some sweetness (from the tonka?). pretty soon the lime settles down. Now the geranium takes the lead and the cedar, patchouly and oakmoss gets more noticable. Also there is a slight hint of cardamom.

All in all, Quercia is a mature and fresh scent and its very different from the other offerings in the so called ""ingredient collection"". Personally, i think it would have been better att home in the Blue Mediterraneo lineup. It has kind of the same balance between fresh and woody/spicey as Ginepro di Sardegna.

Comparisions. It has kind of the same lime opening as Creeds Virgin Island Water. There are also some similarities to Penhaligon's Quercus - probably because they share the citrus, cardamom and oakmoss notes.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"In the cobblestone streets of Rome, where the scent of history mingles with the breath of the sea, Colonia Intensa emerged from the house of Acqua di Parma, embodying a unique essence of Italian elegance.

It is more than just a fragrance; it is a journey that begins with the first spray and continues until it becomes part of your memories.

The scent opens with a radiant burst of ripe citrus: orange, bathed in the Mediterranean sun, and lemon, sparkling with the clarity of morning light. This is accompanied by the warm hint of ginger and the exotic allure of cardamom.

This fragrance represents an extraordinary freshness, akin to the invigorating first breath of mountain air on a clear summer day.

As the minutes pass, the heart of the fragrance draws you deeper. White neroli blossoms, reminiscent of orange flowers in their prime, are surrounded by the fresh touch of artemisia and wild myrtle, evoking a Mediterranean garden at midday, where the leaves sway gently in the breeze.

Here, brightness melds with sweetness, as the fragrance gracefully transitions from the light of day to the warmth of evening.

When the sun sets, the base reveals the fragrance's eternal identity: luxurious leather, akin to an old armchair in an aristocratic library, meeting the noble richness of patchouli, complemented by the honeyed warmth of benzoin, and wrapped in a soft layer of musk, much like a winter shawl draped over your shoulders.

It is this finale that gives Colonia Intensa its unmistakable character—a depth and intimacy that lingers long after the noise has faded.

The sensory experience is like a masterful oil painting: its colors shift with the light, and its details are revealed slowly.

This fragrance does not shout for attention; it leaves a subtle, elegant impression. As one connoisseur put it, ""A Rolls-Royce in the world of fragrances, not a Lamborghini.""

Its virtues lie in the union of classical freshness and modern depth, making it a composition well-suited for the man who appreciates understated elegance.

However, it is not for everyone; some admirers lament its modest performance and projection, which linger close to the skin and diminish sooner than desired. Yet, others find this restraint to be the refinement that prevents it from overwhelming the senses.

In terms of longevity, it usually accompanies its wearer for six to eight hours, then settles into a soft, leathery shadow, as if the fragrance itself were whispering, ""I was here… and I still am.""

Colonia Intensa strikes a balance between morning sun and evening shade, between the sparkle of citrus and the warmth of leather, and between modernity and classical roots.

It is a fragrance that does not need to raise its voice to be heard, for it speaks in whispers and etches itself into memory without noise.

It is the choice of those who understand that true luxury lies in the details, and that the most beautiful impression is often the one that lingers long after we are gone.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Nothing but good things to say about this. Got a 6 OZ bottle for 90 bucks and honestly, that is a steal. This scent is incredibly sophisticated, and has a masculine powdery, fresh, old money type of vibe to it. Men of all ages can wear it, and I'm sure some women might find it appealing for their skin and interests as well. Considering I have a large supply of this, and the appeal it has on the nose, this is very likely to be my signature scent for the foreseeable future. This is a scent that almost anyone should be able to enjoy, for it is simple yet flawlessly executed. Not sure why this doesn't get more attention, but this is a legit fragrance from a legit brand that is a legit bargain from online retailers. Go get yours before the price goes up even more (sitting at about 100 dollars for 6 OZ at the time of posting)

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Very nice, probably excellent. I'm no Mediterranean playboy but to me this does not smell like any kind of cocktail or fizzy soft drink. Often when I smell citrus with ambery resins, it makes me think of candied citrus peels, and so it does here, but this is also fairly sour or tangy, with a little herbaceous bitterness too, and in the opening at least, it has quite a blearily balsamic aspect, like a nice hand cream. As others have noted, it probably would not be the ideal choice for the hottest days, but has the makings of a versatile fragrance for much of the rest of the year. The neroli is prominent and, especially early on, quite indolic. It has a sexy kind of mushroomy overtone that I associate more with jasmine and gardenia. Mainly because of the neroli, this makes me think of another Morillas creation, Bvlgari Man Wood Neroli. In some ways, this is almost what MWN might have been if MWN didn't smell quite so much like lemon furniture polish. Sillage is suitably moderate, longevity moderate to--probably--good.",05/14/25 14:39,woomanmoomin
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"My wife immediately thought this was an old school perfume. It does give off an aged barbershop smell which I quite like. It's not overpowering but sits close for all but the first 30 minutes in which it projects. I definitely pick up on the neroli giving it the flowery vibe throughout. The leather and cedar combo while I can't pick out individual notes with it, do provide a nice base to let you know that this leans masculine. If it lasted longer I'd like it better.",04/18/25 17:09,vespergo

Its very well blended and smooth. I dont feel its a big complement getter especially for young people.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Having bought Acqua di Parma’s excellent Fico di Amalfi earlier this year, I’m hoping to find more from the house that suit my tastes. I tried Colonia Futura, but sadly it’s not quite right for me, which is why Colonia Intensa came onto my radar. Just as with Futura, there is a definite Colonia thread running through Intensa, but comparatively, it is more of a classic old-school fragrance — and for me, it’s better for it.

Intensa opens with a flash of lemon and bergamot that, on my skin, vanishes within seconds and is replaced by a warm, soft cardamom note. Not so immediately obvious is the ginger, which lingers subtly at the back of the nose when one is not smelling the fragrance directly. It’s a great addition and makes Intensa far more interesting to me than it otherwise would be. Then, in hardly any time at all, this cardamom-ginger combination is joined by naturally sweet, aromatic notes that, to my nose, come across as slightly floral. This spicy, aromatic, floral vibe is somewhat powdery at the outset, but after a while it evolves into a full on power house of musk and leather, which on me lasts eight hours plus.

All in all, I prefer Intensa to Futura. It strikes me as smoother, more rounded, and more versatile.

Tested: 1ml decant.
Seasons / Occasions: Could be worn all year round. Suitable for most occasions.
Key thoughts: Spicy, floral early stages give way to musky leather, then turns powdery.
Overall rating: 7/10.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Lemon and ginger are the most prominent top notes, while cardamom eventually comes through as well. These sort of stays on top of a classic Italian cologne base. Otherwise I get a very decent English barbershop feel over it. While the ginger is a bit too strong for my personal taste, anyone who are into classic colognes should give it a try. You will find a lot more warm spice here, when compared to most of the colonia line, but I personally think it is approaching the fougère genre a bit. The leather aspect is discreet, and the citruses blend into the whole in a way that sets it apart from the hespéridés/citrus cologne style.

Otherwise I am a bit surprised over the performance on my skin. I own a handful of ADP’s but Intensa seems to behave more as an EDP initially, but only for an hour or so. After that I get a pretty average ADP performance, if you are a professional you should not wear stronger scents than this for the
workplace. The warm spices make it suitable the year around for indoor wear in my view.

That said, it's not a total loss. I'm a big fan of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, but I live in Florida. Tobacco Vanille is too heavy a scent for most of the year down here.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Mixed feelings about this one. Regarding longevity, I was quite surprised. Got a solid 8 hours out of it. After 12 hours, it was still a subtle skin scent. I rated it ""long lasting"" but its longevity is actually phenomenal, considering Intensa (as is the entire Colonia collection) is an eau de cologne. However, sillage and projection were ""intimate"" after about the first hour.

This is definitely not a soapy cologne. For me, it's a smooth woody-leather scent after the dry down. If there is any soapiness, it is quite subtle to almost nonexistent. In general terms, the scent from start to finish is polished, classy, masculine and smooth without any synthetic harshness. Typical AdP quality.

Despite all the positives above, for me it's only ""OK"". The overall experience is too subtle for me. I prefer fragrances that make more of a statement. Intensa is too introverted for me. However, I can see for a guy who wants something more subtle, especially for a professional environment, Intensa would be good for warmer and hot days in spring, summer and fall.",06/07/24 06:09,Smirky
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"For the last 3 reviewers:
Danilo etc: Colonia Intensa lasts around 8 hours on me. Out of the 15 Acqua di Parma colognes I have, only the 4 Concentrees (Brown bottles) last longer than Colonia Intensa.
My son wore it on a New Years Eve a few years ago. Out on a Penthouse Roof Garden watching the Fireworks I could smell it on him 2 meters away. It was windy as usual in the Netherlands.

Uhistincky: and I prefer Tuscan leather over OG Colonia. Or Steak over Tomatoes.

Shishibr: Smells like Cola?????
I must have woke up in a parallel World.

This fragrance is smoky. Indeed not soapy as you expect from Acqua di Parma fragrances.

About 5 years ago I gave gift sets of Essenza in the black box and Intensa in the yellow box to a few of my clients and to my 2 sons as Christmas gifts.
The Essenza is clearly a Summer Fragrance, while Intensa is more appropriate for the evenings. First I was convinced the later would be a Spring-Summer type but after I smelled it on my son on New Years Eve, I knew it would works all year long.
It's by far the most sophisticated of all AdP fragrances I have. (15)",06/05/24 10:23,Louismanuel
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"It would probably be my favorite in the entire line if it weren't for its longevity, which is by far the worst. In fact, among the Colognes, only Intensa lives up to AdP's stereotype of very short longevity on my skin.

This perfume has, perhaps, the best ginger note I've ever smelled, along with the freshest cardamom I know. It smells 100% natural, and to my nose, the leather is not present. It's even less musky than the original and Essenza, and certainly much less soapy (Essenza is by far the soapiest). It actually seems even more unisex than those two. It's not as citrusy and sharp as Futura and not as floral as Pura, sitting in a middle ground with a light woody base that doesn't detract from the freshness at all.

Its opening fragrance, with its ginger and neroli, is one of the most pleasant I've ever encountered. As mentioned, it smells 100% natural, like Dior Homme Cologne (one of the best citruses I know), but certainly less minimalist than that, with woods, musk, a more diverse citrus blend, and even some incense, without losing its freshness and brightness. However, like Dior Homme Cologne, its longevity is poor.

To me, it's the central ""scent"" of the entire line, modernizing the original and making it less soapy, which is no small feat, as this is one of the most incredible lines in perfumery. For an even more modernized version, and by far the most citrusy and long-lasting on the skin, I suggest trying Futura. For a lighter, aquatic, and unisex option, Pura is great, and for a timeless barbershop scent, the Original is the way to go.",06/05/24 10:01,danilodeathayde

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Strange that rose and geranium are not listed in the notes. Especially the classic, pink rose note is so significant, it's beyond limits of disregard. With that said, it's a very classic take on the original which I find the better choice still due my very subjective leniency on the original.

Intensa smells more old fashioned to me than the original or perhaps my impression of rose note giving that vibe to me. Nevertheless Intensa still holds those complex aromatics much better than the average niche/designer, there is probably a lot of natural oils in trace amounts (classic Morillas style) that it creates a simple-to-the-nose yet complex-in-reality blend. Dry down is again Morillas' favorite musks, that human-skin powdery Muscenone, Habanolide type (Mugler Cologne-ish drydown) with some woody ambers (luckily not in unsophisticated amounts that we find in many so-called niche today).

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Was somewhat expecting a stronger Colonia - my favourite classic mens cologne - and boy was I wrong. TLDR this is a case of attempting a major notes swap while retaining the original vibe, but off the mark in case of Colonia Intensa.

As expected from Colonia, It opens very Cistrusy, juicy and zingy - stronger even than OG - excellent! But then the freshness disappears in just about 15 minutes, completely switching the fragrance. A bait and switch if you will. This was my favourite part of the fragrance too.

Fragrance moves into a Green Spicy and Aromatic direction, completely dropping any hints of Citrus it had. Biggest notes to pick out are Cardamom and Patchouli, latter being particularly strong, and some other Greens, all wrapped in a bit of White Floral soapiness. Almost Fougere territory. Base adds strong Leather with added Woods, and is very Musky, but the green-fougery-spicy middle remains. At this point fragrance becomes very old school and mature.

The scent is Peppery-Spicy, Green, strong Leathery, and Musky. It's very mature and kind of the opposite of your typical summer freshie by the Italian coast. I'd go as far as saying this can easily be a Winter fragrance and not a Summer one.

In some way it paints a similar picture of a gentleman on a coast that radiates freshness, class, and confidence, but in a more serious, contemporary way. Except it takes a completely different angle on it.

Would this have been another fragrance line, the perception would be different, but for Colonia - especially Intensa - it just doesn't cut it for me. And while I do love when fragrances have a major note switch but somewhat retain the vibe of the original (Gentleman EDT Intense), this isn't the case for me unfortunately.

It's smooth and well-blended, good and complex enough to find people who would genuinely appreciate it, but the scent profile makes me want to reach for Bogart for some reason, and as for Fresh fragrances - there's a much wider and better choice out there.

Not bad but isn't worth the price.",02/07/24 03:44,razorsedge

Fresh lemon, then something weird but pleasant hits you, I think that's the cardamom/ginger.

Then the lemon dissapates, leaving the herbs with sweet soapiness. The patchouli comes out very loud at this point.
Then the animalic leather, and a little bit of musk.
Yeah and that's it. Obviously the lemon top note is very fleeting, so the perfume comes down to sweet herbal soapiness -> warm leather+patchouli, with the sweetness not being an obnoxious one, but a pleasant ""car fragrance"" one coming from the benzoin. Actually very nice. There's no bitterness or anything. The patchouli gives it a little bit of dryness, but that's it, other than that it's very smooth and at the beginning, when there's still the realistic juicy lemon in the air it smells amazing. But yeah, it ain't worth 100$ in my opinion. Bought a tester and i'm happy with it.",02/01/24 04:39,abscission
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Yes, @SOS1980, search up fragrance 'maceration,' although, in reality the process is actually called 'maturation,' but most people call it 'maceration' anyways.",01/15/24 23:28,Sebajun7567
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Classy, business-ready scent in a near fougere/aftershave style. Good projection for about an hour then becomes a pretty intimate scent after that which will last several hours.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This juice is very classy and beautifully blended. However, on my skin it doesn’t last more than 2 hours. I blindly bought it and I’m not disappointed except with longevity at least on my me! Any advice to improve its performance?",11/11/23 14:41,SOS1980
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"To the reviewer below - I will say I can see where the other reviewer comes from when he says this is a smoother/drier Cedrat Boise. This is not only similar to it, it’s much, much better and masterfully done. Classier. Infinitely more natural. In fact, there is no comparison - AdPCI is a masterpiece.",11/06/23 15:05,autumnrequiem
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Acqua di Parma Colonia Intensa is a classically soapy Italian-style fragrance. It's marketed as a ""woody-leather"" fragrance, but that doesn't really mesh with the impression that it gives - if anything, I'd say it's closer to a fougere (more on that later).

The top notes hit with a very sharp, almost bitter, pithy citrus. It's not ""rindy"" like D&G Light Blue Forever, nor is it sweet like so many other citruses. It smells like the white gunk in between the rind and the fruit - sharp, acidic, and a little abrasive.

Fortunately, that impression fades pretty quickly (although the citrus does remain), but it's almost immediately replaced by old-school brown cake soap - the kind your grandad may have used. It's thoroughly masculine and smells delightfully clean, but again, it's not a ""modern"" soapiness, like how the Prada l'Homme line is ""soapy"" and ""clean"". This is a ""hairy-chested '70s Italian man, fresh out of the shower, reaching for his bottle of original Paco Rabanne Pour Homme"", kind of soapy.

The odd thing is, there really isn't a proper ""dry down"" here. This ""vaguely citrusy, old-school soapy"" scent profile just rides out for the next several hours (upwards of 6 so far, today), without any real evolution. There's a minimal sort of warm woodiness that reminds me of the scent of the library at my grandfather's house - old woods and a touch of spice, married to extreme cleanliness - which does bring a bit of sweetness to it, but it's a pretty consistently sharp scent throughout.

Performance-wise, it's got pretty minimal sillage (someone 3–4 feet away from me says he can't smell it, and I went *quite* heavy on the trigger), but it nevertheless has a pretty solid duration - it just sits close to the skin.

Within its genre, I would say this is a pretty middle-of-the-road fragrance. When you consider that it's often *quite* pricey, honestly, I have a hard time recommending it. If you can grab it for around $50-$60, it's a pretty good deal, but any more than that, and there are better options available, in my opinion. If you're curious, I've listed a few below:

- Acqua Essenziale Colonia from Salvatore Ferragamo hits almost the exact same notes, but with a wonderful sweet bergamot and orange blossom accord cutting the sharpness off the top. It was also created by Alberto Morillas, one of the two noses behind AdPCI.

- Dior Eau Sauvage (*Eau* Sauvage, not the Johnny Depp Sauvage) gives the same general impression with much more smoothness - and the parfum version is a true love of mine. The Parfum was also created by François Demachy, the other nose behind this scent.

- And finally, if you want to shell out the money, something like Terralba or Sleight of Fern from Masque Milano will fill that same role in your line-up, while taking that sharpness in far more interesting directions. And yes, if you were wondering, Sleight of Fern IS a fougere - to be frank, AdPCI has more in common with them, scent profile-wise, than it does with other ""woody leather"" fragrances.

(Aside: Looking through other reviews, I was very taken aback by someone calling it a ""smoother/drier Cedrat Boise""... this is incredibly wrong, and will absolutely ruin this fragrance for you if you go into it expecting anything in that wheelhouse.)

All-in-all, it's a pretty solid day-time, warmer-weather fragrance that will offend no-one by virtue of its sillage, but also offers very little in the way of evolution or modernity. I like it well enough, but I'm also in my mid-30s, and it hits me pretty hard in the nostalgia.

7.5/10. If you can find it for a good price, get it. If not, there are other things that can do the same general ""thing"", arguably better.",10/26/23 08:27,Dzarsos
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Huge fan of the original Colonia and really wanted to like Intensa but I honestly cannot. To me, it smells way too ""old man"" like. Like something a grandfather might wear. Do not blind buy this one IMO",10/12/23 12:44,Natecx
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Classy Italian cologne- the cardamom and ginger give it that extra warmth and oomph and make it more refined than the OG!

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I sprayed this on test blotter first, before looking at the notes, and wondered if there was a geranium note. There isn't of course but the lemon, ginger, cardomom, and mid of neroli, artemisia, and myrtle seems to impart a strong quasi-geranium facet. It wears differently than on blotter, with the substantial base notes really coming out. The mid seems subdued and supportive. It's one of the most subdued neroli notes I've encountered. And I think the ginger note is more prominent and significant in this composition than it gets credit for. It really gives a strong, longlived fresh zingyness and zest. With the citrus, it seems to almost mimic a breezy incense note. The ginger brings to mind my ginger oriented fragrances, most notably for me Serge Lutens 5 O'Clock au Gingembre. And with the breezy freshness and cedar in the base it almost seems a bit like a Houbigant Bois Mystique with ginger! I'm very surprised the ginger gets little mention. This is full bottle worthy for me and will be grouped with my ginger scents. Very nice.
Update 9/6/24: Wearing today, 30ish sprays and very little performance. Not like the first few times. Don't know what's wrong.",07/08/23 22:49,JmThms
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Intensa took a while for me to appreciate, and I suspect it's because one of the first times I wore it was on the train from Bologna to Verona in the sweltering mid-July summer heat, while this fragrance evokes imagery of riding down the Amalfi coast on a vespa while wearing a crisp white linen shirt and a cooling sea breeze running through your hair.

Nevertheless, it has surpassed the original Colonia for me. The citrus blast in the opening so typical for colognes has been tempered by the zesty warm ginger and sweet spicy cardamom, foreshadowing the woody and leathery drydown. While I found there's no risk in overspraying a little, don't expect this to fill up the room like your average 20 sprays of CDNIM would; the magic lies in its subtlety and discretion, this is a fragrance of good taste.

I see where people are coming from calling it a mature fragrance. There's something I find rejuvenating about it though. Your grandfather wore the original Colonia; you wear Colonia Intensa.",06/12/23 10:58,Girolamo
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"The opening is very barbershop-ish, almost too mature for me, but then it starts to develop into a more fresh, rich, woody-citrusy fragrance. A date night fragrance, but office safe. For the price you can find it at a discounter, a steal. Also the longevity is far better than other ADP's.",06/08/23 04:09,es_paradis
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I got this after trying Mickey Lee Soapworks Colonia Di Agrumi shave soap which is supposed to be cloned from this scent profile. But when I got the cologne I realized although similar it’s very different. The soap smells more like the opener of this scent only. Once the cologne hits the drydown it gets a little brash for me. Something in the mids makes me nauseous.. maybe the neroli idk ..
But all in all I do like the scent. I just wish I could buy a more simple version of this with just that opening. Maybe Pura or Essentia would be closer?! But I will keep this still because I can see myself liking it more and more as I get older. It’s very mature even for me and I like mature scents. I’m 32. I rate this for now as a 6.5/10. I will edit as it e goes on. Stay blessed guys. Much love.",06/04/23 19:52,CoachSignature88
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"No question this is quality stuff from my all-time favorite house of Acqua di Parma. But it is quite dry/sour in the base. There's no real sweetness or levity to the composition once the top notes dissipate. That's probably what makes it feel dated to some.

I used to really enjoy wearing this in Boston in the humid afternoons of late summer and early fall. But now, out here in the Las Vegas desert, I just can't pull it off. Instead, I find myself reaching for ""wetter"" alternatives such as Creed Viking or even Colonia Futura.

Update 02/10/24: Took my bottle on a recent trip to the Dominican Republic, and I can confirm that Intensa performs much better in a humid environment. Some moisture in the air brings out a smooth earthiness that's lacking when worn in a dry climate.",05/31/23 06:03,RandolphCanuck

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"It's interesting when I first got it the Neroli citrus combo just didn't sit with me. I really liked the scent, but didn't identify with it.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"It was not love at first sniff, but Intensa has worked its magic on me over time and I really enjoy this fragrance now. Even though I probably like the smell of Essenza slightly more, Intensa is much more versitile which is why I use it more often than Essenza.

Intensa opens with a woody citrus blast but after a short while I can hardly smell any citrus and what I get for most of the duration is a dry spicy wood with some dark patchouli underneath. The scent is farily linear and has an impressive performance on my skin.

I think this fragrance is a bit too thick to be used in the summer heat. I enjoy it more during early autumn and as an evening scent. I have used it with success on dates and even got a compliment from a guy in a bar when I used it. Very masculine and mature scent without being old fashioned.",04/29/23 06:18,Grensfall
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Some time ago, I received a sample of Mirto de Panarea from the Blu Mediterraneo line, which drew my attention to Acqua di Parma perfumes. Looking hard, you can find it for a very reasonable price (especially testers). I bought a bottle of Mirto de Panarea and I was so enchanted, and heard so many good things about the brand's other perfumes, that I decided to blind buy this one, Colonia Intensa. For the notes and reviews, youtube videos, etc. I didn't seem to have much error. I was then imagining the naturalness I felt in the only perfume I had known from them so far, in the structure of a modernized and smoky cologne.

Well... when the perfume arrived, already in the spray bottle I realized that I had already smelled that smell. I sprayed it on my skin and it felt a little different but still familiar. I noticed that it reminded me a lot in the drydown, another perfume I had that was fresh with a smoky touch: Acqua di Giò Profumo. It looked like a very diluted Profumo. This perfume is officially an EDC but in practice, it has the performance of a medium EDT (3 to 4 hours). It is quite close to the skin. Despite not being listed, I can smell the lavender note, which made me solve the riddle of the scent I smelled in the spray bottle: Believe it or not, it reminded me of Seiva de Alfazema, an old and cheap lavender cologne from Brazil. It is not identical to any of the mentioned perfumes, but for me, among the perfumes I know, it is the memory it brings. It doesn't have a bright citrus and is quite spicy too.

Although not a bad scent, I honestly didn't like it. I think that between it and Mirto de Panarea, there are miles in terms of perceived quality. Listen, perceived quality, because I know that it must have a lot of quality in the raw materials, but that's not what the final smell gives me. I think there is an exaggeration of those who report 7 or 8 hours of fixation. I was quite disappointed, because, despite liking AdG Profumo, it's a perfume that I've used a lot and had its time for me, I don't miss it and I would have zero desire to wear a perfume that looks like a watered down version of it (yes, I know that this one was released before Profumo, so I'd say AdG was an improved version of that). It really has a mature perfume vibe, but when I want that vibe, I prefer to use Terre d'Hermes, which I like better and performs much better.

I didn't do the proper homework before buying (meaning, test before) because unfortunately, in Brazil, we don't have the same access to perfumes of this type, with the inviting prices that we find out in Europe or the US. If I was to find a decant, order it and wait for it to arrive, this perfume would probably have already been sold and who knows when (or if) it would be available again.

Finally, in my opinion, neither this nor this nor Mirto de Panarea (which I loved) are worth the full price charged in Brazil (in 2023, more than US$200 per 100ml). At that price, I think it's better to buy 2 or 3 designer fragrances of similar proposals. And I don't recommend doing what I did: buying without testing (and from now on, I'll try to follow my own recommendation).",04/11/23 09:19,Vetiveril
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,It's a bit synthetic once the citruses are gone.,04/10/23 11:39,Guest2563
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This is in the same ballpark as Dior Eau Sauvage EDT. It's less classy and with less performance. Half of the notes are just for support. My nose which is not really trained to identify notes can only smell citruses, cardamom, musk, patchouli. I find not leather, ginger etc. Having said that. It's still a far better, classier fragrance than most of the modern summer fragrances. I can name at least 20 fragrances that are selling like crazy that I would not buy against AdP Colonia Intensa. Do I love it? No, not as much as Dior Eau Sauvage but this will make you smell different for sure. I see a lot of people saying that it should not be worn by young men. Not true, I don't smell this dated, it's more like classy & timeless. This is a great buy if you get it around $60-$65 which is what I paid for a 100ml tester.",04/04/23 01:07,Vlad Gorneanu

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Great scent. I bought a bottle for my collection. The Ginger, Myrrh and Neroli blend just keeps me coming back to it more than the orginal. This is a mature scent more depth and spice to the original fresh colonia.",03/19/23 18:21,clintjr82
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I don’t really understand many of the reviews here. On me this is an outright gorgeous warm musky incense from start to finish. It starts out a little lighter and airy - but still incensed - then as it progresses the base comes up a bit more and the musky incense gets a bit deeper, slightly darker but not too heavy. I don’t really get any citrus, ginger or even what I normally perceive as cardamom. I don’t detect much of the mid notes either except for the slightly lighter feel the incensed effect generates. It’s mostly about the base notes but even then not in the balance popularity shows. Overall I find it very musky in fact. Absolutely stunning scent that I genuinely can’t understand why anybody would box this into an older age bracket, or any age bracket for that matter! Certainly on my skin this feels throughly modern and entirely ageless, very versatile and also completely unisex. Maybe it’s just my skin chemistry? I think maybe so because I only see one other person in the reviews having a similar incensed skin response. It almost reminds me of ‘smokers’ which is a kind of musky slightly warm lightly cinnamon like candy we have in my country.
I feel a bit weird for reviewing it like this for the fact that I can’t see any obviously similar reviews, and I know my juice is the real deal because it’s a proper Acqua di Parma mini I got in a properly boxed and branded 3 piece set from a thoroughly reputable perfume store. I guess the one thing that does stand out is how very differently this scent seems to respond on different peoples skins, so that may account for something. But either way I’ll be getting my hands on a full 6oz as soon as humanly possible! Awesome top shelf juice!",03/15/23 23:28,RileyB
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"On my skin, the opening is all cardamom and virtually no citrus. It then slowly grows in to this intensely bitter aroma that I can almost taste as I smell it. The dry down is harsh a cedar. Traces of leather are there but insufficient to mellow out the acrid feeling. Still looking for the benzoin, and musk comes out a little bit only if I rinse it off. All around leafy green/woody bitter aroma on me.

On paper, this is a not unpleasant, if only quite an «old man», scent. But, although I’m pushing 40, I’m no grandpa yet so it’s a big disappointment for me. If it agrees with your skin chemistry, this could possibly be a good cologne. Although it reacts badly on my skin, the different notes on paper are very natural, organic smelling to me.

Get a good sampler and try it multiple times to see if it fits. I would definitely not recommend this as a blind buy!",03/14/23 15:49,Ben Armband
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,At the age of 43 I feel way too young for this. It may work for me 27 years later. I'll wait.... this should be called Toxic Masculinity Extrait,03/13/23 04:30,JuloK
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"At the time of my last ""review"" of this, I think that my sentiments was that this was a very good, but not great cologne style fragrance that came across as slightly dated, and while I do still think this is an old school fragrance that you could easily wear in a different time, I appreciate it so much more and actually my younger female co-workers have complimented me when I've worn this more than any other fragrance I've worn with the exception of Dior Sauvage Elixir, probably because that one projects like such a monster. However, in order to not get sidetracked, I just have to say that this is a GORGEOUS scent and I've always thought that, but it's grown on me a lot. This can be worn in almost any situation, I feel like it only really fits if you're wearing a nice shirt like a polo, a button-down shirt, something like that because I feel like this would be a little odd coming from a guy wearing a band t-shirt or something along those lines. Not to be judgy, but I think that fragrances should fit what you're wearing and this one fits a slightly dressier but still perfectly casual look. I think this could also work formally, but it's perfect for business casual style I think. It also has that extra oomph to cut through the cold that other Acqua Di Parma fragrances don't often have, it has this resinous and slightly darker edge to it in the base while still being bright off the top and airy in a way that's suitable for the summer. Performs well for an EDC, it lasts for 6-7 hours and it pushes pretty decent in the beginning, people around you especially in a closed space will notice you when you wear this and I've gotten compliments.

I don't think kids would like this fragrance, this is for 30 and up in my view, and a lot of 30 year olds might not be into stuff like this even. This is a little bit more advanced than your typical designer fragrances, I feel like Acqua di Parma is actually an ideal transitioning phase between designers and getting into indie and niche because they're somewhere in between the two, and quality and sophistication that you get from their fragrances are slightly better than most designers. This is my favorite of the ones I've smelled so far, although I've yet to try the Assoluta and Club versions which I think I would like a lot. This is near perfection for me, and probably the best EDC in my collection so far, I hope to find the Assoluta version at a decent price, and also add the Essenza and Club versions soon.",03/06/23 17:42,Marcjohn86
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This is such a fantastic fragrance, probably the best of the colonia line. The name is right on point, it's like a more intense version of the original. The smell is similar, but punchier and less airy.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I definitely sense the DNA of the original, I think mostly because of the type of citrus used, but this one has its own profile for sure. I really like it! You can hardly beat the OG; however, this one is correctly named in my opinion. I don’t mean that it’s just a stronger version, I just mean the added notes are more intense while still getting a subtle background of the original.

Like others have said, the dry-down is great, although I do like the opening as well. It has a good progression of note changes. It’s darker and spicier, and does have that leather element that’s perfect with the other notes. It’s less fresh and sparkling, even with the citrus, but that is a good thing for what this is.

Nice projection for a couple hours on me. Performance is mid-moderate for me, similar to the OG. I feel it’s safe to overspray this one a bit. I would say this is good for any season, but wouldn’t be surprised if better with heat, which I’ll eventually find out for certain.",11/22/22 21:47,jbuzzz

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Wow. BY FAR my favorite ADP fragrance I've tried yet, and most of them are solid options (Club and Essenza in particular are great). This is gorgeous, masculine, inoffensive, a bit barbershop. Bright citrusy, but also deep and warm/spicy. I've found it hard to find a summer heat fragrance that James Bond would wear, but for sure this is it. This is gray blazer while driving around Italy in an old convertible. It might not be the absolute best choice for sweaty summer days, but this is like a soapy clean citrusy smell with tons of suave and introverted character. Strongly reminds me of Dior Eau Sauvage Parfum in terms of masculine character, but without that tart elemi/citron combo that is unbearable in heat. Replace the elemi and citron with neroli and spicy lemon/bergamot, so it comes across as less ""scented shaving foam clean (barbershop)"" and more ""clean shaven and soapy in summer heat"". Very versatile. Signature worthy. Doesn't last very long though. Highly recommend.",07/03/22 17:06,discardedandroid
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I think Colonia Intensa is a masterpiece. A very classy masculine 24/7/365 signature worthy scent, unique in a world of citrus freshies. How did Morillas and Demarchy succeed with making a citrus freshie that ends so fluently with leather and benzoin? You go to a garden party wearing a lovely citrus, and when the day turns to night, you're already wearing an evening scent. Two scents in one.

That ginger is fantastic. The leather note has the same lovely bitterness as Bottega Veneta Pour Homme, but I like Intensa better.

If it's a masterpiece, why not rate it a Love? For me it's the myrtle. It works well, adds a unique, white fresh chalky floral to the mid, but I'm just not a fan of myrtle.

Dries down to a classic gentlemanly vibe of neroli, leather and woods. Extremely pleasant DNA suitable for all occasions…although younger crowd might not consider it a “fun” fragrance.

Longevity and projection are average. It goes on super wet…so you kind of know it’s not going to last that long. One can certainly pull this off year round by varying the sprays. In the line…I actually think this is more suitable to colder days…allowing the cardamom and leather to warm you up a bit.

After about 15-20 minutes, the leather, cedar and patchouli just take this fragrance to another level, giving it a masculine sophistication that is atypical of normal summer citruses.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,Super Solid if you like classic male fragrances. Opening is my favorite. Dry down is less interesting. I’m happy I have a bottle. Anytime anywhere fragrance 37+ IMO,04/22/22 19:39,Bow collector
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"One might imagine an Italian gentlemen, mature but aging gracefully, his Negroni on the table in front of him on a table at an outdoor bar. His crisp white shirt shows not a single wrinkle, and a dark blue sweater is wrapped around his neck by its sleeves. He is contemplative; he is lost in his thoughts when the beautiful young waitress asks if he would like another drink. He finally looks up and smiles as he answers in the affirmative.

The bright opening of the citruses draw one in, but there is so much more than just the cheery opening. The myrtle, artemisia, neroli, cedar and Guaiac wood make this more complex than just any scent drifting across the promenade on a warm day. The leather is there, but it is not prominent. It a hint of leather, a strap wrapped around his wrist.

This scent could stay with you through the evening. When night falls, this man will have had yet another drink with the beautiful companion that will ultimately join him. She pauses as she puts her second kiss beside his cheek as he greets her. She inhales and wishes she could know this scent forever. But by morning, it will be only a faint remembrance of the night before.

I really love this scent. This is a scent for a well-made drink in a beautiful place.",04/18/22 17:46,Russell August
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This is a nice cologne, but it's pretty old school i.e. in the style of classic Italian style EDCs.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"The brands description of this is truly accurate. ""Colonia Intensa is masculine, intensive, noble and classical."" Absolutely stunning fragrance. I haven't come across anything like this one. I own Colonia, Colonia Club and Colonia Pura. This one is not like any of the others.
Intensa comes across very expensive and rich. This is clean, charming, self assured, masculinity at its finest. Expertly blended. This conveys sophistication and someone in complete control of his mind. It also has a welcoming and calming vibe perfect for short encounters where you want to exude brilliance and confidence.
The longevity is poor, but the 1-2 hrs you receive are worth your money. I think given it's quality the performance can be forgiven, but not entirely.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I found the opening was a bit coarse, but it settled down to something more mellow and warm within minutes. I would have to describe this as a ""traditional old man's fragrance."" Although I enjoy the smell, I find it to be uninteresting. I prefer something a bit more challenging and creative. The dry-down is clean and soapy, which I do enjoy. When it comes to clean and soapy fragrances, however, I tend to prefer the greener varieties, such as Mugler Cologne.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,I'm not someone who gets a kick out of criticising fragrances for the sake of it on here. But having blind bought a 50ml bottle I must say the performance of this fragrance is very substandard. Not what you would expect from something claiming to be 'intensa'. Next to no projection or longevity from 6 sprays. Will have to double that to 12 to get anything out of it. Definitely try before you buy.,10/30/21 18:18,Connors

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This one is so frustrating because it smells amazing. Almost a modernised version of the original colonia with some subtle smoky, leather elements to it.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This is a nice soapy smell which doesn’t smell dated, it is fairly light, projection and longevity wise! This smells like Lalique L'Insoumis’ dry down, which is like half of the price of Intensa (off discounters) and around 1/4th the market price!
Slightly disappointed not gonna lie! But it smells good and it made me appreciate L'insoumis more than I did before (silver lining)

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Subtle and nuanced warm weather fragrance. Opens with a foamy lemon and warm cardamom. Not much projection, but it leaves a pleasant scent of sweet woods and neroli on my skin.",08/14/21 19:31,paulnewman
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Time for another Italian fragrance. Opens up with a cozy accord of Swedish mulled wine a k a glögg. It's probably the cardamom and bergamot. It's really pleasant but who cares about top notes? They're gone in minutes. Call me boring and uncultured but I'm just being pragmatic here, ok?

Ok. So, I get soapy tanginess with a faint hint of bitterness from the wormwood. Mostly soap though. Later on there's some musk but I don't feel the promised patchouli. The leather is what Colonia Intensa is all about in the end though. A great, mature and perhaps woody leather.

This is a complex fragrance with a lot of subtetly. You can tell the duo of perfumers know what they're doing. It's also an EdC so it's sadly subtle in itself. Once the leather develops it's limited to my skin. But what a nice leather!

Anyway, this is a businesslike and sophisticated fragrance without strictness and rigidity. Maturity without machismo. I'm just a measly warehouse worker and this isn't the forklift-operating scent for me. But it sure is a nice one. And that could be the problem; it's nice but not much more.

Birger Karlsson the middle sized middle manager on a middle sized IT company in a middle sized city sprays Colonia Intensa on his neck and what's left of his hair. He pops a couple of prescription opiates to deal with his old hockey injury. Entering his surprisingly large Volvo he curses his PE teacher for recommending sports as an investment in long-term health. Birger puts some live recordings of Pink Floyd on the stereo (despite working with IT he has no idea how to use streaming services) and reminisces about when he was young, had a full head of hair, a budding hockey career, a shy redhead girlfriend, and a ticket to his favorite band. A ticket to grand things. An exciting future. But at least he smells nice on his way from the suburb this dreary Monday morning.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Clean, creamy, citrus scent. Smells like a bath soap. Inoffensive, and very casual. I did not even know that there’s a leather accord in this until I read it here in Fragrantica. All I can smell is the floral citrus. A more natural version of Kenneth Cole Reaction. Has the same poor longevity and weak sillage as well.

No projection even right after spraying. You would have to bury your nose where you spray it in order to catch a whiff of it. And I was very generous with the spray. I would recommend getting the Colonia Essenza instead. That one smells similar, but stays on for far longer and has decent projection. This is not a scent that you’d want to wear if you want to catch attention. This is for more intimate settings where people are standing close enough to smell.

Blind-bought a full bottle and regretting it. I am not happy with this one.",07/09/21 07:26,manila_nose
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"A very spicy and citrusy perfume with notes of leather, ginger, and wood. It starts off strong but quickly tone down. At first, I didn’t like it much, but after an hour I warmed up to it. This is a very masculine scent that is perfect for any occasions: Business meetings, dates, hanging around the house, etc. Perfect for any warm (not hot) days and nights.

The longevity is not that great, lasting about four hours before being barely noticeable. The sillage is pretty good though. 15 minutes after I put it on, I walked by my partner and they instantly were able to smell it. The price is pretty high: 175 USD for 100ml, which would be worth it in the longevity was longer.

Overall, this is a 7.5/10.",06/29/21 12:54,JessVanEgg
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I received this fragrance as a gift I never smelled it before but I have smelled the Colonia but I Did not like the Colonia, but I really liked this one because it had a more masculine scent to it. I really began to like the fragrance witch is unique because I don't really like the colognes because they are weaker than. other fragrances in terms of sillage and longitivtiy.

this fragrance is quite a superstar its just the Colonia but it can be good for spring and fall time but I wont really recommend it for the winter, it still is good in the winter time but the silage wont be as good in the summer. anyways this fragrance is fresh and has a bit of spice and its extremely versatile for any occasion and at any age can a man wear this fragrance. it smells exactly like a business man. I personally rate it a 8/10",06/14/21 12:10,mohammed771
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This is an interesting take on the original Acqua di Parma Colonia, but with a twist: Acqua di Parma Colonia Intensa adds leather, ginger and guaiac wood to a traditional citrus cologne, and thus makes it more mature, masculine and business like.

This is a very solid, good and reliable all rounder, suitable day and night, for formal and casual settings, all four seasons. A very versatile fragrance. Possibly the only citrus fragrance I've tried that is suitably for all four seasons.

But, at the same time, it lacks a soul, a heart and a character. It reminds me of a standardized, well equipped, luxurious, ultra modern hotel room that is well equipped with all possible amenities.
The problem is: It's not your home, and the hotel room has no character of its own. It's well built and efficient, but it isn't yours. It's a standardized venue and locale with no permanent dwellers.

That's how I feel about Acqua di Parma Colonia Intensa. Materialistic, efficient and well built for its purpose, but lacks a soul and a character.

The DNA and quality of Acqua di Parma are undeniably visible and present in Intensa. 

Final score: 7/10.",06/12/21 16:36,Peter The Fragrance Lover
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"This is quite a lot of things for a cologne: it starts off with the light citrus being very prominent, and then the woods taking over, but with the leather always there (but never heavy). I can spot artemisia a mile off, and I can sense its bitterness as a minor note in here: normally, I hate anything bitter, but this with the guaiac works to give a slight edginess to what might otherwise be too soft.

I can see why younger people in particular might like this, given its interesting combination of being definitely present and yet oddly light simultaneously. This would be a nice warm-weather and daytime scent.",05/28/21 13:07,Glyph
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"حين يجتمع إثنين من العطارين الأساطير في تاريخ العطور، حتماً النتيجة تكون في روعة هذا العطر، العطر يحمل طبع وDNA اكوا دي بارما، ولكن بلمسات مختلفة نوعاً ما، صحيح ان العطر من خط الكولونيا لكن اراه مختلف عن كونه كولونيا تقليدية، واذا اعتبرناه كولونيا فهو كولونيا بصورة فاخرة جداً..

حقيقة العطر تركيبته ورائحته شدتني من أول تجربة، وبعد عدة تجارب تأكدت انه يستحق أن يكون في مجموعتي، عطر جميل مختلف رجولي بامتياز، قد لا يعجب الكثيرين، أراه سيعجب من هم على حدود الـ ٣٠ فما فوق، الرجل الكلاسيكي سيحب هذا العطر، عطر يجمع الكلاسيكية والحداثة..

أداء العطر كعادة عطور اكوا دي بارما متوسط، ممكن ثبات ٤-٥ ساعات مو أكثر من كذا، والاحظ فوحانه اكثر خصوصاً مع شدة الحر، احس العطر حولي فعلاً واشم رائحته كل ما تحركت، وانا راضي تمام الرضا عن ادائه، لكن لا تتوقع اداء وحشي على كل حال..

بالمناسبة كلمة بسيطة، كل ما تتعمق في مجال العطور أكثر واكثر، تكتشف أن الثبات والأداء شيء مساعد، الأساس دائماً وأبداً رائحة العطر، اتفهم أن كل واحد منّا يتمنى عطره يثبت ساعات وساعات ولكن إسأل نفسك ليه نشتري عطور؟ الأساس دائماً لطيب الرائحة وجمالها، فمثلاً أنا شخصياً أفضّل عطر جميل جداً كرائحة ثباته ٣-٤ ساعات على عطر ثباته ١٠ ساعات ولكن رائحته عادية جداً، لست بحاجة لاضافة عطور عادية لمجموعتي..

يستحق التجربة والشراء ولكن لابد من التجربة أولاً، وأنبّه على نقطة، هذا العطر كلاسيكي وحديث في نفس الوقت، يحمل طبع العطور القديمة ولكن ما تحسه قديم، هل وصلت الفكرة؟ وبالتالي قد لا يعجب الكثيرين وقد لا يناسب البعض، التجربة ضرورية قبل الشراء..",05/24/21 22:52,DrDohm

A little spicier than the OG which I’m not sure on its own is enough of a reason for it to exist? Essenza and Club have more of a fresh, unique, and intriguing identity. As always with Acqua di Parma it’s a sophisticated and quality scent, but a solid like and not quite a love for me.",05/15/21 03:48,ElCaptain
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I've sampled several formulations of their Colonia. Each shares a common quality that says respectable. I love every one I've tried but it's like wearing a halo. I also wish they were less unisex. Less neutering. But still, I just love their work and keep ordering more samples.
This is the most masculine so far. It's possibly got more depth. It's kind of spicy in a manly way. Lasts longer on me than most of the others. If I was forced to choose only one ADP for life- I'd probably opt for this for it's versatility and relatively assertive quality. It would be a painful decision: So I'd tarnish my unwanted halo by smuggling in their Oud for winter. There're a lot of flankers I've still to try though.",05/06/21 17:57,Jim_Smith

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"A very nice twist on the original, that opens with citruses (like the original), followed by a prominent myrrh and a bit of neroli and benzoin, to finally drydown to a nice (but thin) artemisia/leather combo.
Despite being my favourite of this line, it's only a big like for me (that gives you an idea of my impression of the rest of this line) as it doesn't bring anything new, and his a bit 'thin bodied'. For a more full bodied take on the same theme, one might want to go towards Note di Colonia III, assuming one is ok for the ultra-vanillic myrrh drydown (instead of green leather), and also with the price.

This is not the typical peppery citrus AdP is known for that comes off as mature. This is a more rounded scent where the myrhh and leather gives it a masculine touch, but doesn't take anything away from it being a citrus scent, just that it tones down the citrus from being zesty. Like a mandarin citrusy and not lemon citrusy.
Best worn in spring/autumn. During summer it turns more musky.

Impossible to overspray too. This is one of those that's very soft on the nose and you won't offend anyone. Blended in a way that nothing jumps out trying to clash with the other accords. Overall just very pleasant and crowd pleasing. And yeah, definitely not mature like some people would say about the rest in the colonia line.",06/07/20 06:31,Skywarp

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"In my opinion the regular colonia is best when you're wearing linen clothing on a scorching hot summer day and you just want to smell fresh and sophisticated, like you're just out of the shower. This one on the other hand, is a lukewarm summer evening when you're going out to meet friends and the ground is still a bit warm.
The spices gives it a lot of depth and it's definitely not as soapy as the regular colonia; in fact, if I would've smelled this and the regular colonia blind, I probably wouldn't have even connected them.

Highly recommend everyone to smell this for an interesting spicy summer perfume instead of the citrus blasts that most people think of when they talk about summer perfumes.",04/29/20 09:03,Borzoi
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"A Strong like. But I do wonder why Myrrh is not ranked higher here as it is very dominating on my skin. This is a very well composed, very elegant, very bright and classy chypre. Starts off spicy, citrusy and a bit herbal - the Parma DNA is here again but then the leather comes in along with the myrrh adding a layer of depth and sophistication to the entire thing. It becomes a bit smoky due to the Myrrh. Eau de Sauvage Parfum came to mind at first sniff, so there's similarities here somewhere. This might even be better than the latest Dior formulation - which in my opinion is quite disastrous. Anyhow, I applaud Mr Morillas for this delicate offering. Quite excellent with a solid price tag.",04/19/20 19:20,alanwake
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Bought this fragrance by mere chance. I was actually looking out for a summer fragrance and after several testings I saw the Acqua di Parma booth. I hesitated to try since I know they are expensive, but gave it a try and ended up picking this one.

I love it! Some will find this one to barbershop like, but that's its very appeal.

Sun dried citrus, Italian herbs, patchouli, musk and leather will envelop you rapidly and for a long time, so don't over spray. This is a perfect all around office fragrance that will set you as a classy, clean, manly man.

Beau de jour is for me the closest to what this smells like with the additional heavy creamy leather and aromatic herbs instead of flowers.

Make sure to get it at discount prices tough, it's like 80 some on fragancenet or less.

What makes this different is that it gets rid of the soapy clean, neroli, fabric softener vibe, and adds ginger and cardamon instead. It's warmer and softer than most citruses and doesn't have such a cold dry down. Unfortunately it's very light because it's only an eau de cologne.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"The original Colonia is just to weak for my taste.
So I have the Intensa, Essensa and Assoluta EDT and Deo sprays.

Unlike the Original, the Assoluta and even the Essenza, this one is not a Summer's day citrusy freshy. It is woodier and smokier than the other Colonias. More mature and classy.
I prefer this one for the evenings although it can be used in day time if in Spring or even Fall.
Out of the 3 this also has the best projection and Sillage. It last about as long as the Essenza,(5-6 hours) which has been my favourite from the line from day one. However the Intensa is a more introvert beauty. Sophisticated. And therefore, slowly but gradually, gaining my love more and more.
Having Intensa, Essensa and Assoluta for over 2 years, All gift sets and additional Deo Sprays, this is how I see them:

Assoluta is the Summer beach day time favourite.
Essenza, for overall Summer application, day and night.
Intensa, the more formal evening dress code mysterious companion.
They really suit different purposes. They will stay in my collection forever.

I just found a few great gift sets offerings. Problem is my 100 ML bottles are still for 60% full.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Intensa is a masculine aromatic. This fragrance does away with the original Colonia DNA entirely, and replaces it with ensemble of woody-spicy masculine aromatics that would pass even the strictest Italian standards.

The opening spray is fresh—but very dry and slightly bitter. It can be invigorating, or it can catch you off guard, but I think the bite adds a great artistic flare to the masculine nature of the fragrance.

The fragrance then develops with a rush of complex masculine aromatics. The woody and spicy elements are fiery and abrasive! They create a very strict presence together. An accord of botanicals beneath this reinforces the fragrance's bitterness—further grounding its masculine composure.

And among the complex are exotic accents (such as green coffee)—which has a bold, pungent, yet invigorating aroma to it. It compliments the wood and spices perfectly, and greatly accentuates the masculinity and sophistication of the fragrance.

For all its qualities, Intensa is easily my favorite Colonia in the flagship line. Since my very first impression of it however, I've always said that it is also easily too masculine even for some men. The accents are very strong and stingy—and could be hard to take-in for anyone overly-sensitive to them. 

Intensa is a real man's fragrance—but for such a man—extremely versatile. Many might argue that it's more formal, but I could literally wear this anytime, to anywhere. It has formal grounding, but is just as equally stylish and sporty.

Everything I wished the original Colonia would be—and overjoyed for the dignity of the brand that it found its way into representing the honor of Acqua di Parma.",11/07/19 19:39,ReapThaWhirlwind
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"My hands-down favourite from the AdP Colonia line: a beautiful, true modern cologne but very frustratingly, has woeful longevity & projection. Whilst the original Colonia has fairly decent longevity, this just falls well below par and when I wear it, I always expect more than it has to give, which drives me to despair!

From some of the listed notes - cardamom, myrrh, leather, ginger, patchouli ..... you’d expect something more in terms of staying power but it just doesn’t have the chops; not on me anyway, with it becoming a skin scent in under an hour. As has been mentioned in earlier reviews, it definitely has the intonations of earlier classics, like Armani Eau pour Homme, Eau Sauvage and even YSL Pour Homme but at least those earlier classics had a decent slug of Oakmoss to prop them up a few rounds, whereas this....... well....!!
Despite this being green, citrus and slightly white floral, which screams summer freshie, I find this actually performs better in mild spring & autumn months because full on heat just seems to kill it stone dead. I’m reminded of Zegna’s Acqua Di Bergamotto actually: a beautiful modern citrus cologne that has zero longevity too.

I’m coming towards the end of my 100ml now and I’m really on the fence as to whether I buy another bottle or not. One minute I think ....”why bother, it doesn’t perform “ and the next minute, I’m thinking...”you can’t do without it, it’s lovely.” Very, very frustrating!! It’s definitely unisex without a shadow of a doubt, much more so than the Assoluta flanker and smells beautiful on a woman!

Much more delicate than my second favourite; AdP Colonia Essenza but I just wished it performed as well in the summer months. I’d recommend trying a sample or two first, rather than blind-buying this one, not for the fragrance because there really isn’t much not to like but just so you can test the performance on your skin type. If you find you get over 3+ hours then just buy it & you won’t be disappointed!",08/14/19 23:49,Jay67

Seems slightly odd to me, especially when whatever these 'flankers' share in DNA with the original Colonia, they share it in complex and manifestly different ways.

Don't get me wrong, the original Colonia is a lovely fragrance; I have a bottle as a summer staple, especially if I am spending the summer months somewhere hot. But it's not so wonderful that it deserves to be left alone ad infinitum, with no tweaks to its make up.",03/24/19 10:02,pəˈCHo͞olē
Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"A more complex citrus than I'm used to, yet still very familiar in its approach, the difference being, the resins, the ginger, the cardamom, and the leather. The resins remind me of something Andrier of Prada might do, Prada Infusion d'Homme, specifically.

Don't have much to say about this one, but it's a welcome addition for the Summer and competes for air time against Arancia di Capri of the same house, TF's Mandarino di Amalfi, EZ's Acqua di Bergamotto, and Bright Neroli. None are quite as complex as Colonia Intensa, but it's hardly the pinnacle of citrus, as one can imagine more exquisite, better performing scents, easily.

Upon fifteen to twenty minutes of spraying, was not getting the intensity I wanted, sprayed again and I can say the sillage is already not perfectly promising, unless I'm experiencing olfactory fatigue already. Fret not, however, the price, I believe, is accessible, and going harder on the trigger should offset this somewhat glaring issue.

From the second hour onwards the ginger remains over a 'green woody' fragrance that holds up well in winter but as for projection, Colonia Intensa retreats to a skin scent within a few hours although it remains as a very present skin scent even 8 hours later... in the same room Colonia Assoluta will dominate in terms of projection and sillage.

The Italian family living there serves you some bruschetta and antipasti with red wine from their own cellar, which was built 250 years ago. The best crafted food you'll ever have.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"I have the Tonico Dopobarba, but I've tried the Colonia on perhaps three times as well.

Firstly, the Tonico has considerably less citrus in the opening, almost none. It more smells like a Martini Bianco mixed with a barber's tonic of sorts. The Colonia has the usual very nice citrus blast, and settling towards a similar drydown with it's barber brother. (If you're interested how much the Tonico lasts it's every time 4h and maybe on the collar another 4) TD has ever so slightly oily consistency, so probably has some quality oils there. And Myrtle water, nice. The tonico is the most elegant aftershave I've ever used. Read: maybe not the best or most masculine smelling, but a more elegant one is hard to find.

A cocktail comparison with another Colonia of similar qualities: Alvaréz Goméz Agua de Colonia Concentrada Barberia.
Ginger is at the top, opening the scent with a Campari-like bitter orange, and that opening very much reminded me of Acqua di Parma's Colonia Intensa - at first. So that one is Campari & Soda with orange slice to AdP Intensa's Martini Bianco & Lemon slice (that would be because of the Artemisia found in both AdP and Vermouth). This reminiscence and analogy comes to mind only in their respective openings, their hearts take a different path.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"So I just recently re-acquired Colonia Intensa after selling it off a year or so ago. Maybe I was at another stage in my fragrance journey at that point, but when I recently testing it out again, I was impressed enough to get it back in my collection.

What I get out of this from the top is a blast a citruses with some subtle spiciness, I don't get any neroli in this even though it's listed as one of the notes. The top does not last long and it pretty much morphs into the base rather quickly. After maybe 30 min or so, I get a pretty linear ginger/cedar/leather base that hums along until the end, in my case around 8 hours or so, although it's pretty much a skin scent at that point.

This one is kind of better than ""Essenza di Colonia"", it has that cardamom twist and ginger sting that made the whole juice differs from being original cologne.

It remains the citrus, Russian leather kind of fragrance but i think it's kind of upgraded a bit as the myrrh and artemisia changes the blend direction on the drydown beside the musk and the patchouli.

It reminds me of one of my cousins fragrance as he is the kind of an unsecured guy, don't care about a fragrance unless it's like other fragrance and people won't talk but ok to compliment.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"Typical eau de toilette very classic Italian, very good composition, complex and made with high quality half-court.

It could be a skin scent or fragrance of intimate character (point against for many) since after the first initial burst of citrus dismally low projection and is pegadita to skin.

The combination of citrus ginger and cardamom matifican citrus and neroli brings a rainbow full of light and joy (my favorite part), part of which unfortunately it does not last long.

Drying wood and balms is complex and well measured, anticipating a soft white musk drying, lightweight, which makes hold a couple of hours and then reapplied again (point against).
The fragrance has a certain quality, citrus scent that remains for most of the evolution of the fragrance and if you like this kind of intimate, classic and fresh Italian flavors then you'll love this.

Calling himself ""Intense"" I personally find somewhat lacking in projection and duration for the quality we are trying and especially paying.

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"An interesting take on the house theme, this is a bigger departure from the classic EdC structure that you see in something like Essenza. House purists knock it for this reason, but I love the darker facets introduced by the leather, patchouli. Im also a sucker for sharp aromatics, so cardamom and cedar are always a win for me.

The opening is the straightforward citrus-woody fare you would expect from any competent gentlemans fragrance. The citrus and neroli components of the EdC style are here, but the neroli is not amped to the buttery, near white-floral pitch you get in some hard core EdCs (especially the ones formulated strong enough to last 8+ hours). Instead, the neroli melts into the green, herbaceous structure of the cardamom, cedar, and artemesia. Ginger is not particularly prominent to my nose, perhaps being lost in the myrrh and benzoin resins. This is a citrus-woody-leather, in that order.

The leather here is a soft, brown note (not like the hard black leather of the AdP Leather flanker). It wraps around the patchouli and myrrh. To be honest, I might not have placed it by name without reading the pyramid, but I am used to strong, forward-leaning leathers, and that doesnt meant that it is a weak note in this fragrance. I would say it is in the middle, under the citrus, cardamom, and cedar, but above the ginger and resins.

Closer to the drydown the fragrance becomes softer and a bit powdery; here the benzoin, musk, and myrrh come out to play. It is not a strong shift towards the oriental ingredients; rather, a gradual coziness that comes on as the composition comes to rest.

Overall this is a top-shelf choice for a year round signature with performance: 8-10 hours with four sprays. Perhaps not the most unique, but it smells quality, stands out from your average designer detergent fare, and can be worn year round and in all situations.",06/09/16 19:17,DerangedGoose

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"وقتی اسم آکوا دی پارما رو میشونیم معمولا یاد عطرهای خنک اش میافتیم . واقعا آکوا دی پارما تبحر خاصی در این زمینه داره بگذریم که چند تا کار گرم هم تولید کرده و به حق اون ها هم عالی بودند .

شما زمانی که سراغ تست کردن عطرای این برند خوش نام میرید 3 تا فاکتور اساسی رو در کاراش مشاهده و احساس میکنید : کیفیت و آمبولاژ بسیار تر و تمیز شیشه
دوم کیفیت بسیار خوب عطراش و نهایتا ترکیب شدن خارق العاده نُت های به کار رفته در عطراش
یکی از مشکلات عجیبی که در بسته بندی عطرای این برند میشه متوجه شد که واقعا رو اعصابم هست، برچسب اصلی عطر هست که روی شیشه نصب میشه و اکثرا هم بی سلیقه چسبیده میشه که معمولا هم حباب توش هست و برچسب عطر از یه طرف پُف میکنه

به هر حال زمانی که شروع کنید به تست کردن عطر، جز 30 ثانیه اول که رایحه ای ترش، تلخ و شادابی رو تجربه خواهید کرد که دهنتون آب میوفته، دیگه نمیتونید در طول عمر عطر این حالت رو حس کنید .

خیلی زود روایح اسپایسی و کمی چوبی به عطر اضافه میشه که عطر رو کاملا تحت الشعاع خودشون قرار میدند و شما یه مدتی رو مهمان این آکورد جذاب در کنار مرکباتی که با خودتون اوردید خواهید بود. یه حسی مثل اینکه شما دارید عطر رو به صورت ممتد و مستمر استشمام میکنید و رایحه شاداب لیمو رو حس میکنید ولی در آخر رایحه های چوبی و اسپایسی خاتمه دهنده این وضعیت میشند . یا اصطلاحا
drydown
عطر چوبی و اسپایسی هست .

رایحه چوبی و اسپایسی خیلی ملایم و بسیار خوب ترکیب شده
فکر نکنید دمای عطر رو بالا میبرند . نه این طور نیست
این عناصر عطر رو از حالت روزانه بودن در میارند و یه عطر نیمه رسمی و رسمی رو به شما هدیه میدند .


تا اینجا بوی آکورد های چوبی و اسپایسی به نُت های مرکباتی، میچربه

بعد از مدتی دوباره روایح مرکباتی یا بهتره بگم لیمو، جان دوباره ای میگیره
خیلی از تندی اولیه عطر کاسته میشه
نُت های چوبی و اسپایسی کم رنگ تر میشند و شما یه رایحه ترش و تلخ مرکباتی رو حس خواهید کرد که بر خلاف شروع عطر، اینبار حالتی خشک داره

در ادامه، نُت های مرکباتی هم ضعیف میشند و شما یه آکورد قر و قاطی ضعیف شده از تمام عناصر سازنده عطر رو خواهید داشت که رایحه اش بسیار همه پسند و خوشبو هست .


در کل وقتی عطری بسیار شاداب، ترش وتلخ و آبدار مد نظرتونه، پیشنهاد من، بی تردید سری مدیترانه این برند عطرسازی هست ولی وقتی یه عطر کم تر تکراری، کمپلکس، رسمی و خنک و تلخ میخواهید، این عطر جزو گزینه هایی هست که میره به لیست تست های آینده شما

کیفیت عطر = 8.5
طراحی شیشه= درسته زیباست، ولی به زیبایی سری های مدیترانه و کولونیا نمیرسه پس 7 بهش میدم
رایحه = 8
پخش بو = متوسط شاید تا 1 متر
ماندگاری = رضایت بخش. حدودا بالای 6 ساعت دوام داره رو پوست من
ارزش خرید = 8

Colonia Intensa Acqua di Parma,"A strikingly modern, enhanced rendition of the classic Colonia. On my first test, after a bitter citrusy opening, the scent was dominated by artemisia. Actually, I barely noticed other notes. Now I wear this juice regularly (once a week), just enough to learn it quite well. It's pleasantly dry, rich (plenty of wood, herbs and neroli) and invigorating. Makes you feel fresh and energetic all day long. Longevity and sillage are moderate. After 5 hours, it turns into a skin scent - still noticeable to you only, woody and bitter.
Better try before you buy - I like it a lot, but for many of us it can be a love-or-hate story ;)",05/30/16 07:13,eliweisz

I have to admit that I didn't like Colonia the first couple times i tried it, I felt it had an ""old man"" smell. I'm glad I stuck with it though because I love it, very summery. Although it doesn't last long as everyone else says, which brings me to trying Intensa.

Right out the gate its not Colonia, although it has some similarities. The dry down isn't anything like it, maybe it's just me but it completely reminds me of Polo blue. Glad I just tried a sample because it's not for me.",02/12/16 13:36,RedvsBlue2009

Mirto Di Panarea Forte Special Edition Eau De Toilette Acqua di Parma,"My first experience with Aqua di Parma was a successful one. Was in the mood for something refreshing so I knew this would be the perfect brand to go to!

I probably had sampled over the years some of their fragrances but nothing stood out to me until yesterday when I was recommended by the sales associate in store in Noto this limited edition of Mirto di Panarra! And we clicked instantly, both visually and olfactory.
The beautiful turquoise bottle with medium blue details plus the butterfly design definitely captured my attention and interest. So I decided to give it a couple of sprays on my wrist and it was instant love.

Mirto di Panarea pulls very citrusy sweet on me. It’s such a bright and happy scent, very natural smelling EDT like nothing else in my collection. I have some other green, citrusy, aquatic scents already but nothing quite like this. And it’s such a simple scent…Myrtle, basil, lemon, bergamot, some light flowers and herbs plus some woods.

It smells great but it doesn’t last long. The only thing that made me reluctant to get it right away. But going to the store again today and trying it again made me realise that maybe not all my fragrances need to last a long time. Mandarin Basilic is another similar scent to Mirto di Panarea that I really love despite being so fleeting.

So, I decided to make an exception to my usual rule and get Mirto di Panarea. It’s so refreshing and realistic smelling that I can’t pass it, especially that it’s a limited edition packaging. Which speaks to my soul!

The price is right but also a bit steep in the same time because of the poor performance! I bought this knowing that I will only use this in the high heat, when I don’t want a heavy fragrance anyway.",10/18/23 07:45,Maya lilac

The myrtle is there giving it a beach vibe. The final drydown is myrtle and mastic which gives you many hours of a clean, soapy, beach feeling. 🏖️

Luce di Rosa Acqua di Parma,"Nice rose fragrance with an interesting light woody base. Citruses and pepper (pink and black) are present with the signature ADP citruses fizzing from the top. Not a powerful rose scent, this is more fresh and light. Can be pulled off in high heat or cooler temperatures, so it's very functional. Should be fine for office use.

I don't think it's as beautiful as POAL, Rose De Jamal, or Kilian RO so if you're looking for the best of the best, give those a shot first. However, if you're a rose aficionado who wants to wear it in the heat of the summer, I'd say this is a fairly safe option, along with perhaps MFK's rose, which offers some versatility as well. Don't pay retail. This will be resold at bargain prices.

Luce di Rosa Acqua di Parma,"Testing Luce di Rosa from a 1.5 ml Aqua di Parma official sample.

This perfume is true to its name at least in longevity: it’s a soft spicy, citrusy, aromatic rose focused scent with a strong geranium presence all through its life. Almost equal parts of rose and geranium. It’s not necessarily the lightest, luminous rose forward fragrance on the market but it’s not the deepest/darker either.

Unlike some other niche brands creations centred around rose I have tried recently, Aqua di Parma took Luce di Rosa in a more complex, nuanced direction, made it less sweet, not powdery but still kept it light. This is not a heavy rose scent but has some depth and contrast. The woods from the base notes are prominent once the juice dries down. Also, it has decent performance. It’s still overpriced for what it is in my opinion and it’s not the one for me, but it’s a bit more interesting. Different than other 2025 rose focused perfumes.

Up to this day, I couldn’t find a better rose scent than Atomic Rose by Initio. Afternoon trying quite a few of newer releases, I need to acknowledge what a masterpiece of perfume Atomic Rose is!!

Undoubtedly a fragrance that embodies the brightness and freshness of the summer.",02/12/25 17:24,DariaFrancesca74
Luce di Rosa Acqua di Parma,"Quite sour, bright, and slightly spicy with a hint of wood. ADP’s website references Longoza Oil as a top note - not familiar with the scent of Longoza; however, I am naively keen to attribute the spiced carnation vibe of the scent to it. Very vibrant as a scent, almost grapefruit vibe similar to Pompelmo by L.O. (Perhaps the citrus with the Vetiver in the base?) - up close it makes me want to wince.

After being awestruck with Mandarino di Sicilia, this was quite a let down . Very thin in comparison, and, to me, not worth the price tag. Comparing to the other Signatures of the Sun line, I would say in a way most similar in vein to Magnolia Infinita and perhaps Osmanthus … pre-reformation.",12/07/24 20:47,beardy

Obviously when I say ""no one is asking for this,"" it's hyperbole. But it expresses the point, which you've chosen to be obtuse about, that hardly anyone is talking about these and they won't talk about this one.

ADP is my favorite house. I've tried almost every single one of their offerings. They've tried this floral direction for years and I've literally never seen any interest in the community. The florals are boring, conventional, and push no boundaries. My comment is a tiny attempt at pushing them to do something more creative because I want to see them succeed.

1) You comment in the ""review"" section without reviewing the fragrance
2) ""No one is asking for"" - Where is your market research showing this? How many fragrance houses release fragrances that ""people are asking for?""
3) The ADP brand is built nearly ENTIRELY on single-ingredient fragrances. Such a strange comment to make, you clearly dont understand their brand offerings.
4) The number of Noteworthy single ingredient fragrances by ADP is huge. Im not even going to list them here because they have more noteworthy ones that poor ones

Anyway, as for the fragrance....

It's a well executed citrus/rose. The rose is very ""clean"". I describe many oud/rose combos as having a dirty rose note (not in a bad way - just a descriptive term - maybe ""heavy"" is a better term) but this is a pure and clean rose. The ""clean"" element is probably helped by cedar and musk
The pepper and cardamom adds the spice on the top that stops it being a pure Floral. This means it may appeal to men more than the ""rose based fragrance"" description would imply.

To evaluate the quality of a perfume’s essence and its ingredients, we start by testing on neutral materials like paper. You don’t test on human skin for long periods because contrary to what you seem to do normal people shower once or twice a day. In that way you lost essence longevity.
You, however, sound like you live in a cave without running water, which is why you’re desperate for perfume to smother your stench. ps: if you won’t bathe, not even a $10,000 bottle will help.",10/05/25 05:21,Masteryoda

Gelsomino A Freddo Acqua di Parma,"I don't normally like this house at all. However, in my city, all of my favourite sales people and people who seem to know their stuff, work for ADP. There have been some fragrances that interested me but it's always the same story - I always hate the dry down. Amouage suffers the same way for me.

So the sales person made me a sample of this one and I've just put it on. Sometimes I think it's hard to judge a quality fragrance out of a plastic 2ml atomizer that has hit the air. On the first spray, it's a very light jasmine but there's enough underneath going on that it's not just jasmine and definitely holds the unisex line perfectly. It invokes a nice feeling and imagery, it's very nice so far.

It's not a huge performer but again, is that the fragrance, or is that the way we sample fragrances? In the store it seemed stronger. However, it's a nice bubble, not overpowering, you have to search for it but it's there.

The test now will be to see what happens in the dry down. If I end up liking it, it will be the first ADP in my collection. I'm kind of hoping I don't as man, ADP is crazy expensive. I'll edit later and update.

Edit: Well, I can't complain about the dry down, it's beautiful. However, it's extremely close to ""Oud Gardenia"" by Eric Buterbaugh - close enough for me that I don't need both. If you loved Oud Gardenia and are looking for something to replace it, since EB is discontinued, this is worth checking out.",09/26/25 08:47,RevAaron

It is so smooth and sweet with no perceptible indoles to my nose. Smells like a very natural flower with a gentle bubblegum faucet.

Gelsomino A Freddo Acqua di Parma,"The opening is a sweet citus with some spiciness as an undertone. The spiciness of the opening dissipates about 15 min in and some of the Iris and Black Tea notes starting to present themselves. The heart of the fragrance presents the white florals which become prominent and turns the fragrance quite sweet. At this point I still I get a powdery scent from the Iris. At full dry-down, the fragrance remains quite sweet which is more than likely coming from the Guiaic wood. The scent has a vanilla sweetness with an earthy undertone.

Performance on this fragrance is good as it projects quite well at the opening and is providing a good 5 to 6 hours of longevity. To me this is what I expect from a fresh fragrance.

This fragrance is quite addictive. I continued smelling my wrist throughout the day just to get a whiff of the scent.",08/21/25 04:48,GeoMar12

This actually has a similar ambergris accord, but perfected. It is definetely higher quality than cool water, dont worry lol. The rosy leather vibe is amazing also in this.

But dont wait, its going for about twice the price i paid a year ago. Imagine if acqua di gio profumo was made in the 80s....im kind of serious. It doesnt smell like kouros or polo green but it has this extreme classiness like most adp fragrances. I love this stuff straight up, but if marine and ambergris is something you avoid, act accordingly because this is both, more so the latter. I think even the latest prices are a steal for this fragrance considering how it performs (beastmode, legitimately) and the quality of the ingredients.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"Warning, scent lovers! This is amber, as in ambergris, not amber as in amber. This is NOT an 'amber-coloured' scent.

Thankfully I don't get much 'blue' in this, despite its 'marine' quality. I mean the blue that smells airy and maritime, and which dominated scents in the 90s/00s. I don't like those scents. So if you're into 'blue' scents, or 'freshies' as they're sometimes called here, then this is not the one for you. That said, this is remarkably fresh - but it's not that airy Issey Miyake or Cool Water type of thing.

It's fresh, animalic but not Kouros-y. It feels ""rooted, "" masculine, and honest, and I really like it. It's a straightforward, masculine scent, linear (not a criticism). Suits all occasions and seasons including work/car journeys, but going well beyond being just one more ""generic designer work scent.""

It's very distinctive and unique, without being 'wacky' or 'challenging.'

I like to think of scents in colours - I like amber scents. But this isn't an 'amber' scent like, say, Gucci Pour Homme original, or Lagerfeld Classic. It's not 'warm and spicy' as many amber scents are. It's fresh, dynamic and open, but yet very 'grounded' and 'tied to nature'. It's 'amber' because it's based on ambergris, not because it's amber coloured.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"Ambroxan Overdose (Francois Demachy, 2015)

Scentrack: The Chemical Brothers - Dissolve

As a part of Acqua di Parma Ingredient Collection Colonia Ambra is supposed to be dedicated to precious materials of amber or ambergris. Ambergris is very rare whale vomit, which under the influence of the sea and sun is transformed to the beautiful musky and salty odor. Of course, there is not enough of real ambergris to meet the demand of the perfume industry, and the synthetic molecules are used instead. Although it is marketed as the celebration of the most precious and luxurious ingredient, Colonia Ambra is an ode to Ambroxan, a synthetic ambergris molecule. All I can sense on my skin is strong synthetic musky, salty and fresh odor. Nothing natural or rare, just one-dimensional musky odor with shady woody and oudy nuances. Like a slight, airy evolution of older Colonia Oud. I was really shocked that Acqua di Parma released their own version of Dolce & Gabbana Intenso. I expected some lighter, ambery gentleman's cologne. Colonia Ambra is one of my biggest fragrance disappointing. Simply, not recommended synthetic entity.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"Interesting. There are multiple perspectives you can take on this fragrance but let us talk about smell first:

SMELL
-opening can be off-putting; if you are the type that needs to have a pleasing opening to your fragrances, you may not like this
-to my nose, opening smells like a mix of dried paint and fish oil; it's not as bad as it sounds but it's definitely unusual
-as the scent dries down, it becomes more refined & I pick up on a rose-vanilla-soft wood accord that significantly (but not entirely) calms down that ""dried paint/fish oil"" accord

Perspective#1
-on the niche fragrance scale of agreeable to disagreeable,this veers closer to the agreeable side
-so it has a certain appeal to someone who is looking for a unique & signature scent that can still be perceived as friendly, albeit unusual at times

Perspective#2
-have no clue if it's real ambergris in this fragrance; is this just a marketing ploy by the house?
-if there's real ambergris in here, is it responsible for that unique ""dried paint/fish oil"" accord that has an underlying warm sweetness to it? If so, you can say that you now have exposure to what real ambergris can smell like and how much it can differ from ambroxan

Perspective#3
-ultimately, the scent can come off as linear - the smell doesn't go through perceptible twist and turns
-therefore, it forces you to decide if you like that mixture of the 2 accords (dried paint/fish oil accord VERSUS the rose-vanilla-soft wood accord)
-it's an EDC and so it always has soft projection AND yet it's long-lasting and can regularly be perceived throughout a FULL day's wear; this is a good thing because if this was a projection monster, the unusual nature of the smell would veer away from ""artistic restraint and refinement"" to obnoxious aggressiveness

One more thing: this comes off better when you are in open/outside environments - there is a soft aura this scent creates around you that mixes well with fresh/open air.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"This is a beautiful ambergris-centered fragrance. There are different qualities of ambergris - and different concentrations of tincture - and I wouldn't be surprised if they used real tincture of black ambergris (lower quality), since they specify ""ambergris tincture"" in the note list. If not, I would guess they at least used the higher-end ambergris-like molecule (IFF's Ambergris T. Olifacc), since the smell here does not look like the cheap and sharp usual ambergris aromachemicals (ambroxan, cetalox or cachalox) you can find in many designer frag (ie. Dior Sauvage)

It opens beautifully with the typical citrusy-woody AdP signature blast, and then morphs quickly on a sharp ambergris supported by a hint of rose.
The drydown is still ambergris focused, but it gets rounded by a noticeable sandalwood note and a blend of labdanum and vanilla.

This one shares strong similarities with Colonia Oud in the drydown, with a fresher profile (ambergris).
As for performance, I previously read that some reviewers were disappointed, but it works very well on my skin. Indeed, I get equal performance to Colonia Oud (that unlike other reviewers, is not a beast on my skin): that is a moderate/good projection in the first hour, and then a moderate to low projection in the following 3 to 4 hours, before settling as a skin scent.
Like for Colonia Oud, I can still spot Colonia Ambra as a subtle skin scent after 12+ hours.

My preference goes to Ambra compared to the Oud, since I think Oud's opening is less interesting. That said, you really have to like ambregris, since Ambra is more linear than Oud (the latter evolves more with time, and the drydown is warmer and more luxurious than the opening).
Should you look for something to wear during Fall and Spring days (and possibly Summer evenings) that is more unique and fresh, go for Ambra. Should you like for something to wear during Winter days and Fall/Spring evenings, that is more woody, warm and formal, go for Oud.

My preference goes to Colonia Ambra, because of its higher wow factor, and because the Colonia Oud opening is more common (usual designer oud frag ""wet woody note"" - no real oud in this one).
In either case, you can't go wrong, just a matter of preference.

Note: ignore the reviews stating that it smells synthetic or has poor performance because:
A/ each skin react differently
B/ each nose perceives things differently
C/ statement like ""it's synthetic"" makes a sense only for someone who has directly got his nose over a vial of real ambergris tincture (probably very few - if any here).

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"I concur 100% with the user ""desordenado"" -- ""old paintings"" was the first impression I got from Colonia Ambra as well. It is old, musky, piercing, pungent and strangely alluring at the same time. Definitely animalic, more like fur than cured leather, with a sparkling tingle on top. As it sometimes happens, the first sniff entailed a resolute no-no, but then the curiosity got the better of me and I found myself returning to this olfactory goodness. What I especially like about it, is the relative lack of sweetness. On one hand, it means that we are not dealing with a crowdpleaser here, far from it. Do not blind buy this fragrance. On the other hand, it adds to the originality of the scent and lets you enjoy the specific salty-sweet ambergris muskiness without the plethora of additional notes that are usually put in the more crowdpleasing aquatics. I mean, this thing is raw! At the same time, I get an impression that you'd have to dress up for Colonia Ambra to acquire a certain gravitas and balance the primal instincts that this fragrance could elicit.

BTW, reading some of the reviews, I'm surprised that the animalic ambergris note (synthetic or not) is being constantly mixed up with the oriental amber note. It's not Colonia Ambra's fault that it can't size up to some of the greatest *amber* fragrances. You're comparing apples with oranges.

***

After a full wearing, I have to update my review. Unfortunately, this didn't work well on my skin+clothes. I didn't get the sexy animalics vibe nor freshness, more like a stale pungent odour. Had to wash it off. Sorry. Goes to show that you have to thoroughly test fragrances in real life to appreciate the real effect, not just the aesthetic of the notes. It really matters, whether you spray it on the wrist, chest, clothes, hair or blotter. I tested it on my forearm, but wore it on my chest area and it smelled like whole different thing.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"An interesting fragrance. I love it. Ambra definitely grew on me.

Upon first spraying and testing, I couldn't get the idea of some fancy, vintage wooden furniture out of my head. It smelled too linear, sharp and musky. I gave it another shot a few days later, and ever since, I've been loving Colonia Ambra.

Colonia Ambra starts very sharp, with citrusy and aquatic-type notes. Very quickly, sandalwood and patchouli peek through. The result is a thick, sharp, dense cloud of Italian refinement. Soon after, the ambergris (or ambroxan) can be detected. Subtle, but present. In my opinion, this is what makes this fragrance have excellent longevity on my skin. There is a hint of the Creed DNA here very late in the dry-down; Sandalwood and Ambergris are the likely culprits.

Main notes to my nose are: citrus, sandalwood, patchouli and ambergris.

This ends up smelling very rugged yet somehow smooth, and those around me seem to love it.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"After trying out Oud, Leather and Ambra (I owned FBs of both Leather and Ambra) I have to say that only Leather is worth mentioning and is pretty good. Oud is no oud at all, it is a bland norlimbanol bomb and Ambra, whose having I regretted deeply as I bought it blind, as I thought that after Leather it should be a great Amber based fragrance. Sadly, Ambra was also very, very bad, a norlimbanol and ambroxan bomb with no character at all, smelling very synthetic.

I am very dissapointed in this house and will not buy from it again. They have exceptional design of the bottles and packaging, the story is great, but the substance is lacking. If anyone from AdP bothers to read these comments - focus more on substance, because this way you are not going to finish well. It seems to me that they are not even using ingredients that should be there, I certainly did not detect most of the notes that are listed, and in Ambra I am very sure there is no ambergris (I know that it is extremely rare that any perfume has it, however, if you compare exceptional ambers like TF AA or Profumum Ambra Aurea, this is far on the other side of the scale, pretty worthless). And for the price they are charging, it is a ""emperor is naked"" story.

As I see that AdP as a house does not use famous noses to make their scents, it also says a thing in itself. It looks like their marketing team is involved to create bland, lifeless fragrances that should appeal to rich snobs who are looking for something a bit better and with a bit more character than your usual designer fragrances.

Moving to the scent itself, it is barely appealing at some moments, very generic, and the strong synthetic notes persist 99% of the time of the duration of the scent.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"Absolutely dreamlike for men. At first, I could only smell the rose and was concerned about not enjoying it because of that, but the rose aspect tends to vanish a little and there remains an incredible woody scent that I can't help but sniff on my wrist.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"The whole page for this is messed up!! Taken from an official tester bottle

Group: Woody Aromatic

Top Notes: Orange, bergamot, petit grain
Heart Notes: Rose accord, cypriol, virginia cedarwood, patchouli
Base Notes: Ambergris, sandalwood, cisto labdanum, vanilla, musk

There are no oceanic notes!!! I guess this is the power of persuasion. If someone tells you this cologne contains marine notes, perhaps 8-9/10 will smell them! I get no such smell. Instead I get a rich citrus up top (i.e. not sparkling) that is more clean then fresh. Next I get a warm earthy middle of patchouli and velvety rose. Then the ambergris starts to kick in. This is not the Creed ambergris, this one is much more earthy. I get mostly darker sandalwood, ambergris, and musk out of this to create an overall effect of earthy wood.

I get similarities between this and ADP oud. As with the rest of the line, the quality is noticeable and the perfume lays rich and thick on the skin giving of a sophisticated aura. Not super heavy projection but definite sillage and longevity! I will revisit this one for sure!",08/07/15 19:31,C@nn@r
Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"The original Acqua di Parma 'Colonia' fragrance featured sparkling citrus notes in the top married with an aromatic herbal accord of lavender, rosemary, and lemon verbena. Floral heart notes of rose and jasmine intermingled with warm sandalwood, patchouli, vetiver and amber in the base. The result was a classic and timeless fragrance which embodied the elegance of the Aqcua di Parma brand. Using the original citrus based 'Colonia' as a launching point, 'Colonia Ambra' takes us on a journey to the warm and musky air of coastal beaches. Here 'Colonia' and the Italian tradition are blended with the deep sensuality of ambergris, an ancient essence evocative of faraway worlds and times. The opening citrus is still present, with zesty orange and bergamot full of life. A heart of cedar wood, rose and patchouli follows, melding gently with the hesperidic top notes. The real centerpiece of this creation is the warm and enveloping base notes as rich ambergris, sandalwood and vanilla combine. Upon application, the wearer is cocooned in a sensual amber and marine accord. It is extremely comforting and exhilarating to wear, yet at the same time sophisticated and well-refined. Next to 'Colonia Oud', it is my favorite within the ""Ingredient Collection"" trilogy ('Colonia Leather' did little for me).

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"This is a warm, hearty amber fragrance that expresses the main note well with a heavy dose of vanilla. I don't detect any of the citrus notes opening notes, as I didn't find that this opened with more acidity or brightness than the rest of its life--it was nicely consistent. Ambergris may be present.

At the higher price of the oud/amber/leather group, greater projection is expected, and Colonia Ambra delivers somewhat, though this is no powerhouse (in fairness, it's still described as a EDC but in my estimation, ADP uses EDC liberally).

This is too new for the fragrancenet market so it's still only available at its retail price, which isn't bad. Fans of amber and vanilla should explore this, but at the current price ($220 for 100ml), I'm not sure with its longevity and projection, which are decent but not great, it's a worthwhile purchase.

Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"I already own several bottles of Acqua di Parma, I was interested in trying Ambra. I just bought a bottle and this stuff is really different from the others. When I sprayed this juice on my skin the notes were dancing. Besides Ambergris this juice gives a deep honey/patchouli vib ending with a hint of smokey/woodsy base. Water notes are listed but I'm not able to pick it up. The musk notes certainty gives it warm tone.
Longevity and Silage is excellent lasting 6-8hrs if I spray it 2x. I'm able to detect the aroma at least 1ft away after it's settled.
Final thoughts,
Kudos to ADP, this juice is a real attractive fragrance they used high quality ambergris. A lot Purfumery's add either vanilla or oakmoss to give it that warm/woodsy aroma. ADP didn't overlap different notes which would of decreased the intensity of Ambergrism The only thing that I'm disappointed with is that I didn't buy the large bottle. Try it for yourself and let the fragrance settle before you give it two thumbs up or down. This is DEFINITELY worth two thumbs up in my opinion. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",06/22/15 21:32,aqua_de_la_vita
Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"Very nice! It has some similarities with Colonia Oud, but this one is more mild and ""pretty"". Fresh notes on a sweet ambergris/musk base with hints of soft creamy vanilla. It's totaly irrestistible! Quite uncommon as a Colonia scent, this is an oriental fragrance. This is the most unisex of the Concentree line, and can easily be worn by women too. First Oud, then Leather, and now this! Where will it end? I'm very impressed!",06/08/15 11:11,Oslo-fjord
Colonia Ambra Acqua di Parma,"Yes, VERY much like Intensa Oud. Not an exact copy... but the aromachemical AdP used here to simulate ambergris must have a very similar structure to the one used for their Intensa Oud.

I have Colonia/Intensa Oud. And I wouldn't buy Ambra until I run out of the Oud. And I probably will. I do like that slightly fresher accord perhaps from the musk and ""marine notes"" (whatever they are supposed to represent!). But tastes can drift over time... both are great.

With either Ambra or Oud, you should test before you buy. In fact, I recommend getting both to sample and live with them for a while.

Btw, Ambra longevity is excellent! I think it may be a little better than Intensa Oud.",04/23/15 13:37,cytherian

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Extremely underrated fragrance. You can easily find this for 65-75 USD per 100ml. Opens with typical high quality ADP citruses and a beautiful neroli soap. The soap stays around throughout, if you’ve ever smelled a florentine soap bar or those expensive bars of soap you can find all over Tuscany, that’s the soap you get here. It’s in a category that I would consider “Italian fougere,” soapy and citrus forward instead of lavender/patchouli. There is a traditional vibe to this but without smelling dated, way more modern imo than Colonia or Intensa. There’s a bit of herbal/green facet here but nothing that sticks out and it’s blended very well. Anyone that likes soapy frags should definitely try this. It’s a decent performer but with how natural it smells I wouldn’t expect it to last long anyways. This is not a fragrance you wear to turn necks, it’s there to make you smell like a clean man who knows what he wants and knows where he is going. it will project moderately for the first couple hours. for anyone that gets intimately close to you, it will smell like you just got out of the shower for 6+ hours after application. Perfect for summer and spring. It’s an unbelievable value at discounters. I think ADP is one of the most overlooked houses. Natural, masterfully blended fragrances from a house that represents the smells of Italy better than anyone else and has a variety of fresh scents. Everyone can find one they really like.",11/05/25 23:11,BDK

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"You spritz Colonia Essenza and in that first moment you’re standing on a sunlit piazza in Italy, early morning light glowing off cobblestones. There’s a burst of citrus—lemon, bergamot, orange—so bright and clean it feels like fresh dew. The sweetness isn’t in your face; it’s refined, luminous, as though the light itself has a scent.

As the fragrance warms, it reveals a heart of white blossoms and Italian herbs: neroli, jasmine, lily-of-the-valley, and a whisper of rosemary and clove. It’s floral but never fussy—graceful, elegant, with character. The herbs give it a gentle backbone, so it’s not just light and easy; there’s depth alongside the radiance.

In the dry-down, soft clean woods, musk, and amber take over. Think fresh linen, polished leather, and a gentle after-shave touch. The skin scent lingers—clean, comforting, sophisticated. It doesn’t try to shout; it wins through subtlety. You feel polished and quietly confident.

Longevity is above average, around 8-10 hours on my skin with moderate sillage.

Highly Recommended 9/10.",09/15/25 07:29,PoKpongT
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Very identical to Lorenzo Villoresi Acqua Di Colonia (1996) on the opening.
However, Eccenza feels a bit more perfumy polished, a slight denser and has this soapier depth to it. Plus, it has the light sweet fruity drydown. I believe it could be because of the lily of the valley that adds this soapiness.
Eccenza lasts longer of course and the soapiness is comforting. Eccenza is also a nod to its own house pioneer, Colonia.

But if you like this type of scent in the most natural way possible without the sweetness or touch of soapiness. Lorenzo Villoresi’s Acqua Di Colonia is the winner. It is green and fresh with edges. It feels natural and organic compared to Essenza. But the freshness fades away eventually without any clear drydown for a goodbye.",08/14/25 15:28,BlueButterBee
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,Just beautiful. Like colonia but the fizzy citrus of the opening is dialled down and the neroli and petitgrain dialled up.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Today, I'm reaching for the very last Acqua di Parma fragrance in my current collection: Essenza di Colonia. My journey through this particular line has been quite a study, starting with the classic original Colonia, then moving to the updated Colonia Futura. Both, regrettably, left me underwhelmed by their performance, though the original Colonia certainly possessed a more appealing scent profile than Futura, which struck me as somewhat dissonant. I'm approaching Essenza with an open mind, unsure of what awaits, but truly hoping it holds something special, allowing me to conclude my Acqua di Parma exploration on a positive note. Let's get into it.


Opening:
The opening is a luminous display of vibrant florals, sparkling citrus, and fresh aromatics. The primary notes that immediately captivate me are neroli, jasmine, bergamot, and orange. Neroli and bergamot lead the initial symphony. The neroli immediately takes the spotlight with a generous dose of radiant white florals, gracefully underscored by a subtle citrusy nuance. This particular neroli note bears a striking resemblance to the one prominently featured in Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino. Following closely behind, the bergamot contributes a familiar citrus accord, accompanied by its characteristic aromatic and subtly spicy tones. Next, jasmine and orange weave into the composition. The jasmine adds more white florals to the opening, yet it distinguishes itself from the neroli through its inherent sweetness. Lastly, the orange provides a touch more citrus in the background, emphasizing its sweet and juicy facets.


Dry Down:
The dry down gently evolves, maintaining its core as a blend of luminous florals, soft citrus, and comforting freshness. The primary notes I continue to discern are neroli, jasmine, musk, and bergamot. Neroli and jasmine remain the strongest presences. The neroli continues to be a highlight in the dry down, carrying the same white floral and subtle citrusy accord, albeit more quietly than in the opening. Meanwhile, the jasmine has grown in strength, delivering that same sweet, white floral punch from its initial appearance. However, it has now developed a distinctly creamy, almost ""suntan lotion"" solar accord, adding an interesting depth. This evolving heart is then joined by musk and bergamot. The bergamot is still present in the dry down with its familiar citrusy and subtly spicy accord, but it has gracefully receded to the background. Lastly, the musk emerges, lending the dry down a soft and fuzzy freshness in the base, completing the clean and inviting aura.


Performance:
The initial projection is commendable, reaching a respectable six feet. Sillage mirrors this energy, leaving an easily discernible scent trail. After a few hours, the projection had softened considerably, settling to about three feet, and the scent trail became lighter, though still noticeable. By the five to six-hour mark, the fragrance had transitioned to a skin scent, indicating a total discernible longevity of approximately four hours.


When to Wear:
Essenza di Colonia is unmistakably a spring and summer fragrance, ideally suited for daytime wear. The harmonious blend of florals and freshness gives it a bright, easygoing vibe, making it an excellent choice for casual outings or any outdoor scenario. However, its luminous and floral-heavy character suggests it wouldn't be my first pick for formal occasions or typical office wear.


Blind Buy:
If you find yourself drawn to fragrances with a prominent neroli signature, particularly if you enjoy the style of Neroli Portofino, this would most likely be a safe blind buy for your collection.


Final Verdict:
Essenza di Colonia, to my nose, is Acqua di Parma's refined interpretation of the Neroli Portofino DNA. There is certainly nothing inherently wrong with that; Neroli Portofino is, after all, a very popular creation from Tom Ford. However, it also happens to be one of my personal least favorite Tom Ford fragrances I've ever experienced. With that being said, Essenza did not truly resonate with me. I will concede that I find it marginally more appealing than Neroli Portofino, but still not enough to wholeheartedly declare that I ""like it."" Unfortunately, Essenza did little to alleviate the persistent performance issues that have characterized my experience with the Colonia line. While it started strong, which is more than I can say for the others I've tried, it faded quickly, becoming a skin scent by the five to six-hour mark. Having now concluded my extensive journey with Acqua di Parma, I believe I can confidently state that this house, as a whole, is simply not for me. While some of their fragrances do possess pleasant scent profiles, the recurring lack of robust performance across virtually every fragrance I tried, coupled with their premium price point, ultimately creates a value proposition that doesn't quite translate for my preferences. Still, as they say, you never truly know until you try.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Such a gorgeous, gorgeous scent. From the beginning uplifting and vibrant feeling.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"To my surprise and disappointment — a barbershop scent. The kind that’s a slight step up from Drakkar, like Paco Rabanne, though not quite Azzaro. Maybe a bit like Pasha.

Suddenly it turns out to be more oriental than I initially thought. It starts moving toward notes like Chanel Pour Monsieur or Rive Gauche. Will it drop the lavender? The oriental part here is heavy — maybe even more enveloping than in the Chanel.

To me, though, it feels like a kind of Chanel knockoff. My opinion drops accordingly. The lavender fades away completely, and what remains is a narrow corridor of sweetness in the Chanel style — but weaker.

⸻

A lot of time has passed, and I can now take this scent more seriously. My citrus–fougère journey has left behind all the Portofinos, Amalfis, Soles di Positanos, and YSL Pour Homme fragrances.

Honestly, I haven’t found a citrus scent that truly suits me — they’re either fleeting breezes or old-man trash. Acqua Viva becomes too warm, Eau de Yuzu and Lemon Line are too candy-like, Oranges & Lemons or Melone Grapefruit disappear after 8 minutes, and Dior Cologne is too linear (though I’m not done with it yet).

I also can’t get into any mint scents — not You Or Someone Like You, not Minthe by Diptyque, not Beach Hut or Enclave, nor any of the others, which mostly stay linear and merely naturalistic.

My only saving grace so far is Aventus — but that can’t be it. I want something more natural, fresher, more connected to nature. That’s why I’m thinking about Essenza — it’s refreshing, citrusy, but maintains the right amount of fougère character, which gives it distinction.

It’s genuinely good, without being as old-man-ish as YSL PH.

Before buying it, though, I should still have a conversation with the last big contender (to be rejected), Fathom V, and the new player, Lippizan.

Essenza has a certain type of unpretentious elegance — like something you’d wear during an intermission at a vernissage on a sun-scorched Mediterranean coast, when people have stepped outside just to breathe for a moment.

There’s no real depth here — it’s only hinted at. But that sketch is filled in by life.",07/18/25 05:05,korngoldo

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This is what got me into fragrances properly, something totally different to what is usually accessible commercially and I wanted it as soon as I first smelled it. I know these notes are typically seen as a bit old fashioned but to someone who is new to the game its a really nice uplifting smell that is really addictive. I get really bad performance out of this though, like 2 hours until it becomes a skin scent on me. I spray like 10-12 and it still seems to disappear. But this helped me realize the notes I really care about and there is something in there for everyone which makes it pretty universal despite smelling so particular. That being said this is like the opposite of a blue-aquatic, sporty, modern fragrance. If your a fan of synthetic/modern scents like ysl you will probably hate this. The dry down does eventually go a bit grassy on my skin as well which is probably the vetiver but not unpleasant.",07/15/25 08:55,AdamOOO
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Blind bought this one and the original Colonia since I like these profiles. They both feel a bit old school but very nice

I think Essenza smells pretty similar to Kourous (dont think ive seen anyone mention it), but a bit toned down and more crowd pleasing

And the original Colonia smells a lot Eau Sauvage as many people have said in here

Both really good dumb reaches for everyday wear

Edit; Regarding performance on the Essenza, Its pretty bad it is what I like to call a ""sleeper"", like it sits on the skin and pumps up if your body temp goes up. I like those kind of perfumes. Eau Sauvage is the same for me",07/15/25 05:36,BIGDWARF
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Essenza (2010) – Acqua di Parma.
The Olfactory Family of Citrus Woody Men, created in 2010.
Colonia Essenza, from the prestigious Italian house Acqua di Parma, is a men's fragrance that exudes classic sophistication with a modern touch. With an eau de cologne concentration, it brings a fresh and refined signature, ideal for men who value timeless elegance.

The opening is a vibrant citrus explosion with lemon, orange, bergamot and grapefruit, providing an invigorating and luminous start. Then, aromatic and floral touches emerge with neroli, jasmine, lemon leaf and rosemary, composing a heart balanced between freshness and sophistication. The base is drier and woodier, with vetiver, patchouli, amber and white musk, ensuring a solid fixation and a clean and subtly seductive trail.

Perfect for daytime use, especially in work environments, daytime social events, casual encounters and situations where you want to be elegant without going overboard. Ideal for warmer climates, such as spring and summer, but versatile enough to be used all year round.

Performance: Moderate projection and longevity of around 7 hours, with respectable performance for an eau de cologne. The fragrance evolves in a refined and natural way on the skin, without being aggressive.

Bottle: The black and white design conveys an image of minimalist and timeless luxury, accurately reflecting the perfume's proposal.

Final Score: 9/10

Right away, you get lemon, orange, and bergamot all blended smoothly. Then it settles into a barbershop vibe with neroli, some florals, and a touch of woods and musk. It feels upscale without trying too hard.

Longevity is decent for a citrus scent — it won’t last all day, but it sticks around long enough to get noticed. You can definitely wear it daily if you want that fresh, polished vibe.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Essenza is what you should smell like while lounging in the sun on the coasts of Italy, wearing a white button shirt, reading a book, and looking sophisticated.

The opening is a strong, straightforward citrus, made up of the highest-quality smelling, zesty lemon, grapefruit and orange. Instead of the bitterness from the pith of a real citrus, you get a fresh, clean note from the florals and musk. This opening combination is best described as invigorating and vibrant. After around an hour or so, the citruses settle, and you start to smell the aromatics and florals which give Essenza its calming soapy vibe - the expensive kind you'd find in hotels.

Acqua di Parma seems to be one of the most frequently discounted niche brands, making it cheaper than many of the popular designers, so if you're looking for that hot weather hit, maybe turn your attention away from those Le Beau's and Sauvage's and give Essenza a try.

Overall, I think its an excellent summer fragrance, and criminally overlooked. Performance is above average - I can imagine the citrusy freshness radiates all day during the hottest weather. I would pick this over Neroli Portofino ten times out of ten, considering how similar the DNA and quality is for a fraction of the price.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Was not expecting this. The base comes off so strong. There is a very prominent backbone of rosemary, vetiver, patchouli, oak moss, and musk. I didn’t look at the notes before I tried this and I just hit em with “woahhh this has oak moss”.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Essenza di Colonia opens with a vibrant explosion of Italian citrus. Neroli, from the white blossom of the bitter orange tree, forms the heart of the fragrance from the outset.

The dry-down is clean and mature, with neroli starring alongside a supporting cast of florals and rosemary. It evokes memories of barbershop shaves, with both the sharpness of the razor and the powdery softness of the soap.

Unfortunately, the same soapy cleanness that distinguishes this fragrance also holds it back. Essenza di Colonia is classic and gentlemanly, but antiquated. It is a barbershop scent ill-suited for the outside world — the kind of thing you would smell on an old Italian man at church. It feels alien on my young skin.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Still on the hunt for a second Acqua di Parma fragrance to rival my beloved Fico di Amalfi, this week I’ve been testing Colonia Essenza. When testing a scent, I find many that open with harsh citrus notes, but that's definitely not the case here. Essenza has one of the most perfect openings I’ve ever experienced. To my nose, it is remarkably similar to Dior’s Eau Sauvage EdT, which is a long-time favourite of mine. In fact, in terms of its openning, Essenza is like an amplified version of all that makes Eau Sauvage great.

Opening with citrus notes of grapefruit, bergamot, and orange, Essenza fizzes and sparkles as it first hits the nose. After about ten minutes, notes of neroli, petitgrain, and rosemary emerge, and the scent becomes noticeably more bitter as the juicy citrus notes fade. It’s not unpleasant to me, but sadly it doesn’t fulfill the promise of the opening. At this point, Essenza diverges quite significantly from Eau Sauvage. It continues evolving rapidly, and it isn’t long before the bitterness gives way to musk and the warm, spicy tones of sage and clove, which take centre stage for a while. Vetiver lurks in the background, subtle for the moment.

By the hour mark, Essenza has settled. The spicy notes from earlier are now less stark, and the vetiver becomes more prominent. I also begin to detect hints of rose and amber, resulting in a warm, mellow, and slightly powdery experience.

There’s much I like about Essenza, but I also have a major reservation. Beyond the first few minutes of its development, there’s an underlying note that presents as sour to my nose. I’m sensitive to ambroxan, and I wonder if that’s what I’m picking up here. Unfortunately, ambroxan has ruined several otherwise excellent fragrances for me. However, unlike with those others, the note in Essenza is more elusive; sometimes it is barely perceptible and sometimes it is not evident at all. Taking everything into account, I’m left in a quandary when it comes to Essenza.

Tested: 1ml decant.
Seasons / Occasions: Warm weather. All occasions.
Key thoughts: Nice in many respects, but I sometimes detect something sour in the background that I dislike.
Overall rating: 7.5/10.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This is brilliant, it smells so fresh and clean. It smells kind of airy, like you are in the mediterrenean, surrounded by pure nature, but there is water in the close distance that you can see. Bergamont and neroli are the main notes, smells classy too. It is extremely well blended together, super smooth. Although this is described as a summer scent, I believe you can pull it off all year around, because of the very simple smell, it smells like just cologne water (it is) but just clean and refreshing, thats why in the winter I think if you go light on the sprays, its just your smell, or a smell. Though very simple its really well put together, lasts a long time for me, I easily get 8+ hours on it, smooth, clean and elegant.",04/12/25 02:50,dogfoods

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Straight to the point, Smells very elegant and high quality but its relatively simple, it changes a bit during the drydown but still remains simple, you understand that its been made out of decent quality ingredients but it smells like a pine tree soap with citrus, its not bad the opposite but its simple, many say that it has some depth but i dont see it. It projects the first 2 hours after that it becomes a skin scent for like 5 more hours at least on my skin.
Conclusion: Very simple yet extremely elegant perfume if you want to be called 'SIR' and smell rich this is the perfume for you but the performance is poor.",04/10/25 10:44,ONioniosApoZante

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,Smells like Heno de Pravia bathroom soap that was soaked in water. There's also a hint of a baby powder. But what I dislike is the after dry-down that smells similar to the air freshener in men's urinals.,03/11/25 18:00,long-nosed
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This is my second review of Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza.

It's dry like a vodka martini with almost next to no sweetness in it. Essenza is a sharp, fresh, zesty, clean, green, soapy, citrusy, floral, and woodsy fragrance with a solid oakmoss foundation, which gives the fragrance extra heft and strength, and that oakmoss makes the fragrance lean more to the masculine side of the spectrum, although I don't see why a woman couldn't wear this one.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza is an intensely green, verdant, no-nonsense, straightforward, masculine, down-to-earth, old-fashioned, soapy, citrus cologne (cologne in name only; it probably has eau de toilette strength concentration), yet dignified, luxurious, aristocratic, and regal in nature.

You can dress it down with a pair of jeans or chinos and a crisp white t-shirt, and you can dress it up with a tuxedo and wear it with dignity, pride, and gravitas in more formal situations. That's how versatile Essenza is. It leans formal, but it can indeed be used in almost any setting: office, professional settings, vacations, and life's great festivities and celebratory moments.

Like very few fragrances out there, Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza manages the unique feat of transporting me out of the ordinary, dreary, humdrum daily life to the jet-set life of the rich, powerful, and famous in a glamorous setting.

Essenza is James Bond wearing a formal suit and tie in an Italian Mediterranean summer setting, surrounded by luxury and sports cars, casinos, 5-star hotels, old-fashioned Italian architecture, palm trees, clear blue skies, beautiful women, the glamorous luxury life, and the dark-blue colored Italian Mediterranean Sea in the background.

Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza is the good life, the easy life, the glamorous life, and the luxurious and privileged life. I'm at ease with myself and the world when I wear Essenza. There is nothing in the world to worry about.

I wrote earlier that Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza is green. It certainly is. Maybe not as green as, say, Creed Green Irish Tweed, but not far from it.

Essenza is as green as the Italian Mediterranean coast, but the fragrance also evokes images of the Scottish Highlands and the green rolling hills of Ireland, with a breath of fresh ocean air in the background.

The possible downsides, though, might be that its intensely soapy and floral character could be slightly overwhelming and off-putting for some people. Essenza might even smell like a washing detergent/laundry detergent, and the soapy, green, and oakmossy scent profile might torment the nostrils to a certain extent.

Essenza gets softer in the drydown, but it still remains an intensely sharp and soapy scent throughout its lifespan. Essenza also remains relatively simple, straightforward, and linear in its character, so it's not a complex or rich fragrance by any means.

For the right person, Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza is signature scent worthy.

Final score: 7/10.",03/08/25 17:02,Peter The Fragrance Lover
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I've been a fan of ADP since my 20's , role on to my 40's and with the original Colonia and Intensa being my absolute favourites never having lost my love of them but this no matter how hard I try since it's inception can I feel any thing positive. For me the lily of the valley is too prominent and nauseating. One thing that can be said of the bottles aesthetics though, it's mighty classy looking and ornamentally looks fantastic on the dresser.",03/02/25 13:58,understatedbloke

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Smells like a luxury soap. The neroli mixed with grapefruit gives it a sharp edge that bites pretty hard for the first 15 minutes. It doesn't smell like the typical white floral orange blossom or sunscreen if that is your concern. This frag lasted about 7 hour total on me, with the first 3 hrs being noticeable. As an Italian, I love this Italian fragrance",02/25/25 14:13,abadomen

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Simply put: High end Irish spring in cologne form. That might not be appealing to some, but I love it.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This stuff makes even a shitty, foggy late winter day where the snow has melted into dirty gray slush feel like an all-expense-paid trip to Italy. The citrus in this is so bright and sparkly and fades into the composition nicely in the dry down to create this nice pure soapiness with a semi-modern aromatic fougere edge. It's an expensive soap that you steal from a hotel. It's definitely not modern by any standards, that old school Colonia DNA still carries this fragrance, but I wouldn't pin it as a dated fragrance that only the thirty and up crowd can rock. This DNA and style of perfume in general is so old that it carries a sort of untethered nostalgia, we know it's reminiscent of a different time but it isn't like grandpa's Polo Green or dad's Kouros that might be too familiar and old school for young people. Kind of gives off an old money vibe, which I think is something that is coming back into fashion. Also, for an eau de cologne, the performance on this is really good I get like 6 or 7 hours.

As for whether or not I recommend this, if you can get it for around like 70 or 80, it's worth it.",02/04/25 09:41,Ebbtide

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This scent lasts a lot longer than you might expect for a fresh citrus fragrance that is a Cologne style. I get at least a few hours of longevity. Opening is beautiful and it segs into a soapy feel as everyone has already mentioned. This is going to be the lily of the valley raw materials doing lots of work here whereas in something like suavage cologne you're getting mostly just the citrus and musk. So that one feels more natural than this but it's still a very good pickup. I bought a gift set recently which offset the price quite a bit so I was happy with that purchase, for some reason the gift set was cheaper than buying the individual bottle. But this is perfect for a professional setting and you can still smell the citruses even hours later. 5/5 for me. One day I was actually bored and I sprayed this one and compared it against three other cologne types, the suavage cologne, artisan pure, and this Eau Givenchy. All of those are EDT concentration but somehow this EDC outlasted them all.",12/07/24 20:42,eewatts23

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"First of all, shout out to venusinyourfurs, who introduced this fragrance to little ol' me. She told me this would be a great scent if I like a niche fragrance with strong performance.

Initially, I thought Essenza would be a very citrus-based fragrance with a hint of floral notes, based on what everyone was saying. The opening was quite strong, which really caught me off guard. The first two sprays were really soapy and clean, but once everything settled down, it turned into a calming white floral scent. I didn't expect to like jasmine, neroli, and lily this much....very surprising!

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I sampled TF's neroli portofino a few months ago and although I thought the scent was decent it seemed overly mature. I consider Essenza di Colonia to smell very similar to NP and while still mature it's a lot more wearable for younger people. Seems like a lot of citruses were packed into the scent profile but the neroli is the most dominant to me, smelling clean and spicy. I would say it has an element that smells very similar to a generic green lollipop with it's sharp piercing and biting flavor at times. Like a lot of people have said, it definitely does smell like bar soap. I have definitely smelled soap like this at hotels, I'm guessing neroli-based soaps are popular among the hotel industry. I'm fortunately not getting too much rosemary, oakmoss or patchouli because those things can bring down a formulation in my opinion. I like that there is a bit of a dark aura to the scent, it's clean and fresh but also a bit sinister feeling too. Overall, I really do like Essenza, it's a much more wearable NP in my opinion but i'm not too sure if this can be properly worn outside of spring and summer. I would give Essenza di Colonia a 9/10, excellent for a neroli-based fragrance.",11/05/24 11:13,Fragrance_Nolan

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"''smells like vacation!!'', first reaction i got spraying it from my sis. it smells classic, italian everything that conjures the relaxed mediterrean vibe. the initial spray of photo realistic citrus is so sparkly and airy. like a field of grape/orange trees in the wind. and the opening does last quite a while and i love that. Neroli, neroli, neroli all the way.

this is what michael corleone smelled like in part 2 when he wore his casual clothes going back to his heritage vineyard in sicily!

After the long lasting citrus opening gradually settles. a very thick soapiness comes up in the mid with beautiful floral hints of rose/jasmine + complimentary orange bitter green of petitgrain that make you feel relaxed, comfortable, clean. that soapiness persists pretty much till the end combined with a unique green herbal fougere profile of sage + rosemary with a slight minty/ camphor undertone. woody vetiver + a tinge of cloves. theres an ambiguous leather accord too. with a generous amount of earthy patchouli musk / amber warmth / oakmoss base as support making it masculine. the cloves is the secret ingredient here, working magic in the background adding a layer of complexity from base to mid.

Please judge this with the appropriate weather condition its meant for.
It's not a powerful projecting scent however it does leave scent trails that are just out of this world. it really does need a good warm outside temperature and wind. and thats often with really good natural smelling summer scents that are not relying on powerful aroma chemicals to give lift.

The opening is the most projecting part and it last like 20-30 minutes and that's bit unusual for a citrus forward frag. prob cuz of how much neroli n petitgrain is used giving an illusion of a continues citrus. within that time reception of others was lovely. after that I never really had a compliment unless im like very close to someone however when the mid develops the scent trail is just something so good that i had someone run up to me to ask what i am wearing. literally never had that happen with anything else lol. Honestly the longevity is a fair 5-6 hours. But not like it dies within the last few hours. It holds on wrapping you around a scent bubble for 4 and giving you 2 hours skin scent. letting it self known to your own nose every so often. a slight over spray works well with it.

it's not a dated scent... but its not a blind buy. the scent will wear you if you cannot appreciate the uniqueness + oldskool/modern vibe. it's not challenging at all to wear. quite safe really. and i read some people comparing this like a dollar store scent? come on.. tom ford portofino neroli which i genuinely find smelling like baby wipes with an outrageous pricetag lasting barely 1-2 hours is deserving of that label not this.

its genuinely a complex unique scent but you wouldn't be able to tell right away. it has enough transitions to discover. its one of my fave summer scent for a while. i just had to get another bottle years later. it can be worn all seasons acting like an work/office scent too. I got prada amber pour homme too and i prefer the soapiness in that one cuz of overall versatility performance / projection but sometimes you want something that doesn't announce itself but is to be discovered.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Essenza di Colonia varies depending on my body temperature. When I’m hot and sweaty, it goes directly into soapy, neroli, citrusy, aromatic territory.

It's neroli cirtusy classic soapy fresh that's a little older fashioned but works perfectly for the summer and sunny days.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This is so good, such a perfect year round signature, in fact that's the role this scent will play for me. Reminds me somewhat of a mix between the original Armani Eau Pour Homme, and Tom Ford Neroli Portofino.",06/20/24 22:38,milothepug
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"It smells like expensive citrus soap. High quality. When I smell it, I think of a well respected wealthy man (not a rich boi). I wish Don Vito Corleone had lived long enough to use this during the summer. Longevity is long lasting but sillage is not that good. Maybe moderate sillage.",06/18/24 16:57,baristtas
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"As would be expected from AdP, Essenza starts with high quality citruses. As it dries down the citruses share the stage with a subtle vetiver musky scent that is very soapy. The soapy smell dominates as time progresses, in fact for most of Essenza's life. Performance is average/moderate. Overall a very classy, masculine fragrance that would shine especially on hot summer days and nights.

After all the superlatives, why have I rated it only an 'OK' and will not be getting a FB for myself? Because of the poor price/value ratio. I already have very soapy type fragrances - an aspect I like very much - but for a whole lot less cost. To put it another way, Essenza doesn't offer a whole lot more than cheaper soapy colognes.",06/05/24 17:06,Smirky
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"It's exactly like the original, but much more soapy, a bit more musky, and less fresh. It feels like the same fragrance, just in a bar of soap.

To have the original updated with incredible citrus fragrances, I suggest taking a look at Intensa and Futura.",06/05/24 10:00,danilodeathayde

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Definitely isn’t dated, but does pay homage to classic perfumes eg. 4711.

Very bright fresh citrusy opening that quickly dries down into white soapy florals. It does have a certain depth due to the green spiciness in the base which comes out in the dry down.

Performance is how it should be in my opinion - sits close to the skin and lasts just as long as it should.

Soft, comforting, natural, soapy, clean, elegant, masculine scent.",06/03/24 07:18,BinksStinks
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Smells good, like a rich man above the age of 35. It doesn't smell jerky, and this definitely wouldn't come to my mind if someone said ""Old Money Fragrance"" because this isn't old money, this just smells like an old man.

Now, this may sound like a bad thing, but it isn't. My ex's mom bought this for me, it came with a deodorant and shampoo. I gave them all to my dad, and he loved it. This smells clean, soapy, rich and somewhat reminiscent of babywipes.

Performance is the definition of mid, it doesn't project much but it isn't a skin scent, it doesn't fade away instantly but it also doesn't last long. Mid.

Scent is heavenly if you are above 35 though.",06/01/24 13:33,accursednholy
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I sprayed this on paper, smelled it, thought it had a really nice masculine clean scent to it. Came back 15 minutes later and smelled the paper again. It hit me. This smells almost EXACTLY like dryer sheets. You know those things you use after your clothes come out of the washer, and you put a dryer sheet in with your clothes in the dryer? That. I pressed ""ctrl + f"" on my keyboard to see if anyone else got that and apparently, I'm the only person in the world that smells it. lol.

Is that a bad thing? No! It smells very clean. ""Fresh linens"" is the way I'd describe it. Just a really fresh, clean, yet masculine fragrance. I think I'd prefer this over Creed's Green Irish Tweed. Both are going for a similar end goal of fresh/clean.

This would go perfect with formal clothing. Wearing this with a suit I imagine is a perfect combination. The fragrance does NOT seem to last very long. It is a ""cologne"", so that does make sense since it is not as concentrated as an edt. It seems to be a ""skin scent"" very quickly.",05/22/24 21:18,SmellGood11

Its captivating scent evoked a rush of fond memories, tinged with subtle hints of spice that infused sheer happiness into my being. Friends couldn't help but notice my sudden elation, prompting inquiries about the source of my joy. Describing the fragrance, it's akin to James Bond impeccably clad in his suit, exuding sophistication while engaging in high-stakes poker at the Casino Royale – a blend of soapy citrus notes intertwined with delicate floral accents.",04/19/24 15:16,DolceVita7

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This scent is forever certified balling tier. A modern classic timless scent that embodies everything one looks for in Italian style perfumery. I find this scent is more centered around the neroli and aromatics. I do pick up on some citruses but its not a sharp or bright and zesty citrus to my nose. This scent is beautiful, classy and masculine. It does have that old school vibe but that makes it even better to me. However, it doesn't smell dated or like an old man at all. It's just a modern take on an old school classic DNA. In an age of modern men's fragrances that often lack authenticity Colonia Essenza stands out among the crowd. Timeless, authentic and refined. In my opinion, despite the note breakdown, I find this scent somewhat simplistic. It has a simple goal and that is to smell fantastic. For an EDC it has good performance. I never like commenting on performance since everyones skin will treat scents differently. For me it performs well. This will forever be in my collection. It seems most here are in agreement, this scent is balling.",03/31/24 19:21,3ak
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Love this fragrance. This is quickly becoming my signature scent for spring & summer, possibly even suitable year-round. Takes the DNA of the original ADP Colonia and amplifies it by adding additional spices such as clove, herbs like rosemary and sage are cranked up which results in a soapy scent. It smells so good it makes my eyes roll back in my head. Simply can't get enough of this stuff.

The downside is that it is quite expensive for being an EdC concentration. However, I love the scent and its high quality so that is a price I'm willing to pay. An eternal 10/10 from Acqua di Parma.

EDIT: Soapy, fresh, aromatic greatness. Classic cologne DNA with added soapy notes and a healthy dose of rose. Great longevity for an EDC. Atomizer is fantastic on this, sprays like a firehose.",03/26/24 19:48,Travis_Bickle

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"The original Colonia is an absolute love of mine. Essenza turns it up to 11. I love anything that smells like soap. This is the scent of an old-fashioned soap. I still prefer the original for the high heat and during the day, but with the added clove, rose and more herbal character, Essenza makes a great counterpart for the evening and cooler weather. One of my favorites to wear to bed. Opening is gorgeous. Like, eyes roll back with a big moan gorgeous. Quite possibly the best opening I've ever smelled out of about 500 frags.

If you're interested, watch A.C.'s (Smells Good) review on youtube. He explains it very clearly. Cheers!

Expensive soap vibe after the citrus top notes? Hell yes!

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Essenza di Colonia by Acqua di Parma:
This is a citrusy and aromatic, somewhat soapy fragrance that revolves around white floral notes-namely neroli and because of this focus on bergamot, grapefruit and neroli, Essenza smells similar to Neroli Portofino by Tom Ford though without the slight saltiness that NP has, replacing it with the classic soap smell of the original Colonia. Perfect for hot spring/summer days this is essentially a Neroli Portofino opening followed by a Colonia drydown.

Top notes: Neroli, bergamot, grapefruit
Middle notes: Neroli, rosemary, sage
Base notes: Musk, vetiver, amber, neroli

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Starts out very much like the original ADPC but with a soapy clean vibe similar to Prada Amber. The opening notes are heavily citrus in the same style as 4711, Alvarez Gómez, Florida Water, etc. It truly smells like a higher quality version of Florida Water because of the clove, which is actually a good thing. As for the price though I feel this is far too expensive for what you get out of it. Longevity is decent with multiple sprays but it doesn't project after about an hour or two and is heavily a skin scent. At that point it's identical to Prada Amber, but I adore Prada Amber so it's fine by me. But having a bottle of that already makes Essenza kind of redundant, I'll still enjoy using it though because of the difference in the opening. If it were a bit cheaper then it'd be far better of a purchase but the prices keep going up on all of the ADP offerings to the point they're practically double what they were pre 2020. Essenza would be an optimal choice for more intimate occasions where you don't want to wear a loud or bold fragrance but still want to smell elegant and nice when up close with others. If you're the type who prefers clubbing or youthful scents like Ultra Male, Luna Rossa, or Sauvage then keep looking because this is more for the gentleman or refined style minded individuals.",02/09/24 11:02,CreepyKid
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"The smell of a refined Italian gentleman is the best way to describe it. Has quite sharp citrus layered over a very aromatic, expensive bar of soap sort of vibe.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Essenza di Colonia by Acqua di Parma: A Dry and Sharp Citrus
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Essenza di Colonia by Acqua di Parma is a perfume that captivated me with its dry and sharp citrus. It reminded me of Hermes Orange Verte, but with a much better performance. It had a complex and sophisticated citrus blend, which was probably made with synthetic ingredients, but still smelled natural and authentic. It was paired with oakmoss and green notes, which gave it a dry and earthy character.

The perfume was soapy and clean, but not in a boring or generic way. The soapy term and quality depends on where you live and what kind of soaps you were used to, but in my country, this perfume smelled like a high-quality detergent, which I personally liked. It smelled like the Italian mafia, sharp and well-dressed, but not someone to mess with. It had a strong and confident presence, and it lasted for a long time on my skin. I had a decant from many years ago, which had a nuclear performance. It might have been because of the older batch or the maceration, but I was very happy with it.

Acqua di Parma is my top favorite niche brand, and I think they make amazing perfumes. Essenza di Colonia is one of their best creations, and it is not very popular or hyped, which makes it more special and unique. It is probably the least crowd pleasing one among the other colonia flankers, but I don’t care about that. I love it for its dry and sharp citrus, which is elegant and refined. The closest one to it is the assoluta flanker, but that one is more floral creamy and less dry. Essenza di Colonia is a masterpiece, and I give it 5 stars.

I loved this perfume so much that I bought a 100ml bottle after I tried the decant. It was a great investment, and I enjoy wearing it every time.",01/14/24 09:04,Karenhandmade.com
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,Yuck! Old man fragrance... Citrusy fougere/barbershop type scent... A mix of eau sauvage and roja vetiver... I hate oakmoss and this has plenty of it. It's a pass from me,01/12/24 03:59,Dumbplings
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I loved this scent with it clean and fresh feel. Went through a 100ml bottle and went out and bought a 180ml straight after. As soon as I bought it however I regretted the buy somewhat. The atomizer has changed to give a long, and I mean really long spray. Longest I've come across on a fragrance. Also the longevity seems to have taken a hit. Perhaps it's just me but I spray it and after and hour or so can't smell more than a skin scent. Previously I used to catch a whiff of it every now and again. Maybe it's just my nose playing up.",01/06/24 08:44,Frankie1983
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I had to add a second review to this, since I own a small bottle and I have been doing my best to fall in love with it for a while now. I do love the opening and the first half hour. I would say 4.5, there is only a tad too much soap for my preferences (please note 4.5 is nearly a top score).
The drydown is, however, underwhelming. If only it had been linear, but it is not, it is rather a curve of simplification. All the lovely details that together make up the grand opening fades away, leaving only soap behind. If it smells, as some say, luxury soap to begin with, it smells almost green Palmolive soap after 90 minutes after a slow decline. That is not quite fair perhaps, but you get the idea. Now I hold this to be a technical issue that they could have resolved at the manufacturers. Better performance is basically what I am asking here, a formulation from 2010 should have a higher quality.",12/16/23 02:17,Opato
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"My favorite Neroli fragrance. I think more masculine then Neroli Portofino, which I love, but find not masculine enough for my liking. Overall, a fresh, clean, soapy, mature summer spring and probably fine for those nicer early-into fall days fragrance that is fine for most occasions. I think it is fine for night time but are more options on the market that are more night time friendly for warmer days. Last 7-8 hours and projects fine. Nothing too strong, not too weak in my opinion. Solid 8.5/10 in my opinion.",12/12/23 18:51,JoeN12345
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Smells like a lemon scented body wash soap from a hotel I stayed at in Lima. The citrus notes are bracing and smell like a functional perfumery generic citrus (lemon / orange) akin to a citrus kitchen cleaner - not a realistic grapefruit note. For me the soapiness and functional lemon smell are a non starter.

My favorite summery citrus fragrances are: Mugler's Fly Away for a delicious juicy grapefruit note and Xerjoff's Nio for a fresh citrus that hints at a clean soapiness (not overwhelmingly soapy like Essenza).",12/02/23 10:24,cactus pete

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I have a small bottle of Essenza di Colonia that I sometimes need to smell. It is an elegant, nuanced sent, with some vague nods to leathery, citrusy barbershop colognes, neroli notes and some green, light touches of classic fougères. But alas it is impossible for me to wear! The soapiness is too overwhelming, like the original Colonia from AdP turned up to 11. Between 30 and 60 minutes into the dry down, it develops into something cloyingly soapy on my skin, starting to ressemble the smell of the lavatory of my childhood friend's grandparents. Funnily enough, this urinal note is one that I also get from Eau Sauvage EDT (not the EDP which I own and use). It is also strange: As with ES EDT, I do love the top notes of Essenza and many of the mid notes. It is a lovely smell apart from this strange soapiness, and even so, I really don't mind it on other men. Let us just say I am fortunate that I have no problem keeping my distance from them over time, however. It is fascinating how individual some scents are, and I think that it is a chemical reaction when two substances meet that causes this.

I can mention that I love cilantro/coriander leafs, but I once had an aniseed-rich Pernod for aperitif as I prepared some Mexican Pico de gallo salsa and immediately got a taste in my mouth that I was reminded about with Essenza. Very unpleasant, I speculate that this is how cilantro actually taste for those genetically disposed to dislike it (proven to be approximately 15% of any population). But go ahead and try! It is a quality product, just not for me.",11/22/23 13:07,Opato

Its bright and fruity. I think i smell a bit of lavender but i might be wrong and that might be the other ingredients in the perfume that i dont know how they smell individually. If it is lavender it isnt the laundry detergent smelling kind, it just smells great. Nothing but love for the smell.
The longevity as i said isnt good. That might just be for me and i mightve gotten a bad batch or something.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Very smooth, complex, Musk heavy (it seems to my nose), so well blended, classic perfumery. Different Musks or at least view of them give a thick texture, layers to the formula. It feels, that naturals were selected beautifully. Very sophisticated and elegant perfume. People who love classic perfumery, orange blossoms and Fougéres - I think, you will appreciate this. Thick, soft, clean, soap like, aromatic, with multiple nuances, natural smelling, sophisticated and elegant. I definitely pick up high concentrations of Orange blossom (Neroli) - both synthetics and essential oil. It seems to be built especially upon high concentrations of Evernyl (oakmoss), Calone, Citrus naturals, Neroli, Musks like Galaxolide, Ambrettolide, Muscone. Liliestralis, Magnolan and other (Lily of the Valley raw materials), Salicylates (especially Amyl Salicylate), which support creamy, thick and clean qualities of the formula even more. This is a masterclass of perfumery, it's too complex to my nose to say something more. Everything is blended in harmony. Perfume doesn't have any sharp edges. It smells finished, complete and reserve. Eugenol (Cloves), a traditional, very strong raw material, can support the spicy quality of the fragrance. I have no doubts, that Patchouli naturals improve the substantialness of the fragrance and Rose accord can also do a great job here.

I am 21 and I love it. Many people will not gravitate to it, what I absolutely understand. Classic perfumery in its finest. I think, it is just perfect for professional environment and special occasions. I very appreciate it for perfumers' craftsmanship.",10/16/23 11:12,Dvntex_

Longevity and projection are not stellar, though being a ""colonia"" one can't expect beast mode performance. That said, Essenza di Colonia is office-friendly and a must for old school enthusiasts; so much so that it is currently my signature scent.

In the end longevity was the deciding factor between Essenza and the original Colonia. Essenza lasted better on me when testing side by side with some of the other Colonias, that is not saying that it is beast mode, it is still a cologne and disappears in a few hours.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"One thing I quickly learned while trying Colonia and its various flankers is that my preferences are very different to the majority. For me this is more modern, lighter and soapier iteration of Colonia that ends up smelling very clean and perhaps a tiny bit artificial? If you're after a modernised Colonia I would personally recommend Pura before this one though.

Now for the really peculiar take: There is something in here where the light ""clean"" scents interact that inexplicably reminds me of the smell of a Nike outlet store in the summer, I don't think anybody else is making this connection so it's probably just me but I swear it's there.",06/09/23 06:29,MagicBez
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I like this and extremely safe. It’s very strong on the citrus up top. It mellows slightly as the musks come through but tbh I mainly get citrus throughout.

longevity - I wonder whether some people just get a bit nose blind to it perhaps. For me, it’s still going a good 4-5 hours later. It isn’t going to last much longer than that with this scent profile. I
Projection average for this kind of scent as well but obviously not going to compete with something heavier.

The only reason this is a “like” for me instead of a “love” is that I don’t like it quite as much as Colonia original or Colonia Pura. I do feel like this would be better if I lived somewhere more exotic- on a really hot day this would probably be better than either of those two I mention as this is more citrus and lacks the floral and musk of the other two. In the UK though this would probably only excel about three days a year! That said it’s still very versatile and very office safe - just that when it isn’t extremely warm, it doesn’t sparkle quite the same.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Veeeeery nice, the opening is a bit harsh but wait a few minutes, and it's fantastic.
Would love to wear it as a signature summer scent, BUT ! Clearly overpriced. Its a wonderful cologne, but... It's a cologne. It has more complexity to the usual cheap cologne you get for a couple of €, but its still in the same DNA, just a bit more of longevity and complexity, for 10X the price.
At 50€ for 100ml I would bath in it.
But now, I pass.",02/27/23 11:17,Apache1830
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I find it so hard to write reviews for the fragrances that I love and wear the most. This is my favourite from all of AdP, apart from the now discontinued Colonia Assoluta. They seem to have struck the perfect balance between classic and modern with this bottle, it stays true to the original DNA but packs a heftier neroli punch. Musk, vetiver, oakmoss, patchouli and amber are all very long lasting notes so I understand why some people are getting good longevity out of this, especially if you're using 15+ sprays of a morning (like I do). My current bottle won't even last me till mid-year but I'm fine with that, I understand that this is a citrus cologne and I love it for the fleeting beauty that it is. Perfect for the Aussie summer.",02/23/23 19:50,Bergamet
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"A pleasant summer scent that's uplifting and elegant. Intensa is my favourite from the line as I just think it's more interesting and fitter for the UK where it's seldom super hot, but when it is indeed that warm, Essenza is a good reach. The citrus opening mellows and gets a bit chalky almost, ending with a nice musk. Longevity is OK at about 6 hours, which is pretty fair for a citrus-dominant fragrance.",02/19/23 08:26,danny094
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"A classic, oldschool, elegant, clean and fresh scent. Italian gentleman vibes. Even though the original formulation is over 100 years old, this doesn't smell dated at all — in fact it's one of those few timeless fragrances. Master parfumeur Michel Almairac has done an incredible job modernising this scent.

I don't really understand how people claim to have this performing for over 12 hours, it's simply not made to perform like that. It has a modest projection for maybe an hour and then it becomes a skin scent for 3 hours. That's the beauty and intimacy of these type of elegantly constructed fragrances.

Don't buy this expecting you're going to fill up rooms. However if you're looking for a subtle oldschool yet modern barbershop scent, this is the one to get.",02/09/23 02:49,Sauce God

I didn't like it either, to oldschool, to sharp, gave me a headache, didn't like the scent. It's a grandpa scent, totally dated. Go get Guerlain - Heritage edt instead, it's cheaper, better scent, lasts longer and it's blended to perfection.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Very fresh, crisp, invigorating, soapy, classy. Adp essenza is a safe yet refined summer fragrance. Very well-made composition of neroli, mandarin, Jasmin, sage, petitgrain, a soft vetiver ..the smell is so nice like clean sheets, it evokes a mourning in a hotel next to the sea during Summertime. Relaxing, conforting, never pushy but not weak, adp essenza is a great choice for the warm seasons, better for people over 30, fits for all occasions because nobody can say it smells bad or offensive. It's easy to find for a good price, so dont overlook on it!
Colonia essenza è una fragranza garbata, pulita, fresca, a tratti saponosa, raffinata ma non seriosa. Sa di pulito, di una mattina in un hotel dove ti affacci e ci sono gli alberi, le piante e più in là il mare. Per l'uomo over 30 in vacanza con un minimo di stile. È facile trovarlo ad un buon prezzo, tenetelo in considerazione. Magari non griderete al miracolo ma è impossibile trovarlo fastidioso o cattivo.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I have had the Colonia Assoluta for a while. Sometimes it feels like it has to much Ylang ylang and feels a bit too feminine.
I think this is a little better than the original Colonia.

I just purchased a 50 ml at a great price, going on memory from trying it a few years ago.
It's a simple Eau de Cologne, but it has an Italian vib or spiciness which I like. It makes it stand out from Dior Eau Savage from 1965, also good and similar.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is perfect for me. I'll agree with many of the reviewers here and say it smells like luxurious soap that you may find in an expensive European hotel. I actually don't like many men's fragrances - especially over masculine or fresh fragrances and I also don't like fragrances on the other end of the scale like Dior Homme Intense that are too floral for me. This really doesn't smell like a typical fragrance at all. It just smells like citrus but there's something else there that makes it very addictive. Every time I walk past my wardrobe, I have to stop and sniff the nozzle. It seems to last a long time and when it dries down, it smells the same, unlike some fragrances that smell totally different after an hour. On a negative note, I haven't received any compliments but I will admit that I do not drench myself in fragrance. I like it and that's what matters.",12/10/22 20:52,M-Life
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This smells very very nice. The neroli in it does indeed smell very clean and sophisticated. Unfortunately, as others have noted, the longevity on this obviously isn't great. I also did not realize it was an EDC, so maybe I had too high expectations going into it. If you go heavy on the sprays, it'll project for about the first hour. After that it becomes a skin scent (though it does linger as a skin scent for about 5 hours or so).",12/02/22 10:58,dR$anD37

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"I wanted something from the house of Acqua di Parma, and upon researching, it seemed that this one had the best longevity.

Quick review: A beautiful citrus ""barbershop"" scent!

First spray/top notes are a burst of Lemon, Bergamot, Grapefruit - well-blended citrus mix, hard lemon candy.
Heart and Base notes are a Creamy Neroli, Soapy, Sudsy, slightly Spicy-Warm, slightly Sweet.

The scent is clean, sharp, fresh and uplifting. It's like a high quality lemon-scented soap bar at a five-star hotel.
Works well in the day, hot weather, summer, professional office settings.
Not too unique or standout, but subtle yet interesting.

Sillage/Projection: Quickly becomes a skin scent (as with most fresh fragrances, not a strong projector for long, though body heat helps to emanate)

Longevity: lasts quite a long time, at least half a day, as a skin scent/slight aura",08/31/22 14:41,scented_thoughts

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"What is going on with Acqua di Parma?

Once my favorite house, I feel like they're totally dropping the ball the past few years. They're really doubling down on their endless string of fragrances showcasing a single dominating note, particularly floral notes as of late. Don't forget their exclusive Harrod's fragrance, Zafferano, that no one else gets to experience. Look at the very few reviews of these recent offerings. Hardly anyone is interested in them. They just aren't impressive. Next, spend some time on their social media. They have spent months marketing a special edition Mirto di Panarea that has been on the market for YEARS. It's a fine fragrance, I own the original, but it's not particularly interesting. It's not like the fragrance community talks about it much. Why spend months marketing a years-old fragrance that was simply repackaged in a gimmicky, new bottle? Finally, examine HOW they market their fragrances. They're constantly throwing these swanky brunches with fancy table arrangements which only the smallest percentage of the wealthy class will ever attend. Is that the target audience? Unfortunately, it seems like it. They price their fragrances exorbitantly high but you'll see them on resale websites for a TINY fraction of their retail price. $300 for Lily of the Valley? Are you out of your mind? In what world is that a $300 fragrance? People are having difficulty reselling it online for $50-60. The average person just isn't interested in AdP and won't spend much to obtain one.

I'm not sure that this will ever be read by someone at AdP, but, if so, please know that I love many AdP offerings. I own seven. Colonia is one of my favorite of my entire collection. The brand has such potential, I wish AdP would do more to tap into that potential. Please stop with the ""ingredients"" fragrances and build a modern successor to the legendary Colonia. Not a Colonia FLANKER, put that line to rest. Create the next iconic Italian magnum opus in perfumery for the 21st century. A new fragrance. Something that is high-quality, mass appealing, and UNIQUE. It should set trends in the fragrance world. Finally, the NUMBER ONE complaint about AdP fragrances is that they have serious performance issues. Pull out all the stops. Retain the best perfumer in the world and create a halo fragrance that silences the critics: make it project and make it last. AdP was once at the top of the fragrance world; it has all the potential to be there once again if it's willing to adapt with the times, and focus less on marketing the frills of wealth and status, and more on the perfumery itself.",08/17/22 10:01,agonzony

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Excellent performance in the +90° summer heat of Los Angeles. For under $90 for a 3.4oz bottle you can't lose having this in your summer rotation.

Very fresh, citrus, soapy overall and will keep you smelling freshly showered thru the hot day.

I'm not a fan of neroli and I dislike the smell of rose. That being said, I can instantly pick up the rose (soapy) in here but it is balanced very well with the other florals and citruses and I think that attributes to the freshly showered affect.

For those of you complaining about performance, keep in mind this is an eau de cologne concentration. It performs better than many $400 niche parfums and puts designer summer frags to shame.

+8hrs easy (8-10 sprays) you will smell this on your clothes after 24hrs. Feel free to be trigger happy @ $90/3.4oz bottle.🥂

Anyone working outdoors in the heat would appreciate the cooling and freshly clean affect this has. Construction workers, roofers, gardeners etc Essenza will keep you fresh throughout your day.

The reviewer below mentioned his personal Tom Ford Neroli Portafino head to head battle with Essenza and I would agree with his results.

Essenza stays up several hours past Tom Ford's bedtime and for the price Tom should be ashamed.

Essenza outlasts TF's Oud Wood, Lost Cherry and many other $400 frags but you get the point...

Classic and indeed very italian gentleman. On the drydown theres a subtle rose smell, a very pleasant surprise. All in all, a 9/10.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"This fragrance is amazing, very clean, classy and fresh. The performances are good with an important longevity and a discrete but yet present sillage. The notes are not really divided in the classic order (opening, core and back notes), they almost appear at the same time and evolve in their own way. There are therefore differences between the spray and the dry down, but you will find a very similar scent even hours later. It is not a blind buy however. Despite being very masculine, it has nothing to do with common male fragrances that suit everyone; you have to try it to know if you love it. Colonia Essenza is worth its price (with regard to the accepted prices in the fragrance world), but it is too expansive to buy it blindly.",07/24/22 08:03,Alex Starrick

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Today's scent experiment. Wore Tom Ford Nerolia Portofino on one hand and Colonia Essenza on the other. While both are Neroli fresh scents they do not smell that much alike. The TFNP has a softer more floral opening of neroli where CE has more of the lemon and brighter opening. TFNP I think stays very linear but projectes for maybe an hour and quickly becomes a skin scent lasting maybe 5 hours max. CE projected a bit more loudly and I can still smell it as a stronger skin scent 6 hours later. The drydowns are different. TFNP is more floral again very linear and almost leaning a tad to the femine side although no issues with guys wearing this. CE I see as more masculine leaning. CE has a bit more barbershop feel as it drys down and I think the vetiver is more pronounced.
Overall - I think CE is a great smelling cologne and for the price is outstanding. TFNP is also great smelling but waaaay overpriced for a summer freshie. CE I think can be worn year round.",07/17/22 19:32,CharlieSparta
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"The fragrance which blew me away the first time I smelled it. It's the fragrance which makes my eyes roll in my head when I sniff the atomizer. It's the fragrance that paints a picture in my head, a picture of spring, childhood, fresh linen, hapiness. For me it's a smell of nostalgia. It smells very familiar, like something I smelled in the past butI can't point my finger on what it was.

It's a very fresh, citrusy, uplifting scent. It smells quite elegant but I don't care. I weare it with jeans and t-shirt. It's too beautiful of a scent for me not to wear it, but i'm not going to dress up for it.

I am very much satisfied with the performance of Essenza. I wear it to the office, it last on me 8 hours easily. I think it's a perfect fit for spring. In the summer it needs to cut back on the number of sprays. Otherwise it becomes an annoying, headache inducing scent with a vibe of an insect repellant.",07/13/22 10:03,felopian kid

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Right- time to get down to it.

This - For the gents hanging out- pubs, lunches, a wedding, a meeting - unbeatable.
I would describe it as old school barbershop turned up to 11!

The citrus opening is so natrual and fresh it's just TOO much for some modern noses to handle- I simply don't understand how everyone seems to prefer the synthetic smelling lemon these days- beggars belief.

It turns into a herby soapy smell which lingers for a while but this is a simple day time cologne - I usually spray the hell out of this to make it last longer - it's not a bright and fleeting as the original Colonia though and is more musky for sure. Just love the stuff.

My absolute favourite smell I've come across so far.

For the Ladies? Antiquated for the most part - but if you're wearing it for them you are doing the wrong thing- maybe some tasteful ladies will like it, however this is not a 'sexy man' smell compared to others- it's a grown man's smell. proper vintage cologne style. Ideal if you like wearing a mackkintosh jacket - blazers, you like italian coffee shops, restaurants and a decent bottle of red.

This smell is for godfather dons only! Needless to say it's classy as hell- shamelessly confident.
Italian masters roll up.

Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Colonia Essenza is complexly layered with many aromatic notes, and with white florals over the citrus. This is the rare fragrance where the dryness of neroli (rarely one of my favorite notes) is beautifully balanced with enough juicier notes (bergamot , orange, grapefruit and petitgrain) that it doesn't seem too parched.

There's a kind of density in this I'm unable to explain entirely--it's a darker fragrance than the note pyramid would suggest. This is an especially sophisticated and oddly masculine summer scent.

UPDATE 9/20/22: I liked this so much when I tried it in Stockholm this last summer I bought a split of it online--it is so lovely! This is much more mature and elegant than most other citrus summer scents I use. This really makes me feel special, and when the split is used up I'll buy a full bottle. It is THAT good!",06/21/22 04:37,Glyph
Essenza di Colonia Acqua di Parma,"Wow. After searching for a replacement for the fragrance of my childhood, my fathers bottle of original Armani Eau Pour Homme, and being disappointed by the intense warm orange of the reformulation, this is it. Opening up this is an almost unbearable punch of citrus, which will burn your nosehairs for about 20 seconds. After that it becomes just the most beautiful, aromatic, flowery citrus summer scent ive ever smelt. The neroli and bergamot are an unmatched combination. This is unfortunately plagued with a lack of performance. Still, a must have for any citrus lover.",06/19/22 09:59,TommyL
