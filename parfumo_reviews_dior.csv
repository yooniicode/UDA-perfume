Bois d'Argent,,"This one carries memories for me, I wore it in Paris one summer with a very special friend. The smell, the atmosphere, the beautiful company. Everything came together perfectly and I think this fragrance had something to do with that.

Dior has really done well with this one, it smells classy, it's smells royal, it smells amazing. ""Bois D'Argent"" means ""Silver Wood"" (specifically Birch), and when I smell this I do get the impression of birch trees, but ""Argent"" also means ""money"", and yes, it does smell like money to me. Pure class.

The fragrance opens up with a fresh, bright, juniper berry note. It settles into a gorgeous smelling Iris flower note coupled with sweet myrrh resin. Put simply this combination smells divine. This gives of the impression of a beautiful honey smell, all of which radiates off you like a beautiful cloud wherever you go.

I think that foremost this is something you will want to wear because you want to, not necessarily to impress specific people, although I personally believe that this is what a CEO would wear to a boardroom meeting or in his office. It almost smells royal!

This fragrance was part of Hedi Slimane's vision when he launched his ""Dior Homme"" line (along with Cologne Blanche and Eau Noire), many have even said that Bois D'Argent in particular served as the blueprint for Dior Homme (2005), which also used the Iris note. Unlike Dior Homme, I find the private range more up-scale, exclusive, and classy.

Basically, this smells expensive. It will not offend anyone, personally I think it projects well, enveloping you with the most sublime aroma you could come across. It's worth every penny as it comes in a huge bottle and lasts forever. Truly worth it in my opinion.

Soft, sweet, light, gorgeous and simply divine... if heaven could smell like anything, it would probably smell of Bois D'Argent."
Eau Sauvage Parfum,,"*
This fragrance is quite the plot twist. I’ll admit - my expectations were shaped by the bottle. It looks classy, but visually about as thrilling as a tax seminar. Thankfully, what’s inside far surpasses its understated exterior. If you get the chance, do yourself a favor and give this one a sniff. It was created by Demachy, so you might be positively surprised too.

Eau Sauvage doesn’t get as much hype as Dior’s other lines - cough Sauvage Elixir cough - yet somehow manages to score higher in ratings. A true underdog story.

You can read the notes, sure, but this fragrance defies easy description. It leans slightly gourmand, with an intriguing blend of orange/citrus, sweet lavender, and a whisper of anise. It’s linear - meaning the scent doesn’t evolve much over time, just fades gracefully. That said, after about 30 minutes, the bitterness of the orange steps aside, letting the anise become more pronounced. Simple, but effective.
A note of caution for those who don't like resinous scents. This fragrance is quite balanced, non of the notes is significantly more prominent, but I would say that Eau Sauvage has a perceptible resinous base (the Elemi) which you will notice.

Expect decent sillage (an arm’s length), eight solid hours on skin, and a performance on clothes that goes beyond a whole day.

A fragrance that earns its keep in your collection is one you can wear anywhere, and Eau Sauvage delivers.
Formal event? Check.
Relaxed weekend vibes? Absolutely.
Office setting? Perfect.
It even makes a strong alternative to wedding staples like Amouage Reflection.
While lavender leans traditionally masculine, the hint of sweetness nudges this firmly into unisex territory. As for age, it feels most natural on the 30+ crowd, but honestly? Wear what makes you happy, these are just opinions.

In summary, Eau Sauvage is the quiet, confident type unassuming at first glance, but surprisingly versatile, reliable, and well-rounded. A worthy addition to any collection or good for those who can manage to survive with just a few bottles (i.e. not me)."
Dior Addict,,"I fell in love with this warm and almost narcotic fragrance the first time it appeared in the drugstores here in Italy: this lipstick-shaped blue bottle , minimal, but refined and so feminine and mysterious at the same time, hides a true irresistible love potion that conquired me at first smell.
But let's describe the accord: first of all, you are involved by a vibrant orange leaf note accompanied by the mandarine fruity touch, but after a few seconds the Jasmine absolute, warm , feminine and sensual, arrives to your nose and you begin to dream of Arabian nights and nocturne scenes. But the main actor and the deepest note of this edp is the Vanilla Bourbon: sweet but never swetish, involving, almost cocooning. It's the perfect accord to me. A bouquet to enjoy by night or by day too in the coldest days. The sillage is surprisingly good, as well as the longevity. It isn't only a perfume to me, it's a drug! So, the name ""Dior addicted"" is perfect because you risk the addiction if you love powerful scents like this. It's a fragrance classic and Young at the same time, it is flowery but not too ladylike and warm-gourmand without resulting girly. A true Dior's masterpiece in my opinion. The price is high, of course, but you'll have a true scented bomb! (Maybe don't wear it at the office, of course....it's a typical leisure scent).
So, I think that this fragrance is a must have if you want to feel sexy and irresistible."
Dior Addict,perfect,"i tried the newest version today (is this it?) and smelling it right now on the paper, the vanilla smells just as beautiful as when I first smelled it years back. however, there is a green note I don't think I could pull off personally.
still, it smells beautiful. i don't think I could describe this vanilla with words, other than the fact that its different and haunting.
these notes come together stunningly. it reminds me of my aunts apartment, filled with big cactus plants and pop art pieces on the walls. i realize now, as I'm smelling it again for the first time in years, that I could never take this scent from my aunt. it belongs to her, even if she doesn't use it anymore. this perfume is for someone who lights up a room. who sets things in motion. who makes everyone feel lucky to know her.
that is not me, but smelling this, I feel lucky. like her energy will rub off on me. i think that's what its made for"
Dior Addict,Spicy vanilla,"I don't know if the pyramid is complete or not because for me Dior Addict is a spicy vanilla!

Powdery vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and jasmine. Incredibly good and completely perfect for fall and winter. In fact, it reminds me of the smell of gingerbread! I wonder if some have the same sensation.

Also very chic and the staying power and sillage are excellent on my skin. It has become one of the perfumes I need in winter."
Forever and ever Dior,,"Les Creations de Monsieur Dior “Forever and Ever Dior” (2009)

My god this is beautiful. On my skin it is the embodiment of simple, sheer, transparent floral heaven. This radiant creation joyously opens with a brilliantly fresh and spicy freesia blooming amongst a blanket of zesty green ivy. It is joined by a sweetly airy, non-indolic jasmine. The tenderly lingering opening seamlessly gives way to an exceptionally delicious rush of juicy-sparkling rose-hip/geranium plus creamy-almond-blossom that is further softened by a barely discernible touch of elegantly understated vanilla. The musk and amber animalics are hardly noticeable on my skin and serve only to anchor the ethereal floral splendor above. There is no sweetness beyond that which is naturally extant within the context of the floral petal accords. The scent remains pristinely fresh and vivaciously spicy throughout drydown with just a touch of creamy sweetness and no taint of musk or powdery amber.

I would bathe in this if I could. It is remains intimately close to the skin even upon initial application and lasts for approximately 5 hours on me. Those who demand high sillage complexity/uber-longevity type scents will doubtless be unimpressed. I find that the most beautiful scents are often the most fleeting. And this perfume is ravishingly beautiful. I respritz at leisure with the greatest of delight and enjoy pampering myself with this angelic nectar.

On my skin, there is no sour citric punch, no sneeze inducing soapiness, no bracing aldehydes, no sickeningly sweet sugars, and no revolting animalic rubbish to sully the elegant simplicity manifested in scent here. I am hopelessly and completely in love with this concoction.

If this was music, it would be Mozart. A single note of difference added or taken away would destroy the perfection. And perfection it is to me. Bravo and thank you to the House of Dior."
Forever and ever Dior,Keeping it Short and Sweet,"Perfect fragrance for a girly girl. Fresh, floral, beautiful. It's interesting to smell and has an innocent vibe to it. Won't offend anyone, but will draw people in. I absolutely ADORE this!"
Forever and ever Dior,Pretty pink floral,"The many different versions of Forever and Ever is enough to make me dizzy. A bottle identical to the one pictured above is what I happened to spray the other day, so hopefully I have placed my review under the correct fragrance.

Forever and Ever, while not something that I would personally buy, is one of the most pleasant soapy florals I've tried as of late.

I wore this fragrance to a yoga class last week and I was amazed at how many people commented on how lovely and clean it smelt. Even my sweetheart loved it, and he's usually more accustomed to my dark, earthier scents.

While simplistic, Forever and Ever wears prettily and can lean towards being a romantic scent. It is often said that a majority of men prefer a clean, subtle scent on a woman, and this fragrance achieves this without being overly synthetic or too generic.

The lasting power is quite outstanding, however the sillage is extremely intimate, airy almost. When I wore it, it almost felt as if I wasn't wearing any perfume at all. The only reminder was a waft of soft rose and jasmine when I lifted my arm up past my nose in a salute to the sun.

If you're a big fan of soapy, clean florals I would definitely recommend Forever and Ever. To my nose, it is a very pretty, 'pink' and innocent floral, geared towards any woman of any age, either young or old."
Miss Dior,Girly goodness,"This was my first ever “proper” perfume and I really like it.

I find the initial spray quite strong, the iris and rose is really forward. However, the dry down is probably my favourite- a warm, woody vanilla.

This perfume screams feminine and ‘smells’ like the colour pink, reminds me of something Barbie might wear. The bottle is also really cute, and makes a great gift."
Miss Dior,Peony and powdery florals,"Miss Dior opens up with the powdery smell of iris and the soft, green notes of peony and lily of the valley. Peony is one of my favorite floral notes, which makes this fragrance even more enjoyable for me. It's certainly generic, sure. But there's a reason why it's popular. It's reliable, very feminine, and pretty. The base notes give it a pleasant warmth, it's musky yet refreshing - this fragrance is a classic for a reason. But if you're not a fan of classics, powdery florals, or ""older smelling fragrances"", this may not be for you.

Overall pretty inoffensive, nothing special yet not bad at all!"
Miss Dior,Oh Miss Dior. What have they done to you?,"Today I went in store to compare the Miss Dior 2021 version and the new Miss Dior by Francis Kurkdjian. You may have seen the 2021 version being discounted to make way for the new bottle but let me tell you this- if you want to purchase one of them, don’t bother with the 2021 bottle and just skip straight ahead to Kurkdjian’s creation. You’ll thank me later.

I can see why this version had to be shelved. There is nothing groundbreaking nor special about this. All I can smell is powder, soap and maybe a hint of pepper and dusty florals. Boring and forgettable. There is no resemblance to the beloved Cherie or 2012 versions besides the cute bottle. I definitely won’t be mourning the loss of the 2021 version once it’s finally gone."
Dior Homme Parfum,One of the best designer extrait ever made,"No doubt, this is one of the most compelx, special beautiful mainstream extrait ever made. Now history, of course. Only 3 things about, good to know:

-2014 (75ml) and 100 ml.are ABSOLUTELY THE SAME FRAGRANCES in any therms. Smell, sillage, longevity. It can differ some bottles if they are macerated or not but nothing noticeable
- Better watch for a 100 ml bottle, for sure. Same juice, lower price, 25 ml + liqueur.
- Some of 100 ml bottles especially the 2023/2024 batches are slightly more velvety rosey smell with amber and iris in the background while 2019/2022 are much powdery and iris and less rose.
Both almost the same, both spectacular.
Regarding the ""new"" DHP, well, there is no new DHP. There is only one DHP and this is the one.
2024 MFK mess is totally something else, a bad and common creation. Dior made again another big mistake.

So if you have the REAL DHP, enjoy it, keep it and use it carefully because it is now priced in gold.

Good bye, handsome!
Thank you mr. Demachy!"
Dior Homme Parfum,A corrupt gentleman!,"After Dior Homme Intense 2007 which is still the best release of all the Homme line, this latest one is the one I really fall in love for. Homme Parfum has the very powdery sweet chocolate manly smell Homme Intense presents, yet, this rather more masculine than the unisex-inclined Homme Intense. This is the perfume to die for. A lady trap and a fancy dapper first class formal combination of powdery notes, sweet notes, smoldering floral spice notes, woodsy leathery vibe which is the largest aspect. This leather is the key to make it a VIP perfume.

Homme Parfum is not a remedy for what Homme Intense doesn't present; I believe Homme Intense is flawless. It is a distinct variation of iris and leather, much higher than what expected from niche markets. The pattern of smell is that identical and recognizable that any approximate formula is considered a replica.

Homme Parfum opens with fresh orange imparted within cedar and rose and iris. Then gradually orange shifts with leather and peppery notes to give iris a dandy boost. Wow, this is a ""fifty shades of gray"" type of perfume! The base is all iris, leather and cedar with very slight hint of oud and rose. Very long lasting, very powerful in presentation with vast projection and very effective.

Dior Homme Parfum,"An (almost) successful ""night"" take on Dior Homme","I would say that Dior Homme is such a brilliant, timeless cornerstone of modern perfumery, that any variation on it will always be at least quite good. But then Dior came up with that abysmal Dior Homme Sport, so sadly that isn’t completely valid. But well, apart from that, basically all Dior Homme flankers have been compelling so far – and so is this recent Parfum version. Not entirely, but mostly. And surely not as much as the Intense. Nonetheless it’s very fine. It’s fun that I completely skipped this flanker at first, thinking that it was just a different concentration of classic Dior Homme, and didn’t even bother to read the notes or some reviews. If you’re reading this it already means you didn’t do my mistake, but well, just in case – don’t do my mistake! Dior Homme Parfum is a solid, refined, kind of more formal (or more “mature”) and drier variation on Dior Homme, specifically played on darker, luscious, spicy notes and a recognizable leather base with a clever soft hint of soapy sandalwood. Classic Dior Homme’s DNA is here, sadly not as much as I wished but still here; the unmistakable cocoa-iris-musk structure is the core vein of the fragrance (although in a slightly cheaper rendition if compared to its original form), wrapped in smooth black leather dusted with a sweet blend of pepper, some nondescript sort of blackcurrant feel and an added dose of cocoa. Sort of “Dior Homme in a bitter black praline”, so to speak, at once enhancing the sweet-dusty side of Dior Homme by giving it a sort of more carnal and mature feel, and reinforcing its darker foundation thanks to a sophisticated smooth layer of classy, slightly musky black leather. Leather is quite peculiar here – it smells kind of oily, slightly bitter and rubbery, a bit artificial (shoe-polish type, so to speak) but still very pleasant and classy. I appreciate the fact that it smells discreet and skillfully blended, so it’s not just a rough leather patch glued on the scent as it sometimes happens with leather flankers. Actually the whole scent smells pleasantly discreet and smooth, feeling sultry, quiet, somehow cozy (mostly thanks to sandalwood for me) but at the same time almost austere, with an interesting feel of musky dirt running throughout its apparent “mannered” black feel.

The only flaw I have noticed after a few wearings past the initial enthusiasm is a certain subtle feel of flatness – almost cheapness, honestly. Dior Homme Parfum is a very pleasant scent and there’s definitely some creativity here, but I feel it can’t really compete with classic Dior Homme’s quality in terms of richness, dynamism and deepness (contrary to the Intense version, which perfectly stands to that level). It feels a bit simplistic – and I don’t mean “more minimalist”, I mean just a bit cheaper, more shallow. As if the budget wasn’t as good as the concept (which is potentially great in fact). Something you can notice in the “performances” of this scent as well – kind of linear, with a slightly disappointing drydown mostly based on plain synthetic musk. But well, maybe I’m just being too picky, among today’s garbage my rating is still surely positive. All considered, if you don’t compare it to classic Dior Homme, it’s still one of the nicest, most versatile and most creative “niche-like” recent designer leathers on the market, definitely perfect if you’re looking for a classy, subtly sweet, sultry androgynous leather for your dirty nights out.

Dior Homme Parfum,"Surprised at first, but learning to love this.","First off, I felt very privileged to be among the first people in the world to get their hands on this fragrance when I received my bottle several weeks ago. So, after testing this a few times I feel like I am finally ready to put my opinion of this into words for others to read.

But for review purposes, let me spray this on again. I sprayed a little on my wrist, from about 10 inches away. This way it doesn't get all concentrated in one spot on my skin. Which is what I experienced the first time I sprayed this on. That was, intense, let me tell you, hehe.

My very first impression was that this is dense. It is thick. Especially with its Dior Homme and Dior Homme Intense brothers in mind, this is like an extremely dense version of those. It feels more luxurious even. It has an ambery feel to it, which smells very natural. This smells like a perfume, not like 'fragrance', if this makes any sense at all?

The leather is a lot more prominent in this, compared to its brothers. Somebody mentioned that a Dior rep told them there was rose in this? If there is, I do not pick it up. But rose does have a tendency to mix well with leather and has been used in that accord more often.

This needs about 30 minutes to settle in, to become warm and more accessable. This will not be for everybody. The first few times I wore this, I wasn't sure that I liked it at all. I tried Dior Homme Intense yesterday and finally I could see the resemblance to that. It's in the iris note, of course, but Dior Homme Parfum lacks the sweetness of the cacao. This is a good thing though, because it gives Dior Homme Parfum enough of its own character to be an individual perfume on its own instead of being a 'flanker'. There is a slight sweetness still, but it feels more dry than in Dior Homme Intense.

I can't say a lot about sillage, just that it forms a nice cloud around you. Although I think this does not project loudly or far, I feel that the scent itself is carried nicely around you and people will notice your perfume. When it comes to longevity, this performed well over 12 hours on my skin. And since I have somewhat dry skin, this is saying something.

So in conclusion, my findings so far. I wasn't sure what to think when I first got this, but I have to say that it is growing on me. And I definitely need to give a fair chance on a colder day. But for the moment, I'm glad to have this in my wardrobe."
Dior Homme Parfum,A future classic...,"The best (and most masculine, I might add) from DH line...a stunning dark leathery feeling, combined with ambrette, iris, smooth oud and warm sandalwood. Different enough from DH and DHI to worth owning, like a deeper/fuller version of both. Great longevity/sillage and an elegant appearance for a self confident man. My own rating 9.5/10, strongly recommended."
Dior Homme Parfum,Dior Homme Parfum Fragrance Review on YT,This is my Dior Homme Parfum Fragrance Review on YouTube! Why a re-review of Dior Homme Parfum? Well it's one of my favorite designer releases. Still my favorite designer release. What I love about Dior Homme Parfum is is't intensity and boldness and sexiness. It's everything I wanted in Dior Homme Intense which I have it with Dior Homme Parfum. Man this stuff is delicious....
Dior Homme Parfum,First impression: Nice leather with some Dior Homme DNA,"When I tried it in the department store I smelled intense iris, recognizing that this parfum edition has some Dior Homme DNA in it.

While it is an excellent perfume,..."
Dior Homme Parfum,It's just not that good....don't believe the hype,"If this was still sold in the United States no one would care about it like they do, It's been hard to find for several years now and it just gives way to this 'legend' that it has become.

But it's just not that good.

Where reviews go wrong:
- Yes it has a bit of the lipstick / makeup bag vibe, but not as much as people make it seem.
- It's extremely linear
- It's not the 24 hour, mile long silage trail that everyone says it is. Someone literally said it lasts for day(s) plural directly under this review with nuclear silage (and no, vintage is not different).
- Saying this is 'formal' or 'classy' ... maybe compared to Allure Homme Sport, but that's about it.

Where reviews are right:
- ehh?

I just don't know why anyone would pay this price for what this is, if you want something leathery and masculine there are hundreds of other options that are significantly better for the same price or even less.

Don't believe the hype."
Dior Homme Parfum,Probably the Best of All Times...,"For me DHP is indeed a unique masterpiece, the GOAT perfume and a League on its own but I totally understand why some people don't like it...fully respected. One thing that I don't understand is why almost all reviewers saying this is only for formal occassions....sorry but no way guys...It is indeed ideal for formal occassions BUT you can rock and enjoy this perfume in many more occasions that are less formal."
Dior Homme Parfum,Dior Homme Parfum Fragrance Review on YT,"This is my Dior Homme Parfum Fragrance Review on YouTube! Why a re-review of Dior Homme Parfum? Well it's one of my favorite designer releases. Still my favorite designer release. What I love about Dior Homme Parfum is is't intensity and boldness and sexiness. It's everything I wanted in Dior Homme Intense which I have it with Dior Homme Parfum. Man this stuff is delicious. Sexy but masculine, bold but soft. Just an incredible update to the much loved and sometimes hated Dior Homme line of fragrances from Christian Dior. It's too good. Find out more from watching my review."
Dior Homme Parfum,First impression: Nice leather with some Dior Homme DNA,"When I tried it in the department store I smelled intense iris, recognizing that this parfum edition has some Dior Homme DNA in it. Later I received a sample vial (my 2nd impression, lol) and I started to like it more: It is primarily a leather perfume with iris in second place. The initial phase consists of intense iris, reminiscent of Dior Homme Intense. The leather accord will appear soon after that, and after 1 or 1,5 hours the leather takes the lead. At that point, in my opinion, the iris only serves to add a 'clean' aspect to the leather.

The leather is not one dimensional but an accord with several facets. Leathers can be quite different and I'd describe this one as black leather, it's also smooth and soft. I haven't detected any rose. The woody note is probably there, yep. I haven't smelled any oud. However the leather accord has a nice edible aspect. I quite like this leather smell, maybe it's in my top 5 leather fragrances.

Performance: I get 6,5 h.longevity, probably because I've applied too little from my sample. I get average sillage, or a little less. You should test this for yourself.

Comparisons: Let me compare Dior Homme (Parfum) with another recent release Guerlain L'Homme Idéal. DH Parfum is more mysterious and perhaps 'sexier'. But L'Homme Idéal has equally good quality (or better) and a very appealing smell for a better price. Another black leather I smelled is Bottega Veneta pour Homme. That one is quite mature (30+) whereas DH Parfum is pretty much for everyone who dares to wear a leather fragrance."
Dior Homme Parfum,Not a surprise,"Tone down the iris, almost muting it.

Add a strong leather, but smooth and creamy.

Add some sandalwood.

So is the Dior Homme Parfum.

Differs from Dior Homme because the iris note was rather attenuated - forget the makeup smell.

Also there isnt the sweetness of Dior Homme Intense.

The leather note is the main player here.

While it is an excellent perfume, in my opinion lost a bit of eccentricity of the other versions.

Just as the Fahrenheit Parfum, Dior Homme Parfum lost some of its character - both go to a common place, even above average.

Excellent lasting power (over 10 hours) with good sillage in first hours."
Dior Homme Parfum,why did they discontinued it?,"Unisex, slightly masculine, suitable for the evening but for me it doesn't do any harm even during the day in work contexts. The iris is powdery, rather greasy and very present, supported by a woody, amber and generally sweet base. I can feel it on the skin but it's not overwhelming. The scent is really beautiful, elegant and deep, with good performance. In fact it reminds me of the smell of a woman's bag because of the iris, but I don't mind it. It's comfortable, enveloping, warm, very ""dark"", it's not invasive but it feels good and doesn't bother. When it dries, it leaves a sweet but not cloying scent on the skin. I prefer it to the intense version which for me lacks depth and ""thickness"" and has a base that is too ""generic"" for my tastes. In short, beautiful and worth it. It's a shame they discontinued it; I bought a few bottles and put them aside."
Dior Homme Parfum,The perfect scent for a special occasion,"The perfect scent for a special occasion if you like Iris, leather and wood notes. Managed to get a 100ml bottle for half the price of the official website in a local discounter, but it is really hard to find. All of the notes listed above can be spotted on it. Oud is there, but not as prominent as other scents, it just compliments the whole mix.

Best one in the line 100%. Makeup vibe is still around, but it is so well blended with the leather and the woods that does not give that old lady vibe some get in the Intense. Wild that this can be bought at the same price than other design fragrances. Comparable to niche fragrances.

If you find it, buy it. If you like it, it will be a win win, if not, you can resell at any moment and still earn money.

Edit after 24h: Man this smell is still on my wrist. Eternal longevity is not enough to describe it."
Dior Homme Parfum,Metrosexual,"This is very successful parfum. It is not just because it smells amazing. It also represents a style. Style of an urban metro sexual. He is familiar with suit and tie. He is a confident, dark and elegant.He also has a soft side, a feminine side. He likes iris , nothing wrong liking flowers. Dior is doing something nice here. They are trying to create a style of our time with fashion and parfums.Thats why this is “true” designer parfum . Maybe this style is also fading, getting older.
I am not that guy wears suite and tie. I always struggle to wear this one without a suite . Yet , I really enjoy wearing this because of quality and idea behind it."
Dior Homme Parfum,Iris powerhouse,"I discovered what iris was through the DH intense version. Dusty carrots it reminded me of. I love that, the powderiness made it a great unisex fragrance.
This Parfum version however is less powdery but more tangible and soapy. It supposedly has a leather note but I can’t find that anywhere. Less powdery makes it more masculine in my book.
The stuff lasts for days, even weeks on clothing. I had some of it on my coat and I kept smelling the deliciousness. On skin easily from morning to night.
It’ll be replaced shortly by a new version, one can only hope it’ll be as good as this one!"
Dior Homme Parfum,The Dark Knight,"This was a great conclusion to the line. Where Dior Homme EDT was a gorgeous cocoa powder, with waxy iris and lavender, a sensitive new metrosexual style of fragrance was introduced to the world, and Dior Homme Intense made things just more sensual and night-time appropriate, DHP introduced a rough edge, an oud base, spices and a dark rose to the mix. Its the perfect conclusion to the line, a dark, mysterious boss fragrance that had so much power, and somehow did not lose its elegance in the way.

This was the end of Dior as we know it, sadly, after 2014, we got Sauvage, and the rest after that is not good at all, just Dior losing all creative power, and started copying trends. Oh well, at least we got this."
Dior Homme Parfum,The best niche of designers. Glorious juice.,"I'm going to try to rehearse my experience with the recently acquired Dior Homme Parfum. First of all, I would like to demystify the idea that it is a difficult perfume to use because it is heavy, in my taste it is much more versatile than what it has gained from its reputation, and on the other hand, come on, you have to use what you like when wherever you want and where you..."
Dior Homme Parfum,Beast of a fragrance,"No other way to describe this other than as a beast mode fragrance with a loud and potent opening. A fragrance that resonates confidence and masculinity.

It feels as an almost unending fragrance, with skin scent present event after 20 hours and a shower!
The sillage is strong (3-4ft easily 1-2hours), strong lingering effect several hours afterwards too. It does have this suffocating cloud effect after application, due to its explosive opening, those who are sensitive in that case might find it unbearable. It’s a fragrance you should not over apply, at most 2 sprays is sufficient."
Dior Homme Parfum,Dry and Dusty Leather + vintage DHI,"It opens with the familiar Dior Homme Intense - Iris, with a scent of lipstick and light sweetness, but is dense as machine oil and without any freshness.

A minute later the leather appears and the composition becomes dry, dusty and very slightly animalistic, but it does not lose the smoothness of the iris, which I suppose is helped by the sandalwood.

In the drydown, which is noticeable even after 10 hours, the perfume remains pretty much the same.

In short: This is the original metrosexual DHI (which we all miss dearly) with added dry and dusty leather, making it a much more masculine composition."
Dior Homme Parfum,I smelled this before,"I am a big fan of the DHI and since 2011 I always had a bottle in my drawer, I must admit that this passion for scents started a while ago, but I came across the Dior by chance and fell in love with the smell.

FFW to present times, the DDI is not as powerful and intense as it once was .. and the last bottle bought in 2015 was still having this character, the recent one does not have it anymore.

Therefore, I gave DHP a chance to see how it will be in comparison .. well, it does not dissapoint and it is really the better option from the Dior Homme line, if you like bold and loud scents.

For me, the current DHP smells exactly how I remember DHI of being, 12 years ago .. so not all is lost, we can still get the good stuff, but with another name from the same brand.

I hope you will enjoy my versus below, thank you."
Dior Homme Parfum,One designer to rule them all,"I absolutely adore Dior Homme Parfum. I went for the hype with an open mind and traded a bottle of mine for DHP with a friend. I was in utter awe of the fragrance the moment I sprayed it. I reckon having this tingling sensation on my skin and indeed I have not smelled anything this amazing and captivating even to this day. The beautiful leather, citrusy cacao notes with the iris dancing throughout the scent is a journey nothing short of a wonder. I love it through and through; there is never a dull moment when I wear it. It is a must have or a must sample in case you don't have it. I will definitely and permanently keep DHP in my collection even if it means I have to give all my other fragrances away. DHP is the one fragrance that rules them all, be it niche or designers."
Dior Homme Parfum,The best niche of designers. Glorious juice.,"I'm going to try to rehearse my experience with the recently acquired Dior Homme Parfum. First of all, I would like to demystify the idea that it is a difficult perfume to use because it is heavy, in my taste it is much more versatile than what it has gained from its reputation, and on the other hand, come on, you have to use what you like when wherever you want and where you can, and it is not something that only I think about.
The notes stated on the official Dior website summarize the composition to Iris, Sandalwood and leather accords. Personally, I do perceive a fleeting citrus at the top and an oud chord, curiously not at the base, but at the top and that lasts not much more than an hour. The iris can be felt from the beginning, the protagonist, powdery and dry that combined with a woody leather accord is wonderful, it embraces you and lasts throughout the life of the perfume. It is not an aggressive leather, hardly animalistic, with a toasted sensation that is addictive.
My bottle is a Bach 2023, it is not the best performance, but it lasts about 6 hours with good projection for the first two hours. I insist with my perception that it is a perfume that can be used on many more occasions than YouTube reviewers say. Is it redundant to have Intense? I have both, it may be but I wouldn't leave any of them. Intense is sweeter and lighter, it doesn't have the notable leather accord, which is why I don't consider them to be so similar, but I don't know if any nose can confuse them.
It is a masterpiece that feels natural and quality when smelled. With a great personality, he is neither interested nor seeking to please everyone. It is original, particular and unique, capable of causing a very special experience when used. This to me is one of the concepts of what “niche” means. May I never lack."
Dior Homme Parfum,Perfection,"A masterpiece. Leather and sandalwood drenched in a nuclear payload of iris with a meagre spritz of orange. Oud, rose, and ambrette are a part of the symphony, adding a dusky halo to the composition, but the driving forces remain the muscular leather, creamy sandalwood, and almost electric iris.

Dior Homme Parfum,Dior Homme Parfum: the GOAT,"Dior Homme Parfum is arguably the best perfume I have had the utmost pleasure of trying. It is indeed a more masculine approach to the iris based fragrances and I can understand why so many reviewers say it is 'niche quality'. I love almost all iris based men fragrances, but Dior Homme Parfum is by far the most complex and luxurious one. Based on feedback from the females in my life, I do not think it will do well in romantic or intimate settings though. I believe it is made to be worn on special occasions when you wish to exude confidence and make a statement. If you want to wear it casually, I think it will best complement a dark leather jacket outfit with Chelsea or combat boots.

Currently this is the most enjoyable scent I have in my collection and it has been so for some time.

Regarding reformulation - the formula on the bottom is the same as the original, but I confirm that my bottle is definitely weaker than the testers I have tried in stores. I remember one time I sprayed this on my jacket sleeve 3 times and the scent stayed there strongly for the whole winter and spring! With the current bottle the same experiment left me with just a day or two scent that then faded away. it still does perform very well and on skin I get around 2-3 hours nice projection and up to 8-9 hours longevity. Some say that the Dior 'Homme' line perfumes get stronger and better smelling with time and oxidation which at this point I cannot deny or confirm.

The review is based on batch code 8J05 (meaning production date 09/2018)."
Dior Homme Parfum,Dior not marketing this for the marketplace in the USA is a travesty!,"I absolutely love this fragrance. While I likely would not have any need to ever need to buy a second bottle of this, I am absolutely boggled as to why Dior doesn’t market this fragrance for the US marketplace. It’s been said time and time again this is a masterpiece by the legendary Francois Demachy, and all I can do is nod my head in agreement with fervor.

This one plays off my skin seemingly different than for most and/or hits my olfactive receptors differently. While most categorize this as an evening formal, I tend to wear this anytime anyplace with any clothing. Granted prior to leaving my last place of employment, that was 3 years working from home and given I was working from home 10-12 hours a day, I typically dressed for comfort. When taking into account making breakfast, dinner, and walking my dog, I had very little time or reason to leave the house. As such, most of my wearings were with comfortable sweat pants, t shirt, hoodie, and slippers. I suppose at first spray, in the opening, I can see why some associate this with a lipsticky nature of the iris. For me, however, that fades rather quickly. My nose doesn’t pick up on much of an evolution, but rather after about 20 minutes into dry down, it gets rather linear and what my brain associates this fragrance with is a memory of a particular candy from childhood.

I recall being a child and eating a candy in the shape of a barrel with a distinct root beer soda flavor. When the dry down fades, and it goes linear to my nose for several hours, that is what I am reminded of so much so I can almost taste those candies. It is with extreme rarity that I drink any carbonated beverages. I typically only drink soda once every year or two and only when I’m feeling under the weather with a cold virus or illness that leaves me with similar symptoms of runny / stuffy nose, malaise, and feverish. Typically in those instances, I have a bottle of ginger ale, and a bottle of root beer in the house. For me, as a child, root beer was my favorite. Now, since adulthood, considering having a root beer occurs once every year or two, it could be some aberration of my olfactive sense, but that’s what I get and I absolutely love it!

This is a 10/10 masterpiece for my nose and while I don’t get the evolution of the scent profile as many do, and any changes due to complexity, nor the lipsticky iris, this one certainly has struck me as unique from the moment I first got my sniffer on it and continues to strike me as such. I’ve seen some describe this as, despite being a designer, niche in scent profile and I truly could not agree more! If I were to provide a list of must have fragrances, this one would unquestionably make the list.

I can’t help but wonder if others remember those root beer candies (not sure if those are unique to the USA), and if so, if this fragrance is reminiscent of those candies for others. While my daily beverage intake consists of a dark roast coffee in the mornings, water for the rest of the day, with one juice and one smoothie made in my ninja blender each day, and a good quality beer or a glass of wine maybe once every 2 or 3 months, if I ever did have a craving for a soda, this fragrance might quench that craving as it’s so realistic to that root beer candy for me.

While I can’t see ever needing to buy a second bottle just due to having far more fragrances that is necessary, if ever I dropped the bottle and it broke, I’d be very disappointed this is not regularly available in the states. C’mone Dior, get it together… I really feel this would do remarkably well stateside!"
Dior Homme Parfum,Perfection,"A masterpiece. Leather and sandalwood drenched in a nuclear payload of iris with a meagre spritz of orange. Oud, rose, and ambrette are a part of the symphony, adding a dusky halo to the composition, but the driving forces remain the muscular leather, creamy sandalwood, and almost electric iris. Taken together, the scent boquet almost makes me swoon. It has a physical effect on me, as if a shockwave had been sent through my brain. The kind of scent that leaves you without words. The Dior Homme DNA reaches its apogee with DHP, its darkest, deepest, sexiest, beastliest, and by far its most masculine iteration.

A 10/10 for me"
Dior Homme Parfum,A secret miracle!,"I got this small wonder from a friend who doesn't like iris root. The prominent note is iris here all the way through, with warm juicy orange zest. As the sillage progresses you get such well balanced notes of suede leather, oud,rose and patchouli, cedar and sandalwood. However, the miracle of this formula comes when your body heat and your blood pulse heats up the note of ambrette in the drydown. This animalic musc derived from a plant rockets the extrait de parfum up high in the air around you! The other reason this jewel was known only to collectors- influencers is that as long DIOR had it in their collection you could only order it through the DIOR site strictly and could not have found it in dept stores or cosmetics shops. Francois Demachy you saved me from Francis Kurkdjian!
But now I must save this bottle as long as possible because I can't buy it again! And must thank my friend who sold his 2020 bottle to me every day in my meditations!"

Dior Homme Parfum,Old Scent DNA of Dior Homme Parfum – Vintage Formulation,"This analysis focuses on the original formulation of Dior Homme Parfum (DHP).

The scent profile is dark, floral, and leathery. Upon initial application, Dior Homme Parfum immediately presents itself as a dark, profound, and floral fragrance. The composition instantly conveys a sense of maturity and classic elegance.

The initial Iris opening is reminiscent of the make-up section of drugstores or perfumeries. The start is dominated by the characteristic, powdery Iris note of the Dior Homme house.

This initially ambivalent, floral impression quickly changes, however. The powdery texture serves to tame the scent and lend it a polished beauty before the deeper notes take over.

The central, dark, and present leather accord is the most important bearer of the composition. This deep leather provides the defining feeling of seriousness and composure. The fragrance prioritizes elegance and depth, without conveying a superficial impression of ""fun"" or ""lightness.""

The performance of this old DNA is particularly subtle. Immediately after application, the fragrance acts rather intimately and slowly builds its presence. It does not immediately seek the attention of the entire room.

The beauty and allure fully unfold in the drydown. Compliments slowly set in as one approaches the other person, which underscores its more elegant, mature effect.

The old DNA of Dior Homme Parfum is ideally suited for enthusiasts who wish to convey a classic, dark, and serious vibe. It is also for those who appreciate mature, deep leather fragrances that are not dominated by sweetness. Furthermore, it suits those seeking a scent signature that radiates seriousness and confident authority.

In comparison, the DNA of Dior Homme Intense is often perceived as more approachable and ""joyful,"" and is therefore better suited for younger or more carefree occasions."

Dior Homme Parfum,COMPLEX IRIS MASTERPIECE,"As an iris lover, I eagerly awaited the chance to try this perfume. Sadly, it wasn't available in the US, so I had to order all the way from Canada and wait weeks for it to arrive. But let me tell you, it was worth the wait.

This fragrance is complex and multifaceted. What appears to be a simple iris scent surprises me every time I catch its aroma, revealing new and different notes each time. At first, it opens with the vegetal and carrot-y undertones of iris, followed by slightly bitter powdery notes and suede. As it further unfurls, citrus and dark rose accords sweeten the blend.

Later, the base notes of cedar / sandalwood come into play, creating a light incense-y woody base, but the waxy iris remains the headliner. It's a playful scent with an elegant touch and signature-worthy flair. It has great performance and doesn't overpower its surroundings. Rather, it leaves behind an alluring diffusive trail.

If you're an iris lover looking for a woody powdery fragrance, this one is for you. Ladies can wear it, too."
Dior Homme Parfum,Beast Mode Lipstick Leather,"Moderately sweet powdery, waxy, lipsticky iris. I find this slightly woodier than Intense and more upfront with these woody notes, a smidge less sweet, and the added leather is a very gentle one. Soft and fuzzy like a suede, it sits beneath the iris boosting the powdery feel and adding just a touch of dark, mysterious, sensual masculinity. Like a tree stump dressed in a new leather jacket smeared with lipstick.

At the end of the day, as much as I love it, I think I still prefer Intense. I go in and out of appreciating the added depth that Parfum's leather provides versus disparaging the tempering of the iris, where with Intense I experience no such dilemma and simply love it 100% of the time. DHI is also perhaps more versatile because it's not as dark and rich, in addition to being more unisex. The performance difference is noticeable for me, though, with DHP having a massive advantage over the more mediocre-performing DHI. The initial spray is somewhat overwhelming and creates quite the opulent scent bubble, with strong projection for 4-5hr and 12hr+ longevity as a skin scent."

Dior Homme Parfum,Brilliant without arrogance,"Minefield… I won’t dwell on the extent of the damage caused by reformulations, discontinuations, replacements, etc. Do I appreciate this fragrance for what it is? I own 5 bottles. So yes. Would I spend the ridiculous sums asked by shady resellers? No, thank you.

As for the perfume itself: Dior could have stopped there, with the “parfum” version that closed the collection with seriousness, flair, elegance, and depth. All the qualities that define this fragrance. DHP is a leathery perfume, masculine without caricature, with iris, maybe rose (opinions differ; I only perceive some floral aspects), and woods, even animalic notes that add substance without provocation.

This fragrance is consensual without being easy, adored without falling into obsequiousness, brilliant without arrogance. Classic, did you say?

Also it has one of the best ""smells balancing"" of all around the world.

Truly unique. I find this fragrance very special and unlike any other in my collection. It's hard to find so I'm thrilled to own two 100 ml. bottles of it. I don't ever want to be without this one. Definitely in the top 5 of my entire collection. Perfection in a bottle! I love it!"
Dior Homme Intense,Not my cup of tea,"With winter approaching I've been on the lookout for a unique classy fragrance to standout on the cold winter nights. Read some good reviews about Dior Intense. But considering the price I decided to first venture to the local fragrance store to sample it. I have a decent collection of scents, maybe 15 to 20. So guess you could say I'm a fragrance junkie. But my approach is always to first sample a fragrance on my skin before spending hard earned cash. Sprayed about three whiffs of this highly rated parfum on my skin. Dear oh dear. It is certainly long lasting. And powdery as many reviews suggest. My disappointment is that after if i bought this i would be spending a load of cash on this to smell like a stronger version of Johnsons Baby Powder. The notes just get worse for me. I really wanted to like this scent. But just kept getting this annoying baby powder scent instead of a more masculine fragrance. Cannot understand the mega raves it gets. Maybe will try it on my skin again to decide. But for now i am yet to find a Parfum that wows me. Both Jaipur and this have not impressed. Gave my Jaipur Edp away as I could not stand the smell after two or three uses. They are built to last as a Parfum should. But the scents are too annoying for my liking and unique, yes, but not in a good way."
Dior Homme Intense,A Lil too much for me.....,"If I hadn't enjoyed the awesome blending and versatility of the Original edt , my thoughts on this would have been different from what I am going to write at the moment.
As a huge fan of Dior Homme 2005 , i was very excited when I received this as a gift , I must say its very nicely done with Iris and Vanilla(too much imo) but I badly miss the leather and cacao here which I got in original EDT, and that is the main difference I see between them , I just like it but dont know its a nose fatigue or something else , the over prevailing vanilla is not letting me enjoy the beautiful scent behind it.
Love the original which is far more better, masculine and very versatile piece of art if compared to this intense version."
Dior Homme Intense,Intense perfection,"As perfect as Dior Homme and heavily similar to it (no point in describing the notes again then): just deeper, probably with more iris, slightly darker, muskier, more powerful and with a bolder lasting on skin. Maybe slightly woodier too. Layering the two of them using Dior Homme Intense's drydown as a base for Dior Homme brought me this close to getting rid of 90% of the rest of my wardrobe. I am not familiar with the alleged variations among Dior Homme and Dior Homme Intense batches, all I know is that my 2014 bottle of the Intense is a glorious, delightfully non-redundant companion to its timeless brother.

Dior Homme Intense,"Three E's: Easy, Effeminate and Elegant.","After hearing about Dior Homme Intense, and consistently seeing it in the top 10 fragrances in Parfumo over the past few months, I bought a sample and wanted to know if it was worth the hype.

----

First, let us talk about the smell.

Dior Homme Intense is not a complex fragrance. It opens with a powdery floral that is almost certainly iris, which mixes with a light musky sweetness. Once the iris wears off, the cedar becomes more prominent and mixes with the musky sweetness that continues to linger.

Dior Homme Intense is an example of how simplicity can work in a fragrance.

One of the largest critiques about the smell is that Dior Homme Intense smells feminine, especially to men who grew up around women and know what lipstick sets smell like. Perhaps if the era was the mid-2000s or earlier, Dior Homme Intense would have a different name, and advertising would market toward women.

I strongly believe that women can easily wear this fragrance with zero problems. While cedar is considered more masculine, the iris and light musk is more prominent.

That said, the likely goal of Dior Homme Intense is to create the allure of an elegant gentleman that consistently has women around him so frequently, that they leave their scent on him. It succeeds, as the fragrance presents a captivating and alluring aura.

----

A 100 ml bottle of Dior Homme Intense has the traditional classy feel of a men’s fragrance.

A clear rectangular bottle with a translucent black cap is not exactly grand bottle artistry. However, the classic look is elegant, and will always look great on a dresser or on a display shelf, nor is the bottle embarrassing enough that one must hide it in a drawer, a closet, or inside the box.

----

In terms of performance, Dior Homme Intense is outstanding.

With projection, Dior Homme Intense hits a rare balance that is difficult to achieve. The overall projection is strong and noticeable, but the fragrance does not overwhelm everyone when in proximity, allowing for more people to move closer. Again, elegance without being overbearing or trying too hard.

In terms of longevity, two sprays of Dior Homme Intense last for about twelve hours, with the opening lasting for about three.

This is a fragrance that will follow a person throughout the day without a respray, but a person wearing it will not feel like they are drowning in it.

----

Thanks to the unique performance of Dior Homme Intense, it gains some flexibility that is difficult to achieve with fragrances that have strong projection, making it easier to wear.

As a result, it is usable throughout the year, with the only questionable time to use it is on a blazing summer day outside. (As musky smells can radiate in the heat.) Also, while Dior Homme Intense is fantastic in the fall and winter, I will go against the grain, and state that the fragrance easily shines the brightest in the spring.

As for social scenarios, Dior Homme Intense works in an office or school environment without annoying everyone and is usable daily.

On the negative side, the musky aspect may be too much for the gym, even if it is on the lighter side.

That said, ultimately, the best usage for Dior Homme Intense is as a nighttime fragrance (especially on a date night). While lightly sweet, it will stand out as unique because it is not the typical super-sweet fragrances that most people smell on men in 2022.

----

Overall, Dior Homme Intense is an outstanding fragrance and is mostly worth the hype it receives, and I bought a bottle after trying the sample. However, I highly recommend sampling first, as the critiques are valid, and the fragrance is not for everyone.

For example, someone looking for an artistic or complex fragrance to make a statement should look elsewhere. Likewise, someone who is looking for a more traditional masculine fragrance, or someone that hates powdery scents will be massively disappointed.

That said, Dior Homme Intense is best for people trying to be considerate of other people while having their own identity. They want a fragrance that projects, but do not choke out a room. They want a fragrance that stands out for going against the common trends, but also works in attracting positive attention. If this is you, you may like the results."
Dior Homme Intense,A Modern classic,"Finally, a fragrance that dares to be different—a vanillic, cocoa/orris floral for men that feels like a sigh of relief in today’s overly citrus-splashed lineup. And yes, it's absolutely worth the hype. Dang!

But let’s talk reformulation. I don’t usually get swept up in the drama, but this one threw me for a loop. My first encounter was with a 2015 version—a stunner with lush cocoa and ambrette seed that stole the spotlight, while iris and leather played a delicate supporting role. Smooth, seductive, unforgettable.

Then came a 2014 bottle. Totally different mood. Cocoa and ambrette take a backseat, easing in much later and far softer. Instead, iris and leather dominate with thick, buttery orris root and a nutty ambrette that's almost hazelnut-like, paired with suede. Musky, vanillic, and woody—feels deep, rich, and soulful.

Either way, I’m hooked. I lean slightly towards the 2015 for its velvet-smooth cocoa/orris elegance. But no matter the year, performance is top-tier—radiant projection, beautiful sillage, and longevity that just won't quit.

If you're even a little curious, go ahead and try it. You might just discover something unforgettable hiding in the drydown.

Dior Homme Intense,The first perfume I fell in love with before the niche world,"This is the perfume I would buy over and over again when it ran out for a whole decade until I was opened to the world of niche.

I can say that it is an amazing perfume for lovers of powdery iris scents.

And here comes the but, over the years this perfume simply declined in quality and began to disappoint me with weak and disappointing performances to the point that I started looking for other perfumes and so I entered the world of niche and later I also sold the bottle I had with a heavy heart.

In the first few years that I bought it, around 2012, this perfume would not come off me all day and leave an excellent SILLAGE behind and now this perfume evaporates from me after two or three hours after it is mostly close to the skin.

a big disappointment - but on the other hand, it opened the door to this huge world of perfumes for me and overall I am happy.

Thank you to Christine Dior for all the years and I will not buy this perfume again.

Previously: 10/10.
Currently: 7/10."
Dior Homme Intense,What do you think?,"There's a big debate about which current men's perfume is more feminine, or metrosexual? Thierry Mugler A*Man? Midnight in Paris? Or Dior Homme Intense? I understand that sometimes we don't notice a certain note. But in the case of the lipstick note in DHI, I think it's hopeless to want to ignore it. The discussion is just one piece of the puzzle that, once formed, paints a very complex picture of what the human psyche is, and the patterns dictated by fashion through the ages.

Dior Homme Intense, for me, opens with lavender, vanilla and iris. In this case, it is the Íris that conveys this idea of lipstick or makeup and draws the attention of those who smell DHI. Gradually, the iris becomes more intense and powdery. It gets hotter, sensual. About 1 or 2 hours later, the plot starts to get thicker and more mysterious. I don't know what notes form this impression, but my guess would be pear, vetiver and amber (which together with vanilla and iris, form a chocolate-like aroma). This phase lasts for a long time, until the emergence of the base notes (more woody). However, even in the end, DHI is a composition based on the iris, which in this last stage also resembles baby powder.

Despite being a really intense fragrance, the name is not just a pretext, as it sometimes happens. It's warm and sweet, I think 2 or 3 sprays can be enough to ""fill a room"". Dior Homme Intense is too good to be limited to just one station or geographic point.

The connoisseur of good perfumes, now that he knows and wears Dior Homme Intense, should take it a step further. Imagine DH or DHI alongside a more floral fragrance? It could be L'Eau d'Issey. A little more powdery iris. More vanilla and tonka. Some sandalwood and anise. It's not all of these together, but side by side, like faces of a cube, one of the faces being DH/DHI. So the question that doesn't want to be silent is: what is a woman's perfume and what is a man's perfume? Think Dior Homme Intense and be careful not to bite your tongue."
Dior Homme Intense,Story time.,"Wanted to review this one several times, and I thought to myself.. maybe I should tell a real life story which this fragrance is highly attached to for me. That haven't been said countless of times already.

I work in the music industry, and I often work with vocalists for various projects. One day I got sent a video of a young beautiful blonde haired woman singing by a friend, and he told me I should try to contact her.

Some time past and I was searching for a woman vocalist to sing on a project of mine, after searching for a bit, I suddenly remembered my friend sent me that video, and I decided to contact the vocalist. Our conversation quite quickly went in another direction than the project, also the first time I figured out there's a message size limit on Facebook's Messenger. Instantly a match between me and her.

One day we got the courage to meet up for the project, which ended out with anything else than that, obviously. We spend the whole night together, like we had knew each other for much longer, in a way where nothing felt awkward. She left early in the morning to go to work, and the first message I woke up to was, my perfume was stock in her head, she had never smelled anything like it, and every time she thought of the smell she was picturing me. I asked her if she liked it, or if it was just because I was wearing it, she said, the smell is good, but it's because you are wearing it.

Which means to me, unique scents might not get the mass appeal, but in reality you are not looking for the mass appeal, because when someone likes you, they will associate that smell with you.
In other words, the smell is a part of who you are to other people, which learned me an important lesson. If someone likes you, they will also like the perfume you like to wear, or at least associate it with you, and that is good.

And for those who are curious about the project, I did see her in a few months, and we never ended up doing any work together, I was still not done with my ex girlfriend, so it ended that way. And yes, I wonder how my life would had turned if I had dared to give that relation a chance. Today 3 years later, I'm single.

When I wear this today, I think of that whole story, and I remember it as one of the most alluring periods I ever experienced.

Thanks Homme Intense for taking part of that story, maybe someday we will take a re-match."
Dior Homme Intense,My favorite simple iris scent!,"Dior homme intense is my go to scent for a night out when i want people to notice my scent! It is a beautiful sweet, powdery iris scent which is really attractive and smells amazing. 3-5 sprays would be recommended by me for this scent. Love that Dior has provided many good sizes for this and i will fur sure get a larger size when i have finished my 50ml bottle!"
Dior Homme Intense,Signature Scent,The perfume is arguably most controversial in the world of perfumery. Some think it is more feminine while argue it’s unisex but in my opinion the perfume is really a masterpiece and very versatile. (Just breath and wear Dior homme intense in peace ) It’s smoky and powdery. The vanilla and Irish presence is obvious. the scent trail is also powerful. On many occasions...
Dior Homme Intense,One of the sexiest scents on a man,"I am usually not one to use ""sexy ""or ""panty droppers"" to qualify a scent. But in all honesty out of all the fragrances that I own (I own quite a few masculine scents) this is the one I prefer on my husband.

You smell that typical lipsticky iris DNA but also some dark almost chocolatey undertones. I love that clair obscur / chiaoscuro aspect. DHP one the contrary veers more on the darker sides which makes it less mass appealing. I still haven't smelled the 2025 reformulation."
Dior Homme Intense,Surprisingly seductive,"Honestly, I think that my favorite part is the opening 10-15 minutes with this fragrance. It’s just so layered and wonderful. To me, the opening beats out Dior Homme. That’s saying something, considering Dior Homme has become a staple in my rotation.

I’ve noted in subsequent comparisons between the two, that I enjoy Dior Homme more, overall. That being said, I will combine this two, and it’s essentially a 1A vs 1B scenario.

One of the main differences with Intense, is the lack of the leather note, when compared to the original. This is woodier, with a sweeter warmth.

The iris is still dominant, later on, but tempered when compared with Dior Homme. The lavender here, plays a pretty big role in how the iris gets to develop.

As it settles down, it draws more toward the powdery end of things, and there is definitely the cacao note that is found in the original Dior Homme lurking in this mixture.

It actually dries down into a rich, chocolate (somewhat vanilla) powder, gourmand and that’s how Intense separates itself from Dior Homme.

I get a fresh and semi-sweet fragrance, once it’s fully developed. This is all sitting on a dry base of cedar and vetiver. Powdery, clean, classy, and ."
Dior Homme Intense,THE BEST designer scent on the market.,"DHI is my first ever Dior perfume and my first bottle was purchased in 2011, since then I had three big 150ml bottles, this is the last one.

It has listed only 3 notes but it might also have a bit of sandalwood in the composition and something sweet: Florentine iris absolute, Ecuadorian ambrette seed, Virginia cedar

- When I first smelled this, over 12 years ago I fell in love with it instantly. This is a very complex and playful scent with an aura of mystery.
- The Iris is not feminine and the ambrette seed, which is a vegetal musk works wonders, it brings the imagination to life.
- The DHP is also very nice, but not as silky and playful as this one.
- It has a beautiful development, this is a bold scent which will fill a room. Since 2020 has a new package, but I think it is as great as before so no need to FOMO there for the older ones.

I think this will always stay into my collection, because it is complex, powdery, sweet but not gourmand and very manly. Plus the ladies like the lipstick smell of it, because it reminds them of their own make-up.

As a whole, this is a masterpiece from Master Demachy and most likely THE BEST designer scent on the market."
Dior Homme Intense,Signature Scent,"The perfume is arguably most controversial in the world of perfumery. Some think it is more feminine while argue it’s unisex but in my opinion the perfume is really a masterpiece and very versatile. (Just breath and wear Dior homme intense in peace )

It’s smoky and powdery. The vanilla and Irish presence is obvious. the scent trail is also powerful.

On many occasions wearing the perfume I get a lot of compliments and questions like what are you wearing and all. At some point I had to stop wearing as can be very addictive.

One of the most affordable complimented Dior fragrances.

3 to 4 spray will do all the magic you need all day as it last above 8 hours on skin and 24 hours on cloths."
Dior Homme Intense,New Era...,"Excellent by any measure. I simply cannot describe Intense by Dior using the usual descriptors(aromatic, floral, spicy, musky) because if I do…you will naturally seek to place this with other colognes in your experience. It is a very unique fragrance that is well suited for a mature gentleman.
D.H.Intense is noticed for its very pleasant & different smell. This is not overwhelming but give'em a hug or kiss on the cheek and listen for the ooh and aahs. A tiny spray has long legs. The lingering sent can last for days on your Blazer."
Dior Homme Intense,Alluring,This is my first review so please be gentle… Both my wife and I were searching for a nice perfume. I wasn’t really into this perfume thing so we had to rely on the shop assistant. The nice lady asked what we were looking for but she misunderstood. She thought we were looking for a fragrance we could both wear. So she came up with DHI. Alright.. I wasn’t really looking...
Dior Homme Intense,I simply don't like it,"I don't know why this fragrance is even rated that high, it reminds me of everytime i visited my grandma, that's because the scent is really powdery and mixed with a slight woody and spicy undertone. The smell of this particular perfume, feels really heavy and can be too much for some people. I recommend you not to exaggerate with the application.
At last i have to admit, that i am also no fan of most of the powdery fragrances, so if you like something in the general direction of powdery perfumes, you could try it out, but i really recommend you to apply it on your skin and let it develop for some hours."
Dior Homme Intense,Classic,"This is a smooth, warm, inviting, elegant masculine fragrance, despite the Iris note. In terms of when to wear it, it is ideal for colder weather and for more formal events, be they for business or pleasure. Gets lots of compliments and lasts well. If it were a piece of clothing, it would be a fine Italian suit, well tailored and not brash, but a head-turner and memorable nonetheless. The original version lasts longer than more recent iterations, but still a beautiful scent."
Dior Homme Intense,The Mighty DHI!,"Before I wrote this review, I took the time to think about if there was any other “bigger than life” fragrance that actually fulfilled customer and fragrance enthusiasts’ expectations as DHI did.

Rarely there are, few and usually released far between each other. I cannot tell you how much I’m happy when something creative as this gets deserved recognition while maintaining its lasting appeal.

One of my Holy Grail Scents, Homme Intense, regular Homme, and Homme Parfum have been with me during most of my fragrance journey.

TOP NOTES
this unique fragrance opens up with the aromas of powder, lipstick, makeup, aromatic herbs, and bitter citruses lurking in the background. The bitter bite combing from sage envelops the lavender, and amplifies it with the same bergamot found in the Dior Eau Sauvage Parfum 2017. Judging by the opening, you will be either disappointed or pleasantly surprised. Since we are already in the 2020s, this kind of semi-sweet, and powdery scents probably won’t shock you as they would back in the 2000s.

HEART NOTES
The scent warms up, the powdery iris overtakes almost everything experienced in the opening, and the fragrance starts to project even more. This note is present almost until the fragrance fades away from your skin. The genius move from Demachy to include this show-stealing Pear fruit is probably the sole reason why DHI is more popular than any other Dior Homme fragrance, and keeps the iris from never going fully into the feminine side.

BASE NOTES
One thing I wish it stayed longer would be the iris. By the time the fragrance reaches the dry down, the floral aspects are gone and don’t get me wrong the dry down remains great, but it would have been nice if that floral edginess stayed during the whole wake of the scent. The further DHI dries down, what is left is warm and musky vanilla with hints of chocolate, and is great.

Dior Homme Intense,Alluring,"This is my first review so please be gentle…

Alright.. I wasn’t really looking for a Homme fragrance for my wife but she sprayed it on her and.. boy does that smell good! Grassy but sweet! A very recognizable scent but I couldn’t quite make out what I smelled. Turned out it’s fresh carrots that it reminded me of (thanks @MrIDK :-)).

I told her we had to think about it but we kept smelling ourselves. It’s so good. Once the grassy opener dries off, it becomes a bit darker. But it keeps this high-acidity note to lure you in.

Oh by the way I bought it for my wife and indeed we can wear it both.

It lasts quite long, it doesn’t need lots of sprays, it’s one of the best smells I’ve ever smelled. For me this is a straight A."

Dior Homme Intense,Dior Homme Intense is a true masterpiece,"Every time I smell this/ wear it, I have a permanent smile that I just can't get rid of, it is a very sophisticated, sensual, sexy, high class scent that smells a million dollars.

This is the first fragrance I purchased on my fragrance journey that isn't the typical, cheaper side of the fragrance word.
I've bottles from 2012-2014 year with formula- 05443/A.
Dior fragrances are timeless. It's true that a lot of women ( If not all) love this fragrance, but i want to review it as a guy who doesn't wear fragrances just to please women.

A very similar fragrance to the Dior homme yet a lot darker, more ""velvety"" and smooth with a denser aura and a voluptuous and rich presence due to the prominent upgrade of the all so familiar and beloved iris, creamy cocoa & buttery vanilla combo. On top of that, DHI also smells woodier and softly leathery thus emitting a more masculine vibe than its predecessor. Very warm, very sexy, an excellent choice for nights out.

This fragrance is for intense men. You need a strong personality to pull this off. Even though now women are so used to it it doesn't turned them on anymore, you can still wear this fragrance and you will live a very memorable winter. Dior fragrance are all timeless classics.

Formulas:

1. Years 2007-2010: formula 03214/A
2. Years 2011-2014: formula 05443/A

Dior Homme Intense,,"This reformulation version seems to me somehow like a middle term between the two previous Dior Homme Concentrations, the EDT and the EDP Intense, in terms of how the scent develops on skin. It seems to rescue the powdery iris aspect of the EDT and to soften the vanillic drydown of the Intense turning it into something more woody (but not with not so much cedar as the original EDT seemed to be on my skin). With this, the Shalimar-like vanilla homage has gone alsmot completely, but the elegance is still here. It'd be very nice if they bring back the original intense formulation,reworked maybe in a pure parfum concentration."
Dior Homme Intense,Extraordinary!,"When it comes to sophisticated fragrances that exude elegance and masculinity, Dior Homme Intense by Dior is a true standout. This extraordinary scent is a captivating blend of luxurious ingredients that leaves a lasting impression wherever you go.

Upon the first spritz, the fragrance opens with a burst of citrusy freshness, primarily from notes of bergamot. This invigorating start effortlessly transitions into the heart of the fragrance, where the mesmerizing combo of lavender and iris takes center stage. The floral notes mingle beautifully, creating a harmonious and refined aura.

As the hours pass, Dior Homme Intense evolves into its enchanting base notes. The smooth, velvety cocoa note emerges, adding a touch of warmth and sensuality to the fragrance. The rich and creamy amber note enhances its depth, creating a captivating blend that commands attention. Together, these base notes create a comforting and irresistible allure that makes it perfect for romantic evenings or formal events.

What truly sets Dior Homme Intense apart is its impeccable longevity and sillage. This fragrance is a definite powerhouse, generously projecting its sophisticated essence for hours on end. It engulfs the wearer in an elegant cloud of scent that demands attention without being overpowering.

The versatility of Dior Homme Intense is another reason why it deserves all the accolades it receives. Suitable for both daytime and evening wear, this fragrance seamlessly transitions from professional settings to nights out on the town. Its alluring and refined composition effortlessly adapts to any occasion, making it a must-have in any fragrance collection.

Not only does Dior Homme Intense resonate with refinement, but it also evokes an air of confidence and charisma. It possesses an innate ability to instill a sense of self-assuredness in the wearer, complementing their style and enhancing their overall presence.

In conclusion, Dior Homme Intense by Dior is an exceptional fragrance that epitomizes class, refinement, and masculinity. Its intoxicating blend of citrus, lavender, iris, cocoa, and amber creates an alluring symphony that captivates all who encounter it. If you are in search of a fragrance that demands attention and exudes confidence, look no further than Dior Homme Intense; it is a true masterpiece that will never let you down."
Dior Homme Intense,CLASSIC SCENT,"After reading a lot of reviews and saw how this juice
was hyped i decided to blind buy it. And this was my
first designer perfume. At first spray i was unhappy at
the opening; i was expecting something ""wow""
considering all the hype it got. I put it up for sale the
following week, although I was still using it. I put it on
one evening for a party. And I got my first compliment
on a perfume. My friend told me “you smell so good, I
love this perfume”. I was glad at last; all hope wasn’t
lost after all.
So I thought this fragrance was meant for the evening,
especially when it’s cold and raining or on cold
mornings. At these times I still smell it on myself after
a couple of hours.
I also discovered my DHI didn’t perform so well when
it’s sunny and hot (Nigerian weather). So knew when
to use it or not. I finally settled for this masterpiece.
Nine months later am planning to get another bottle or
the parfum version.

SUMMARY: Soft and sweet, smells feminine in the beginning. But later the masculinity starts creeping in after an hour or so. It performs best in cold evenings and winter. It's suit and tie scent."
Dior Homme Intense,More like Intense headache.,"Everything about this perfume is mediocre. To the very last bit, last drop of it - I can't stand this smell so much.
Strong, smelly, discustingly smelly. One spray fills the entire apartment or house with it and you get to taste it on your tongue for the rest of the day!!!

What do you smell, once you apply it? That's right - nothing nice. Alchohol right away, followed up by maybe a slight hint of something powdery and sweet, but, no, excuse me, it aint no iris, alright.

The bottle is mediocre as well. Chunky lid, chunky square body. Amazing performance. How to make the most default, yet disgusting hand sanitizer? Yeah, ask Dior with this ""Homme INTENSE"" perfume. Horrendous."
Dior Homme Intense,Versatile Iris fragrance,"Starting off, many people think that this fragrance is reserved for dressing up or special occasions where you would wear a suit or to a work conference. But I personally think that this fragrance is more versatile than that. I live in a tropical city, and I find myself wearing this fragrance all times of the year except for summer. Surprisingly, this fragrance is light and..."
Dior Homme Intense,An Otherworldly Perfume.,"After a decant order full of stinkers, I had to revisit a true classic. This is one of the greatest perfumes in human history.

It’s powdery. It’s sophisticated. It’s sexy in a way no other scent quite achieves. I don’t know how to describe it other than it smells like the bottom of your grandma’s makeup bag. And I mean that in the best, most beautiful way possible. The iris note is unmatched.

I can reminisce over so many memories with friends by smelling this perfume. Oh, how I miss them. It's so wholesome yet emotional for me. It’s attached to memories I’ll never want to forget, which just makes it more special for me.

This is not a casual wear scent. This is for occasions. It projects like a monster and sticks to your skin forever. It’s unforgettable.

One of the highest-rated perfumes on this site for a reason, and rightfully so. I pray this scent never gets discontinued.
I’ll never get bored of it."
Dior Homme Intense,Simply one of the best of all time,"The pre 2025 formulation. Simply one of the very best, even compared to much more expansive niche.

Sophisticated, complex yet simple, addicting, intoxicating, yet very explicit in its subtelty. Smells high quality and luxorious, especialy for its price. Maybe one of the best deals in the world of perfumery. You get a straight up masterpiece for the money of a mere designer.

How lucky I feel having gotten one of the last pre 2025 bottles as I believe they reformulated it a little bit, making it just a bit less complex, dumped it down a tiny notch just enough for it to lose its whispering treasure. What a horrible crime.

And as Dior Homme Parfum (2014) is just as much of an absolute masterpiece, for my personal taste the intense is enough. The intense is all I need in the space of iris perfection. The parfum is stellar, more complex, more deep, richer and probably one of the very best of rose perfumes, but for me it is just too much of it. Thus, I prefer the simpler, straighter to the point flowery genius of the intense.

François Demachy I solute you and your immense genius. You defined a generation of perfumery. What a tragic letting you go. May another virtuoso take your place. May there be another day.

God bless."
Dior Homme Intense,Stunning,"I just bought a newer bottle of DHI, and it seems much weaker than earlier formulations that I also have. Anyone else notice a difference? I sure do.

This is one of the best modern mens fragrances. The iris dominates throughout, and a powdery undertone anchored with smoky wood notes make it irresistible. Every single time I’ve ever worn this I’ve had compliments and questions. This is for the confident man, as the powdery iris notes are very sweet. Go easy with this one, 3-4 sprays is all you need for all day. I’ve washed some shirts 2-3 times and can still smell this on them. Even on days when I don’t wear this, I will still pick it up and take a deep satisfying whiff."
Dior Homme Intense,Doubtful,"Don't understand the hype about Dior Homme Intense. It's not bad, but also not great. It's a fragrance only for the fall / winter.

But I personally think that this fragrance is more versatile than that. I live in a tropical city, and I find myself wearing this fragrance all times of the year except for summer. Surprisingly, this fragrance is light and airy enough to support its seasonal versatility. While you can wear this to work I also think this is a great fragrance to wear on casual occasions, dates, and even to sleep (only one or two sprays sleeping). It's such a soothing smell that is sweet, airy, and floral with the Iris. Performance is what you would expect from a extreme Eau de Parfum. Only slightly less versatile than the Eau de Toilette. 9/10"

Dior Homme Intense,Safe buy,"A very simple scent which seems complex as you wear it.
I always admire great PERFUMERS and Francois is one of them. I can't remember how many compliments I get when I wear this, IDK if it's me or what but this is one of the perfume I never got Nose Blindness from. A very well balanced perfume for Date night and bit cold weather.
Might hit you hard during summer."
Dior Homme Intense,A gentlemanly woody iris that remains timeless,"Dior Homme Intense is a classic masterpiece from Dior and its then creative director Francois Demachy. The current version dates from 2011, though there was a previous version (2007) that looks very similar. It is versatile perfume with a distinct set of notes, well worth the adulation it receives. Though Dior Homme Intense is overhyped on various forums, the opposite reactions of disgust and animosity are unfair to a perfume so simple and elegant. Perhaps this ire is directed to every popular perfume sold in a department store. I have had a full bottle for many years now, bought from Jomashop for $118.

This version from 2011 is impressive for its simplicity. Demachy uses three key notes in the olfactory pyramid: iris from Florentine iris absolute, ambrette seeds and cedar. It is possible that you may detect many other minor notes, if you smell this perfume harder. But for the most part, it is an olfactory pyramid with the three aforementioned notes. I perceive the olfactory pyramid as starting with iris and a less dominant ambrette seeds note, with the ambrette seeds becoming dominant in the heart notes. Both these notes settle down in the bottom, with cedar becoming more evident in the end. The base notes and dry down are sweeter than pure cedar, with minor nuances of tonka and/or vanilla. This is all I need to say about the contour of the Dior Homme Intense. I do not detect any bergamot, pear, lavender or vetiver in Dior Homme Intense, not even a touch.

The performance of Dior Homme Intense is excellent, with my skin retaining the woody notes even after ten hours. The iris-ambrette heart notes last for 6-8 hours on my skin. Sillage is good for a few hours, detectable in the wake of the user. It can be used as an office perfume, if sprayed with discretion two hours in advance.

Dior Homme Intense is a little pricey for a mass-market fragrance. Many men’s perfumes that occupy the same niche sell for a third less. This includes Dolce & Gabbana The One, Guerlain L’Homme Ideal and Gaultier Le Male Le Parfum. I would still recommend Dior Homme Intense if you can afford it. Dior Homme Intense leads this men’s group, while maintaining its user-friendly versatility and gentlemanly grace."
Dior Homme Intense,Evening or special events,I first smelled Dior Homme Intense when a friend wore it to dinner. The opening was very smooth with iris and lavender. After some time it became warmer with cacao and amber. It feels elegant and a bit romantic. I wore it later myself on a date and it worked perfectly because it stays close but lasts many hours. For me it is a perfume for evenings or special events.
Dior Homme Intense,Divine Iris Bomb,"Slightly powdery, and maybe I just don't know what iris is supposed to smell like but I feel like I get a lot of lavender here along with it? I know what lavender smells like, and this smells like lavender, but I imagine it's kinda like combining tonka + vanilla where they smell similar and amplify one another.

Anyway, a pear accord adds a bit of sweetness but is otherwise only noticed if I go looking for it. It kinda makes me think of a more floral Prada L'Homme, something that's actually reasonably safe and versatile. Prada if the iris never turned soapy in the drydown. DHI didn't grab me at first, I wasn't as wowed as the hype made me expect, but the drydown... oh my. It gets sweeter and a woodiness/mossiness comes in that blends with the top notes in the absolute best way possible. This is right at the top of my list of favorite scents, and honestly I think it's more versatile than the consensus. I just imagine you'd go lighter on the sprays so it's not cloying in hot weather, else it's a fairly inoffensive sweet woody floral that's never too out of place in any circumstance.

Performance is average with 2-3hr of moderate projection and 8-10hr longevity. As an American, I should also be thankful that it's significantly easier to purchase than both Dior Homme Original (aka 2011) and Parfum."
Dior Homme Intense,dior homme intense,what a wonderful perfume. i have a 100 ml of it and just after a week of smelling it i decide to buy another bottle and now i have a 100 and a 150 ml of this perfume !.some of my friends said that it was great before 2013 i don't know but i believe i will buy dior again and again :).
Dior Homme Intense,Marketing tactics are a strange thing,"Dior Homme Intense seems to be quite the example of how marketing tactics can shape the way we view a fragrance.

For starters, Dior only claims that there are three notes here, but in reality this fragrance is far deeper than that. Second, this fragrance could easily be a..."
Dior Homme Intense,Sweet iris,"Iris, woody, and musky from the ambrette. I wish the aromatic aspects in the opening lasted longer, as the drydown, while beautiful, becomes too monotonously sweet and powdery for my tastes. As such, I find too few occasions to wear it. It feels like the kind of scent that is very formal but more well suited to a younger man, as the sweetness is reminiscent of so many other..."

If you are bothered to read the review, I have told the whole truth in the previous..."
Dior Homme Intense,Bedtime lullaby?,"This perfume comes with a lot of hype so when the opportunity came for me to get my hands on a bottle I jumped on it right away. I had never put my nose on it so I patiently waited for it to arrive in the mail. I had seen people rave about this as a very sexy seductive date scent which I could not wait to spray it on myself before my next date night with my lady. It finally arrived, I opened the box sprayed it and waited 30 min and remember saying out loud ""Is this it, is this the masterpiece everyone raves about?"". I expected a WHOLE lot more character, maybe I'm being unfair since I had such high expectations based on others reactions. As for the scent itself is actually really nice. I get the iris lip-sticky note at the top and it's quite pleasing. Lavender follows giving it a bit of freshness and the dry-down is quite powdery. I do get and dark-ish kind of insense note which I do enjoy although it is very subtle. The scent itself is an 8 in my opinion now the performance is another story. This is very soft projecting and does not last on my skin at all. I get maybe and hour of soft projection and 5 hours of longevity. I have yet to try this in cooler weather and have only worn it in Florida summer heat which maybe is affecting the performance a bit. I wore it yesterday for lunch and drinks and spent quite a bit of time outside and it was jot cloying at all. After 3 hours it was a skin scent and although my lady enjoyed it she could hardly perceive it at all sitting right next to me. Odd enough this is a lovely and relaxing scent for bedtime wear."
Fahrenheit,Volatile Energy,"Every time I wear Fahrenheit (which is only about 3 times a year) I think ""why do you wear this one so infrequently?"". It's fabulous, gives me a boost of energy and makes me feel like a guy ... a gay one, but a guy nonetheless :).

This fragrance brings back memories of Fashion College in 1989. I fell in love with two fragrances that year ... this one and Lauder for Men. The reason was that my mentor and teacher wore them ... and when I say WORE them I sincerely mean it! These were the days of your sillage arriving ten minutes before you did, and fragrance was worn as a status symbol. I was a starving student in those days :) and couldn't afford to wear Fahrenheit myself, but I would hurry to catch my teacher in the elevator and bask in the waves coming off him! I bought my own bottle some years later ... and somehow infected all of the menfolk in my family with it :) ... It's remains my father's 'go to' evening frag and my brother and brother-in-law still each get a bottle for Christmas.

Despite the long list of notes, Fahrenheit plays it really cool and invigorating on my skin. The citruses up top burst like opening pods of cotton for the longest time, remarkably carrying their freshness all the way through to deep dry down. It is, however, the Cedar here which is my best friend ... and undoubtedly sparked my interest in this note. I love a good Cedar ... I'm always on the lookout for them. I don't get much in the way of florals except for a faint sweetness ... while the Patchouli in the base finally takes over but is smoothed beautifully by the Amber and Tonka.

I've read some wildly varying reviews on this one ... reminding some of everything from gasoline to greasy car workshops :). Fahrenheit displays none of these antics on me ... It's always reminded me of snappily dressed gay men from a time when we recognized each other by our smell!"
Fahrenheit,CLASSIC,"Fahrenheit edt is a classic perfume that was released in 1988. For me it is one of the most masculine scents I can imagine. Every time I wear it I get nostalgic and think about my youth growing up in the 80's and 90's.
The mix of notes does bring a gasoline vibe. Violet leaf, leather lavender and citrus. Just a great scent you either love or hate. For me it is pure love. Especially the older bottles. Go get a bottle from before 2002 if possible. They really don't make them like that anymore."
Fahrenheit,Fahrenheit,"Fahrenheit hit in 1988 and was an instantaneous commercial success. It was a bold scent, innovative in concept and execution and was immediately recognizable as something new. It might have been developed using the framework of the fougère, but unlike the other massive launch of the year, Cool Water, it bore little resemblance to the genre. Fahrenheit’s infamous gasoline note gave it an edginess that separated it from other masculine fragrances. 1988 was effectively pre-niche and unorthodox perfumes were rare. Dior bet that there was an unmet demand for a fragrance that didn’t play by the ‘normal’ rules of scent. The combination of gasoline and dehydrated sweetness gave Fahrenheit a deliberately synthetic appearance and distanced it from the fougères and woody chypres that were still the norm for masculine fragrances. The olfactory image of gasoline is convincing. The dryness of woods and the coolness of the violet leaf suggest volatility, like drops of gasoline evaporating from your skin.

To Dior’s credit, they didn’t simply take a traditional perfume and dress it out with ‘avant-garde’ images and a trendy ad campaign. They created a straight-up oddball that didn’t fit easily into existing categories. What’s interesting, though, is that while Fahrenheit was groundbreaking, it wasn’t without precedent. Dior seem to have learned from a few great masculine fragrances of the prior dozen years. The pressurized hiss of violet leaf is a nod to Grey Flannel and the aggressively dry woods are reminiscent of Antaeus. The last piece in the puzzle comes from perfumer Jean-louis Sieuzac himself. Two years before he co-authored Fahrenheit for Dior, Sieuzac composed Hermès Bel Ami, a sumptuous leather chypre with a noticeable whiff of gasoline. He isolated the gasoline note and amplified it to form the basis of Fahrenheit.

Fahrenheit juggled offbeat style and mainstream PR and production streams with remarkable success. Take a look at a network sit-com or an action movie from 1988. Or a fashion magazine. Listen to some 1988 pop music. Most of it doesn’t hold up very well. (see above.) Fahrenheit on the other hand might come off as era-specific, but not dated. It has survived reformulation, the vagaries of trend and an increasingly competitive market yet remains distinctive."
Fahrenheit,A friend I've never missed...,"Back in 1988 I was a poor student, and for your information, while the noun is long gone, the adjective still remains. So when I managed to save enough money and buy a gorgeous heavy woolen jacket, I was more than happy to take a long walk downtown and enjoy its comfort, warmth and quality. It was a couple of days before Christmas, and along with a blissful pixie who pretended to be my human girlfriend, we thought it would be a good idea to test some fragrances, and perhaps get a couple of free miniatures. I have to clarify to younger readers that back then most perfume samples were miniature bottles, and not the bland plain vials that they are nowadays. Truth be told, I was looking forward to return home and spray my new jacket with a generous dose of Davidoff by Davidoff, and turn it into my signature jacket soused in my then signature perfume. But what harm could a little window shopping do? So, I, armed with a brand new '80s jacket (which would be thought a curio today) and she, armed with the obligatory '80s perm, headed for the cosmetics stores.
Grave mistake...
A sales assistant who was lurking by the door and surely was a faster shooter than Billy the Kid, managed to shoot three huge sprays of something that nearly knocked me off my feet on my jacket, in less than a second. If she was holding a gun instead of a huge bottle of the most potent and fresh Fahrenheit ever imagined in her hands, I'd be dead before hitting the ground. And I have no doubts that had I tried to duck her attack, she wouldn't hesitate to spray me square in the face, if it had come her way.
I shook the impulse to strangle the harpy on the spot and search for a dry cleaner in the next 20 seconds, and proceeded with our perfume testing.
And then the horror begun...
For the next four months or so, every time I'd put my jacket on, I smelled like someone who was working in a car repair shop or a gas station, although if this was the case, I would be the swankest car repair shop or gas station employee ever.
And to add insult to injury, can you imagine what were the only miniatures that we were given in the end? Yeah, you got it right...
...
Fahrenheit is a heavy scent. A very heavy scent. And of course I'm not talking about its potence in aromatic terms only. Even though it's a prolific scorer in the fields of sillage and longevity (the vintage one at least), it's mainly a very serious player in the field that produces legend material.
I have to admit that Fahrenheit is an incomprehensible scent to me.
Peppery notes, but no pepper! Perhaps it's a dirty trick played by some strange reaction between leather and nutmeg. Since I can't point at any other notes and consider them the culprits for this elusive accord, these two have to be the ones responsible.
And then there's this strange, unique and unequalled (but not necessarily nice) accord, which I'm completely incompetent to decipher and therefore to describe it. Not in an satisfying degree at least.
But perhaps it's worth giving it a try.
Since my nose is no big deal, I rarely talk about notes in my reviews. However, Fahrenheit has kept me wondering since 1988 about this ""What the hell am I smelling here Christian?"" stuff.
The fragrance has three hesperidic notes (Is ""hesperidic"" a valid word? Internet has not decided yet, so I apologise in advance for the possible barbarism.)
Well, I don't smell them.
It also has five sweet flowery notes.
I don't smell them either.
So, according to their absence of prominence, none of this eight notes is directly responsible for Fahrenheit's distinctive and unforgettable drydown.
So what is it?
I say that it smells like gasoline soaked sandalwood, that someone was crazy enough to set it on fire, and then put the cinders in the inside pocket of an old leather jacket, which he then wears after the gym and without showering first.
And before extolling my imagination... I've done it...
But it just made the whole thing even trickier, because it added a slight cummin note, and cummin is not included in the scent's pyramid. So, what I finally got with my ""analysis"" was a hint of something that shouldn't be there at all. Very helping...
I could also say that it smells the way some old taxis used to smell back in the '70s, but maybe my mind is playing tricks, trying to place the leather and diesel/gasoline/kerosene/motor oil notes to a matching vessel. However, I can see some connection here, since I believe that if we ask ten people how the inside of a brand new or a very old car smells like, five of them will say that it smells of leather, the other five that it smells of fuel, and all ten of them that it smells of Fahrenheit.
But maybe it's these very same oddities about it, which render Fahrenheit one of the few instantly recognizable fragrances in my book.
I have no idea how the current formulation smells like, and to be honest I don't care. I don't love and I don't hate Fahrenheit. For me it's a perfect example of uniqueness and an unparalleled specimen of aweless perfumery, but I'm still unable to decide whether this example is a paragon or a byword, and whether Fahrenheit's universe and mine are any parallel at all. But my personal likings have nothing to do with the objective stature of the fragrance. Fahrenheit has become a cornerstone and a legend over the years, and it doesn't give a damn if I like it or not. It's just there, too busy being itself."
Fahrenheit,FAHRENHEIT - SMELL OF GASOLINE!!,"A classic. Masculine confidence in a bottle. How your dad smelled in the 80s.

I think every guy owes it to himself to try Fahrenheit on for size - see how it works for you. It can definitely be the 'alpha Wall Street / Corporate bro who time traveled from 1989' vibe if you want it to be. A date or office staple for the mature man.

But it can also be 'young, sleeveless t-shirt, cutoff shorts, tan, speeding in a '87 Camaro in the July heat to 7-Eleven to pick up a slushee, sitting next to a pretty girl who smells like vanilla and coconut and laughs every time you gas it at a yellow light'. Basically, a sexy, young Boomhauer from 'King of the Hill' (with or without the heavy accent, your choice).

It's what I'd assume going to Reno with your best buds in that city's 80s heyday would smell like. It's rowdy and boisterous and sexy. It's classy, masculine but ALSO a bit campy and playful. It's the best attributes of testosterone, bottled. It takes confidence to wear, but can also inspire confidence in the man who wears it. It's for a man who hates (or wants to take a break from) modern men's fragrances.

Guys, go for it. See where it takes you. I can't imagine a well-rounded fragrance collection that doesn't include this absolute mad lad of a scent."
Fahrenheit,Timeless Classic,"In 1988 Dior decided to break the mould in terms of men's fragrances and decided to go in a different direction, by turning the established system on it's head. What they managed to create was something entirely unique (even today). They succeeded in creating a truly remarkable and very masculine floral (by using violet, nutmeg, carnation, and a lot of leather).

The result? Something which smells beautifully modern even today. In a word - timeless.

I believe that years later Dior would turn the world of male perfumes on it's head for a second time (with their metrosexual floral leather release 'Dior Homme'). However for many people, this is considered their best masculine and I think it's one of the most unique designer masculine fragrances ever created.

Instead of the Leather-Iris combination used in Dior Homme, here it's Leather and Violet, a pairing which gives off what many people term ""sweet motor oil"".

Before actually wearing this on my skin, I tried the luxury 'soap' of this for years, never finally wearing the fragrance itself until now. To me this can't be categorised purely by a ""gasoline"" smell (and I happen to like the smell of petrol). To me, this fragrance smells like an incredibly clean version of petroleum. Imagine a mechanic who after working a long day with the car grease and motor oil, then decided to take a really good bath or shower with luxury, high-quality soap. After he's finished, he smells clean and fragrant, but the original petrol note is under all the soap, and because of this, now starts to smell ""clean"" as well. Of course this is also a perfectly blended fragrance, and you'll struggle to put your finger on why exactly this smells as good as it does. The combination of violet leaf, leather, nutmeg, musk, geranium, lavender and carnation makes this extremely masculine. However it could be worn very well by a woman because it's also sweet at the same time. It's addictive!

I think the marketing concept of Fahrenheit was a perfume of contrasts. Specifically Hot and Cold, or ""Fire and Ice"". Fahrenheit is a measurement of temperature, and as a result applies to burning, boiling heat and also icy cold. As an olfactory sensation, Fahrenheit straddles the line between these two extremes, and does it beautifully.

I will say that this smells just as modern as it ever did 25 years ago, and could easily be released today and go on to be a number one hit. It's unique, nothing out there smells like it. It's not like Cool Water (also released in 1988), which went on to spawn the aquatic craze of the 1990's, and as a result is starting to smell a little dated by today's standards.

This has lost none of it's originality. It is well worth it's reputation. I believe that it can be worn by almost anyone and in any season. It needs no introduction. It is what it is (even in our time)... original, unique, & unmistakably beautiful!"
Fahrenheit,Nothing Else Quite Like It...,"Count me in the love camp for vintage Fahrenheit. I do get the violet driven gasoline note mentioned by others, but to me that is just fine, as I like that smell. I also get leather and woody cedar. The bottom line is this scent is a classic and entirely unique. Somewhat difficult to wear publicly, but highly enjoyable and noteworthy for it's distinctiveness and innovation. 4 to 4.5 stars out of 5."
Fahrenheit,Billy Bob Thornton in Oliver Stone's film U-Turn,"With Dior's FAHRENHEIT, I've finally met my match: a made-for-men fragrance that I would not choose to wear under any conceivable circumstance in this or any other possible world.

But, to be honest, I also would not recommend FAHRENHEIT to any man who was not deliberately, intentionally, consciously seeking out a scent that mimicked perfectly the odor of a mechanic who has not showered in three days. We're talking Billy Bob Thornton in Oliver Stone's film U-TURN. No joke. Is dirty black automobile grease mixed with sweat a sought-after masculine smell? Well, that's what overwhelms in the opening and persists through to the finish with FAHRENHEIT. Not a scent that I myself find pleasure in wearing or would find attractive on anyone else!

However, those who like this scent will be pleased to know that FAHRENHEIT has frightfully good staying power and sillage!"
Fahrenheit,Refreshing and complex.,"Fahrenheit wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be. It is definitely masculine, I wore this fragrance for a whole day and it just didn't feel right on my skin.

To my nose, Fahrenheit is a combination of watery woods and a touch of spice. The scent is quite recognizable, I have smelt this on strangers quite a few times in my life.

Some mention a petrol type note, and while I can see what they mean, it isn't as strong as what some people make it out to be. Fahrenheit smells gutsy and daring in a way. I would most likely recommend this fragrance for older men. It doesn't radiate a sense of youth for me at all.

The sillage of this particular fragrance is quite incredible, as is the lasting strength. I sprayed this fragrance once on my wrist, and for the next six hours, Fahrenheit enveloped me in a cloud of its scent.

I personally don't find this fragrance sexy, however I do find it refreshingly masculine. Thankfully this fragrance goes on smooth rather than bold and/or cloying. I feel that this kind of fragrance would really suit those clean-cut, somewhat conservative and goal-orientated men."

Fahrenheit,Unique and masculine,"I don't know what formulation i have (i purchased in 2011 aprox). It's a nice, manly, strong and unsual scent.

PROS:
- It's a classic.
- Very different (in a good way) to the other fragrances.
- Projects and last a lot.
- Masculine

CONS:
- If over apply, can offend to somebody

For me, it's a must have. Definitly worth the try.

There is a rumour that Michel Almairac helped him with this one. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful sexy Violet. I have a 2002 bottle and it is different from the newer bottles, which I had too. It starts off very green and gasoline-like. It turns more woodier as time goes by. Nutmeg is very strong but I smell more nutmeg on the newer versions, actually. There's some florals too, just to harmonize this almost boozy concoction. It's super unique and very masculine but I don't find it mature at all. I could live only with this fragrance and would be fine to me. The newer batches don't have great performance but it's still good and overall it's a relevant fragrance and a must have! A masterpiece with a unique vibe.

Fahrenheit,Why Dior?,"I never had the chance to smell the original formulations of Fahrenheit but what I smelled today was certainly watered down. Since Apple got away with selling phones without 3.5mm headphones inputs while asking you to pay a $30 to afford an adapter to use headphones, I knew the tech industry was going down an insidious path. The same sales strategy has made it to perfume. The reformulation I smelled today was a skin scent within a few minutes on a fresh nose. You have to spend more money on the newer parfum to get proper arm's length sillage. I suspect this reformulation happened around the time Dior released the parfum. There are Parfums now that get over powered by EDTs of the 80's-00's. What is happening in the perfume industry? I was excited to smell the EDT today but dumbfounded as it faded from my skin.
The scent: Yes, there is a hint of petrol in the first few seconds (an interesting combination of citrus) on the opening but this goes away quickly revealing the beautiful heart of violet. Most violet scents smell fresh, cool, and metallic like but the violets are contrasted with warm amber that is then intensified with the subtle spice of cedar and the leather accord, creamy sandalwood, and tonka bean. This is a beautiful balancing act. It's nice. I'm sad that I can't smell the original strength EDT. To put it in perspective, the fragrance lasted as long as D&G The One edt does and had less staying power than YSL La Nuit D'Lomme. You need to pay the premium and upgrade to Fahrenheit Parfum. I don't have kind words to say about Dior for making the Edt so weak just to make the parfum better. Demachy is a perfumer I both hate and respect. I will only ever buy the highest concentrations of Dior products from now on because they're only as strong as their 90's edt's. I love the scent but it didn't stay around long enough to really enjoy. The parfum is still radiating from my other arm. Ah the parfum is heaven. I suspect Demachy let his ego get the best of him and he ruined the original formulation to make his the better one. Sound familiar... Apple, Tim Cook anyone?"
Fahrenheit,Let the Games Begin,"Fahrenheit, much like a prized vintage wine, is a timeless creation. It is meticulously blended with select ingredients and crafted with passion. As its complex blend of notes unfold with depth and character, it stirs the senses. It almost certainly leaves me magnetized and is the only male fragrance on this planet (to date) that can put me in what can only be described as a trance-like state. A whiff of this fragrance, just like a sip of good wine, transports me to a specific moment, place and time in an instant, evoking sweet nostalgia and sophistication. Fahrenheit is nothing short of a masterpiece, intricately layered and deeply personal inviting you to savor its evanescent appeal. It is the male counterpart to Poison EAU DE TOILETTE , another powerhouse from the 80s, and my favorite female perfume. It is no surprise they happen to both be Dior creations. What follows is a review of the vintage formula.

The experience begins with the design of the bottle. A brilliant concept reminiscent of an abstract thermometer, it subliminally makes one feel like the temperature is rising, which is exactly what it does to unsuspecting women caught in its redolent web of fumes, like prey ensnared by a spider’s delicate strands. The liquid inside the bottle is a magic potion. It’s as if the makers at Dior managed to capture or rather extract the male pheromone and market it as an elixir of pure virility, rugged and raw, the embodiment of primal manliness.

Of the many notes detected in the opening, the heart and the dry-down it is the combination of three specific aromatic details that give it its distinct profile: gasoline, leather and cucumber. This trinity creates Fahrenheit’s captivating spell, endowing the wearer with supernatural powers to lure and seduce the object of his desire. I envision a confident man with a strong sex drive who pursues whoever strikes his fancy with feverish passion and conquers. Make no mistake, pursuit is the name of the game and the roles are clearly defined here; he is the dominant one and she the submissive. He is the hunter she is the hunted. The scent trail is both commanding and intimate, leaving an unforgettable impression, elevating the wearer to an almost divine status.

The strength of this fragrance’s enduring legacy can be attested to the fact that I am writing this review off memory that goes back over a decade, because it has been that long since I have smelled this on a man. I would never dare to wear this cologne myself; it would be sacrilege for a woman to do so. I do confess to occasionally spraying it on my bed sheets. It’s not the same but it does the trick. Fahrenheit is a scent that burns hot and lingers long. Highly recommended for those who relish their untamed masculine wiles and wear their passion on their sleeve."

Good people, the perfume appeared in 1988, it's exactly 35 years, what do you expect from a perfume that has been on the market for 35 years?
Understand that perfumes, along with people and times, change, more or less.
Fahrenheit is not mocked, but rather its formula has been stabilized, keeping and reproducing excellently the unique petroleum/gasolifer accord and that unique violet combined with galbanum, leather, labdanum and other greens, is as present and timeless as can be!
Fahrenheit will always be produced, as long as the house of Dior exists, and I feel proud to wear it and love it for so many years!"

Haha!

Some reviewers claim this is the ultimate sexy leather for a rugged man. I disagree — it’s more unisex, and those white florals give off serious dated vibes (no offense). There’s nothing rugged about this, at least to me. It is almost elegant with its subtle floral nuances. I got a free bottle with a bundle purchase, and it’s absolutely repulsive. I can’t imagine letting any man in my life smell like dusty cucumbers and shy violets. Maybe Ray Bradbury’s futuristic firemen need a new job — like burning this perfume!"

But I think most people are interested in these two so I want to offer some insights on which one you should buy and if you have one should you go for the other

for convenience sake, OL is ombre leather and FH is Fahrenheit

The overall experience of OL is a black, rough leather. Imagine some raw hide that has just been processed out of factory and ready to be used for whatever purposes. They have a certain chemical rough smell to them that is well... leathery. And they are not flexible at all. OL also seems more linear to me, after the opening slightly jasmine and fruit smell for less than 10 sec it jumps straight into that fresh raw rough leather smell and it stays like that.

FH on the other hand, smells more complex, much more complex. after the opening of fresh violet leaf ozonic airyness, I can detect chamomile, nutmeg and some floral green sweetness. The leather in FH is soft, supple, and reminds me much more of the texture of a woman's leather glove. or that from a vintage sports car where the leather has been weathered so much that they are very soft and flexible.

Which one I like better? I like FH better because it's more interesting to me. in a sense, it is less rough/masculine than OL but OL gives off a vibe that is very biker like.

If you are a student of leather frags, please do buy both. For mass appeal, I'd recommend FH. For those who want the most authentic leather smell, go for OL.

Neither smells...elegant per se.. but the impression of FH is more acceptable in business settings IMO.
If you are a biker at heart or a fan of PURE LEATHER smell, OL would do you better

in terms of wearability, FH>OL. FH has more freshness so in the summer it's also wearable. Additionally, the new batches of FH have great performance and is more bang for buck"

But let’s get to the good stuff—how did Fahrenheit end up with that unmistakable “gasoline” smell? Well, if legend is to be believed, it was a complete fluke. [Shoutout to prolific perfume critic Varanis Ridari for this story.] According to the lore, three perfumers—Michael Almairac, Maurice Roger, and Jean-Louis Sieuzac—were all competing to create Dior’s next big men’s fragrance. One by one, their ideas were shot down. Frustrated, they dumped their rejected samples in the same trash bin outside Dior HQ, where the sun went to work on the mess. By the time someone happened upon it later, the discarded juices had blended and baked into something strangely captivating. Dior’s team took a sample, had it analyzed, and boom—Fahrenheit was born.

Of course, the real explanation is a bit less chaotic. The signature petrol vibe comes from a potent mix of leather and violet, with the latter being the main reason Fahrenheit’s opening smells like racing diesel fuel. Here, I’m definitely reminded of Sieuzac’s Or Black (Pascal Morabito, 1981; reformulated in 2014), with its use of violet and its dark, dry, green profile. It makes sense that it’s often thought of as a Fahrenheit precursor. But I digress.

Because the original formula supposedly contained bits and pieces of multiple abandoned compositions, there’s an unpredictable, almost alchemical quality to it that makes it tough to pin down. The rest of the scent is a pure late-80s power move: a bold floral-heavy leather structure that came just before the world went nuts for aquatics. Somehow, it dodged extinction and remains one of the few fragrances of its era still in production.

Why? Because it plays by its own rules. Its unisex florals, smoky leather, and unforgettable opening have made it iconic. But let’s be honest—if bold, green florals and rugged leather aren’t your thing, Fahrenheit won’t try to convince you. It’s not here to please everyone; it just waits for the right person to get it."

Fahrenheit,The Elixir For The Upper Crust,"Dior Fahrenheit made its debut during the late Eighties, the decade defined by great scents with bold personalities that took risks. For instance, think of Davidoff Cool Water, Yves Saint Laurent Kouros, and Chanel Antaeus. For those unfamiliar with this modern classic, unique, and masculine juice, Fahrenheit was packed with floral notes of the less traditional kind (hawthorn, honeysuckle, and a big hit of the violet leaf). The predominant leathery note, I reckon from styrax and musk in the base, perhaps blended with those unusual blossoms, also carried a sign of something abstract, like petroleum products, which is so dirty and addicting. It sounds odd, but it worked, and it is all but alien.

Fahrenheit is the elixir for the Upper Crust only. It combines leathery-woody-floral-musk accords to create a scintillatingly sensual signature fragrance. Be prepared; it opens up with a blast of leather, a kind of like kerosene or gasoline odor, the intoxicating smell of fresh asphalt, a bit stronger than in Fahrenheit original, though, it even features the aggressive use of leather as a top note. Despite the presence of a few citrus fruits like mandarin orange, bergamot, and lemon, the opening is not zesty. This petrol-like accord blends with a fresh, aromatic scent of violet leaves. Shortly after this opening, hints of leather can be detected, adding to the boldness of this fragrance.

The middle, the second layer consists of nutmeg, honeysuckle, sandalwood, violet, and cedar. To my nose, the most predominant notes are the spicy nutmeg and the sweet-floral honeysuckle, and the violet leaves, of course. Although they linger in the background, sandal and cedar keep the middle stage away from being cloying, too floral or too sweet. Now and then, you can also notice a faint hint of cucumber.

The base notes contain leather and vetiver, giving off those strong, earthy smells. In Fahrenheit's dry-down, dusty cedar, sandalwood, and softened patchouli produce dry and warm aromas that remind me of a place where earth and rocks bake under a summer sun. Hours later, the remnants of this have become a skin scent that skews more traditionally masculine with rooty vetiver and animal musk.

I would say that each stage of this cologne is a pleasure to smell. It's more suitable for the fall and winter seasons, or in the colder months of spring. Because it is an intense, bold fragrance, I wouldn't wear it in the summer seasons, or any unusually warm days. Fahrenheit is perfect for evening wear or a night out where you want to give off that overpowering, masculine smell. It is appropriate for men about 25 years of age or older.
As far as versatility goes, however, I would not rank this cologne high on that scale. It is undoubtedly not a cologne made for casual, everyday wear. The projection is reliable, and you won't have to worry if your cologne is working with this one. I would say it is on the heavier side, giving off those durable leather and violet redolences.

If you aren't a fan of those strong petrol notes, then you won't like this fragrance. I would not recommend this cologne to someone who prefers a lighter, fresher scent, and not a blind buy. This cologne is a divisive one, people love it or hate it, but it is an iconic men's cologne. But if you do love it, this is a fantastic fragrance with a subtle hint of violet. If you need to feel like a well-groomed bad-ass for a day, try it!

Stay well; stay healthy.

-Elysium"
Fahrenheit,great first fragrance,"i got this as my first ever cologne and i still love it. it is a very good option if you enjoy non sweet, masculine fragrances. sometimes, this smells like a wonderful blend of leather and plants, sometimes i get a straight butane note, either way i love it dearly. it smells different on me almost every time. all in all, a really nice fragrance."
Fahrenheit,The Stink of Captain Caveman,"Did you know Vernee Watson Will Smith's 'Mother' in the Fresh Prince of Bel Air also voiced Dee Dee Sykes in one of my favourite afterschool cartoons of the 80s (yes I know it was made and aired originally in the 70s but I wasn't watching TV then) Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels.

I loved Brenda, Dee Dee and Taffy and I loved Captain Caveman. What I loved most about Captain Caveman was that the defrosted hirsute protagonist was not infatuated with the three women to whom he was befriended. He resided in a stony carapace fixed on top of their motorhome van. The man was hardly interested in the three women he lived with; this man who has spent thousands of years frozen in ice was happy to spend his time removed from their company. Admittedly to me at the time who was a little in love with Dee Dee and Taffy couldn't understand why the hairy neanderthal wanted nothing to do with them.

Now how do I segue to taking about this fragrance without some clumsy, butchering of metaphors and similes. Nope cannot do it, I'll just wing it.

Now in a review I did of Musc Ravageur likened it to Funk (I stand by it), now it's not the only fragrance I think fits this association, there are others. For example, Dior's Fahrenheit. That fragrance reminds me of Parliament's 'Little ole Country Boy' the song is a tale of a guy being replaced by another in a young woman's affections. The lyrics of the song is narrated by George Clinton, in it he sounds less like a young guy but in my head a drunk older man reminiscing on the cause of his present predicament. His voice is gravelly, and his speech slightly slurred in a way it reminded me of Captain Caveman, and the song too with its weird Country influence - it was an odd crossover but it works really well.

Fahrenheit works similarly well considering how it presents as a wholly unworkable concept, who would a petrol-leather woody-floral scent appeal to. Yet it works so well and beautifully it has lasted over 30 years, especially in the climate of today were market sales and the survival of a fragrance is predicated by a generation that's not renowned for its sedulousness (maybe that's unfair). Fahrenheit, like, Captain Caveman retains a nostalgic bent for me, I was old enough to remember its first iteration way back in the late 80s (though not old enough to purchase it). I both love and hate the 80s, it was an era very much about self and the pursuit for personal gain at the expense of other was openly encouraged, the whole decade was geared towards the John Nash game 'Fuck you Buddy' (odd that the gameshows popular nowadays often adopt this very model), Racism and the other 'isms' were just chips on the shoulders of others. But what I love about the 80s was the utter abandonment of restricted fun, if you could pay for it or you were brazen enough you could do it and have fun with it (you did have cover up for most of it if you wanted to keep it or not catch it) but I can tell you out of my group of friends growing up in the 80s only two of us never had a limb in cast and questioning from the police. Returning to the former hatred of the 80s brings me to why this fragrance has a weird dichotomy as it so brilliantly represents the 80s of the yuppy, brash loudmouth fucking annoyance of Thatcher's Britain, Reganomics and the EEC.

Here I am the son of 'working class lefties', someone who could be considered 'left leaning' but I love a fragrance from the height of the Yuppyverse. The weird thing about this fragrance is it does not evoke wealth or greed or accumulation of wealth. I smell this and i do not think of the ruddy faced, yarping maw of the city boy trader. No I get the image of a man who does not equate his worth with the number of zeros printed on his bank statement, or the affects of consumption or consumerism. Fahrenheit has this spicy sharp presence and then the dulled expanse of the leather. That sharpness I suspect is provided by the mace as it cuts through the citrus notes of mandarin and bergamot. The citrus fades as its wont to reveal the other star player in this fragrance which does not get that much of mention in reviews or gushing praise is the violet. The Violet I think is responsible for the that peculiar petrol stank that we all find both jarring and alluring. This Captain Caveman shaped bottle is a mess of beautiful dichotomies. That man that I now picture could very well be Captain Caveman, a man who lives with three beautiful women unconcerned with the modernity, the new bells and whistles and the accumulation of things. He's not like the men of his present time, he does rush after those wants.

Fahrenheit is the fragrance for Captain Caveman"
Fahrenheit,Gasoline leather miracle,"It took me a while to warm up to it, but now I'm completely transfixed. I can only imagine how older versions smelled, although I hear the current formulation is actually not bad. It's just the perfect balance of contradictory tendencies: the rawness of gasoline, the delicacy of florals, the diffusive greenness of violet leaf, the grounded reddish brown of leather. Its like one of those optical illusions where you can see two different things depending on wether you focus on the figure or the ground, both perfectly complementary and opposite, yet existing simultaneously. This feels like a rare stroke of brilliant perfumery genius combined with the stars aligning, considering all the parties involved in its creation, and it's a miracle that it's still available and in decent shape nearly 30 years later. This doesn't fit into any category, is really a work of art, and yet is still perfectly wearable and arguably even versatile. I only wish it had a bit more body in it's current form."
Fahrenheit,Farenheit 9-11,"Vintage bottles of this fragrance are available online for purchase. I was able to grab a 1.7oz bottle from 1988 and the smell is quite fresh. There is a certain car motor aspect of the fragrance that is very prevalent in the opening and also throughout. Just an FYI. If your planning to buy a bottle and you're interested in a vintage piece, make sure on the bottom of the bottle it says Christian Dior and not just Dior. If it only says Dior then it's a recent bottle which you don't want.. It has 22 different notes in the composition but it's kind of a linear scent. Longevity is ok, even though many people seem to think it's a beast. It's anything but. After 3 hours it becomes a skin scent. I find myself constantly sniffing my wrist to see if it's still there and that's lame. Again I expected much more out of this but that being said the fragrance is not a bad one it's quite good it's different it's bold it's sharp it's spicy it's a lot of things but I'm not sure that if you buy a vintage bottle it would be worth the price which would surely be well over $100. Also i hope that when a seller says it's a vintage item, it's a VINTAGE ITEM. That's the chance u take anytime u go online and buy something from a private seller. Almost all of the time it's what they say it is but THIS? I'm not so sure. I never owned this fragrance when it 1st hit the market. I just recently became interested in it. I paid $145 for a little 1.7oz bottle but the batch code did say 1988 so who knows. I know it's not my skin because i have many fragrances that last all day on me so I'm glad that's not it."
Fahrenheit,Myriad of notes (80's classic),"A late 80's scent I sampled at a department store recently that I was not crazy about but I know I will probably learn to enjoy with time.

Sauvage Elixir,02/16/2023,Drseid,M,828,,7,The Stuff of Nightmares to Classic Perfumery Lovers...,"I won't waste any time writing an extensive review with note breakdown of this horrific stinker. Projection is stellar and so is longevity at 20 terrifying hours on skin despite several attempts to wash it off.

While terrified by how bad a release the original Sauvage was, I read enough folks say that Sauvage Elixir was worth a try even if you disliked the original. Well, now having purchased and wearing a sample of Elixir, I think pretty much if you enjoyed the synthetic ambroxan smell of regular Sauvage, you will near-certainly enjoy the overpowering strong, highly synthetic profile of this one too. If your tastes run to more along mine (think 70s and 80s natural smelling powerhouses) steer well-clear of this abomination and insult to the world of perfume. The bottom line is Sauvage Elixir, like its Edt counterpart is scary, nightmarish stuff indeed, ""earning"" a 1 star out of 5 ""horrific"" rating and a mega-avoid recommendation. Seek out the spectacular classic *Eau* Sauvage Edt instead, says I."
Sauvage Elixir,08/06/2022,Stefan79,M,9,,6,Best of designer fragrance,"It is the best designer fragrance that has ever been released. If Amouage Interlude is the Beast of niche fragrances, this is the Beast of designer fragrances. The people who say this isn’t appropriate for summer are likely teenagers who are too afraid to wear this in the summer. This is perfection in the summer. In fact it’s probably best in summer. It’s worth way more than what they are charging for it. Remember, all you need are 2 or 3 sprays and you have ample performance for 24 hours. I truly recommend to all who wants enjoy the quality of niche at the price of designer fragrance"
Sauvage Elixir,07/05/2025,Mohashim,M,140,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,A Masterpiece,"Dior has truly outdone themselves with this fragrance – it's absolutely fantastic, radiating both class and sexiness.
The opening introduces a bright dash of grapefruit, which quickly transitions into a wonderfully smooth, milky, chocolatey cardamom. A subtle hint of sweetness emerges, and then the lavender works its magic, especially when mingling with nutmeg to create a distinct roasted, woody vibe.
This is a complex scent that truly evolves. After the initial few hours, the heavier cardamom mellows, moving into the background. The lavender, grapefruit, woods, licorice, and cinnamon then take center stage, seamlessly blending into a unified, captivating aroma.
For the first two hours, the projection and sillage are incredible, easily filling a room. It then settles to within arm's length but remains very noticeable. The longevity is exceptional, lasting well over 12 hours and even into the next day on my skin.
The overall smell is simply wonderful, allowing you to discern individual notes even within their intricate blend. The sandalwood in particular is outstanding, almost creamy. This fragrance undergoes numerous beautiful transitions on the skin, always maintaining its classy and seductive appeal. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed – a stellar release from Dior."
Sauvage Elixir,03/29/2023,Sierra91,M,4,,8,"It`s not weak, Your nose may be exhausted!","I have purchased the Elixir after a whole day smelling testers in perfumeries but could not find the Elixir in stock. In the evening I finally found one and bought it, after I smelled the tester and loved it. Once I got home, I opened the box and sprayed it again on my wrist. After, an hour, I could not smell it anymore, so I panicked and thought i may have bought a bad batch. I have the 100ml bottle and production was from 8 months ago.

I gave it sometime, left it closed in the closet. After few weeks, I have decided to try it again, and men, the smell was strong and longevity was for hours. I also noticed, where I sprayed it, the skin had like an oily patch form the spray, meaning its very concentrated. I had a shower (did not scrub my wrist but water went on it), and the day after I could still smell through my wrist and smell the beautiful scent, obviously weak but still there.

Sometimes, we smell so many perfumes, in a short amount of time that our noses go blind and immediately decide that the batch is wrong. Give your nose a break, you`ll see the difference.

I had a couple of discounts and managed to buy it for around Eur 160 for the 100ml bottle from a good reliable perfumery in Europe.

The scent is masculine, warm, strong, sexy and elegant at the same time, not elegant as much as DHI but in a different way. I`m glad I bought it, not sure how many occasions I have to be able to wear it but was worth the price and the scent is unique.

Obviously, this is only my personal opinion."
Sauvage Elixir,06/01/2024,Smirky,M,483,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Sauvage Family of Fragrances - Excellent and Versatile,"This is a combined review of Sauvage EDT, EDP, Parfum and Elixir after having tested all four on consecutive days. The Sauvage line, in general, is very popular for a reason. These are excellent, masculine fragrances that are very versatile, working any time of the day, any day of the year, hot or cold or in between. They are also very people pleasing in that most who smell these perfumes on a guy will say they are pleasant scents and attractive. Thus, they are all an easy grab for most situations. They also work for most men of any age. Dior quality is evident in all four perfumes.

There is a concern about the popularity and not standing out with them or being unique. I can't address that aspect because I live in a rural area where the vast majority of men do not wear any fragrance at all. So, no problem for me.

Regarding how different the four perfumes are from each other, I'd say the Sauvage DNA is quite clearly shared in the EDT, EDP and Parfum while the Elixir is more distant. As an analogy, I'd say the EDT, EDP and Parfum are like brothers while the Elixir is a cousin. Still, the EDT, EDP and Parfum are sufficiently unique that it isn't redundant to own all three if you like the different aspects of each.

To sum up these aspects, the EDT is more citrusy, the EDP is smoother, rounder and creamier than the EDT while the Parfum is a more woody version of the EDP. The Elixir is a more warm spicy fragrance with touches of cinnamon and licorice.

If a guy is unsure about which to get, I highly recommend purchasing samples of all four and wearing each on separate consecutive days. That's what I did. This is a much better approach than sniffing all four on test strips in a store. My personal choice is to go with the EDP and the Elixir as I do not have a goal to own all four just for the sake of a complete collection. Of course this is subjective, but the EDP and the Elixir were the most appealing to me.

Performance of the EDT, EDP and Parfume are all quite good with the EDP having the best performance for me. The Elixir is in a class by itself - a truly beast mode fragrance that requires experimentation to determine the quantity to apply. It can easily become overwhelming if too much is applied. The Elixir allows you to fill a room and leave a trail for sure!"
Sauvage Elixir,03/14/2022,Shafkat82,M,25,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Freshie with Twist,"When I first tried it , just one particular fragrance was on my mind , it was Layton by parfums de marly . I have layton in my collection since 2019 and wore at least 30-40 wearings . The apple note of layton is very similar with the new Elixir . Elixir has prominent Lavender and dose of spices , and i got little vibe of aftershave Gel vibe but in a good way . So , overall its a mass appealing scent with great performance . Little bit dark but I like this part . Its suitable for Spring and fall , not for summer heat . The price is very high for 60 ml juice , I bought it at 150 USD. $ 100 would be a perfect pricing for this juice but Its Dior you know ."
Sauvage Elixir,06/28/2024,Leonart,M,5,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Overly spicy, borderline offensive to the wearer","As i said in my title, hard to wear for me. I loved it when i first tried it, albeit it was on clothes. Now as the time goes on and it macerated i feel it is hard to pull off. It is very spicy and very masculine and it doesnt allow me to relax if i spray more than one spray on my neck. Especially if there is more than 15 degrees celsius outside. I used up 30% of the bottle pretty quickly but now, a year later, struggle to reach 50%, and it is a 60mL… i dont ever do a full press spray on it. I do two half sprays on my neck and one on clothes. As far as the scent goes, pretty well blended with prominent licorice, nutmeg and creamy woods for me. If it doesnt offend you it could work in all seasons except summer. It is still a nice scent with undeniable performance. Price is on the expensive side, however with many frags that are more expensive having far worse performance ill give it a pass. As far as the line goes, EDT is my winner."
Sauvage Elixir,08/16/2021,ScentSlave,M,246,,5,The Sauvage haters are going to have to DIG for something to hate…,"… because is smells WAY different than the EDT/EDP… this scent is more at risk of being hated by those who LOVED those versions…

It’s VERY RICH… make sure you get an even spray that covers a larger area, as this richness does NOT fade away…

I am enjoying this a lot… In the opening I feel a lot of the licorice pushing out… and as it dries down it’s more dominated by the Sandalwood.

Performance wise, you have to be extremely confident; the smell projects LOUDLY, and they will know that it’s YOU that it’s originating from.
A projection radius that easily surpasses 4ft, and the sillage trail sits and lingers, so all will know who you are, and where you’ve been. Longevity? You will smell this the next morning if you don’t shower before bed and scrub with the intent of erasing it… SERIOUSLY… you are going to have to MAKE SURE you’ve scrubbed it off.

The price is pretty steep… but as a collector who loves Dior, I am extremely happy to have my hands on it this early (the first run of the release).

Is it loud and strong? Oh hell yes it is! Is it obnoxious? If you overspray this, you will smell like this for DAYS. Is it too similar to the rest of the line? Absolutely not.

Final verdict? I’d say try before you buy, especially if you’re loyal to Sauvage because you love the EDT or EDP."

Sauvage Elixir,09/09/2021,Artistscent,M,18,,4,Overhyped,"If this was released under any other name it would have passed by everyone without a care in the world. For all those saying this is paying homage to older men's perfumes, I have no idea what you're on about. Just cause there's lavender in it doesn't make it retro.

For those who wanted another Sauvage flanker, you'll be disappointed too, it only becomes Sauvagesque in the drydown when the ambroxan and timbersilk peek out.

Otherwise, it starts off with a warm sweet grapefruit with lavender and spices, the nutmeg makes it fuller and the cardamom with the lavender is slightly powdery. It reminds me of facets of ST Dupont's Noir, which also has lavender, cardamom, nutmeg and the cashmeran replaces the ambroxan."
Sauvage Elixir,08/27/2021,JackHunter33,M,90,,3,Sexy And Seductive!,"Dior has hit the ball right out of the park with this one. It smells fantastic, really classy and sexy!

I get a dash of grapefruit in the opening and then a super smooth dose of milky chocolatey cardamom. There is a hint of sweetness and then the lavender does something special to this scent. Especially when it mixes with the nutmeg, you get that roasty woody vibe.

The scent is quite complex and after the first few hours it really opens up from the heavy cardamom which moves into the background. The lavender with grapefruit and woods, licorice, cinnamon move into the front seat all mixed together as one.

The first two hours the projection and sillage is amazing on me a real room filler. Then it settles down to within arms length but is very noticeable. The longevity is 12 hours plus into the next day on my skin.

The smell is just wonderful and you can pick apart the notes even though they are mixed together. The sandalwood in this is really good and almost creamy. The scent seems to go through many transitions on the skin. And it smells really classy and seductive. All in all I'm impressed, a stellar release from Dior."

Upscale and sophisticated. Oldschool vibes turned modern. Leans mature, but confident youngster can certainly pull this off. Those 60ml will do some heavy duty for sure. I'm serisously impressed!

And the price tag? Sure it is expensive. But at the same time you will not smell like every other guy in the room like with all the previous versions. Give this one a try, you might be surprised."
Sauvage Elixir,10/03/2025,LePianoMan,M,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Truly an elixir,"With the abundance of “elixir” flankers being released, Sauvage Elixir stands out as one done right. While it differs vastly from the line, it still has that undercurrent of sweet, clean perfume to it, but it brings in a whole load of spices, warmth, and some dryness that is just incredible and comes off the skin like nothing else.

This REALLY radiates. All you need is a quarter spray to be modest, 2 quarter sprays if you’re willing to stand out a bit more, and maybe a half spray if you’re gonna be outdoors. The atomizer is amazing and also insanely deep with how much perfume you can spray on yourself if you press it fully down, so a half spray is much more than it sounds like it is. DO NOT OVERSPRAY. This can go from incredible to cloying and it WILL choke you and others out very easily. Honestly one of my favorite scents in the collection, but I am a sucker for darker, spicy, sweet perfumes like this and Amouage Interlude Black Iris."
Sauvage Elixir,09/06/2021,PerfumePL,M,31,,4,The exclusive mainstream,"The drying has some of the Sauvage DNA, but especially in the last blows. Very spicy, amber top, with tonka and lavender peeking out, forceful top, barely citrus, with a note of liquorice that I liked the most, drying is much kinder, cardamom adds shine and Lavender predominates but in its sweet floral facet more than clean and sharp, it has oak moss and an earthy and green part, the woods are also showing.
It is an elegant and mature fragrance, especially for temperate climates, on a summer night it also works well.
Much higher than the quality of the designer, although for me the price of it is still somewhat excessive, since even though it is a fragrance that differs a bit from what the market is taking over, it is still mainstream, that is, great composition, eternal duration the next day you still feel something if you stick your nose, in me the trail is moderate, it is worth trying it"
Sauvage Elixir,09/28/2023,Gfxdaddy,M,5,,2,Not for me...,"Tried to like this but this is an affront to my senses and I think it works best as an extremely light application (read: one spray) to layer with and boost a light application of Sauvage EDT. Cooler weather only, maybe Fall/Autumn if lightly layered with Suavage EDT. Some might like this but personally it's not for me — too cloying.

I will say though that this is far and away the best Sauvage on offer at this point."
Sauvage Elixir,08/03/2025,Malignant,M,12,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,The best Sauvage out of the whole line,"This is Sauvage but improved in every way possible. It smells a little sweet and it is very dark and spicy with very strong projection and insane longevity. The sillage on this is also great. I blind bought this and sprayed it on me but i was confused since it kinda smelled like an old man to me but it grew on me very quickly. And best of all, this one can easily fill up a room so you only need like 1-3 sprays which means a bottle of this will last you a long time and it will also macerate as well during that period of time if stored properly. Only downside is that it’s not as versatile as the rest of the Sauvages."
Sauvage Elixir,10/10/2024,Mysticmiggy,M,4,,3,Someone dropped a box of Fall themed essential oils.,"I received a couple of 1ml sample sprayers after making a purchase from Sephora.

For context, I am 36, and work in an office in a temperate, snowless climate, and today, a mild October 10th coming off of our annual October heatwave, is the first time I'm wearing it to work.

I love the Eau De Parfum; I find it as close to a year-round, all-event fragrance as you can get with excellent performance and sillage. I am not loving the Elixir. The opening is giving 'Joann's Fabric and Crafts in the Fall', a formless sweet cinnamon assault. Not 'SPICY' spices, more like, 'Pumpkin Spice Mix'. It's been roughly an hour since application and the initial blast of cinnamon has receded but remains present, and you can get small hints of the Sauvage DNA in there, the nutmeg that pervades the entire line is fighting for its life to be smelled, but it is there, however the sparking bergamot on top that defines Sauvage is missing, and the grapefruit top note in the notes breakdown at the top of this page is subtle and bitter. I'm getting some anise in here as well that is lending a medicinal tinge to the whole affair. The more I smell my wrist the more it smells like Tiger Balm.

Overall, I'm not a fan. This may work better in climates with true winter. The most we get in the Bay Area is a few sub-freezing days, and in extraordinary years, snow dusts the very highest peaks but never reaches populated areas. I feel like Elixir skews much younger than the EDP due to its all-encompassing sweetness and couldn't imagine wearing this to a formal occasion, or anywhere food is served. On a positive note, I'm certain performance is not an issue."
Sauvage Elixir,10/15/2025,Laertes,F,219,,2,Sauvage Elixir,"Day 4 of my Sauvage trial, and it’s the turn of the Elixir. Having seen some of the reviews here, I was expecting to hate it - but, surprise! I don’t. It actually might be…love?

This one opens up so blue and aquatic on my skin, really fresh and clean. As it begins to settle the spices come out to play - predominantly cinnamon, but the nutmeg and cardamon are there - which give this scent a really warm undertone. Then the lavender emerges and washes softly over the spice.

As time goes on the basenotes appear - liquorice, sandalwood, amber, just a touch of patchouli. It’s slightly woody from the vetiver, but the overall impression is smooth, creamy, and a little vanillic. Whatever your thoughts on Sauvage generally, this is a well put together fragrance. I would go as far as to say it’s delicious.

It is a completely different experience to the EDT, EDP and Parfum, but I can see why it’s in the Sauvage line as the same underlying DNA is there. In terms of performance, it’s definitely the strongest of the bunch. A couple of sprays and you’re good to go pretty much all day - or night. It does project well, but as long as you don’t go mad you’re not going to “fill a room” or choke anyone. Stick to a spritz or two and you’ll be fine, unless perhaps you’re particularly sensitive or just not used to wearing scent. As it’s quite a spice heavy scent, I’d say this is best suited to autumn and winter.

Such deliciousness cannot be the sole preserve of men, and as a woman I would (very) happily wear this. Indeed, I am today. It does perhaps lean masculine, or what we’ve been taught to consider masculine at least, but don’t let that put you off. If you like it, wear it; be powerful, bold, and sexy."
Sauvage Elixir,05/20/2024,Tracershy,M,121,,1,The only Sauvage I like,"The composition is fascinating to me... Interesting things are happening here. My sympathy for Elixir is great when I feel its initial stages.
The opening is great, so dark, tarry, thick, full of strong spices. Lavender appears very quickly and it is a truly beautiful lavender. I'm not a fan of it, but when it appears here after this burst of spices, it smells great, is intense and natural. At this stage, however, I received an interesting ""compliment"", namely that I smell a bit like a mothball bag. This lavender soon becomes more and more burnt and this is the moment when licorice joins the composition, an ingredient that finally convinced me to buy an expensive bottle. It adds even more density, viscosity and a bit of sweetness.
If Elixir smelled as it does during the first 1.5 hours, I would be screaming with delight. It's not that it has changed radically after this time, but it is gradually losing its clarity. After 2 hours I start to feel the DNA of the Sauvage line in the background, the feisty character of the opening slowly disappears and the scent flattens out. I can feel the ambroxan, it is not dominant, it is added here within reason, without being flashy, but there is an ambroxan cloud over the composition. It makes Elixir, in my opinion, fall into some irritating mediocrity, it is not bad, but it has lost what it had at the beginning and in this form it lasts for many more hours, from time to time flashing a glimpse of what it delighted me with in the initial chord.
Despite my ambivalent impressions, I don't regret the purchase, maybe a little, mainly when I think that at this price I could have had Beau de Jour from Ford, which is much better with its lavender color. I will stubbornly claim that Elixir is not worth the price that Dior wants, because you can have a great niche at this price, but I had a whim to have it for this opening, I knew how much and what I was paying for. If I were to buy it as a fragrance that I would like to use often, I certainly wouldn't have it. I bought it as a collector's item, to use from time to time, to enjoy this temporarily intoxicating, spicy lavender with licorice on a gloomy winter day. This one bottle will stay with me for many years and in this case I do not think that the price of Elixir is excessive.
A few words about parameters. I don't completely understand those who say that one spray is completely enough. Elixir is not a killer when it comes to projection, at least on my skin it never exceeded average. Used in the amount of 3-4 sprays, it did not fill the room, it does not suffocate anyone nearby (tested among people), it does not have an atomic projection. However, it is very noticeable, it leaves a delicate but short tail, it surrounds you with a bubble that glides nicely across your nose... after two hours, the projection goes from quite clear to moderate, even very moderate, but it's ok, it stays like that for many hours. Only after about 6 hours does it become very close to the skin. I tested fresh releases after the premiere, several from 2022 and my current bottle from January 2023, there are no differences. Apparently I'm not one of the lucky people on whom this is a designing beast. Durability is always great, it is still on the skin a day after application. It survived scrubbing in the shower, and that's something to brag about.
To sum up, it's a pity that Sauvage Elixir does not fully use its potential, but it must be admitted that it is solid and overall I do not regret the purchase."

This fragrance is too powerful, it overwhelms you and anyone around you. If I smelled someone wearing this, I would think they are not a considerate person. So definitely not office or gym safe.

Sauvage Elixir,09/02/2021,Matux,M,39,,3,"An updated fougere, almost unrelated to the EdT","Sauvage's DNA is present however in a very subtle fashion: the Edt's hiperbolic topnotes are absent, which is a good thing. There is some spiciness, a tad enough to relate this with the original one. At the same time there is fougere - molecule that I can associate with other present day blends of the kind like Beau de Jour and Viking, maybe this is what provides Elixir balance and elegance to the composition.

It is a complex, full bodied yet discreet blend, almost unrelated to the original in its lack of references to the concept of ""synthetic""."

I used 3 sprays once I was on the conference, and I could feel that scarry cloud arround me that 100% bothers everyone near.
It might suit older men, maybe 60+, who want to mask the natural scent of aging skin, but for most guys, it’s simply too much. I eventually sold the bottle below market value because it just sat untouched in my collection of 70 fragrances."

Sauvage Elixir,10/27/2023,Shemsmeller,M,206,,2,Too powerful for me,"tested yesterday at Marionnaud de Vaulx in silk vellum, driven by the hype around this new perfume.

what nonsense, what banality, they simply created a smell extremely close to extreme eau sauvage always from Dior.

it smells of liquorice leather, virile, powerful masculine, it is a winter perfume with a strong sillage just like their source of inspiration, the staying power is very good since 9 hours.

the only positive point about this perfume is that it is less aggressive.

Sauvage,08/27/2015,BrianBuchanan,M,363,,11,Clockwork Orange,"Powdered orange juice concentrate, neutral synthetic plasticy filler, an intense metallic tang, fugitive red peppery note, sweetness, powder, a woody amber undertone and a black plastic 'bergamot' resin that smells more like it came from a hydrocarbon cracking plant than Calabria.

Sauvage follows in the vein of Boss In Motion and 1 Million with a distinctly uninspired coarse and lumpen orange profile. The metal note becomes so overblown that it is really unpleasant, and there isn't a heart accord to provide any relief, it goes in a straight line from metallic orange to woody amber and sticks around longer than an African dictator.

While I was testing it, a friend asked me to never wear it in her company again. Appropriately, as well as wild and savage, the French word sauvage also means unsociable.

I can understand the lack of creativity and artistic judgement, just the sight of the box is enough to set the alarm bells ringing, but what is inexplicable is why LVMH chose to debase the reputation of a great classic by plagiarising its name for this derivative dross."
Sauvage,09/03/2015,ColinM,M,516,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Easy to underrate!,"My expectations for Sauvage weren’t extremely low, but neither that high for sure. I was convinced it was probably better than the undeserved skepticism it seems getting here and there from fragrance snobs, but nothing groundbreaking for sure. Now that I’ve finally snatched a sample, I must say it quite reflects the idea I had about it – and actually, it is slightly better than I expected. First of all, in broad terms, it is probably right to consider this the first “Dior’s Bleu de Chanel” (or name another fragrance like that), as the league is more or less the same; but contrary to Bleu de Chanel (and most of similar scents), besides showing a clearly better quality, Sauvage avoids any boring, pretentious, preppy middle-class mannerism and adds a subtle touch of pungent vibrancy, of “rawness” as the name suggests. It is in fact a compelling contemporary take on a classic green fougère theme, opening with a bracing, peppery, crisp green-bergamot accord with a peculiar sort of “cedrat” heart, something bitter and earthy that provides a really nice sort of musky-sour shade to the crisp, fresh leafiness of the main accord. And then there’s a subtle, yet deep base of synthetic ambergris enhanced by some generic woods – “generic” means here nothing smelling overly cheap, but surely not the greatest woody notes around.

So imagine a quite classic and apparently mannered green masculine scent centered on pepper, citrus notes and dry ambery woods with some mossy patchouli lingering below, and give it a modern shape with an exotic, and slightly sombre touch halfway “organic” and “futuristic” (thanks to the cleverly-fitting warm and “grey” note of ambroxan). I must note that Sauvage feels quite much dry throughout its evolution, which I guess may be taken as a “masculine” added value, and also shows a pleasantly nondescript sort of dark, bitter-fizzy feel with a Mediterranean vibe, which reminds me of the balmy smell of air on a cloudy day in some woodland by the sea. Quite some interesting contrasts, overall: dryness, bitterness, warmth. So, again: an office-safe scent for sure, but in no way cheap or uncreative. Nothing exciting, but nothing bad to say the least. It just offers the right tiny amount of creativity within a “pop”, crowdpleasing frame. I think Demachy did quite a nice job in creating a deceptively generic fragrance with some sparkles of dark rawness. And I also appreciate the fact Sauvage smells really simple overall, almost minimalistic composition-wise, and with no overly cheap nuances. Simply put, it smells nice and it isn’t boring at all. As hours pass the ambroxan-woody-patchouli base takes the main stage, making Sauvage smell darker, warmer, dustier, more (again, “generically” ) classy and less bitter, with also some (good!) vetiver popping out. Still quite dry but at the same time quite comforting and sophisticated.

To cut it short, I think this is a good fragrance, quite more peculiar than it may seem at a first rushed test, and I think it is fully justified for Dior to have something like this among their range. Not everything has to be creative, or flashy, or (more or less faithfully) luxury or make some “statement”. Sauvage is a quality, discreet everyday scent with a seducing dark-organic twist and a nice evolution, smooth enough to appeal classic wearers but quality enough to be worthy a sniff for everybody else, including niche-heads. And it would surely be a mistake to dismiss this too early labelling it mediocre or cheap, since it isn’t either of the two. I probably wouldn’t buy this, but I’m glad Dior introduced it.

This perfume is my favourite among almost 130 collection of niche and designer fragrances that I have, it's an excellent aroma, very masculine and attractive. To hate something because it's popular is immature.
You can't pretend this isn't a nice fragrance. Sure, it's extremely popular because it is very nice. BMW and Mercedes Benz cars are popular and we still buy them because they are reliable, prayer of every good business person is to have a product that is very successful and popular. Men like this. Women like this. It projects. It's arguably the longest-lasting blue fragrance ever made, go and make your own if you have a problem with popular products and stop hating.

Sauvage,01/06/2023,Patj1994,M,29,,7,Disgusting,"So I finally got a small sample of this yesterday after surprisingly never having smelled it before and all i can say is…this stuff is absolutely repulsive. Within 15 minutes of wearing only three sprays i had a splitting migraine (im guessing from the overload of ambroxen). I don’t know how anybody could possibly enjoy this fragrance. Smells like a dirty, musky old man that hasn’t showered in weeks with some spices sprinkled on top. Smells like a cheap, synthetic, chemically mess. Want to smell cheap and like every college frathouse d-bag? Wear this

The fact that this is as popular as it is truly shocks me"

Sauvage,10/07/2023,Adamrbz,M,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The hated gem,"When Dior Sauvage edt first came, it was a surprise for everybody. Dior always use to make perfume for mature men (Eau Sauvage, Fahrenheit). But with Dior Sauvage, they completely changed the dynamic of the brand. Dior sauvage was a blue/aromatic/spicy fragrance with a little touch of shower gel, which, of course, aim for a younger audience. Despite this fact, I remembered that my father fell in love with it. When it came out, in 2015, he immediately bought it. He was 50 at that time and I was 15. I still remember sneaking in his room to take a few spray before going to school or a little night out. It was a crowd pleaser and attention grabbing perfume

But slowly, the reputation of the perfume became worst and worst to the point that neither of us wore it until few days ago. Now that nobody still wear dior sauvage, we can reappreciate it and wear it peacefully.

For me, this perfume didn’t deserve all this hate. You can’t hate a perfume because of its public. A perfume have to be judged only by itself and for me, Dior Sauvage is still a masterpiece to this day. I have the edt, edp and perfum version and I can say that despite having +80 perfumes including niche, designer and clone, all the 3 version are really good and not redundant to have."
Sauvage,06/24/2025,Ceesie,M,132,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,What's left to say?,"As I’m squeezing out the last drops of my sample I’m wondering what to do; buy a bottle or not. Yeah I had a couple of official samples but I’m emptying my last one. It’s such an iconic scent. Fruity opening, sharp and bold spiciness for the rest of its lifetime. Masculine yet youthfull.

Somehow I associate this scent with my own youth. I went full puberty in the 90’s, long before this beastly perfume was born. It would have fit that era quite nicely though. It’s grungy, it’s loud, it’s literally wild. In fact, quite the opposite of how I feel the 2010’s were. Yet there it was. And it was everywhere. As if every adolescent needed it. I’m too old for clubbing but I’m sure those discos reeked of the stuff.

I love it when I wear it myself too. But I can’t help but feeling like an old guy wearing clothes that are too hip. And it’s so recognisable, it’s embarrassing. Some time ago I went to dinner and the waiter was a boy not even in his 20’s. He didn’t really know how to dose but he clearly wore Sauvage. The whole restaurant reeked of it and I lost my appetite a bit. Then after that I walked the dog through a beautiful park. An older guy passed me by on a bicycle. A bit chubby, grey hair, a bit scruffy. Yep, a cloud of Sauvage travelled along with him.

So will I buy a full bottle? I’d love to but it’s more of a guilty pleasure than anything else. In the mean time if I want to smell it, I just go out on the streets, it’s everywhere."

But the price........my substitute is Byblos Leather Sensation. Almost same scent, 2-3 times weaker on performance (on some skins remains very long, unfortunatelly on mine only 6 hours), 12-14 times chiepier.

Sauvage,06/17/2025,Averycj,M,50,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,One of the G.O.A.T.'s,"Dior Sauvage EDT gets a lot of hate in the fragrance world, but let’s be real: it’s a modern classic. It’s versatile, mass-appealing, and undeniably fresh. There’s a reason it’s so popular.

Let’s look at the facts. Around 60% of men wear fragrance regularly, but only a small percentage of them, let's say maybe 5–10% are actually involved in the fragrance community or consider themselves serious collectors. So for the average person, Sauvage isn’t overplayed. It’s just a well-loved, solid choice.

Think about it: outside of your circle, how often do you actually smell Sauvage out in the wild? For me, it's not often, if at all. Online echo chambers have really brainwashed people into thinking this is a bad fragrance or is associated with negative things like exes or fuckboys.

There’s a reason it’s a go-to: it smells great. Sharp bergamot, clean ambroxan, and crisp pepper. It’s fresh, sexy, and fits any setting. Gym, date, wedding, office... it works.

If you collect fragrances, you should own this. A staple in designer perfumery. It performs well, lasts impressively for an EDT, and gets compliments. What more do you want?

Don’t let influencers or frag snob culture make you second-guess yourself. Wear what you love. Be confident. Smell amazing. If you’re afraid of smelling like her ex, don’t switch fragrances. Become the kind of person she’ll never compare to anyone else. Sauvage EDT may not be the rarest scent in your collection, but it’s earned its place on the frag Mount Rushmore."
Sauvage,10/06/2021,HugoMontez,M,81,,4,The Modern Man,"I like it. Is fresh, citrusy, a little bit smoky, metallic, slightly sweet and very masculine.

Dior has some of the best and most iconic fragrances. Iris (Dior homme), aromatic citrus (Eau Sauvage), violet leaf (Fahrenheit), Fig (Dune for men), etc ... Sauvage brings the metallic-amber compound (ambroxan) and a juicy Bergamot to offer a very fresh, modern and long lasting experience.

I saw many hate when it was released and for the simple fact that it smells boring, screechy and not interesting. But the fact is that 6 years later, is one of the best sellers and a very influential fragrance. An iconic one, like it or not. Like Fahrenheit is. Or even 1 million. Fragrances that not everybody love but they defined a style, a wave of new fragrances, a status quo.

Sauvage inspired many others but it still the best combination of metallic and fresh citrus. The Elixir is also great but in a different way. Many will compare it to Bleu de Chanel but i don't find them similar in many aspects. While Bleu is more a traditional woody aromatic with an ambery base, Sauvage is more citrusy with a weird metallic ambroxan note.

If you want a modern masculine, with good quality and mass appeal, go for it. Don't be affeaid to buy a best seller. It's really decent and i recommend it for a signature scent or just to grab and go. Never fails and lasts +8h.

Fahrenheit, Eau Sauvage and Dior Homme are legends in Dior's lineup, and although this is not a masterpiece, is still a staple.

I really do not associate this scent with that portrayal, but hey, commercials nowadays always are better looking than the actual product. So, be vigilant.

I must say, I was not very interested in Sauvage for a long time. I thought, ""Overhyped generic scent, you smell it everywhere"". I decided to buy a sample online, just to get to know the famous over-used scent that apparently everyone weares. Sample arrived, sprayed it on and wow. THIS is thé Dior Sauvage? Fascinating, I indeed smelled this so many times when walking in cities or going to restaurants and other places et cetera.

I took some time for this scent to really get used to it and actually liking it. Here I am, sitting in front of my desktop writing the Sauvage review on Parfumo while wearing Sauvage. I must say, this scent is really delicious after a while. I'm not sure for the sillage, but longevity and quality are awesome. Though, people characterize this scent as ""synthetic"". As a chemist myself, it's just about the molecules that evoke the scent our noses can perceive. Molecule from a plant or created in a lab? Doesn't matter in my opinion. So, a synthetic scent is something created by humans and is therefore not always associated with natural scents, like the ambroxan present in this perfume. Probably that's why people call it synthetic. Funny enough, ambroxan naturally occurs in ambergris that is only obtainable from the digestive tract of sperm whales. Hence it's high price. But it seems, according to literature, that ambroxan can also be synthesized from sclareol. Which is a natural molecule present in clary sage.

My point, nothing really, just for informative or entertaining purposes ;).
In the end, Sauvage is a scent that 'makes the man' and can never go wrong. Only people that are sick of it obviously. Others reviews here that seem to despise the scent is absolutely fine. Your nose is not my nose after all.

Have a nice day."
Sauvage,06/02/2021,Kurai,M,388,,3,Overhyped and overhated,"The typical long-lasting nightclub buzz coming from the ambrox boost. Obviously, that's the part that polarizes. That and the marketing campaign being too successful, I guess. It's more a 'join-the-cool-club' scent than something to stand out with. Then again, we can say the same about Layton and Aventus nowadays.

The scent itself.. Bergamot, aromatics, pepper, elemi. Not too bad. Outstanding performance. I would have liked this in my younger days as a nightclubber. Not that I feel old.. or.. oh well, never mind.."
Sauvage,06/28/2018,NicosV,M,12,,1,A successful marketing hit!,"A successful marketing hit! Has a beautiful bottle. It is very easily recognizable and because of its popularity not very unique.

Sorry Mr. Depp, I like your commercial, but not the fragrance. It could be that I am over 30 and smelled too many fragrances in my life but Sauvage smells so cheap and synthetic when compared to competitors in this genre... My wife HATES it and runs away from me every time I spray it - ""Oh no, not Sauvage!"". I am aware that many people love this line (especially younger folks) and everything about this fragrance is explained many times.. but if you still haven't try it, don't blind buy it! Go and try it somewhere and don't be influenced by the hype. Could be that you will love it, end enjoy many bottles of Sauvage! But if you don't, just keep searching for your own magic. There is no perfume that works for everyone and there is no fragrance that could ""catch-a-girl"" for you. It is not about the fragrance itself but about your self-confidence when you are wearing it."

Read some good reviews about Dior Intense. But considering the price I decided to first venture to the local fragrance store to sample it. I have a decent collection of scents, maybe 15 to 20. So guess you could say I'm a fragrance junkie. But my approach is always to first sample a fragrance on my skin before spending hard earned cash. Sprayed about three whiffs of this highly rated parfum on my skin. Dear oh dear. It is certainly long lasting. And powdery as many reviews suggest. My disappointment is that after if i bought this i would be spending a load of cash on this to smell like a stronger version of Johnsons Baby Powder. The notes just get worse for me. I really wanted to like this scent. But just kept getting this annoying baby powder scent instead of a more masculine fragrance. Cannot understand the mega raves it gets. Maybe will try it on my skin again to decide. But for now i am yet to find a Parfum that wows me. Both Jaipur and this have not impressed. Gave my Jaipur Edp away as I could not stand the smell after two or three uses. They are built to last as a Parfum should. But the scents are too annoying for my liking and unique, yes, but not in a good way."

As a huge fan of Dior Homme 2005 , i was very excited when I received this as a gift , I must say its very nicely done with Iris and Vanilla(too much imo) but I badly miss the leather and cacao here which I got in original EDT, and that is the main difference I see between them , I just like it but dont know its a nose fatigue or something else , the over prevailing vanilla is not letting me enjoy the beautiful scent behind it.
Love the original which is far more better, masculine and very versatile piece of art if compared to this intense version."

Maybe slightly woodier too. Layering the two of them using Dior Homme Intense's drydown as a base for Dior Homme brought me this close to getting rid of 90% of the rest of my wardrobe. I am not familiar with the alleged variations among Dior Homme and Dior Homme Intense batches, all I know is that my 2014 bottle of the Intense is a glorious, delightfully non-redundant companion to its timeless brother.

Dior Homme Intense,08/22/2022,GeorgeReid,M,37,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"Three E's: Easy, Effeminate and Elegant.","After hearing about Dior Homme Intense, and consistently seeing it in the top 10 fragrances in Parfumo over the past few months, I bought a sample and wanted to know if it was worth the hype.

----

First, let us talk about the smell.

Dior Homme Intense is not a complex fragrance. It opens with a powdery floral that is almost certainly iris, which mixes with a light musky sweetness. Once the iris wears off, the cedar becomes more prominent and mixes with the musky sweetness that continues to linger.

Dior Homme Intense is an example of how simplicity can work in a fragrance.

One of the largest critiques about the smell is that Dior Homme Intense smells feminine, especially to men who grew up around women and know what lipstick sets smell like. Perhaps if the era was the mid-2000s or earlier, Dior Homme Intense would have a different name, and advertising would market toward women.

I strongly believe that women can easily wear this fragrance with zero problems. While cedar is considered more masculine, the iris and light musk is more prominent.

That said, the likely goal of Dior Homme Intense is to create the allure of an elegant gentleman that consistently has women around him so frequently, that they leave their scent on him. It succeeds, as the fragrance presents a captivating and alluring aura.

----

A 100 ml bottle of Dior Homme Intense has the traditional classy feel of a men’s fragrance.

A clear rectangular bottle with a translucent black cap is not exactly grand bottle artistry. However, the classic look is elegant, and will always look great on a dresser or on a display shelf, nor is the bottle embarrassing enough that one must hide it in a drawer, a closet, or inside the box.

----

In terms of performance, Dior Homme Intense is outstanding.

With projection, Dior Homme Intense hits a rare balance that is difficult to achieve. The overall projection is strong and noticeable, but the fragrance does not overwhelm everyone when in proximity, allowing for more people to move closer. Again, elegance without being overbearing or trying too hard.

In terms of longevity, two sprays of Dior Homme Intense last for about twelve hours, with the opening lasting for about three.

This is a fragrance that will follow a person throughout the day without a respray, but a person wearing it will not feel like they are drowning in it.

----

Thanks to the unique performance of Dior Homme Intense, it gains some flexibility that is difficult to achieve with fragrances that have strong projection, making it easier to wear.

As a result, it is usable throughout the year, with the only questionable time to use it is on a blazing summer day outside. (As musky smells can radiate in the heat.) Also, while Dior Homme Intense is fantastic in the fall and winter, I will go against the grain, and state that the fragrance easily shines the brightest in the spring.

As for social scenarios, Dior Homme Intense works in an office or school environment without annoying everyone and is usable daily.

On the negative side, the musky aspect may be too much for the gym, even if it is on the lighter side.

That said, ultimately, the best usage for Dior Homme Intense is as a nighttime fragrance (especially on a date night). While lightly sweet, it will stand out as unique because it is not the typical super-sweet fragrances that most people smell on men in 2022.

----

Overall, Dior Homme Intense is an outstanding fragrance and is mostly worth the hype it receives, and I bought a bottle after trying the sample. However, I highly recommend sampling first, as the critiques are valid, and the fragrance is not for everyone.

For example, someone looking for an artistic or complex fragrance to make a statement should look elsewhere. Likewise, someone who is looking for a more traditional masculine fragrance, or someone that hates powdery scents will be massively disappointed.

That said, Dior Homme Intense is best for people trying to be considerate of other people while having their own identity. They want a fragrance that projects, but do not choke out a room. They want a fragrance that stands out for going against the common trends, but also works in attracting positive attention. If this is you, you may like the results."
Dior Homme Intense,01/31/2017,RhythmnHues,M,51,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A Modern classic,"Finally, a fragrance that dares to be different—a vanillic, cocoa/orris floral for men that feels like a sigh of relief in today’s overly citrus-splashed lineup. And yes, it's absolutely worth the hype. Dang!

But let’s talk reformulation. I don’t usually get swept up in the drama, but this one threw me for a loop. My first encounter was with a 2015 version—a stunner with lush cocoa and ambrette seed that stole the spotlight, while iris and leather played a delicate supporting role. Smooth, seductive, unforgettable.

Then came a 2014 bottle. Totally different mood. Cocoa and ambrette take a backseat, easing in much later and far softer. Instead, iris and leather dominate with thick, buttery orris root and a nutty ambrette that's almost hazelnut-like, paired with suede. Musky, vanillic, and woody—feels deep, rich, and soulful.

Either way, I’m hooked. I lean slightly towards the 2015 for its velvet-smooth cocoa/orris elegance. But no matter the year, performance is top-tier—radiant projection, beautiful sillage, and longevity that just won't quit.

If you're even a little curious, go ahead and try it. You might just discover something unforgettable hiding in the drydown.

Dior Homme Intense,02/24/2025,Moshikoko,M,84,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The first perfume I fell in love with before the niche world,"This is the perfume I would buy over and over again when it ran out for a whole decade until I was opened to the world of niche.

I can say that it is an amazing perfume for lovers of powdery iris scents.

And here comes the but, over the years this perfume simply declined in quality and began to disappoint me with weak and disappointing performances to the point that I started looking for other perfumes and so I entered the world of niche and later I also sold the bottle I had with a heavy heart.

In the first few years that I bought it, around 2012, this perfume would not come off me all day and leave an excellent SILLAGE behind and now this perfume evaporates from me after two or three hours after it is mostly close to the skin.

a big disappointment - but on the other hand, it opened the door to this huge world of perfumes for me and overall I am happy.

Thank you to Christine Dior for all the years and I will not buy this perfume again.

Previously: 10/10.
Currently: 7/10."
Dior Homme Intense,01/15/2022,PedroCabral,M,147,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,What do you think?,"There's a big debate about which current men's perfume is more feminine, or metrosexual? Thierry Mugler A*Man? Midnight in Paris? Or Dior Homme Intense? I understand that sometimes we don't notice a certain note. But in the case of the lipstick note in DHI, I think it's hopeless to want to ignore it. The discussion is just one piece of the puzzle that, once formed, paints a very complex picture of what the human psyche is, and the patterns dictated by fashion through the ages.

Dior Homme Intense, for me, opens with lavender, vanilla and iris. In this case, it is the Íris that conveys this idea of lipstick or makeup and draws the attention of those who smell DHI. Gradually, the iris becomes more intense and powdery. It gets hotter, sensual. About 1 or 2 hours later, the plot starts to get thicker and more mysterious. I don't know what notes form this impression, but my guess would be pear, vetiver and amber (which together with vanilla and iris, form a chocolate-like aroma). This phase lasts for a long time, until the emergence of the base notes (more woody). However, even in the end, DHI is a composition based on the iris, which in this last stage also resembles baby powder.

Despite being a really intense fragrance, the name is not just a pretext, as it sometimes happens. It's warm and sweet, I think 2 or 3 sprays can be enough to ""fill a room"". Dior Homme Intense is too good to be limited to just one station or geographic point.

The connoisseur of good perfumes, now that he knows and wears Dior Homme Intense, should take it a step further. Imagine DH or DHI alongside a more floral fragrance? It could be L'Eau d'Issey. A little more powdery iris. More vanilla and tonka. Some sandalwood and anise. It's not all of these together, but side by side, like faces of a cube, one of the faces being DH/DHI. So the question that doesn't want to be silent is: what is a woman's perfume and what is a man's perfume? Think Dior Homme Intense and be careful not to bite your tongue."
Dior Homme Intense,10/06/2022,Troelsh,M,4,,10,Story time.,"Wanted to review this one several times, and I thought to myself.. maybe I should tell a real life story which this fragrance is highly attached to for me. That haven't been said countless of times already.

I work in the music industry, and I often work with vocalists for various projects. One day I got sent a video of a young beautiful blonde haired woman singing by a friend, and he told me I should try to contact her.

Some time past and I was searching for a woman vocalist to sing on a project of mine, after searching for a bit, I suddenly remembered my friend sent me that video, and I decided to contact the vocalist. Our conversation quite quickly went in another direction than the project, also the first time I figured out there's a message size limit on Facebook's Messenger. Instantly a match between me and her.

One day we got the courage to meet up for the project, which ended out with anything else than that, obviously. We spend the whole night together, like we had knew each other for much longer, in a way where nothing felt awkward. She left early in the morning to go to work, and the first message I woke up to was, my perfume was stock in her head, she had never smelled anything like it, and every time she thought of the smell she was picturing me. I asked her if she liked it, or if it was just because I was wearing it, she said, the smell is good, but it's because you are wearing it.

Which means to me, unique scents might not get the mass appeal, but in reality you are not looking for the mass appeal, because when someone likes you, they will associate that smell with you.
In other words, the smell is a part of who you are to other people, which learned me an important lesson. If someone likes you, they will also like the perfume you like to wear, or at least associate it with you, and that is good.

And for those who are curious about the project, I did see her in a few months, and we never ended up doing any work together, I was still not done with my ex girlfriend, so it ended that way. And yes, I wonder how my life would had turned if I had dared to give that relation a chance. Today 3 years later, I'm single.

When I wear this today, I think of that whole story, and I remember it as one of the most alluring periods I ever experienced.

Thanks Homme Intense for taking part of that story, maybe someday we will take a re-match."

Dior Homme Intense,04/07/2025,Capsicum,M,11,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Surprisingly seductive,"Honestly, I think that my favorite part is the opening 10-15 minutes with this fragrance. It’s just so layered and wonderful. To me, the opening beats out Dior Homme. That’s saying something, considering Dior Homme has become a staple in my rotation.

I’ve noted in subsequent comparisons between the two, that I enjoy Dior Homme more, overall. That being said, I will combine this two, and it’s essentially a 1A vs 1B scenario.

One of the main differences with Intense, is the lack of the leather note, when compared to the original. This is woodier, with a sweeter warmth.

The iris is still dominant, later on, but tempered when compared with Dior Homme. The lavender here, plays a pretty big role in how the iris gets to develop.

As it settles down, it draws more toward the powdery end of things, and there is definitely the cacao note that is found in the original Dior Homme lurking in this mixture.

It actually dries down into a rich, chocolate (somewhat vanilla) powder, gourmand and that’s how Intense separates itself from Dior Homme.

I get a fresh and semi-sweet fragrance, once it’s fully developed. This is all sitting on a dry base of cedar and vetiver. Powdery, clean, classy, and ."
Dior Homme Intense,11/17/2024,Razvanyke,M,215,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,THE BEST designer scent on the market.,"DHI is my first ever Dior perfume and my first bottle was purchased in 2011, since then I had three big 150ml bottles, this is the last one.

It has listed only 3 notes but it might also have a bit of sandalwood in the composition and something sweet: Florentine iris absolute, Ecuadorian ambrette seed, Virginia cedar

- When I first smelled this, over 12 years ago I fell in love with it instantly. This is a very complex and playful scent with an aura of mystery.
- The Iris is not feminine and the ambrette seed, which is a vegetal musk works wonders, it brings the imagination to life.
- The DHP is also very nice, but not as silky and playful as this one.
- It has a beautiful development, this is a bold scent which will fill a room. Since 2020 has a new package, but I think it is as great as before so no need to FOMO there for the older ones.

I think this will always stay into my collection, because it is complex, powdery, sweet but not gourmand and very manly. Plus the ladies like the lipstick smell of it, because it reminds them of their own make-up.

As a whole, this is a masterpiece from Master Demachy and most likely THE BEST designer scent on the market."

Both my wife and I were searching for a nice perfume. I wasn’t really into this perfume thing so we had to rely on the shop assistant. The nice lady asked what we were looking for but she misunderstood. She thought we were looking for a fragrance we could both wear. So she came up with DHI.
Alright.. I wasn’t really looking for a Homme fragrance for my wife but she sprayed it on her and.. boy does that smell good! Grassy but sweet! A very recognizable scent but I couldn’t quite make out what I smelled. Turned out it’s fresh carrots that it reminded me of (thanks @MrIDK :-)).

I told her we had to think about it but we kept smelling ourselves. It’s so good. Once the grassy opener dries off, it becomes a bit darker. But it keeps this high-acidity note to lure you in.

Dior Homme Intense,11/20/2021,ScentGrail,M,108,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,The Mighty DHI!,"Before I wrote this review, I took the time to think about if there was any other “bigger than life” fragrance that actually fulfilled customer and fragrance enthusiasts’ expectations as DHI did.

Rarely there are, few and usually released far between each other. I cannot tell you how much I’m happy when something creative as this gets deserved recognition while maintaining its lasting appeal.

One of my Holy Grail Scents, Homme Intense, regular Homme, and Homme Parfum have been with me during most of my fragrance journey.

TOP NOTES
this unique fragrance opens up with the aromas of powder, lipstick, makeup, aromatic herbs, and bitter citruses lurking in the background. The bitter bite combing from sage envelops the lavender, and amplifies it with the same bergamot found in the Dior Eau Sauvage Parfum 2017. Judging by the opening, you will be either disappointed or pleasantly surprised. Since we are already in the 2020s, this kind of semi-sweet, and powdery scents probably won’t shock you as they would back in the 2000s.

HEART NOTES
The scent warms up, the powdery iris overtakes almost everything experienced in the opening, and the fragrance starts to project even more. This note is present almost until the fragrance fades away from your skin. The genius move from Demachy to include this show-stealing Pear fruit is probably the sole reason why DHI is more popular than any other Dior Homme fragrance, and keeps the iris from never going fully into the feminine side.

BASE NOTES
One thing I wish it stayed longer would be the iris. By the time the fragrance reaches the dry down, the floral aspects are gone and don’t get me wrong the dry down remains great, but it would have been nice if that floral edginess stayed during the whole wake of the scent. The further DHI dries down, what is left is warm and musky vanilla with hints of chocolate, and is great.

This is the first fragrance I purchased on my fragrance journey that isn't the typical, cheaper side of the fragrance word.
I've bottles from 2012-2014 year with formula- 05443/A.
Dior fragrances are timeless. It's true that a lot of women ( If not all) love this fragrance, but i want to review it as a guy who doesn't wear fragrances just to please women.

A very similar fragrance to the Dior homme yet a lot darker, more ""velvety"" and smooth with a denser aura and a voluptuous and rich presence due to the prominent upgrade of the all so familiar and beloved iris, creamy cocoa & buttery vanilla combo. On top of that, DHI also smells woodier and softly leathery thus emitting a more masculine vibe than its predecessor. Very warm, very sexy, an excellent choice for nights out.

This fragrance is for intense men. You need a strong personality to pull this off. Even though now women are so used to it it doesn't turned them on anymore, you can still wear this fragrance and you will live a very memorable winter. Dior fragrance are all timeless classics.

Dior Homme Intense,12/22/2014,Rickbr,M,190,,0,,"This reformulation version seems to me somehow like a middle term between the two previous Dior Homme Concentrations, the EDT and the EDP Intense, in terms of how the scent develops on skin. It seems to rescue the powdery iris aspect of the EDT and to soften the vanillic drydown of the Intense turning it into something more woody (but not with not so much cedar as the original EDT seemed to be on my skin). With this, the Shalimar-like vanilla homage has gone alsmot completely, but the elegance is still here. It'd be very nice if they bring back the original intense formulation,reworked maybe in a pure parfum concentration."

Dior Homme Intense,12/24/2014,Keppy,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,CLASSIC SCENT,"After reading a lot of reviews and saw how this juice
was hyped i decided to blind buy it. And this was my
first designer perfume. At first spray i was unhappy at
the opening; i was expecting something ""wow""
considering all the hype it got. I put it up for sale the
following week, although I was still using it. I put it on
one evening for a party. And I got my first compliment
on a perfume. My friend told me “you smell so good, I
love this perfume”. I was glad at last; all hope wasn’t
lost after all.
So I thought this fragrance was meant for the evening,
especially when it’s cold and raining or on cold
mornings. At these times I still smell it on myself after
a couple of hours.
I also discovered my DHI didn’t perform so well when
it’s sunny and hot (Nigerian weather). So knew when
to use it or not. I finally settled for this masterpiece.
Nine months later am planning to get another bottle or
the parfum version.

SUMMARY: Soft and sweet, smells feminine in the beginning. But later the masculinity starts creeping in after an hour or so. It performs best in cold evenings and winter. It's suit and tie scent."
Dior Homme Intense,09/08/2023,Linadia,F,23,,5,More like Intense headache.,"Everything about this perfume is mediocre. To the very last bit, last drop of it - I can't stand this smell so much.
Strong, smelly, discustingly smelly. One spray fills the entire apartment or house with it and you get to taste it on your tongue for the rest of the day!!!

What do you smell, once you apply it? That's right - nothing nice. Alchohol right away, followed up by maybe a slight hint of something powdery and sweet, but, no, excuse me, it aint no iris, alright.

The bottle is mediocre as well. Chunky lid, chunky square body. Amazing performance. How to make the most default, yet disgusting hand sanitizer? Yeah, ask Dior with this ""Homme INTENSE"" perfume. Horrendous."
Dior Homme Intense,08/09/2023,Odysseus,M,13,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Extraordinary!,"When it comes to sophisticated fragrances that exude elegance and masculinity, Dior Homme Intense by Dior is a true standout. This extraordinary scent is a captivating blend of luxurious ingredients that leaves a lasting impression wherever you go.

Upon the first spritz, the fragrance opens with a burst of citrusy freshness, primarily from notes of bergamot. This invigorating start effortlessly transitions into the heart of the fragrance, where the mesmerizing combo of lavender and iris takes center stage. The floral notes mingle beautifully, creating a harmonious and refined aura.

As the hours pass, Dior Homme Intense evolves into its enchanting base notes. The smooth, velvety cocoa note emerges, adding a touch of warmth and sensuality to the fragrance. The rich and creamy amber note enhances its depth, creating a captivating blend that commands attention. Together, these base notes create a comforting and irresistible allure that makes it perfect for romantic evenings or formal events.

What truly sets Dior Homme Intense apart is its impeccable longevity and sillage. This fragrance is a definite powerhouse, generously projecting its sophisticated essence for hours on end. It engulfs the wearer in an elegant cloud of scent that demands attention without being overpowering.

The versatility of Dior Homme Intense is another reason why it deserves all the accolades it receives. Suitable for both daytime and evening wear, this fragrance seamlessly transitions from professional settings to nights out on the town. Its alluring and refined composition effortlessly adapts to any occasion, making it a must-have in any fragrance collection.

Not only does Dior Homme Intense resonate with refinement, but it also evokes an air of confidence and charisma. It possesses an innate ability to instill a sense of self-assuredness in the wearer, complementing their style and enhancing their overall presence.

In conclusion, Dior Homme Intense by Dior is an exceptional fragrance that epitomizes class, refinement, and masculinity.

Dior Homme Intense,07/26/2025,Averycj,M,50,,3,An Otherworldly Perfume.,"After a decant order full of stinkers, I had to revisit a true classic. This is one of the greatest perfumes in human history.

It’s powdery. It’s sophisticated. It’s sexy in a way no other scent quite achieves. I don’t know how to describe it other than it smells like the bottom of your grandma’s makeup bag. And I mean that in the best, most beautiful way possible. The iris note is unmatched.

I can reminisce over so many memories with friends by smelling this perfume. Oh, how I miss them. It's so wholesome yet emotional for me. It’s attached to memories I’ll never want to forget, which just makes it more special for me.

This is not a casual wear scent. This is for occasions. It projects like a monster and sticks to your skin forever. It’s unforgettable.

One of the highest-rated perfumes on this site for a reason, and rightfully so. I pray this scent never gets discontinued.
I’ll never get bored of it."
Dior Homme Intense,03/07/2025,Moetorious,M,19,,3,Simply one of the best of all time,"The pre 2025 formulation. Simply one of the very best, even compared to much more expansive niche.

Sophisticated, complex yet simple, addicting, intoxicating, yet very explicit in its subtelty. Smells high quality and luxorious, especialy for its price. Maybe one of the best deals in the world of perfumery. You get a straight up masterpiece for the money of a mere designer.

How lucky I feel having gotten one of the last pre 2025 bottles as I believe they reformulated it a little bit, making it just a bit less complex, dumped it down a tiny notch just enough for it to lose its whispering treasure. What a horrible crime.

And as Dior Homme Parfum (2014) is just as much of an absolute masterpiece, for my personal taste the intense is enough. The intense is all I need in the space of iris perfection. The parfum is stellar, more complex, more deep, richer and probably one of the very best of rose perfumes, but for me it is just too much of it. Thus, I prefer the simpler, straighter to the point flowery genius of the intense.

François Demachy I solute you and your immense genius. You defined a generation of perfumery. What a tragic letting you go. May another virtuoso take your place. May there be another day.

God bless."
Dior Homme Intense,01/14/2022,Indominable,M,23,,3,Stunning,"I just bought a newer bottle of DHI, and it seems much weaker than earlier formulations that I also have. Anyone else notice a difference? I sure do.

This is one of the best modern mens fragrances. The iris dominates throughout, and a powdery undertone anchored with smoky wood notes make it irresistible. Every single time I’ve ever worn this I’ve had compliments and questions. This is for the confident man, as the powdery iris notes are very sweet. Go easy with this one, 3-4 sprays is all you need for all day. I’ve washed some shirts 2-3 times and can still smell this on them. Even on days when I don’t wear this, I will still pick it up and take a deep satisfying whiff."
Dior Homme Intense,10/21/2024,Irruzzarboss,M,5,,2,Doubtful,"Don't understand the hype about Dior Homme Intense. It's not bad, but also not great. It's a fragrance only for the fall / winter. The first sprays are almost identical to the original Dior Homme. After half hour it get's a twist of his own, intenser and also more powdery. The scent keeps a half day on my skin. It's only suitable for colder days and absolutely not for summer. I prefer the original Dior Homme over this one, no doubt. And for the price there are better fragrances than the Dio Homme Intense."
Sauvage,08/27/2015,BrianBuchanan,M,363,,11,Clockwork Orange,"Powdered orange juice concentrate, neutral synthetic plasticy filler, an intense metallic tang, fugitive red peppery note, sweetness, powder, a woody amber undertone and a black plastic 'bergamot' resin that smells more like it came from a hydrocarbon cracking plant than Calabria.

Sauvage follows in the vein of Boss In Motion and 1 Million with a distinctly uninspired coarse and lumpen orange profile. The metal note becomes so overblown that it is really unpleasant, and there isn't a heart accord to provide any relief, it goes in a straight line from metallic orange to woody amber and sticks around longer than an African dictator.

While I was testing it, a friend asked me to never wear it in her company again. Appropriately, as well as wild and savage, the French word sauvage also means unsociable.

I can understand the lack of creativity and artistic judgement, just the sight of the box is enough to set the alarm bells ringing, but what is inexplicable is why LVMH chose to debase the reputation of a great classic by plagiarising its name for this derivative dross."
Sauvage,09/03/2015,ColinM,M,516,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Easy to underrate!,"My expectations for Sauvage weren’t extremely low, but neither that high for sure. I was convinced it was probably better than the undeserved skepticism it seems getting here and there from fragrance snobs, but nothing groundbreaking for sure. Now that I’ve finally snatched a sample, I must say it quite reflects the idea I had about it – and actually, it is slightly better than I expected. First of all, in broad terms, it is probably right to consider this the first “Dior’s Bleu de Chanel” (or name another fragrance like that), as the league is more or less the same; but contrary to Bleu de Chanel (and most of similar scents), besides showing a clearly better quality, Sauvage avoids any boring, pretentious, preppy middle-class mannerism and adds a subtle touch of pungent vibrancy, of “rawness” as the name suggests. It is in fact a compelling contemporary take on a classic green fougère theme, opening with a bracing, peppery, crisp green-bergamot accord with a peculiar sort of “cedrat” heart, something bitter and earthy that provides a really nice sort of musky-sour shade to the crisp, fresh leafiness of the main accord. And then there’s a subtle, yet deep base of synthetic ambergris enhanced by some generic woods – “generic” means here nothing smelling overly cheap, but surely not the greatest woody notes around.

So imagine a quite classic and apparently mannered green masculine scent centered on pepper, citrus notes and dry ambery woods with some mossy patchouli lingering below, and give it a modern shape with an exotic, and slightly sombre touch halfway “organic” and “futuristic” (thanks to the cleverly-fitting warm and “grey” note of ambroxan). I must note that Sauvage feels quite much dry throughout its evolution, which I guess may be taken as a “masculine” added value, and also shows a pleasantly nondescript sort of dark, bitter-fizzy feel with a Mediterranean vibe, which reminds me of the balmy smell of air on a cloudy day in some woodland by the sea. Quite some interesting contrasts, overall: dryness, bitterness, warmth. So, again: an office-safe scent for sure, but in no way cheap or uncreative. Nothing exciting, but nothing bad to say the least. It just offers the right tiny amount of creativity within a “pop”, crowdpleasing frame. I think Demachy did quite a nice job in creating a deceptively generic fragrance with some sparkles of dark rawness. And I also appreciate the fact Sauvage smells really simple overall, almost minimalistic composition-wise, and with no overly cheap nuances. Simply put, it smells nice and it isn’t boring at all. As hours pass the ambroxan-woody-patchouli base takes the main stage, making Sauvage smell darker, warmer, dustier, more (again, “generically” ) classy and less bitter, with also some (good!) vetiver popping out. Still quite dry but at the same time quite comforting and sophisticated.

To cut it short, I think this is a good fragrance, quite more peculiar than it may seem at a first rushed test, and I think it is fully justified for Dior to have something like this among their range. Not everything has to be creative, or flashy, or (more or less faithfully) luxury or make some “statement”. Sauvage is a quality, discreet everyday scent with a seducing dark-organic twist and a nice evolution, smooth enough to appeal classic wearers but quality enough to be worthy a sniff for everybody else, including niche-heads. And it would surely be a mistake to dismiss this too early labelling it mediocre or cheap, since it isn’t either of the two. I probably wouldn’t buy this, but I’m glad Dior introduced it.

Sauvage,03/02/2017,Muotarek,M,51,,7,Versatile/Underrated gem,"Despite the many negative reviews, i find Dior Sauvage is really really good scent, i use it on a daily basis i guess, my colleagues at work love it, and it gets me compliments, it's very versatile scent, it easily lasts 8 hours on my skin, it's not overpowering scent yet people will detect its presence, i don't care if it's synthetic or whatsoever, it's all about if you find it good, then buy it, don't follow the hype whether it's good or bad, because at the end of the day it's a matter of taste."
Sauvage,05/22/2022,LIZABS68,M,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,"Amazing scent, ignore the noise-makers/Sauvage haters.","Dior Sauvage is one of the best fragrances that money can buy, damn your haters I will continue to buy you with my hard earned cash for as long as you are available my love, nothing compares to you. This perfume is my favourite among almost 130 collection of niche and designer fragrances that I have, it's an excellent aroma, very masculine and attractive. To hate something because it's popular is immature.
You can't pretend this isn't a nice fragrance. Sure, it's extremely popular because it is very nice. BMW and Mercedes Benz cars are popular and we still buy them because they are reliable, prayer of every good business person is to have a product that is very successful and popular. Men like this. Women like this. It projects. It's arguably the longest-lasting blue fragrance ever made, go and make your own if you have a problem with popular products and stop hating.

Sauvage,01/06/2023,Patj1994,M,29,,7,Disgusting,"So I finally got a small sample of this yesterday after surprisingly never having smelled it before and all i can say is…this stuff is absolutely repulsive. Within 15 minutes of wearing only three sprays i had a splitting migraine (im guessing from the overload of ambroxen). I don’t know how anybody could possibly enjoy this fragrance. Smells like a dirty, musky old man that hasn’t showered in weeks with some spices sprinkled on top. Smells like a cheap, synthetic, chemically mess. Want to smell cheap and like every college frathouse d-bag? Wear this

The fact that this is as popular as it is truly shocks me"

People love it while I don’t find it such exquisite. It's fresh powdery with foggy spicy warmth within and soft woodsy base, resembling to many others mainstream fragrances but not similar to anyone!

Sauvage is a purpose, versatile, winter-to-summer, day or night, casual-to-formal fragrance with good longevity and sillage. What a peaceful and handy perfume!

Sauvage,04/17/2018,Eyedean,M,22,,5,Let’s blame the pirate!,"Love, hate, love, hate.... a lot has been said about this one. No matter what I think or what YOU think, the crowd loves it. That’s just the way it is.
The downside is that it’s exactly everywhere. Damn you Johnny Pirate, its all your fault!"
Sauvage,10/07/2023,Adamrbz,M,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The hated gem,"When Dior Sauvage edt first came, it was a surprise for everybody. Dior always use to make perfume for mature men (Eau Sauvage, Fahrenheit). But with Dior Sauvage, they completely changed the dynamic of the brand. Dior sauvage was a blue/aromatic/spicy fragrance with a little touch of shower gel, which, of course, aim for a younger audience. Despite this fact, I remembered that my father fell in love with it. When it came out, in 2015, he immediately bought it. He was 50 at that time and I was 15. I still remember sneaking in his room to take a few spray before going to school or a little night out. It was a crowd pleaser and attention grabbing perfume

But slowly, the reputation of the perfume became worst and worst to the point that neither of us wore it until few days ago. Now that nobody still wear dior sauvage, we can reappreciate it and wear it peacefully.

For me, this perfume didn’t deserve all this hate. You can’t hate a perfume because of its public. A perfume have to be judged only by itself and for me, Dior Sauvage is still a masterpiece to this day. I have the edt, edp and perfum version and I can say that despite having +80 perfumes including niche, designer and clone, all the 3 version are really good and not redundant to have."
Sauvage,06/24/2025,Ceesie,M,132,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,What's left to say?,"As I’m squeezing out the last drops of my sample I’m wondering what to do; buy a bottle or not. Yeah I had a couple of official samples but I’m emptying my last one. It’s such an iconic scent. Fruity opening, sharp and bold spiciness for the rest of its lifetime. Masculine yet youthfull.

Somehow I associate this scent with my own youth. I went full puberty in the 90’s, long before this beastly perfume was born. It would have fit that era quite nicely though. It’s grungy, it’s loud, it’s literally wild. In fact, quite the opposite of how I feel the 2010’s were. Yet there it was. And it was everywhere. As if every adolescent needed it. I’m too old for clubbing but I’m sure those discos reeked of the stuff.

I love it when I wear it myself too. But I can’t help but feeling like an old guy wearing clothes that are too hip. And it’s so recognisable, it’s embarrassing. Some time ago I went to dinner and the waiter was a boy not even in his 20’s. He didn’t really know how to dose but he clearly wore Sauvage. The whole restaurant reeked of it and I lost my appetite a bit. Then after that I walked the dog through a beautiful park. An older guy passed me by on a bicycle. A bit chubby, grey hair, a bit scruffy. Yep, a cloud of Sauvage travelled along with him.

So will I buy a full bottle? I’d love to but it’s more of a guilty pleasure than anything else. In the mean time if I want to smell it, I just go out on the streets, it’s everywhere."

I tested this one in perfumery on wrist and sleeve, only one shot. Projects strong and long. 5-6 hours i took a shower and stil can sniff it on my skin. On my clothes it stays a few days, literaly till laundry.
But the price........my substitute is Byblos Leather Sensation. Almost same scent, 2-3 times weaker on performance (on some skins remains very long, unfortunatelly on mine only 6 hours), 12-14 times chiepier.

Sauvage,06/17/2025,Averycj,M,50,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,One of the G.O.A.T.'s,"Dior Sauvage EDT gets a lot of hate in the fragrance world, but let’s be real: it’s a modern classic. It’s versatile, mass-appealing, and undeniably fresh. There’s a reason it’s so popular.

Let’s look at the facts. Around 60% of men wear fragrance regularly, but only a small percentage of them, let's say maybe 5–10% are actually involved in the fragrance community or consider themselves serious collectors. So for the average person, Sauvage isn’t overplayed. It’s just a well-loved, solid choice.

Think about it: outside of your circle, how often do you actually smell Sauvage out in the wild? For me, it's not often, if at all. Online echo chambers have really brainwashed people into thinking this is a bad fragrance or is associated with negative things like exes or fuckboys.

There’s a reason it’s a go-to: it smells great. Sharp bergamot, clean ambroxan, and crisp pepper. It’s fresh, sexy, and fits any setting. Gym, date, wedding, office... it works.

If you collect fragrances, you should own this. A staple in designer perfumery. It performs well, lasts impressively for an EDT, and gets compliments. What more do you want?

Don’t let influencers or frag snob culture make you second-guess yourself. Wear what you love. Be confident. Smell amazing. If you’re afraid of smelling like her ex, don’t switch fragrances. Become the kind of person she’ll never compare to anyone else. Sauvage EDT may not be the rarest scent in your collection, but it’s earned its place on the frag Mount Rushmore."
Sauvage,10/06/2021,HugoMontez,M,81,,4,The Modern Man,"I like it. Is fresh, citrusy, a little bit smoky, metallic, slightly sweet and very masculine.

Dior has some of the best and most iconic fragrances. Iris (Dior homme), aromatic citrus (Eau Sauvage), violet leaf (Fahrenheit), Fig (Dune for men), etc ... Sauvage brings the metallic-amber compound (ambroxan) and a juicy Bergamot to offer a very fresh, modern and long lasting experience.

I saw many hate when it was released and for the simple fact that it smells boring, screechy and not interesting. But the fact is that 6 years later, is one of the best sellers and a very influential fragrance. An iconic one, like it or not. Like Fahrenheit is. Or even 1 million. Fragrances that not everybody love but they defined a style, a wave of new fragrances, a status quo.

Sauvage inspired many others but it still the best combination of metallic and fresh citrus. The Elixir is also great but in a different way. Many will compare it to Bleu de Chanel but i don't find them similar in many aspects. While Bleu is more a traditional woody aromatic with an ambery base, Sauvage is more citrusy with a weird metallic ambroxan note.

If you want a modern masculine, with good quality and mass appeal, go for it. Don't be affeaid to buy a best seller. It's really decent and i recommend it for a signature scent or just to grab and go. Never fails and lasts +8h.

Fahrenheit, Eau Sauvage and Dior Homme are legends in Dior's lineup, and although this is not a masterpiece, is still a staple.

This scent is one hundred percent guaranteed to get me compliments when I wear it to a gathering. I just wore it to a wedding this weekend and when a fellow guest hugged me, she commented on how good I smelled. I greatly enjoy the powdery make-up smell mixed with the cocoa, vanilla and iris. Truly unique. I find this fragrance very special and unlike any other in my collection. It's hard to find so I'm thrilled to own two 100 ml. bottles of it. I don't ever want to be without this one. Definitely in the top 5 of my entire collection. Perfection in a bottle! I love it!"
Dior Homme Intense,04/22/2014,Slimdutoi,M,1,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Not my cup of tea,"With winter approaching I've been on the lookout for a unique classy fragrance to standout on the cold winter nights. Read some good reviews about Dior Intense. But considering the price I decided to first venture to the local fragrance store to sample it. I have a decent collection of scents, maybe 15 to 20. So guess you could say I'm a fragrance junkie. But my approach is always to first sample a fragrance on my skin before spending hard earned cash. Sprayed about three whiffs of this highly rated parfum on my skin. Dear oh dear. It is certainly long lasting. And powdery as many reviews suggest. My disappointment is that after if i bought this i would be spending a load of cash on this to smell like a stronger version of Johnsons Baby Powder. The notes just get worse for me. I really wanted to like this scent. But just kept getting this annoying baby powder scent instead of a more masculine fragrance. Cannot understand the mega raves it gets. Maybe will try it on my skin again to decide. But for now i am yet to find a Parfum that wows me. Both Jaipur and this have not impressed. Gave my Jaipur Edp away as I could not stand the smell after two or three uses. They are built to last as a Parfum should. But the scents are too annoying for my liking and unique, yes, but not in a good way."

As a huge fan of Dior Homme 2005 , i was very excited when I received this as a gift , I must say its very nicely done with Iris and Vanilla(too much imo) but I badly miss the leather and cacao here which I got in original EDT, and that is the main difference I see between them , I just like it but dont know its a nose fatigue or something else , the over prevailing vanilla is not letting me enjoy the beautiful scent behind it.
Love the original which is far more better, masculine and very versatile piece of art if compared to this intense version."

Maybe slightly woodier too. Layering the two of them using Dior Homme Intense's drydown as a base for Dior Homme brought me this close to getting rid of 90% of the rest of my wardrobe. I am not familiar with the alleged variations among Dior Homme and Dior Homme Intense batches, all I know is that my 2014 bottle of the Intense is a glorious, delightfully non-redundant companion to its timeless brother.

Dior Homme Intense,01/31/2017,RhythmnHues,M,51,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A Modern classic,"Finally, a fragrance that dares to be different—a vanillic, cocoa/orris floral for men that feels like a sigh of relief in today’s overly citrus-splashed lineup. And yes, it's absolutely worth the hype. Dang!

But let’s talk reformulation. I don’t usually get swept up in the drama, but this one threw me for a loop. My first encounter was with a 2015 version—a stunner with lush cocoa and ambrette seed that stole the spotlight, while iris and leather played a delicate supporting role. Smooth, seductive, unforgettable.

Then came a 2014 bottle. Totally different mood. Cocoa and ambrette take a backseat, easing in much later and far softer. Instead, iris and leather dominate with thick, buttery orris root and a nutty ambrette that's almost hazelnut-like, paired with suede. Musky, vanillic, and woody—feels deep, rich, and soulful.

Either way, I’m hooked. I lean slightly towards the 2015 for its velvet-smooth cocoa/orris elegance. But no matter the year, performance is top-tier—radiant projection, beautiful sillage, and longevity that just won't quit.

If you're even a little curious, go ahead and try it. You might just discover something unforgettable hiding in the drydown.

Dior Homme Intense,02/24/2025,Moshikoko,M,84,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The first perfume I fell in love with before the niche world,"This is the perfume I would buy over and over again when it ran out for a whole decade until I was opened to the world of niche.

I can say that it is an amazing perfume for lovers of powdery iris scents.

And here comes the but, over the years this perfume simply declined in quality and began to disappoint me with weak and disappointing performances to the point that I started looking for other perfumes and so I entered the world of niche and later I also sold the bottle I had with a heavy heart.

In the first few years that I bought it, around 2012, this perfume would not come off me all day and leave an excellent SILLAGE behind and now this perfume evaporates from me after two or three hours after it is mostly close to the skin.

a big disappointment - but on the other hand, it opened the door to this huge world of perfumes for me and overall I am happy.

Thank you to Christine Dior for all the years and I will not buy this perfume again.

Currently: 7/10."
Dior Homme Intense,01/15/2022,PedroCabral,M,147,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,What do you think?,"There's a big debate about which current men's perfume is more feminine, or metrosexual? Thierry Mugler A*Man? Midnight in Paris? Or Dior Homme Intense? I understand that sometimes we don't notice a certain note. But in the case of the lipstick note in DHI, I think it's hopeless to want to ignore it. The discussion is just one piece of the puzzle that, once formed, paints a very complex picture of what the human psyche is, and the patterns dictated by fashion through the ages.

Dior Homme Intense, for me, opens with lavender, vanilla and iris. In this case, it is the Íris that conveys this idea of lipstick or makeup and draws the attention of those who smell DHI. Gradually, the iris becomes more intense and powdery. It gets hotter, sensual. About 1 or 2 hours later, the plot starts to get thicker and more mysterious. I don't know what notes form this impression, but my guess would be pear, vetiver and amber (which together with vanilla and iris, form a chocolate-like aroma). This phase lasts for a long time, until the emergence of the base notes (more woody). However, even in the end, DHI is a composition based on the iris, which in this last stage also resembles baby powder.

Despite being a really intense fragrance, the name is not just a pretext, as it sometimes happens. It's warm and sweet, I think 2 or 3 sprays can be enough to ""fill a room"". Dior Homme Intense is too good to be limited to just one station or geographic point.

The connoisseur of good perfumes, now that he knows and wears Dior Homme Intense, should take it a step further. Imagine DH or DHI alongside a more floral fragrance? It could be L'Eau d'Issey. A little more powdery iris. More vanilla and tonka. Some sandalwood and anise. It's not all of these together, but side by side, like faces of a cube, one of the faces being DH/DHI. So the question that doesn't want to be silent is: what is a woman's perfume and what is a man's perfume? Think Dior Homme Intense and be careful not to bite your tongue."

Dior Homme Intense,08/22/2022,GeorgeReid,M,37,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"Three E's: Easy, Effeminate and Elegant.","After hearing about Dior Homme Intense, and consistently seeing it in the top 10 fragrances in Parfumo over the past few months, I bought a sample and wanted to know if it was worth the hype.

----

First, let us talk about the smell.

Dior Homme Intense is not a complex fragrance. It opens with a powdery floral that is almost certainly iris, which mixes with a light musky sweetness. Once the iris wears off, the cedar becomes more prominent and mixes with the musky sweetness that continues to linger.

Dior Homme Intense is an example of how simplicity can work in a fragrance.

One of the largest critiques about the smell is that Dior Homme Intense smells feminine, especially to men who grew up around women and know what lipstick sets smell like. Perhaps if the era was the mid-2000s or earlier, Dior Homme Intense would have a different name, and advertising would market toward women.

I strongly believe that women can easily wear this fragrance with zero problems. While cedar is considered more masculine, the iris and light musk is more prominent.

That said, the likely goal of Dior Homme Intense is to create the allure of an elegant gentleman that consistently has women around him so frequently, that they leave their scent on him. It succeeds, as the fragrance presents a captivating and alluring aura.

----

A 100 ml bottle of Dior Homme Intense has the traditional classy feel of a men’s fragrance.

A clear rectangular bottle with a translucent black cap is not exactly grand bottle artistry. However, the classic look is elegant, and will always look great on a dresser or on a display shelf, nor is the bottle embarrassing enough that one must hide it in a drawer, a closet, or inside the box.

----

In terms of performance, Dior Homme Intense is outstanding.

With projection, Dior Homme Intense hits a rare balance that is difficult to achieve. The overall projection is strong and noticeable, but the fragrance does not overwhelm everyone when in proximity, allowing for more people to move closer. Again, elegance without being overbearing or trying too hard.

In terms of longevity, two sprays of Dior Homme Intense last for about twelve hours, with the opening lasting for about three.

This is a fragrance that will follow a person throughout the day without a respray, but a person wearing it will not feel like they are drowning in it.

----

Thanks to the unique performance of Dior Homme Intense, it gains some flexibility that is difficult to achieve with fragrances that have strong projection, making it easier to wear.

As a result, it is usable throughout the year, with the only questionable time to use it is on a blazing summer day outside. (As musky smells can radiate in the heat.) Also, while Dior Homme Intense is fantastic in the fall and winter, I will go against the grain, and state that the fragrance easily shines the brightest in the spring.

As for social scenarios, Dior Homme Intense works in an office or school environment without annoying everyone and is usable daily.

On the negative side, the musky aspect may be too much for the gym, even if it is on the lighter side.

That said, ultimately, the best usage for Dior Homme Intense is as a nighttime fragrance (especially on a date night). While lightly sweet, it will stand out as unique because it is not the typical super-sweet fragrances that most people smell on men in 2022.

----

Overall, Dior Homme Intense is an outstanding fragrance and is mostly worth the hype it receives, and I bought a bottle after trying the sample. However, I highly recommend sampling first, as the critiques are valid, and the fragrance is not for everyone.

For example, someone looking for an artistic or complex fragrance to make a statement should look elsewhere. Likewise, someone who is looking for a more traditional masculine fragrance, or someone that hates powdery scents will be massively disappointed.

That said, Dior Homme Intense is best for people trying to be considerate of other people while having their own identity. They want a fragrance that projects, but do not choke out a room. They want a fragrance that stands out for going against the common trends, but also works in attracting positive attention. If this is you, you may like the results."
Dior Homme Intense,10/06/2022,Troelsh,M,4,,10,Story time.,"Wanted to review this one several times, and I thought to myself.. maybe I should tell a real life story which this fragrance is highly attached to for me. That haven't been said countless of times already.

I work in the music industry, and I often work with vocalists for various projects. One day I got sent a video of a young beautiful blonde haired woman singing by a friend, and he told me I should try to contact her.

Some time past and I was searching for a woman vocalist to sing on a project of mine, after searching for a bit, I suddenly remembered my friend sent me that video, and I decided to contact the vocalist. Our conversation quite quickly went in another direction than the project, also the first time I figured out there's a message size limit on Facebook's Messenger. Instantly a match between me and her.

One day we got the courage to meet up for the project, which ended out with anything else than that, obviously. We spend the whole night together, like we had knew each other for much longer, in a way where nothing felt awkward. She left early in the morning to go to work, and the first message I woke up to was, my perfume was stock in her head, she had never smelled anything like it, and every time she thought of the smell she was picturing me. I asked her if she liked it, or if it was just because I was wearing it, she said, the smell is good, but it's because you are wearing it.

Which means to me, unique scents might not get the mass appeal, but in reality you are not looking for the mass appeal, because when someone likes you, they will associate that smell with you.
In other words, the smell is a part of who you are to other people, which learned me an important lesson. If someone likes you, they will also like the perfume you like to wear, or at least associate it with you, and that is good.

And for those who are curious about the project, I did see her in a few months, and we never ended up doing any work together, I was still not done with my ex girlfriend, so it ended that way. And yes, I wonder how my life would had turned if I had dared to give that relation a chance. Today 3 years later, I'm single.

When I wear this today, I think of that whole story, and I remember it as one of the most alluring periods I ever experienced.

Thanks Homme Intense for taking part of that story, maybe someday we will take a re-match."

Dior Homme Intense,11/17/2024,Razvanyke,M,215,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,THE BEST designer scent on the market.,"DHI is my first ever Dior perfume and my first bottle was purchased in 2011, since then I had three big 150ml bottles, this is the last one.

It has listed only 3 notes but it might also have a bit of sandalwood in the composition and something sweet: Florentine iris absolute, Ecuadorian ambrette seed, Virginia cedar

- When I first smelled this, over 12 years ago I fell in love with it instantly. This is a very complex and playful scent with an aura of mystery.
- The Iris is not feminine and the ambrette seed, which is a vegetal musk works wonders, it brings the imagination to life.
- The DHP is also very nice, but not as silky and playful as this one.
- It has a beautiful development, this is a bold scent which will fill a room. Since 2020 has a new package, but I think it is as great as before so no need to FOMO there for the older ones.

I think this will always stay into my collection, because it is complex, powdery, sweet but not gourmand and very manly. Plus the ladies like the lipstick smell of it, because it reminds them of their own make-up.

As a whole, this is a masterpiece from Master Demachy and most likely THE BEST designer scent on the market."

On many occasions wearing the perfume I get a lot of compliments and questions like what are you wearing and all. At some point I had to stop wearing as can be very addictive.

I’ve noted in subsequent comparisons between the two, that I enjoy Dior Homme more, overall. That being said, I will combine this two, and it’s essentially a 1A vs 1B scenario.

One of the main differences with Intense, is the lack of the leather note, when compared to the original. This is woodier, with a sweeter warmth.

The iris is still dominant, later on, but tempered when compared with Dior Homme. The lavender here, plays a pretty big role in how the iris gets to develop.

As it settles down, it draws more toward the powdery end of things, and there is definitely the cacao note that is found in the original Dior Homme lurking in this mixture.

It actually dries down into a rich, chocolate (somewhat vanilla) powder, gourmand and that’s how Intense separates itself from Dior Homme.

I get a fresh and semi-sweet fragrance, once it’s fully developed. This is all sitting on a dry base of cedar and vetiver. Powdery, clean, classy, and ."

Both my wife and I were searching for a nice perfume. I wasn’t really into this perfume thing so we had to rely on the shop assistant. The nice lady asked what we were looking for but she misunderstood. She thought we were looking for a fragrance we could both wear. So she came up with DHI.
Alright.. I wasn’t really looking for a Homme fragrance for my wife but she sprayed it on her and.. boy does that smell good! Grassy but sweet! A very recognizable scent but I couldn’t quite make out what I smelled. Turned out it’s fresh carrots that it reminded me of (thanks @MrIDK :-)).

I told her we had to think about it but we kept smelling ourselves. It’s so good. Once the grassy opener dries off, it becomes a bit darker. But it keeps this high-acidity note to lure you in.

Dior Homme Intense,11/20/2021,ScentGrail,M,108,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,The Mighty DHI!,"Before I wrote this review, I took the time to think about if there was any other “bigger than life” fragrance that actually fulfilled customer and fragrance enthusiasts’ expectations as DHI did.

Rarely there are, few and usually released far between each other. I cannot tell you how much I’m happy when something creative as this gets deserved recognition while maintaining its lasting appeal.

One of my Holy Grail Scents, Homme Intense, regular Homme, and Homme Parfum have been with me during most of my fragrance journey.

TOP NOTES
this unique fragrance opens up with the aromas of powder, lipstick, makeup, aromatic herbs, and bitter citruses lurking in the background. The bitter bite combing from sage envelops the lavender, and amplifies it with the same bergamot found in the Dior Eau Sauvage Parfum 2017. Judging by the opening, you will be either disappointed or pleasantly surprised. Since we are already in the 2020s, this kind of semi-sweet, and powdery scents probably won’t shock you as they would back in the 2000s.

HEART NOTES
The scent warms up, the powdery iris overtakes almost everything experienced in the opening, and the fragrance starts to project even more. This note is present almost until the fragrance fades away from your skin. The genius move from Demachy to include this show-stealing Pear fruit is probably the sole reason why DHI is more popular than any other Dior Homme fragrance, and keeps the iris from never going fully into the feminine side.

BASE NOTES
One thing I wish it stayed longer would be the iris. By the time the fragrance reaches the dry down, the floral aspects are gone and don’t get me wrong the dry down remains great, but it would have been nice if that floral edginess stayed during the whole wake of the scent. The further DHI dries down, what is left is warm and musky vanilla with hints of chocolate, and is great.

This is the first fragrance I purchased on my fragrance journey that isn't the typical, cheaper side of the fragrance word.
I've bottles from 2012-2014 year with formula- 05443/A.
Dior fragrances are timeless. It's true that a lot of women ( If not all) love this fragrance, but i want to review it as a guy who doesn't wear fragrances just to please women.

A very similar fragrance to the Dior homme yet a lot darker, more ""velvety"" and smooth with a denser aura and a voluptuous and rich presence due to the prominent upgrade of the all so familiar and beloved iris, creamy cocoa & buttery vanilla combo. On top of that, DHI also smells woodier and softly leathery thus emitting a more masculine vibe than its predecessor. Very warm, very sexy, an excellent choice for nights out.

This fragrance is for intense men. You need a strong personality to pull this off. Even though now women are so used to it it doesn't turned them on anymore, you can still wear this fragrance and you will live a very memorable winter. Dior fragrance are all timeless classics.
