Golden Haze Burberry,A faint vetiver and marigold which I don’t fancy opened the scent up. Then an even fainter tea note appeared before the entire scent disappeared from my skin completely. Then an even scent didn’t last ten minutes on my skin but remained faintly woody on clothing after twenty four hours. The vetiver was nice as a note but anything beyond marigold was just gone before any feeling could be felt. This coming from two sprays which is the norm I set for testing was just pathetic. A real shame coming from a luxury line from the house that created my favorite amber scent.,09/25/25 19:12,ckorp8
Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"burberry summer
(why are there years missing?

summer going into autumn so cooling off.
about 5 sprays to inner elbow - the tester was a bit stuffed but i got a reasonable amount out.

lovely green floral
gently zingy - not sour, not sharp, but a little angular and crisp.
one thought came to mind as Oscar de la Renta Flor seems and feels like its similar to this - that one is much zingier in a limey bright zing way, burberry summer is toned down.

i prefer this to my burberry blush which i have tried recently (that one was a bit too similar to others i either have at the time or have tried, not a bad scent tho)

ok sillage - its not loud, ive had a good three hours with it and it lingers on fabric well.",03/05/19 01:18,dglightblue
Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"Fan of all things Burberry. This one is a light, green floral I ❤ for daytime casual wear. Perhaps a better spring/summer scent, it is a floral fragrance I'd wear year round, due to the abundance of woody aromas. It doesn't' last very long and can really spray the stuff on without offending. It is a beautiful blend of green, white flowers, wood and musk, with a slight punch of juicy pomegranate.",12/16/18 23:44,pamelalasalle110

Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"A nice, spicy floriental! A friend gave this to me because she wasn't a fan, but I really quite like the subtle sweetness behind this, and the added woody notes. I find that although Burberry are not always at the top of my list of favourite perfumes, I always find their fragrances strange and compelling. The combination of orange and musk in this is pleasant, alongside the pomegranate. I don't find it as distinctive as a lot of other perfumes though, and as genny17 said it's a 'safe' scent that is nice but not overly memorable. It also doesn't last too long, but the scent itself is an interesting warm-floral fragrance.",02/06/17 15:30,Lyoness

Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"I have to say that I love this fragrance!I was shopping one day at Younkers department store and saw this at the fragrance counter so I sprayed this on and went on my way.This is so pretty.I usually like more heavy amber and tropical fragrances but lately I have been craving fresh and airy scents and have been looking for a more natural fragrance to add to my collection.This is very natural smelling for a summer scent no strong alcohol smell at all.On my skin I smell pomegranate, lily of the valley,freesia and a soft woody base.If I could pick one word to describe this scent I would say fruit sorbet.It is cool and airy and the citrus smell stays all the way through the drydown.The woodsy notes are soft but noticable.I have dry skin and the 2 squirts I sprayed on my wrist lasted a good 6 hours.This is not going to be a silliage monster but if you did 4 squirts on the neck and a couple squirts on the inside of the arms people would smell you as you walked by.This will be fabulous for humid hot days and nights as there is something romantic and elegant about it as well.I think soft flowers,italian fruity ice or fruit sorbet with a touch of green and soft woods.The bottle is so pretty as pink is one of my favourite colors.This will not make you feel sick as it is very natural smelling.If you had to pick one fragrance for summer I would say this is the best summer fragrance I've smelled so far.Men will love this as well as they tend to like soft clean smells on a women.Pair this with a cute floral sundress and some gladiator sandals and you will get admiring glances and you wont kill everyone with a strong overbearing fragrance on a hot summer day.This is fruit sherbet in a bottle!LOVE IT!",06/09/13 12:00,tropic sugar
Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"This has the word “garden” written all over it. Smelling it straight out of the bottle it smells like the tomato plants in my garden, very green with a hint of bitterness. After it’s sprayed I get a strong hit of Lily of the Valley -a transport back to my grandmother’s garden. I thought maybe the floral would be too strong for my liking, but then after about half an hour, it really lightened up; almost too much. I keep pressing my nose to my wrist to drink in my summer garden. The lasting power is not good on me, so I don’t think I’ll purchase, but I think it’s really nice. They really managed to bottle nature with this one!",04/29/13 13:26,Melly26
Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"Very aptly named as it is a perfect scent for summer.

It's light, it has a lovely freshness and ever so sweet and faintly floral. It is really pretty while being a wee little bit woodsy. It has a watery freshness to it that I really like.

It is perfect for an inoffensive scent. It doesn't project much at all.

Longevity is 3 hours - if that. Great summertime scent you can wear for anything. Spraying clothes and using an unscented lotion helps it last longer. I still have to bathe in it quite a bit because it just doesn't last. It will be perfect for HOT months when you want something refreshing, lightly sweet and floral.


I will have to buy multiple bottles as it is a limited ed only.

Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"I was able to get a sniff of this Friday when I went to Dillards. I was expecting a sweet fragrance for teens, but was pleasantly surprised by the tart citrus/woodsy scent. It's very earthy, musky, and crisp at first and then drys down to a powdery/woody scent. It reminds me of a hot summer day down here in the South; the name fits it perfectly.

Burberry Summer for Men 2010 Burberry,"Here's another one of my weekend, workout, and early morning errand running fragrances. The smell of Burberry Summer (2010 edition) is synonymous with freshness.

Burberry Summer for Men 2010 Burberry,"I received a spray sample of this from Lana Lool (Thanks friend!) and though I love the 2009 version of Burberry Men Summer, this one is VERY similar. The only thing I can see (sniff) that is different about it is that it has no apple, and has dyer's greenweed added, which gives it a sharp slightly green vegetal edge.

This (on the first spray) is amazingly citric with the mandarin's slight sweetness and yuzu's bright juicy sparkliness. As the top notes evaporate, there is still a ""citrusy"" feel there; but it DOES get more green with mint, juniper and the greenweed. There is an odd sweetness lingering just behind the light (white) woodiness. The drydown ""sounds"" somewhat oriental, but to me it is just ever so slightly warm and smooth, and accents the top and heart in a clean and refreshing way, while not overpowering them . This is an excellent scent for hot and humid days, and would make any citrus and green lover very happy; and it is done in typical Burberry style. This scent is the olfactive equivalent of swimtrunks and a cool crisp white tank-top. Like a warm green summer wind, the sun on your face and your toes in the sand. Citrusy, aromatic and quite well-done, but I did not (and am not going to) run out and buy a bottle. I WILL, however, enjoy the sprayer sent to me this summer...and should I happen to see it in a discount store for a great price would buy it, as I love the whole Burberry line of perfumes.

Sillage: good
Longevity: average
Overall: 3.5/5

I think Burberry is thinking along the lines of ""if it isn't broken, then don't fix it"" and this is very nice and only slightly different (less fruity/more citric) than the last year's version. It is a lighter fresher alternative to Burberry Men: brighter and more ""summery""; but at the risk of sounding like a ""snob""...there are better summer scents out there. It does the ""job"" by keeping things fun and light though, while still managing to say SUMMER, and projects rather well! The longevity of citrus is often a problem, but the greens and aromatics keep the ""fun in the sun"" vibe going.",06/16/11 11:52,gypsy parfumista

Burberry Summer for Men 2010 Burberry,"I got a sample of Burberry Summer for Men 2010, and was really impressed with the scent. It has a really fresh, laid back, almost ""lime"" scent to me. I know lime isn't in the notes, but that's what I seem to get. It's not a bitter citrus scent, but more of a sweet, and greenish fresh scent. I found a 100 ml. bottle for a good price at a discounter while in NYC recently and picked it up for about $30. Overall, I am still enjoying it, but my one complaint is longevity. This is a VERY short lived fragrance. (even more so than most fresh/summer scents). It's literally gone after about 30 min. to an hour. I would recommend spraying this one on your clothes to extend the scent, as it goes away quickly on the skin. Other than needing to reapply very often, it's a really nice, light summer scent.",02/18/11 08:12,BRH
Burberry Summer for Men 2010 Burberry,"I tried this one in the store yesterday. Well, very nice and clean. Much better than many modern aquatics.

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I had an opportunity to pick up an unopened mini bottle of this recently. I very much enjoy the 1995 Burberry for Men and thought I'd give this a shot. There's definitely some continuity between the two versions. I don't get the mint nearly as strongly in this 1981 version (hard to say whether it would have smelled differently 40-odd years ago), and the lavender, musk, and amber hit me much more heavily in this 1981 release than in the 1995, but the resemblance is there.

To me, this smells like a man in the 80s who spends his time wearing a suit (sans jacket, much of the time) sitting in a well broken-in oxblood leather executive chair at a solidly constructed, dark-stained black walnut or mahogany desk in an office with vertical wood paneling. He might be an executive type. He might be a crime boss. The office, chair, and desk may or may not be his - I won't ask questions, he smells like he probably belongs there, one way or another.

I find the 1995 release light, fresh, versatile, and well suited to daytime use in both casual and formal settings - very work appropriate, but just as easily worn with a t-shirt and nice jeans. This 1981 release is, by comparison, much darker, heavier, and, if you're not in the 1980s and the kind of person who sits in the office I describe above, probably best suited to nighttime use, or use in non-work contexts - perhaps a classy cigar lounge, or maybe a not-so-classy strip club (to give two extreme examples).

I like this a lot, but I can't really think of how or where I'd wear it in my life / with my lifestyle. I'll hold onto it anyway, just in case I happen to find myself headed somewhere this would make sense to wear.",10/01/24 21:48,kqfka
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"For nostalgia's sake and a rare treat of this sort: I recently scored a full bottle of this, which appeared to be in good shape - even including the box and insert that describes the whole line of products.

It smells almost like I remember, but not quite exactly. That's okay given how much time has passed.

It DOES however, smell like a close cousin of my bottle of Gres Homme (1996). The Gres is greener and being an EDT, is stronger. But the two could be flankers smelling them side by side, with some slight divergence in the later drydown.

About the strength. This is an EDC but it's an EDC like Aramis. It packs a wallop!

Burberrys is absolutely worth searching for if you're a fan of this kind of scent. If no success, Gres Homme (1996) would be a great alternative.",04/15/24 15:20,Br'eauDeCologne
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"Was it Keat's ""soft-dying day"" or Yeat's ""October twilight"" that was preferred by this man in his walks in the Autumn sunset? Did he wear an Ivy cap to really warm his head or to appear well-read? Is he always cultural and clean or secretly damaged and sometimes mean? So many questions, so few answers at the ""other end of the telescope"" as Elvis Costello sang.

He wore Burberrys for Men, redolent with marjoram, that one herb that is the question mark among exclamation points. Mild and sweet, much like his demeanor, like spearmint-scented oak wood, more intensified when the herb is dry, much like his sense of humor. Its smell reminds me of a walk in the Vermont woods, when you can almost smell the fauna among the flora, the smell of warm sheep's pelt, and then tang of juniper berries can be made out among the lash of mugwort bushes.

It simmers down to a soft round patchouli awash in musk, firmly planted in the twilight comfort of a leather base. It is a welcome relief from the strain of dialectics, as this man takes off his cap and undoes a couple buttons of his Oxford shirt to just feel comfortable in his own human vulnerability for a while.

This gem was only on the market for about ten years, subsequently replaced by an entirely different Burberrys for Men in 1991. Sadly, it's become quite scarce and is therefore a treasure in my collection. For those who may want to seek a similar sensibility, there is also the lovely original (not new) version of Perry Ellis for Men cologne, which lies in the same vicinity.",03/06/24 07:43,alphairone
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,An Executive´s scent of the early 80s. Sitting long office autumn days as a fairly succesful head of a top management organization in the construction business while dreaming of scenic golf rounds in Spain with fellow business collegues requires a scent that goes with a dynamic but mature international aspiring personality. Only a few perfumes can impersonate such an 80s character but this Burberrys for Men is one of a few. A top choice.,02/07/23 07:16,Fimafeng

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I was fortunate to score a NIB mini bottle. This stuff is amazing. Old school 80s: rich, dark and mossy. Performance is excellent. Scent reminds me of V.S.O.P. and Brownstone by Paul Sebastian (both almost as hard to find as this original Burberrys).

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"So I'm writing this review because I find myself gravitating towards vintage men's fragrance. I find the 70s and 80s men's fragrances to be the most well-blended and having a depth that has been missing in men's colognes for a long time now. Burberry the original 1981 version I was able to acquire and I must say the first thing that caught my attention was the true seamless, masterful blending and superior ingredients. This cologne starts off as one might expect with that dated Macho old man smell. I don't mean in a grandpa sort of way but definitely vintage. However within 30 minutes it settles in to a warm rich smooth sent that indeed is all man. I find it very sexy yet calming. I would think this performs best in cooler climate and vintage or gated or whatever you want to call it there is no mistaking that it is a masterpiece. If you've ever had the pleasure of smelling Perry Ellis signature from 1985 you might think these two were cut from the same cloth. The similarity between the two is really interchangeable between the apapa max in Perry Ellis and the murderer in Burberry. Make no mistake although it might be an investment to acquire a bottle of Burberry the original it is so worth it. Is it something I will wear everyday know. Is it something I will wear frequently? Absolutely! It's very hard to come across these days but even if you can only score a miniature version I say go for it because these vintage fragrances like this are we coming harder and harder if not impossible to find these days and it is well worth having in a collection and certainly a true pleasure to wear as well.",01/30/20 21:23,ismellfine
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I had been on a quest for this classic. Back in the 80s, someone gave me a gift pack that included stick deo; shower gel, and generous-sized bottle (probably after shave; I wasn't paying that much attention back then). But OMG, I never forgot the rustic, yet sophisticated/animal-magnetic sense from the original Burberrys. I just got my hands on 2 oz. of EDT from Ebay. It was in a plastic bottle, authentic to how this classic was packaged over 35 years ago. It is the fragrance that I remember, although there has probably been some ""shifting in transit"", given all the time that has past (not claiming an expert schnazzola). It did take my sense of scent back in time, nonetheless. I wonder if there is anything else really close to this fragrance, being that I'll tear through 2 oz. pretty fast, and I ponied up for what I have.

Impression: conifer, but not pine, fir, or spruce; dry and just a little sweet, with a peppery hint, and good staying power.",02/24/19 12:04,Jack2scents

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I remember when I was about 11 years old, walking in the department store with my folks after church on a Sunday afternoon in the winter. A pretty lady asked me if I wanted a sample of this new cologne. It was the best smelling men's cologne I had ever experienced up to that point and to this day I remember how good it was. I held on to that little towelette sample as long as I could, careful to fold the pouch it came in to tuck in all the fragrance. That thing lasted about a year or more, stashed away in the upper drawer of my dresser.

I never forgot it.

I have owned and smelled lots of amazing fragrances since then (including a couple from Burberry), but very few made an impression on me like Burberrys did. I am sure nostalgia and the pretty lady made an impact, as well ... but this was just a great symphony of notes, period. My young nose knew it then and my old-ish nose knows it now.",11/03/14 15:05,Br'eauDeCologne
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"Thankyou perfumecritic for making sense of this confusion. I knew the bottle in the main picture wasn't the one I was looking for. The Burberrys for Men that I wore and loved from the early 1980s was the vertical oblong bottle (as per the picture on the right). I haven't seen it for a long time. It was very popular and is yet another much lamented absentee (Ted Lapidus PH and Charles Jourdan un Homme).

If like me you came to this site looking for information on the much loved 1981 original, then check out M Generation by Mauboussin. Some resemblance unless my memory is playing tricks on me.

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"In 1981 there was a fragrance called Burberry's for men. In 1991 Burberry's launched Society for women and a companion fragrance also titled Burberry's for Men which was not the same composition as the original 1981 version, nor was it the product shown on the Society for men page, a fragrance which was launched by a different company using the same name once Society for women was no longer in production.

And if all of this wasn't confusing enough, in 1995 after the apparent failure of Society for women and the 1981 & 1991 versions of Burberry's for men, the company launched another set of fragrances with the exact same name, ""Burberry's"", however this time the word London appeared underneath the company's moniker. Of the three versions from 1981, 1991 and 1995, the 1995 product is the only one still in production. This is now sometimes referred to as Burberry's London for men, which is even more crazily misleading because Burberry's did indeed launch a Burberry's London for men just a few years back. These two fragrances have totally different bottles and totally different compositions.

When fragrance licenses expire and change hands we consumers witness all of this confusing naming business. Both Versace and Dior have suffered from the same problem with numerous fragrances launched at different times with slightly different compositions, or even wildly different compositions, but quite similar or exactly the same names.",05/26/13 09:38,perfumecritic
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"This review is for the bottle pictured above. I can see the comparison to Tiffany for Men, though not as much to Chanel pour Homme Concentree. Here the myrrh/vanillic quality is obvious, as is the vanilla in the Tiffany, but the patchouli is much less obvious. Perhaps it is closest to Caron's Third Man, though (that one is a bit more cloying than the Burberry, which is more herbal than Third Man). What I think I like most about this one is how there is great contrast between the aromatic elements and the sweet, syrupy oriental one. Spice seems to connect the two and prevent an irritating clash from occurring. There is also a kind of woody background hum which supplies some ""structure."" This is the kind of scent that recent designer attempts seem to fail miserably at, and my guess is that lack of ingredient quality is the key problem (though in some cases there is another issue, such as being overly sweet). Of course some don't perceive the ""synthetic"" qualities of them, but that also means they probably can't appreciate the richness and depth of scents like this one. This is really well balanced and should be ranked very highly, IMO, even when compared against other vintage greats !

UPDATE: If you can't afford this one or just can't find it, I suggest trying Mesmerize for men by Avon. No, I don't think it's exactly the same or that the ingredient quality or blending is as good but it may be close enough for you, all things considered. Heritage is another in the same general range as this one.

UPDATE #2: I have now tried the ""original,"" from 1981. Apparently, the bottle (and formulation) pictured above is from around 1991/1992. In any case, the 1981 formulation smells a great deal like Vetiver de Puig, though perhaps just a bit smoother. I'll just copy and paste the notes for Vetiver de Puig below and that will give you an idea of what to expect (it's dry, with strong lavender, sandalwood, and vetiver):


TOP:
galbanum
bergamot
aldehydes
lemon
artemesia
rosemary

MIDDLE:
lavender
carnation
cedar
patchouli
vetiver
cumin

BASE:
labdanum
moss
musk
tonka bean",05/18/13 20:12,Bigsly

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"A very clean, fresh, light, and effervescent fragrance. It has a very slightly soapy type of clean scent, but in a good way. It would be a great choice for at the office because it’s an inoffensive scent. It’s also a nice casual fragrance, so it’s great for daytime wear and anytime that you just want to smell/feel fresh and clean.

Burberry Britt Sheer reminds me somewhat of Clean Reserve Skin and Phlur Missing Person. They’re not the same, but they have a similar clean feel to them.

I tend to get really good longevity with my fragrances, and this is no exception… it lasts throughout the day on me. The projection is nice, it radiates out about an arm’s length from me.",02/04/24 07:54,Shimmer412

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Fruity, fresh shampoo, but not to the extent of Marc Jacobs' Sorbet. It's a lot more clean and less offensive than that one.
I've been inadvertently complimented wearing this - my friends said they smelt something really nice, like someone had just showered. In fact, I did not take a shower, just wore this perfume. Was somewhat surprised they could even smell it, considering how quick this one fades. In the end, I didn't tell them I was the one wearing perfume (or had just showered), but I think they would've figured it out on their own anyways considering that people move to places.

I love clean bathroom, but a lot of perfumes actually turn slightly bitter on my skin. That makes this perfume smell slightly more mature and less 'generic shampoo/nice bathroom' on me :D
I just wish this had more lychee. I've been on a lychee hunt in perfume for a long time, but today's still not the day.",04/30/23 05:23,myperfumeisleakingplshelp

But overall, it's. very, very fresh, light, and clean smelling. Great work/every day perfrume. I just got myself a little rollerball and I'm going to get the full bottle so I can do larger spritzes.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I am starting to question my ability to smell fruit notes after reading the reviews for this and realizing it's not my first time missing out on fruit scents that others notice. The comparison to shampoo is accurate. I would say this is bright, floral, and a little chemical. It's not for me, and also not unpleasant or overpowering. So there's that.",08/11/21 14:41,MacabreLemon
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I'm learning there's more than one kind of soapy scent.

There's fragrances that smell like bar soap, vintage, French-milled, gentle. There's laundry detergent/freshener/softener smells. There's nondescript bathroom air freshener aromas. There's shampoo, which can be divided into further categories: men's, women's, children's, and dog shampoo. And then there's liquid hand soap, the kind that comes in the cheapy transparent pump bottle with the picture of the clownfish on the inside.

This one is smack between children's shampoo and clownfish hand soap. It's the sickly-fruity-sweet shampoo the popular girl in 5th grade wears, which her mother sometimes sneaks pumps of to remind herself of her own days as 5th grade popular girl. It's the generic fruity clean scent of their bathroom, with its Glade air freshener. And it's the smell of the unscented clear liquid Softsoap hand soap standing at their sink.

I've never smelled a more distinctly shampoo-like fragrance in my life, with more liquid-hand-soap nuances. I can practically taste the glycerin. The edible arrangement of nondescript tropical fruit notes is bang-on. The hint of quintessential early 2000s floral musk lingers in the air like a familiar old acquaintance taking up all the space in your bathroom with her five hundred bottles of hair products. If this came out today from some smaller niche house as a self-aware nostalgic scent with a name like ""2007 Bathroom"", I think people would buy it.

I don't understand why someone would want to smell this much like shampoo, but it's genuinely a cute, very clean, and inoffensive tropical fruity smell. The fruits and florals are all well-blended and pleasant. If you're unafraid of soapy scents and you like the notes and the clean bathroom vibe I've described, go for it.",07/28/21 08:58,ambergeese
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Peony, Musk, and no vanilla (it makes it different from most of BBW peony compositions). For me to work it has to be mixed with some woody perfumes to make it last a bit longer. In my experience it very well layers with an old school vtg white musk from the body shop (some oak moss has them anchored) together. My advise is to only get it if it is extremely discounted since back than in 2007 it was produced under Interparfum well known for fleeting creations.",07/11/21 06:48,imoore

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"As one could guess from the top notes, Burberry Brit Sheer opens sweet, bright, and juicy. However, its fruity notes don't dominate for long, and BBS soon transitions into a slightly dampened floral fragrance with bright, fruity supporting notes.

The peony and peach blossom have a pollen-heavy muskiness to them, that, when combined with the tropical top notes, give BBS a somewhat humid, rainforest vibe. However, as BBS’s fruity top notes fade, they take most of that tropical element with them, and BBS slowly morphs from tropical-fruity-floral-fresh to musky-soapy-floral-fresh.

BBS is feminine, generally youthful (but not immature), and fine for pretty much any girl or woman and any spring/summer occasion, barring very fancy formal events where it might feel a bit breezy and indifferent.

It's certainly nothing to sneer at, but in the end it feels a bit middling and average to me. But then I've never been one for ""easy"" fragrances, so YMMV.",02/08/21 21:45,ginandrice

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"This is the original 2007 composition, I am not sure if the newest version is any different but based on my feelings for this bottle, I doubt I'll be testing it to see.
The bottle itself is gorgeous, and I'm sad to say that's the only thing I really like about it. This scent is inoffensive I suppose---I felt it opened kind of harsh and cleanser-like, but it's mostly a musky floral-fruity scent with not much personality once it dries down. It has absolutely nothing in common with the edt or edp of Burberry Brit--it's not really a 'sheer' version of those as there is no familial connection. If you like musky fruity florals with no personality, then this one is for you. Safe for office or classroom for sure.",09/15/20 11:40,Lipglossjunkee
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I bought this perfume because I read that it is similar to bright crystal by Versace.
This perfume opens with a burst of juicy fruity notes (some citrus, pineapple, lychee) which, the first time I sprayed it, literally made me say 'wow'. For me, these fruity notes last only about an hour then it dries down to a soft powdery floral musk which is pretty unremarkable.
I think this is a nice subtle scent if you want to prolong that 'just out of the shower' freshness, and I will be using it in Summer or at the gym when I don't feel like wearing a strong fragrance.
This perfume is similar to bright crystal in that it is a light fruity floral, however I think Bright Crystal is superior.",01/03/20 15:43,Goity

Out of the bottle it smells very potent, and the citrus is very overwhelming feeling almost cheap. It dries down to a very synthetic, chemically smell. Not very pleasing almost clinical and cold. Maybe nice for beginners on very young women.
*UPDATE:
I decided to give this fragrance a 2nd try and On a rainy day outside it smelled delightful on me. While still being a bit chemical smelling, but juicy and a bit floral. it was sort of pleasing.

Its great to have that option in your collection. Sometimes i mix it with My Burberry Blush, try it ! The two can easily be wear together, blush adds a little and gentle sweetness to Sheer.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I received Brit Sheer as a gift and after a quick test,I gave it to my sister.her signature is lanvin eclat arpege and Jesus del pozo Halloween kiss and she was looking for a new signature,something that belongs to the same league of delicate,super feminine,clean scents but with more fruity punch
Brit sheer was a love at first sniff for her.she loves cool scents(as opposite of warm),something bright,crisp,refreshing,youthful and uplifting and brit sheer is exactly mentioned things.I remember almost sour and sweet,mouth watering,fresh fruity notes,light and delicate florals and a hint of clean musk.
Versace bright crystal was my signature about ten years ago.I haven't tested it recently but from my memory,they belong to the same league but they don't smell similar.brit sheer is more sharp and fruity sour

Also for a toilette, it has pretty amazing staying power on me and scents usually tend to fade on me pretty quickly. It's more sweet and floraly and has that Burberry undertone dry down to it. It's a really nice everyday scent. I don't get tart or crisp at all, more soft, sweet, floral.",01/29/18 12:59,Britt206
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I loved how this smelled on the tester paper. Before I buy a perfume, though, I usually try it on- so I spritzed this on and it did not disappoint! For me, it is very floral. I think my body chemistry burns off the citrus notes pretty quickly- but that's okay because I adore peony which is most intensive for me with this perfume and then just the right amount of musk and 'white wood' to keep it from being cloying. Sidenote- this is truly the only Burberry Scent that doesn't smell like a floor cleaner or acne medicine on me. Must be my chemistry but I have tried almost every scent of theirs and it just does not work for me- but this one has gotten me compliments.",01/26/18 18:11,amy.yasuda@gmail.com
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"It's very clean, and it's pretty the way early spring time is pretty. The way 9 year old girls are pretty, with their over sized teeth. It just doesn't offer enough interest, or refinement. Especially considering it's Burberry, I had higher expectations. After the initial display of bright and juicy top notes, Brit Sheer smells exactly like a pink Calgon body spray I convinced my mother to buy me when I started junior high. It smells like feeling very grown up and *thinking* I was wearing perfume. It smells like the beauty aisle at Walgreens.

I agree with the comparisons to Envy Me, though I like that one a little better and for a little longer than I do this (it has a longer lifespan on my skin).",01/18/18 15:16,NicoleET88

But all the that really matters at this point is that I really enjoy it.

I tested it in a store a few years ago, liked it enough, bought it a day later... and disliked it almost immediately. Something in it smelled like an air freshener to me, and I cannot stand it. A few weeks ago I thought I'd give it a second (fourth? Fifth maybe?) chance, and funnily enough the ""air freshener"" note has become unnoticeable. All I notice now is fresh juicy fruits (grapefruit???) mixed with cold ""watery"" (read: dewy) flowers (must be the peony coz there's some sharpness to it as well) on a clean musky-woody base.

Bright Crystal has this weird deodorant-like sour musk that not only offends my nose, but also triggers a huge headache. I actually adore this scent.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Very clean, fresh, ""sheer"" scent - it's a very ""innocent girl"" scent.

This is my daily go-to spring/summer scent when I'm just going about my daily tasks. It doesn't last very long on me - about 4 hours tops and that's being generous. The bottle is pretty easy to carry around though, so I don't mind it very much.",05/19/15 15:56,o1love
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,Oh my! Cassandra's review is spot on! I loved the fresh powdery (but not too powdery) citrus scent I had the first hour. But then I kept smelling playdoh with something I couldn't put my finger on. It IS sunscreen playdoh. I'm so disappointed!,03/20/15 16:25,stephb
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"When I first apply it, I get this fresh tangy and sweet mix of citrus and litchi, with a bit of floral, very girl, and fresh. It's pretty good, however, after it dries it has this disgusting smell of play dough sunscreen. I don;t know what and it's really disappointing because the initial scent smelled so good, but the dry down is just nauseating.",03/12/15 06:46,cassandra5322
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,On me it had a very bitter citrus opening note. But once the bitterness faded it was a short-lived but nice little fresh and light fragrance. I could wear it in summertime and it wouldn't be overwhelming or cloying at all.,02/12/15 04:18,Tracyarts
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,This is so weak that it only lasts for about 1.5-2.5 hr on me. I did not find any interesting notes in this EDT. It's just so normal and smelled like an unisex perfume for its Yuzu note perhaps. It's a fresh perfume and should be wore in summer instead of winter.,02/07/15 13:42,jessie.yue.5
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I bought a 50ml one many years ago after trying it on my wrist. The fresh and bright fruity notes had attracted me a lot. It has a similar base note with Marc Jacobs Daisy which was in my wishlist (and was on my another wrist at the same day I tried Brit Sheer).
Nowadays it still lasts less than 10ml in the bottle and it just dosen't come to me again to wear it. Maybe it's because I'm no longer a young girl like years ago to match the pure fruity fragrance. My taste changes. The scent becomes too ""flat"" to me now.",01/27/15 09:53,sylviak
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"The citrus note comes on quickly and sharply, and almost sour, and there is a citronella character that is a bit overwhelming initially. There are hints of lychee and pineapple that don’t quite do enough to round it out. Very slowly, the white musk begins to emerge, and the dry down reminds me vividly of Revlon’s Fire & Ice, which I was obsessed with when I was 13 years old. On the blotter it dried down to an underripe mandarin. Certainly not a favourite, but I can understand the appeal.",01/10/15 02:14,alice.livings
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"This perfume is close to Gucci envy me (could be from litchi and pineapple) but without the spices and sexiness. The longevity is poor on me. Somehow, I still enjoy wearing this in-aggressive perfume, it gives me a happy mood for some reason.",01/06/15 19:27,megkaybeee
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Sheer versions of popular scents are usually done one of two ways: either they smell like a lighter ""watered down"" version of the original with perhaps a slight variation for interest OR they take the wearer on a completely different journey that often solidifies a time and season that the original and it's offspring are meant to be worn. Brit Sheer is the latter. Miles from it's mother scent, which I consider a chilly fall/winter creation, Sheer is a cirtus-pear base with a veil of summer peonies. Experiencing it blindly, Burberry would not necessarily come to mind, but it most definitely has some bitter refinement that makes it discernible from a fruity bath shop body spritz. The clean woodsy note gives the potential for some to get furniture cleaner from this scent if overdone, which is easy to do with light summer creations. But applied appropriately this is a happy and light addition to a strong and eclectic fragrance house and a sweet but slightly rebellious progeny of the classic Burberry Brit.",01/02/15 12:24,CarmendyNola
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,Fresh clean soapy girly,01/01/15 08:18,DreamIsland
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"This reminds me of the original, loud and fun Escada perfumes like Taj Sunset, Ibiza Hippie etc. Except that Brit Sheer is not as loud or sweet as the Escada perfumes were. I smell the lychee and pineapple as well floral notes and a clean white musk. It's soft and not very long lasting, but it's pleasant and pleasing for those around you. Not something I would wear any more but maybe once upon a time in my early 20's yes I would have before Fragrantica opened a whole other world of perfumes to me.",12/19/14 00:51,kxnaiades
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"It's clean, bright and crisp. But for my nose it's too sharp, and I don't understand what smells like this, because when I look at the notes it seems that I sense something else in it. For some reason, I can't smell tropical pineapple or fresh litchi. I think it's more floral than fruity.
Not even closely as good as Burberry Brit EDT.",11/24/14 07:25,ScarlettX

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I received this as a sample from Sephora, and I reminded why I am not fond of ""fresh"" perfumes.. Fresh perfumes always dry down on me to smell like soap. This one is no different. It smells exactly like Dawn dish washing soap to me.",11/14/14 15:42,mystylynn
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"In my opinion it has very little to do with Burberry Brit edt/edp.
It's a rosy light on a newborn spring/summer morning. Light, fresh, sweet, from the first sniff innocent and girly, but a bit later it shows its adult and naughty side smiling and teasing. Reminds me young Brigitte Bardot in her girly, romantic vichy dress dancing in a huge flower garden. The same sensual innocence, flirty and a bit naughty glances.
The dry down on me turns a bit soapy, but in a good way -fresh, clean, almost transparent joy of life.
It's not unique and recognizable, it's just a nice, fresh, clean spring/summer scent.",11/09/14 01:36,Juliana6
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I have this new image of Burberry Brit Sheer..

(I sprayed 7x it really smells cheap.. First few minutes.. )

15 mins later you I appreciate the smell of Burberry Brit Sheer it smells like Versace Bright Crystal.

It smells Sweet, Fruity Floral and sort of really feminine. I have staffs (men and women) appreciate the smell on me. But it would give me a slight headache for 3-5mins and then minutes have passed I do appreciate the scent. I can't help to say or think if something is wrong with me or Burberry Brit Sheer isn't for me? (I don't know it's a bit complicated to describe)

So far -- I like it but not that loving it. On the bright side of this perfume.. Days have passed, (doing my laundry 1-2 weeks later after spraying, due to traveling and travel --tip-- if you asking why it took me so long do the laundry.. )

I would really sniff my shirt, my dress and say --woooohoo! smells good!

i am really amazed it's still there :D",10/29/14 04:15,hey_im_christine
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I used to get confused which one to choose between Brit Sheer and Brit Summer.

At first sniff I fell in love with Brit Summer coz the tea + amber combination is quite crisp and unique. However, I find myself wearing SHEER more often.

Brit Sheer starts with fruity + immensely sweet opening (I'm not into sweet scents by the way), but after a few minutes.. W O W.. the drydown is LOVELY!! I find SHEER safer for everyday use because it develops into something clean and uplifting despite the hot weather.

Brit Summer on the other hand develops nicely during cold seasons or nightouts, will make a statement as compared to Sheer.

On my skin, both are DIVINE and included on top of my list!",09/30/14 11:42,kattleia
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Incredibly light, fresh, and very subtle. A great spring, summer, or early morning perfume. I find this perfume doesn't have a lot of staying power though, and most people don't even detect I am wearing anything since it doesn't have much of a tail. Hubby bought me the roll-on as a stocking stuffer, so I wonder if that application (vs. spray) has something to do with it. A truly lovely scent, however not a personal favourite as I prefer slightly more prominent perfumes. I will likely keep a small bottle on hand for spring/summer and when the mood strikes for something crisp and light. It reminds me of something that would be nice to spray on the bed linens since it is such a soft scent.",09/26/14 10:19,ckernan
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I smelled this side by side with Weekend (my old love), and I have to say that this is a younger sister (or daughter?) to Weekend. This is Weekend diluted with fresh fruits added in place of the deep florals. I believe this should have been released as a Weekend flanker, not a Brit flanker, as it has absolutely nothing in common with the latter.

At the start, Brit Sheer and Weekend are quite different, Brit Sheer opens much juicier and lighter. But at some point, they start to smell quite similar (hello musky peach blossom!). 'Clean, bright, fresh, peachy, musky, uplifting', are words I would use to describe both scents...but Weekend is warmer, heavier, cozier, more floral and has a very noticeable clean laundry note. Brit Sheer is much fruitier with citrus and litchi, sweeter, lighter, much more crisp and airy. Same DNA though! If I had both, I would wear Brit Sheer in late spring and summer, and Weekend in fall and early spring.

Lovers of Weekend should check this out for a more modern, lighter alternative...and haters of Weekend need not worry, everything you dislike about Weekend (I assume it's the heavy, laundry-floral vibe), is nowhere in Brit Sheer. I will definitely be treating myself to a large bottle of this next summer. Longevity of Brit Sheer is moderate on my skin (good for a light summer scent), as is the sillage, but I can still smell it days later on my scarf.",08/22/14 18:56,CozyCat

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"How do I begin to describe this? I have always adored this perfume for its crisp, clean and light scent (I always spritz this on when I go to a store) but have never really try to analyze this until today. Again, it is nice, though I can't really detect any fruits.
In the opening, I get a very clean (almost alchoholy-bleach kind of smell I always associate with operating theater, which I love, call me weird) and fizzy scent but it later dries down into something flowery and aquatic almost like Body Shop's Aqua Lily although if you smell it really close, you could smell something else underneath. What I love about it is the base which is soft but gives the perfume more depth.
Overall, despite the fact that it does smell nice, I'm not very pleased with the purchase, wouldn't buy a second one.",08/11/14 11:07,wingz85
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"The first perfume I ever bought lol. Light, sweet and pleasant; I don't think this perfume would offend anyone at all.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,When I tested this in the store it honestly smelled like all the perfumers did was take Burberry Brit and then decided to water it down and gave it more floral notes. It is not unpleasant at all but is unoriginal and it had no staying power.,08/07/14 22:39,glambert

I've had this Brit Sheer hanging around for some time now since it is not my favorite fragrance and has not been used but once or twice. Still not sure if this is the citrus for me but I'm appreciating the crisp airy quality this lends. It's like I'm airing out my aura, lol. What I don't love is the sharpness of the pomelo or litchi and at the same time the pink girly aspect. I would like to try Brit Summer as I like the combo of lime and pear.",07/25/14 21:05,beachrose

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Though I'm not a fan of Burberry scents overall, I picked this up in a rollerball on a whim while traveling. Yuzu, Lychee, peony and a light but steady musk make it pretty, young, and wearable. Definitely good for the office or close quarters on planes/trains. Reminds me vaguely of Versace Bright Crystal, but not nearly as memorable or likely to elicit compliments.",06/28/14 17:20,MQBannon
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Citrus, clean, musk. Nice and light for summer. Doesn't seem like it would be strong enough to offend so would be perfect for office or other similar situations. Will enjoy finishing my sample but won't buy a FB",06/04/14 16:56,Not Sure
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I like this a lot. It's just a really pretty, bright, summer-time smell. I can even wear it on my weekly hikes and find it doesn't feel out of place. It smells like Versace Bright Crystal, but better. Compared to Bright Crystal, this feels like a higher quality and better composed scent.

I work in an animal hospital, and this is one of the few scents I know I can wear safely without bothering anyone in close proximity to me. Every time I wear it to work, someone tells me I smell great. My boyfriend loves it too, which is a plus.

That said, I don't *love* it. I just get a little bored with it, if I wear it all the time. I will still repurchase though, because it's really a lovely scent.

Oh, and it lasts ALL day on me. And, as I said, I work in an animal hospital, so it's not like I sit at a desk all day. I'm up and about and my job is pretty physically demanding. I do spritz pretty heavily (for me anyway, which is about 5 sprays). I have a large 3.3 oz bottle, and I got halfway through it in about 3 months. That's huge for me as I've only ever finished one bottle of perfume in my life, and that was a 1 oz.",05/24/14 18:14,myownflagg

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I love this perfume. It's just kind of light and clean and fresh. It's simultaneously energizing and relaxing. It makes me think of bathing in a waterfall on some tropical island somewhere, surrounded by trees and flowers and a distant sea breeze. Very lovely, very feminine. Also, this lasts quite a long time on me. I sprayed it n my wrist in the store 10 hours ago and I can still smell it. It's lost a lot of the soapy quality and now just has a subtle mix of peony, peach blossom, and musk with a little hint of wood. It is slightly similar to Versace Bright Crystal, in that it is the same family, but I think that they are different enough that I would like to have both.",03/15/14 12:31,christinavictory

I cant pick up any pineapple and I'm definitely not getting a tropical vibe as listed in the main accords, in my opinion this resembles chilled florals.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"This is one of my favorite fragrances of all time. It's what I wear when I want to smell good but don't want to think about it too much. I've gotten tons of compliments in every type of setting and occasion, and while it's very light and playful and young, I really don't think you can go wrong when wearing this scent. It's not overbearing at all, and while it's definitely strong in the citrus department (especially at first), you don't exactly smell like you just spritzed on a citrusy perfume. No one's ever asked me what I'm wearing - it just seems to evoke a ""Hey, you smell really good!"" reaction. The initial application is citrusy and fruity - I find the pineapple and pear to be the main notes - and rather quickly but smoothly settles down into a more fresh floral scent. I do find that there can be a *very* subtle artificial quality sometimes in the top and middle notes, but it doesn't bother me very much, if at all, and pick it up very rarely. I absolutely love the drydown, which to me just about smells like the best part about fresh laundry (without the soapy, powdery connotations) - clean, crisp, and happy. This is a very crisp, clean, fragrance that manages to be flirty and feminine without being cloying or obvious. The main downside is that it doesn't last long :(",08/29/13 20:17,elegia
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I really adore this perfume, it's one of my favorites.

It opens with a soft fruity, tropical mix, with the litchi the only fruit I can actually identify.

Then it settles down, and it is just a sweet, clean, dreamy soapy smell on my skin. It's a very feminine clean smell.

What I absolutely love is that despite how utterly soft the scent is, it lasts and lasts on my skin. I remember when I first tried this on, I forgot I had tried it. Throughout the day I kept getting these whiffs of beautiful, sweet, clean soap. Finally after a few hours I realized it was this fragrance and made up my mind to immediately purchase it.

I sort of think of this as the ultra feminine counterpart of Light Blue in my perfume arsenal. Don't misunderstand me, they don't smell alike; rather their nature is the same. Light blue is a clean, everyday unoffensive fragrance for me, but it borders on being masculine. Burberry Brit Sheer is the same in my mind: a clean, everyday unoffensive fragrance, but ultra feminine in nature.",08/22/13 11:25,andabri
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I'm very anxious to try this one out. I sprayed some on my skin at the perfume counter. On it's initial spray, I detect a clean fresh scent, almost like a floral shampoo, but not in a bad way. I was pretty pleased with the scent. I Can't wait to purchase this one. Will review later....

*****UPDATE******
I finally purchased this scent, and to be honest, it's not that great as when I tested it on my skin. It starts off with a fresh, soapy, clean floral shampoo like scent to it, then as it settles into my skin, it turns yucky!!! Almost like there is some sour note spoiling the fragrance. Perhaps it was just my skin chemistry not agreeing with this scent. I'm glad to finally be done with the bottle, but I don't think I'd repurchase this one. It just didn't work out with my skin type.",08/21/13 21:02,ritaramirezz

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Oh my, I was never inclined to buy Burberry perfumes because all the ones I had sniffed didn't appeal to me. Until I randomly smelled Brit sheer. I spritzed a little on my forearm and went around the store to shop for other things. I kept getting sweet little whiffs of it as I walked here and there and fell in love with this scent. Its fruity but not too sweet, floral but citrus at same time. Drydown is mainly floral and soapy/clean smelling on me and it lasted for a good 5 hours on my skin. I bought it on the spot, without hesitation. Got a good deal on a gift set including a 100ml EDT, a purse spray and body lotion for $60 (same perfume all by itself at Sephora cost over $70.) I smelled the regular Burberry Brit and liked it as well though I'd probably like it better for fall. Do I need any more summer scents in my collection? Nooo, but when I like a scent I gotta have it.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I don't usually go for Burberry perfume, but I just had to buy this one because of the heavenly first note. It reminds me of Gucci Envy me, but a little softer. The citrus/fruity note will stay for quite a long time and it feels really refreshing, especially on hot summer days.

I often spray it on my neck and wrists, enjoy the sour yet sweet smell of mandarin mixed with litchi for 3 or 4 hours and be content with just that, eventually my nose gets used to it, I cannot smell it on me anymore.

Today at work, a guest told me when I was walking up to him: 'There's some kind of flower that smells very good, I cannot figure out what kind of flower it is.' I took a sniff at my wrist and was really surprised that it had developed into lily/peony kind of flowery smell. How could I never noticed this before! The lasting strength is brilliant, too, since it was almost 4pm already.

Fruity or Flowery note, all smells so amazing for me. Definitely a must-have in my perfume collection.",06/27/13 06:05,fan sui

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"This perfume is noted as the most reminder of Versace Bright Crystal, but be aware that if you like VBC that doesn't mean you'll automatically love Burberry Brit Sheer, and I suppose the opposite is correct too.
Personally VBC is my favourite perfume, on the other hand I didn't like BBS and I don't even find a similarity",04/14/13 07:22,dream

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Got a sample of this with a Sephora order. I was very surprised to find that I liked it. First impression reminded me a lot of Davidoff Cool Water that I used to wear sometimes as a teen - but this is more elegant and understated.

Smelling this at a distance it smells aquatic and a bit ""cold"" in a calming way, but close to the skin I can definitely detect the litchi, accompanied by just a bit of pineapple.

I am still debating if I would buy a full-sized version, because ""cold"" watery scents don't often suit my mood, but I'll also try this on again in the summer and see if my opinion changes on how the fragrances makes me feel.",03/05/13 20:36,kabelaced

Day time and casual scent.
Reminds me of clean laundry or the way a bathroom smells after a long shower!",02/25/13 19:39,Prettysweetz
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I'm currently on a quest for a perfect summer fragrance. Fresh, clean, simple, and youthful with just a HINT of sweetness. I tried this expecting it to smell like Versace Bright Crystal (which I own) and Gucci Envy me. Boy was I surprised! Yes, it has a similiar essence to Bright Crystal, but it is much more refined, has beter lasting power, a tiny less sweet, which VERY much less rose. Enough for me to buy it.

On my skin I get a fresh laundry scent. But it's very crisp and refined. It's everything I want for myself. It's not dated and it smells so clean and fresh. Like you've just got out the shower. It doesn't think too hard nor does it try to challenge anyone. I feel confident and clean wearing this! Highly recommend!",02/12/13 05:46,Mochahantas
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"One of the few fruity scents that I like and don't find overpowering. I pick up the tropical notes of lychee and pineapple. I find it to have good lasting power even though its EDT. I bought a bottle to give my daughter, but I'll be sampling from her bottle every now and then :)",02/09/13 21:45,veronicab
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"What can I say about this one? I love it!!! I remember trying it on at Macy's but somehow I didn't like it, maybe because I was also trying other samples but once I saw it on eBay I decided to give it a try and was I impressed!! It's definitely a very soft fresh fragrance for the girl/woman who doesn't want to overwhelm everyone around her lol. I find that the secret for it to last longer is to spray it like five times on yourself before leaving home. I did that today and I noticed it lasted around six hours or so, however I plan to carry my 1.7 oz bottle with me after all it's just a scent I cannot simply get enough of and the bottle is just too cute.",02/08/13 19:13,lovely0219

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I wanted to like this so much but unfortunately this doesn't work for me :( I admit this is a very nice, fresh fragrance, but on my skin yuzu gets so annoying, it's way too soapy and it lasts and lasts, it doesn't blend with other notes like in Versace Birght Crystal where yuzu is also clearly present but it's calme and well mixed with other fuity, flowery notes. At the beginning I can feel the lovely pineapple note but it fades away quicky and the only thing that stays is the annoying, soapy yuzu. I'm sad about this because I like the bottle and usualy I'm a big fan of pink perfumes :) On the other hand I wouldn't say I'm not recommending this fragrance to others, actually I always do but I couldn't wear it.",02/04/13 04:28,Cecza
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I would describe Burberry Brit Sheer as one of those ""no muss, no fuss"" perfumes. It smells clean, fresh, light, soft, flowery, and a bit fruity. None of the notes overpower each other, and I'm certain this scent wouldn't offend anyone's nose. I'd say this is a fantastic daytime perfume for work and school.

There are quite a few fruit notes in this, but the fragrance doesn't exactly smell sweet. Instead, I think the fruits make it smell juicy and fresh. The floral notes and the musk give the fragrance a feminine and soft touch to the fruity notes. The woody notes are a nice touch to blend everything together without having the fragrance smell too sweet or too powdery.

All in all, I think this is a great fragrance for perfume lovers who don't like to wear strong and decadent perfumes. If you want something that smells feminine, clean, and innofensive, then this is something to check out! It's a nice perfume!",01/29/13 08:24,spiderleenie

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I usually prefer oriental scents, but I wanted to try a perfume that was fruity and floral without strong musk, woods, or spices. Burberry Brit Sheer fulfilled my wants. Upon the very first spray, I smell something almost similar to light, sweet roses. I really adore that floral scent, but it fades after 10 minutes and goes right into the fruity scents, which also smell lovely. On my skin, the pineapple, peach, mandarin, and litchi are the star notes. Even though “white musk and creamy amyris woods” are present in this perfume, I don’t detect their scents.

This perfume is light and could be used every day for all seasons, but is obviously most appropriate for spring/summer. I like that I could wear this in the summer without feeling smothered. I also like the consistency; it smells the same every time I use it and doesn’t dramatically change as the day goes on. It has good lasting power, too.

The only thing that I don’t really care for is that it smells TOO youthful for my taste. It smells like something a young teenage girl would wear. I’m not saying that it smells like Pacsun's or Aeropostale’s fragrances; it’s made with top-rate quality. I also wish this fruity floral had more floral because I only smell the fruits. If you love fruity fragrances and you want something light, playful, and youthful, definitely give this a try! 4/5",01/10/13 08:15,wyrdlam
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I usually am not a huge fan of ""pink scents"" but Brit Sheer is real nice, not watery, I get a bit of peony, mixed in nicely with the fruits, lovely soft scent, not girlish, it has the Burberry elegance, with a bit of spark, it is fresh without being sharp, a lovely scent that smells really nice!! I don't think it is for any age category as it has that elegant edge Burberry fragrances have!!
Would be perfect or a teacher, or a young girl wanting a first perfume, for anyone really wanting a soft floral.",12/25/12 16:14,genny17
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"So fresh and energizing! The citrus is wonderful in this. Very light, perfect for summer. Hardly any florals though, definitely dominated by the tropical fruits.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"a year or two back i used to own a bottle of this and i remembered loving it so much and used it all up. i recently purchased another bottle without smelling it again and i was so disappointed! i cant believe that my taste in fragrances has changed so dramatically over time.

i adore litchi notes and i cant detect it at all in this. i would say this is a soft fresh and fruity scent. i really dont care for this at all. its too soft and boring for my taste and has no depth or dimension. my younger sister loves this though so i gave it to her and it does smell pleasant on her since it is a very girly and simple scent. i think i just grew out of it.

This scent reminds me so much of bright crystal by versace. a scent that i also dont care for and find quiet boring.",12/10/12 08:24,annettepe
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Fruity floral normally isn't to my taste but Brit Sheer is fresh, optimistic and relaxed fragrance. The fruity note isn't harsh or too acidic. The combination is well blended and the sweet musk at drydown makes it more beautiful.",12/02/12 02:24,Toom_Snoopy
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Optimism a bottle!!!

1 minute: the musk has dissappears, and the citrus component morphs into a sweeter experience reminiscent of pineapples
5 minutes: the scent becomes sweeter with litchi bursting forth and hints of cedar wood
As the day goes on the most noticable notes are litchi and cedar. (Cedar seems to be more pronounced in the warmer months while the litchi and citrus notes are more noticable during winter.)

The litchi is soft and not soapy as sometimes happens with that note (litchi taste kind of soapy so it's not surprising), and the other citruses blend well. I don't smell floral with it, just mixed citrus over a light musk. It's not at all a cloying sweet, but very light for a fruity floral.

I don't see any florals in the notes but definitely smell some white flowers or maybe water lily? There's something aquatic about this scent. I would say it's definitely for spring and summer and it would be a good, safe scent to wear to work without annoying anyone (as long as you don't go crazy and douse yourself- that won't make you any friends with any perfume, though!)",06/06/12 08:48,acavicchi

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I love all the fruity in it (which I've grown up with and eat all those lychee, pineapple and citrus fruits., they're delicious and refreshing.)

For me, Burberry Brit Sheer's such a safe choice to wear with any days and any moods accompanied my indoor and outdoor activities (OK, it may not be very exciting scent.) The last scent I got before it's gone off, it reminded me of fine clean laundry.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I found out my cousin's daughter wears this. She is awfully young to be wearing a fine fragrance. When I tested this, I thought, That girl has great taste for being so young! It's a sweet and fruity perfume, but definitely not immature. I could smell the litchi, but there are other notes that make the whole thing smell grown-up. Brit Sheer is not like Escada's perfumes, which seem a lot more youthful, like fruit punch or something. This is a nice casual perfume for any age.",05/20/12 09:33,AveParfum
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"I bought this for my sister's birthday because her last bottle ran out and she really wanted some more.

I had to scrub it off twice and I could still smell it. Not my thing. I guess I like them sweeter. I have regular Brit and it's much better than this one.

It smells nothing like versace bright crystal. This is fresh, tangy with a hint of floral. It doesn't last too long but that's alright- I'd rather re-apply and keep smelling fresh than to have my perfume keep evolving throughout the course of the day.. I'm not someone that enjoys smelling like the base notes of any perfume. :)

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"This is the lightest most agreeable pleasant fragrance I have tested. I am not sure I could ever get sick of this one? I have been wearing it from this rollerball I have been carrying around for a better part of a year. LOVE IT. :) I think being rollerball helps too. I am thinking of getting a spray.

It is softly floral and yet very clean.

All this time didn't even pay attention to the notes or anything. :) I am just about out of it. Will need to invest in a new one when I run out!

I am realizing it's ok if many of them are too rich, heavy, musky for me... this one is just perfect.

And how many do you need? When you find the right one? breath of fresh air. And (smelling my wrists) don't ask me why? But once it dries down and melts into my skin it smells like fresh clean laundry. :) and some soft flowers. Don't ask me why? LOVE IT. :D

(yes that cozy blanket or sheet fresh out of the dryer that you just want to smell and cuddle up in, that is clean and soft kinda happy feeling. But girly floral too. Very soft. Not cloying or sweet. Slight fruity opening. But not anything fruity salad. This is probably appropriate for any age or occasion. So light and clean. Love it. :) Classy, pretty and clean. :D Is it me?

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"My first whiff is a bunch of fruity stuff, a few minutes later, I smell flowers, although there's no floral notes in this. The dry down is powdery, but the fruits and flowers are still noticeable.

I always have a vision of a teenage girl wearing a light pink sundress, ballet flats and grandma's hat clutching a bouquet of flowers in one hand and a basket of fruits in the other, twirling in the sun. It's exactly like its bottle: sheer, subtle and simple. If there's a scent for the color light pink, this will be it.

I caught a whiff of this perfume a few years back when I was in a department store, and I didn't mind it much back then, but I remember the scent so well that I bought it a few months ago without a second thought.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"Maybe it's the pineapple-litchi-yuzu combo, but I always get a whiff of papaya or guava when I spray this. It's vaguely unsettling. The result is a little too much like sticking your nose into a bag of sour tropical skittles. I like some florals and some fruits but this doesn't quite suit me and it doesn't last at all on my skin, which is a pity because I really wanted to like it. Twenty minutes after spraying it's already fading, although the lasting resin-floral notes are quite nice after the fruity assault fades. I like the finish but the tropical-fruit-salad top notes just don't do it for me. The bottle design really indicates the scent this time, though.

Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"as always with lychee perfumes, i smell this fruit the whole way through [i guess because my nose recognizes it ;)]. i smell pineapple and sweet pea too, which i like. it's a very fruity floral perfume, and i can't get enough of it.

it does tend to wear off a little throughout the course of the day, but i can still smell it on my skin even after showering (just have to be really close to my skin to smell it). i love it because it's airy and fresh and perfectly summer. this is my go-to scent, in general.

the bottle is kind of blah - cute, pink, girly, but still boring compared to other bottles out there. still, it's very burberry-esque in that it's plaid, simple, clean and works.",08/17/11 06:52,ajaeee
Burberry Brit Sheer Burberry,"This fragrance is fresh and light and summery, with a sweet dry down that isn't overly saccharine or cloying.

The yuzu is the strongest note on me initially and that slight sourness is a nice contrast with the sweeter pineapple.

I do prefer the dry down though, where the yuzu fades a little and the other notes come out to play, but all in all it's a sweet, pretty scent.

It's the kind of perfume that's refreshing on a hot summer's day. Like having a nice cool iced drink, but for the skin.

It's really not that expensive for a 3.3 oz, especially if you can get it on sale (there's good offers on it everywhere), so it's good value for money.

The sillage is also good for what is essentially a subtle and unimposing perfume, and best of all it has good lasting power.

A great summer investment for your collection.",08/16/11 00:54,Starlight_Angel
Hero Burberry,"I agree with others that it is the most practical, but it is not generic smelling like some say. It’s a woody fragrance, yet the EDP is the most woody for me. I get a lot of compliments on this. I like it a lot. It’s professional smelling. You can find testers on EBay for around $45. Crazy",11/10/25 18:25,CDCD
Hero Burberry,"The EDT version is the cleanest-smelling and most practical version. It's truly fresh and quite masculine. The other products in the series can be a bit boring with their leather and coconut notes, but the final stages are all very clean and practical. I think they offer a quality profile that's not too noticeable yet, but blends in well.

There are four fragrances in this series, and all four are different from each other.

I'd like to help those interested in this perfume sort:

Clean, light, bright, vibrant, and sophisticated: EDT
Slightly subtle, but relatively energetic, with a slight coconut note: EDP
Deepest, very leather-themed, close to the skin, and uniform: PARFUM
The coconut is the most pronounced, vibrant, and leather-themed: PARFUM INTENSE

My preference for this particular fragrance was definitely the EDT version. The only version in the series that feels different is the EDT. If you're blind-buying, go for the EDT only. It's inferior to the others in terms of longevity, but on average, all of them last 4-8 hours.",11/08/25 15:47,erkek

Hero Burberry,"This is definitely a safe blind buy. I love the edt for daily use, it's powerful in the beginning, very spicy, but quickly calms down and you can really appreciate the scent in its fullest form. I'm not great at describing all of the notes, but to me this is such a good blend of citrus and woody, neither is begging for the attention, which allows you to really appreciate both for what they're worth. It's such a simple fragrance that you can't really go wrong with purchasing it and as long as you can handle the spicy opening, you will really like this for a good daily and year-round fragrance.",10/14/25 07:09,Rjles

Hero Burberry,"This is totally my kind of scent. I love woody colognes, and this one delivers. It's almost entirely built on a warm rich cedar base that is very masculine and appealing. It brings lots of peppery spice to add character and the juniper and bergamot give it liveliness and lift. There's just enough sweetness to smooth things out a bit, and the overall accord is a traditional woodsy one but with a modern refinement. This is a great versatile all season scent that's safe but interesting. The only knock is that the performance is pretty average, with several hours of moderate projection before it becomes more of a lingering skin scent. This is one you will need to reapply it you're looking for an all-day scent. But so-so performance aside, if you like woody scents you still can't go wrong with this one. I dig it.",09/09/25 08:02,doggymcnuggets

Tonight we went out to eat and in the car I kept getting powdery, masculine, clean whiffs of something off him. He smelled soooo good. I complimented him and he told me it was this. Will probably be getting him a bottle for Christmas, bc it def suited him well. I think this may be a “boring” option for people who are really into cologne collecting, but it’s a nice gift for guys who just like to smell nice and appreciate a little something nice.

Funny how it doesn't remind people of anything else but other flankers of Hero and Wood&Wood by Issey Miyake. 2000+ votes and only three similar fragrances, I haven't seen anything like that on Fragrantica.

This is one of the only fragrances that I would call truly ""woody"". This is absolutely cedar heavy. So much cedar that it comes off smokey for some reason. But still the performance is underwhelming + I quickly become noseblind to it.

Overall nice woody scent with a fresh spicy accent. 4/5 or maybe 3.8/5",05/04/25 07:06,semyonsemyoff
Hero Burberry,"I just wanted to add context to the other reviews who say this is “generic”. I feel like it might give off those vibes because it is blended so incredibly well. This is actually a positive if you are looking for a very inoffensive, office, or first date friendly fragrance.

I liked the EDT better than the EDP because I felt the EDT was a little closer to the skin. It has a gentle presence that isn’t too old or young. On the one hour dry down, the sweet cedar kinda gives a tonka bean note.",05/02/25 20:36,Wildnectarsantal
Hero Burberry,"Meh. Smells cheaper than Hero Eau de Parfum.

honestly, it’s pretty similar to Hero Eau de Parfum. It’s more like the leaves of a tree, just faintly in the distance, like you're walking through a park with your dog. It’s grassy and, frankly, kind of boring.

It doesn't really smell like a person at all. More like a used leather bag and jeans. It's just kind of there. Flat and uninteresting.",04/19/25 17:04,sagebelknap
Hero Burberry,I did not expect to like it so much. Just wish the performance and longevity were better. Scent bubble pushes for 3-4 hours and then becomes a skin scent.,04/17/25 03:52,302JH
Hero Burberry,I received this as a sample from Sephora. Its starts out with a very strong bergamot note and then quickly fades into a light dusty woody scent which doesnt linger long. This is not a very strong projecting fragrance. It definitely sits close to the skin and leans masculine. It reminds me of a weaker Born in Roma Uomo. Not full bottle worthy in my opinion. This would be a good fragrance for someone who wants a light woody smell.,04/16/25 15:44,Alchemy de Enigma
Hero Burberry,"I bought this fragrance when it first came out. I loved it then and I rebought it and still love it. However, I love the opening. That’s it. The projection and longevity is weak. Which is kind of a shame because the scent profile is incredible. It’s SUPER Bergamot heavy. It’s probably the most bergamot in a fragrance I’ve ever smelled but I really like it. I see how people compare the harsh opening to bug spray, but it kind of tickles your nose in a good way. Overall good everyday grab in the spring/summer time. Wish it lasted longer but great scent profile. 7/10",03/24/25 19:35,Connormaroney

The first time I wore it I wasn't overly impressed, but what I find is that the more I wear it the more I appreciate it's simplicity and versatility. It's a grower for sure. Performance could be better, but it's not terrible. I get around 5 hours of moderate projection, and moderate silage. Signature scent worthy and a 5 for me.",03/01/25 17:36,Cologneinhaler

Becomes slightly earthy, maybe some leather?
Turns woody/coniferous, then balsamic.
More woods, a little smokiness.
Becomes a pleasing cedar wood skin scent.
As it warms off the skin it has a soapy-apple aroma.

Nothing is too synthetic or low quality, impossible to offend anyone and gets the job done. Great for all seasons in office-daily use, can be bought for very cheap prices; I believe 150ml bottle can be found for 70 usd which is a pretty good deal. Scents like this one, MB explorer, Monclear Pour Homme or Missioni Parfum are amazing all year rounders without smelling just like fresh clean citruses. They have some depth and character in them.

Hero Burberry,"Woody bergamot and cedar open Hero. Sweet cedar heated with spice; defanged black pepper. It fills up your olfactories with comfort. I imagine a chest of drawers built by hand by your grandfather. It radiates the care he put into it. This is where the name Hero comes into play for me. While the Adaminotaur swimming around is cool, that hits somewhere nearer maybe the imagery for Musc Ravageur.

Here, Hero brings the thought of one you look up to rather than a savior or a superhero. One who can does things you admire and things you hope one day to be able to do.

The warmth of Hero is somewhere in the neighborhood of Spicebomb or the Night Vision EdT, while staying nearer to the trees rather than all inning the pepper. The sillage is large, even 2 sprays on the back of my hand got attention from a few people 5 feet plus away from me.

Another bit of imagery, which i touched on in my first impressions video, was the image of a stuffed animal lion. A small and favored comfort to a child, the lion also being a heroic figure itself. Maybe one set inside that handmade cedar cupboard in hope its comes to life to be a protector.

A bit into the dry down, a warm apple note tinged with cider cozies up. Autumnal, cedary and dry with walnut, mature.",01/24/25 07:27,jarroditshallbe

It smells woody and spicy but not in a warm terms. It sounds like it’s a basic smell, which it could be but it has something that makes it stand out compared to others in this price range.

Bright with a hint of spice. People say it’s generic but it’s quite unique to my nose. I went back and forth between if I liked this or the EDP more, but I think the EDT is my fav. If I had to strip my 40+ bottle collection (niche, designer, and clones/cheapies) to 10, Burberry Hero EDT would make the cut. Plus my wife likes it on me as well. It’s longevity is it’s only drawback in my opinion. Projects really good for me for maybe an hour and then suddenly turns into a skin scent.

Hero Burberry,"This was ""meh"" to me on intial spray, but, for some reason, I kept wanting to smell it.

After a few days, I realized that this is really good. It's not a heavy or resinous scent, just a lightweight, sweet cedar with a little spice.

Appropriate for just about any occassion or season; it's not sweet to the point of seeming juvenile or dry to the point of smelling overly mature. Longevity and projection are on the lighter side of moderate.

You can get the 100 mL for under $70 right now on discounters, and I think that's fair.

In the end, this went from a ""meh"" to a firm ""like.""",08/28/24 14:11,FragranceAnon
Hero Burberry,"Honestly nothing ground breaking. It’s an inoffensive fragrance that works for any season or occasion. You really cannot go wrong with this one. The projection and longevity is shit, but it’s ok since you can overspray. The bottle really speaks volumes for how creative this fragrance is. You’d be better of buying Versace Dylan blue or Ysl y EDP, but if you’re looking for a yellow ish bottle, get this I guess. Also if you’re new to fragrances and need something that works for everything, maybe get this, but I’d still recommend the previously stated fragrances more. Other than that I would not recommend.

Barely affected by other notes.. It has a sweet woodiness to it.. enhanced by the non-empowering spiciness of black pepper and the green accord of juniper.. and the bergamot is here for a soft citrusy touch, that balances the woodiness.. This is just.. PERFECT... Not a singular synthetic note to my nose... Smells like hiking in a deep green forest...

Hero Burberry,"Citrusy spicy opening with a warm wood in the background. Definately more for day and warmer months, as it lacks the sweetness and heaviness of notes like leather to make it appropriate for cool weather.
This gives me the same vibes like Sauvage, that is, a spicy bergamot opening with a warm base ( here it is wood instead of amber ). The wood lingers for the drydown, providing a serene, warm, soothing feeling, smelling like cardboard / recycled book pages with tea, peppered with spicyness, sitting close to the skin.

I like Burberry in general and this was something that I expected to be good and it fulfilled my expectations. It has that overcoat-scarf-hat combination kind of smell (by that, I mean it would suit that trio really good).

Hero Burberry,"People have to understand summer fragrances, some climates are hot and humid and you will be very limited on what you can wear and enjoy, and this definitely won't shine in Switzerland summer, this is needs a Dubai, Bangkok, Indonesia kind of humidity and this will shine, it gives me a cigar humidor vibe not that i am saying it smells like tobacco, this woody with hint of herb, i used to wear the discontinued Dsquard he wood, probably similar scent profile but to my nose Burberry hero EDT is the winner, i have ignored hero because realistically Burberry makes super safe fresh fragrances for the summer, not alot of character in them if that makes sense they are your typical YouTube reviewers safe for likes and views, not this one tho, i don't care about your European beautiful summer breeze wear creed smw or rasasi hawas for that, you live in high humidity climate sample this one, look for 2-3 ml sample give it a try for that humid night out, i have a sample of this, and i do have some nice collection for the humidity this is on my wishlist and will definitely pick up a full bottle",06/14/24 03:49,rolls.oud&cigar
Hero Burberry,"While it may not be ground-breaking or very unique, this fragrance is an inoffensive smell that can be worn in any occasion, I would highly recommend.",06/12/24 16:43,lewisty22
Hero Burberry,"Finally picked up a reasonably priced bottle after trying it in store over a year ago. Smells completely different than I remember. The bergamot is so fresh and juicy, and I love the strong cedar backbone. This is perfect for all year wear, as with most Burberry fragrances, performance and longevity are slightly above average. I have a feeling I'll be reaching for this one a lot this summer.",06/07/24 07:34,SrSadFish

Hero Burberry,"Got this as a sample kit with the 2 flankers as a gift from buying London. Honestly, this is pretty nice. On my skin, it's really weak though. A skin scent within an hour, and doesn't last longer than 3-4 hrs. Also, I'd say it's overpriced, even though it's about 40-60 euros",04/25/24 06:56,Aleksandr_Artemev
Hero Burberry,"I've got this as a sample from notino, it reminds me of legend spirit for some reason.
It's a nice freshie but a bit generic to be real, good but doesn't wow me in any way",04/23/24 10:37,Adrian Papaki
Hero Burberry,"I honestly think this is a masterpiece. It's a very woody fragrance but with a warm, slightly sweet hint to it. It's masculine but sexy. Youthful but sophisticated. I could wear this all day long, every day. At work, on a date, just lounging round the house... I can't get enough of this smell.
It's perfect for all age ranges too. It's just a great all round classy scent. I've recently bought a few supposedly woody fragrances on my search for a new signature scent. Terre d'Hermes, Dior Homme Sport, MontBlanc Explorer but this is hands down the best of the bunch and as soon as it hit my nostrils, I knew I'd found the one.
Projection and silage is average. It's not beast mode but it's not a poor performer either. It's what I'd expect from this sort of price point and there's nothing stopping you from applying a couple of extras sprays after a few hours if you want to top up the performance.
This gets a perfect 10 from me. It's my new signature scent and is probably the best masculine woody fragrance available today.",04/22/24 10:13,Brett_Sinclair

Hero Burberry,"Bergamot provides a fresh, citrusy aroma, juniper adds a crisp and slightly woody note, while cedar offers a warm, earthy scent. Sets down nicely on the skin and is not too overpowering or masculine.

The combination smells refreshing and comforting, and the fact that i find it unisex highlights its versatility and appeal across genders. A well-balanced and elegant fragrance can certainly be appreciated by anyone! I really like it.",04/10/24 09:21,VanHessen1234
Hero Burberry,"nobody gives burberry hero any recognition, the scent is amazing, its a fresh spicy at first then it develops into a woody cedar scent, its a very pleasant smell that is super underrated, the bergamot note is super nice and smells amazing.
the longevity is about 7-8 hours which is enough to wear to school ( which is mostly what I use it for ), its also fancy enough to use for formal events like business meetings, I preferred to wear it during spring. its projection is kinda mid, it projects well for the first 3 hours but after that it isn't as noticeable.
it costs about 120$ cad for 100ml, not a terrible price but not worth it honestly

It is worth picking up as a more formal fragrance",04/09/24 11:20,latterlyjeremyfragrance

Hero Burberry,"I love this fragrance! It's simple but it is one of my favorites! While overall proformance isn't that good, it is still a beautiful fragrance while also being versitile. It smells very woody with some fresh bergamot and personally reminds me of the smell of a fresh cristmas tree. Fresh, woody and citrusy would be how I describe this fragrance. I love it!",03/30/24 16:21,chumino
Hero Burberry,"This is way better than the EDP. Please make sure you're reviewing the EDT!

Just vanilla and woods. Beautiful Pacific Northwest mountain range.",03/30/24 07:31,FragPW123
Hero Burberry,"So why do I think this smells like the perfect mix of Mont Blanc Legend and Dior Savage? Two that I LOVE on men. It's amazing!
It also smells similar to Burberry Brit Rhythm, another love. In fact I could say Hero is a more refined more expensive smelling Rhythm.",03/28/24 22:26,violetaura

Hero Burberry,"This bad boy right here is a masterpiece, it's everything I could want in an everyday masculine fragrance. It has a beautiful sweet citrusy followed by a powerful woody and addictive dry down while still maintaining that subtle sweet scent. I love it and it's my beautiful underrated boy.",03/10/24 16:42,burberryherofan
Hero Burberry,"I found this very similar to Diesel Only The Brave. They had both same Virginia Cedar note, similar citruses as top notes, similar spicey note usage (pepper vs coriander). I still give my vote for Diesel Only The Brave, it seems to be a little bit better performer between two.",03/09/24 07:33,buyukbang

Longevity: 7.5/10",02/28/24 08:15,cjwalton27
Hero Burberry,"Easy to wear, sweet top notes, smooth cedar dry down, nothing special but nothing wrong either. If you see a discount, you could grab one. (Mine is 50% off, 50ml).",02/25/24 00:20,Erodeox
Hero Burberry,"Sure, it may be non-complex and fairly simple... but it's a really nice masculine scent. I agree with the reviewer who said it actually ends up being quite unique in its simple goodness. It certainly is versatile. I really like it... although the woodsy vibe isn't my favorite profile overall. Only issue I have is, the performance is unremarkable, while the price is still high compared to other casual frags like Mont Blanc Legend or what have you. So you can overspray it and smell great, but it's a tad pricey for that type of thing. Still... it's an easy everyday reach, so if you like that woodsy profile, go for it.

BTW -- I find using the EDT in the daytime and the EDP in the evening is a great way to go with this.",02/17/24 00:21,bartca89
Hero Burberry,"Bought this for my fiancé because…well…I liked it! It smells amazing on him and I’m sure it does on almost everyone. It’s a fresh, lemony-spicy and tingly opening, then slightly woody, very inviting and „manly“- sweet (just teeny-tiny bit). What’s best is that it doesn’t start to smell „old“ or „worn tor too long“ as I think lots of the gentleman’s perfumes do (like Dior sauvage or gucci guilty etc). In short: Smells like a manly man who just showered and is always in a good mood with a big smile on his face but in a cool, not goofy way",02/15/24 14:12,Filolek3037
Hero Burberry,"It's been awhile since the last time I've worn this, but boy, is it good. For around 50 euros, it's a very nice-smelling fragrance that lasts I'd say, around 5–6 hours. It has a very woody/citrusy smell and smells very fresh. As far as the sillage, it's moderate. I very much recommend this for spring, summer, and fall.
Update: I sprayed some on my wrist yesterday night (around 12am) and I can still lightly smell it at 6:40PM today.",02/09/24 16:03,jermey fragrance fan

Hero Burberry,"As a woman, I love this on a man! Smelling it, I associate a romantic date or a late summer evening stroll hand-in-hand by a lake, cuddling up when the colder air hits after sunset. The combination of the cooler top / middle notes and the warmer base notes reminds me of late summer and early fall days in nature. I also appreciate that there is no unpleasant sharpness, just freshness, which adds a tad of sophistication.",01/09/24 08:07,KöbiD

Hero Burberry,"This was my signature scent for the longest time. Wore it for 2 years straight (maybe skipped some days). My partner loved it and when I was around the house I only sprayed twice and never more than 4. So definitely projected within arms length and smells pleasant. It's rather safe and hits it's stride best on a warmer day. I started to associate this scent with moments in my life I needed to be daring, brave or courageous towards the end of my 100ml bottle and the funny thing is so did the people around me because they've smelt this off my skin for so many years. I created this signature identity around this fragrance which makes me consider picking up the EDP for winter. I think what you get here is a money well spent pleasant softly projecting woody fragrance that won't blow you away but has so much versatility and is a joy to wear in the great outdoors.",01/01/24 08:13,hihero

Hero Burberry,"I was not impressed with this one. I feel like they couldn't decide if Ithey wanted something sweet or something woody aki to Dior homme 2020. What you are left with is a generic woodsy scent with some sweetness in the background. It's not bad it actually smells wonderful, but it's just kind of boring, like I've smelled similar a hundred times but what I usually smell that is similar is better. Longevity is nothing to impress either I get 4 to 6 hrs. Overall I have to give this a 7 out of 10 as it's just mediocre.",12/23/23 04:59,Trueblood84

Hero Burberry,"This and the EDP are unique. Nothing smells like them. They stand out on any walk through smelling of a departments scents. It's not blue and it's not ambroxan and it's not sweet. This bucks the trend. It doesn't smell like any older or classic scent so it really has potential to create new and unique impressions on people. This stands out. If you smell several scents in a day and also smell this, you will understand. Closely harmonized accords of a gentlemanly and sexy wood, not smoke nor tobacco. Not fresh citrus or sailing scent. This is a sophisticated lumberjacks go to, the homesteading bitcoin investor who home schools his kids and knows self sufficiency and tradition forever trump the worlds cheap plastic values and fake virtue signalling for ""diversity"" and conformity. For the farmer who drinks bourbon and the philosopher who still reads books on paper. Mans cologne of thought and action.",12/21/23 06:23,Dannatello
Hero Burberry,"The smell is addictive, to say the least. One of my favorite colognes ever. Its performance and longevity is ok.

Hero Burberry,"Probably the most versatile and safe scent that you can get.
It ticks all the boxes: it can be causal, sporty, elegant but also fresh and summery scent.
Bottle looks very nice too, simplicity at its best.
It is very weak though, but that's actually good because it makes it a good everyday ""work"" scent, you won't suffocate everyone around with it.
Nothing great and extraordinary about it, but you really can't go wrong with this one.",11/10/23 05:28,nabojsa

No stinky woods or green poisonous smelling woods used, only clean smelling woods.

but the performance is what made me sell this, very weak. maybe would work for an office fragrance but personally i’d want something stronger. if they released this fragrance again but in a higher concentration i’d probably buy it.

I love the simplicity of the bottle design, the versatility and wearability of the fragrance itself - it just really does it for me. The reviews saying it’s nothing mind blowing are correct, but it’s also not another ambroxan or tonka bomb. Clean, sophisticated, and safe. Definitely blind buy worthy!",08/01/23 17:02,bmcd921
Hero Burberry,"Smells like Lacoste l'Homme and YSL l'Homme.

There's nothing wrong with this fragrance, really. The only problem is that it's been done a thousand times over and it offers nothing new. Smells nice, but boooooooooorrrrrrrrrring and as generic as it can be. As cedar fragrances go, I prefer l'Eau d'Issey pour Homme l'Eau de Cèdre. It's more polarising in the community, but at least it's not boring.

At the end of the day, Burberry Hero does its job: makes you smell nice, but that's all it does. It might wow some people who don't know much about men's fragrances but it's completely mediocre to the learned noses. Just like Adam Driver: he acts, and that's all he does.",07/29/23 13:08,washudtoj

Burberry Hero
Safe, Simple, Cedar

Like all Burberry scents there's nothing out of the ordinary here. You end up with Juniper and Cedar, pleasant, inoffensive, mildly projecting, completely safe for office wear. This is a total snoozer, but the performance is at least middling with a cedar note that will make it to lunch.
Not a bottle buy for me, but not an awful scent for workplace use.",07/27/23 06:38,JusttheFactsMan
Hero Burberry,"Not everything needs to be complex to be great. This is a linear and simple fragrance but done very well. A cedar based masculine scent. Subtle yet very manly and potentially extremely sexy if used during a summer date night. If she catches a whiff of this it won’t go unnoticed. Only drawback is longevity, about 6 hours but i think projection is as perfect as it is. It doesn’t need to be overpowering to work its magic",07/20/23 11:15,Xscent
Hero Burberry,scent is amazing just wish it could last longer,07/19/23 07:39,lufragrance420
Hero Burberry,"This is a basic but well-executed masculine fragrance. It was designed to sit squarely in the middle of safe market ground. In my mind it's reminiscent of some of the stronger men's colognes from the 1980's and it's appealing to the same type of wearer. Despite its simplicity it does have merit. It opens with a compelling raw bergamot smell, intermingled with juniper berry to give it deeper tone. There isn't much else to it but the wood. It smells good, is unambiguously male, and can be worn by nearly anyone.

The fragrance community might be disappointed by it but there is a good reason this is a best-seller in the US right now. It's a mass market departure from the Blues in a way that does not feel dated. The bottle design and marketing are communicating all of this pretty clearly too. It looks like a golden-hued brick with bold lettering, even moreso than Terre d'Hermes. In an calculating way that clarity makes it stand out even more on a shelf full of gaudy Paco Rabannes.",07/16/23 19:42,BananaXango

The scent didn't excite me. Especially in the drydown, the Hero gets slightly stinging. A property that is often found in cedar scents.",07/08/23 03:44,DichterundDenker
Hero Burberry,"I find it amusing when a designer fragrance is called generic and isn't remotely similar to anything else.

Hero by Burberry is like stepping into a fresh cedar forest on a brisk morning.

I can't help but compare it to Dior Homme 2020; while Dior takes you on a crisp, clean journey with its breezy and effervescent vibes, Burberry's Hero is like the rugged and adventurous sibling.

It smells like a very attractive man I would feel comfortable around. Sweet, reminds me a little of shampoo, but nothing light or fruity. It’s very pleasant and would be great for summer or daytime. My boyfriend and I compared it to Burberry Hero EDP and both agreed this is the winner. The bottle is nice and classic, not too flashy just like the scent.

Hero Burberry,"I think Hero is a great name for this masculine, somewhat warm and powdery, slightly sweet cologne. The notes are simple but very clear. This is a very understated scent that doesn't offer much from afar but up close is very nice.

This could easily be a signature scent and should work for men of all ages, although I do think this would fit a more quiet, understated type of person. 7.5/10 on scent. It does smell nice but nothing I'd go out of my way to smell, yet at the same time it would be a great blind buy. If you consider price then this could easily be an 8 or 8.5/10 scent.

After a couple of months with the sample, I'm bumping my overall score to an 8.5/10. This is just a really great, everyday, casual scent that I could see myself buying one day.",06/30/23 18:03,Psalzarulo

Hero Burberry,"Upon first sprays, it doesn't seem like this edt will perform well. While Hero is not a strong fragrance, it does give some sillage and lasts a few hours.

If the price drops to where other Burberry scents are. ( Like 40 bucks) i can completely understand people making this their signature scent.
Right now i feel that scents like Explorer and Dylan blue will have more of a wow effect for a cheaper price.

In general i personally like to wear something different that makes me stand out and i gladly pay a little more for that so this is not for me.
In a world where everything in a perfume store at least smells nice, this for 70 bucks for a 100 ml is not a great pick up.",06/26/23 06:53,Basman0

Performance is good but not worth the full price. Not an everyday option after real-world use, especially in hot weather. Strong projection fades with moderate longevity",05/17/23 04:25,Parfumpop
Hero Burberry,"I'll first start with a story. Almost 30 years ago, as a high school student, I purchased a cheap Imperial Leather deodorant, a green one. It was a typical fresh masculine fragrance with lots of pine/juniper notes. Well, it proved to be a an absolute magnet for schoolgirls and I often received compliments from them. Mind you, I wasn't a popular guy, so, yeah, that fragrance kind of made me popular :) It wasn't my cup of tea though but I didn't hate it. And actually I thought it smelled more expensive than it really was. I haven't encountered a similar fragrance recently.

Well, I got some samples from a beauty store today, and when I finally sprayed the Burberry Hero on a paper I immediately got those old memories of that Imperial Leather deodorant and all these girls that were mad about it. I don't know whether the Burberry Hero and that Imperial Leather deo are exactly the same, I'm only relying on 30 years of fading memory but I'd say they are in the same ballpark. And while it may sound like comparing the Hero to some cheap deodorant, that was not my idea. It's a very nice and masculine fragrance that you can't go wrong with. It's not one of those masterpieces that everybody talks about, it's also not one of these polarizing fragrances that people love or hate. It's just a very nice, above average quality, well-crafted and safe fragrance with old school hints (no pun intended), fresh, manly, assertive but not overpowering. I'm not sure I would purchase it and I will have to demo it to my wife and see whether she would act as a teenage schoolgirl (pun intended).",05/17/23 03:58,CyberGene
Hero Burberry,"Got this as a small sample, and from the first sniff off the atomizer I thought - nice! I like the woodiness of this, with a lot of cedar. It's the note I like in other perfumes, plus juniper is ingredient for gin, my favourite spirit. Pleasant smell, but I have to say that I can't pick it up from my clother after few hours, it could last longer.
I still need to compare this one to EDP I also have for tests, but I believe the notes are slightly different as well.",05/16/23 23:29,czajnik
Hero Burberry,"Hero is manly, woody, and fresh. No sweetness or something horribly chemical here. Mr. Guichard's professional hand can be detected in this product. And though the fragrance is not particularly distinctive it is indeed very ""nice"". It lasts some 6/7 hours and projects discreetly. It is a very ""professional"" office scent. Is it bad? Not at all: it does very well what it has been designed to do. Is it particularly memorable? Certainly not. Try it.",05/13/23 19:13,Palosanto
Hero Burberry,"WHAT A MASTERPIECE BY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMERS! Simple but Manly from young to old….. woman/ Men I’ve received compliments just wanted this EDT to be stronger!

One love ❤️✌️on earth 🌍",05/13/23 17:15,bolancb
Hero Burberry,"Hero EDT is clearly very spicy and woodsy and it's same characteristics stay until the end. However, it's not new smell. I find it very close to Dior Savage. Someone who doesn't want to spend 100$ to test this one can buy Ajmal Kuro (also a clone of Dior Savage). It's about 85% clone of Hero with super beast mode projection and longevity. It will be available at around 20$ or so. Hero is not worth the price I feel and also the blend is not that great. I would rate it 5.",05/09/23 10:08,hiteshvs
Hero Burberry,"Very woodsy, very fresh, very nonoffensive, but also very generic. It’s not a bad scent, but you’ve probably smelt something very similar before in other popular fragrance.

I haven’t really seen this comparison before, but it kind of reminds me of LNDL by YSL. I think it’s the bergamot/cedar with a hint of spiciness that makes these scents pretty similar. But LNDL smells way more sexy/interesting/delicious than Hero. Hero kind of smells like LNDL’s depressed younger brother, haha.

Overall not too bad. Not really interested in buying a decant/bottle, but I can see how this can appeal to some. It’s a great office fragrance due to it being nonoffensive, clean and manly. But it doesn’t wow me a whole lot.",05/03/23 16:51,LOUDPACK
Hero Burberry,"Hero is beautiful but it can't compare to the intoxicating essence of Dg light blu. Hero is dry and weak, relying only on three cedar woods for its strength. Differentiating the scents is a mystery. I'm at the beginning",05/02/23 06:42,Cengizhannn

Hero Burberry,"I think it would be a great fragrance for everyday use, especially for the office. It has a bit of character but it won't bother anyone. The performance is medium, which is good for me. I don't always want a super strong and aggressive fragrance.
What about the bottle? I think it's very sleek and modern. I love it! I'm really happy I bought Burberry Hero and I can't wait to wear it more often.",04/07/23 01:32,Greatnessss

Hero Burberry,Woody and vaguely spicy fragrance. Really pleasing. I’d call in the perfect office scent. Only fragrance that got any compliments at work.,02/03/23 05:50,Beniamin
Hero Burberry,For me it shares some similarities with Dior Homme 2020. At the current prices though I would choose DH 2020. If this makes it down to the Touch price range it will definitely be worthy of a full bottle purchase. The market is flooded with samples so I'm hoping it will be sooner rather than later. Between the EDT and EDP I much prefer EDT.,01/31/23 09:33,neodave
Hero Burberry,"In two words: Quality, Understated. It's not challenging or head turning, rather its understated and mass appealing. Making it great for the office and daily use. The minimalist bottle allows you to really appreciate the little details. It exudes quality, very heavy and solid feeling in the hand and the weighty magnetic top adds to that. The color contrasted atomizer is really good, maybe amongst the best, which is a good thing because you will need quite a few sprays of this to have it project and last. The fragrance notes do not contrast or change over time, rather they merge into one singular understated olfactory experience which is a fresh yet dark wood. Its smells familiar and comforting but you can never quite put your finger on what it is which is what keeps drawing you back for more.",01/25/23 17:39,bashar11

Hero Burberry,"Burberry hero is a very subtle and inoffensive scent. Something you can wear day to day in any environment or under any circumstance. Whilst it’s a great compliment getter in the summertime, it heavily underperforms in the wintertime.",01/17/23 12:52,sammyboysmells

Hero Burberry,"I really like this! Sure, it's nothing ground-breaking, but it's probably my most worn fragrance. Super mass-appealing and its simplicity is what makes it great IMO. It's like every male fragrance mixed together. It's citrusy, woodsy, metallic, musky, fresh, and aquatic all at the same time. Opening is great but the dry-down is fantastic- a super clean smelling, slightly soapy citrus which I really love. I dont really think it's ""dated"" as many say. Just an all around great fragrance that's an easy reach. Only complaint is the longevity but it does its job. I get like a solid 6 hours with this usually. 8/10",01/07/23 21:40,enzoespin
Hero Burberry,"one of the more basic smelling perfumes. If you tell any regular person to describe cologne, chances are it'd smell like Burberry Hero. But, I like it because it's a nice fragrance and I think it can be worn all 4 seasons. Though mainly in the spring/summer/fall, I do think you can get away with this in the winter too.",01/02/23 20:22,z2
Hero Burberry,"Honestly i wanted to love this for the fact that is a SUPER generic easy versatile scent. All the way through you get a dry aromatic slightly spice coniferous cedar and it's something that i've smelled a million times, really reminds me of a body wash.

With that being said this stuff smells absolutley fantastic and is super mass appealing but the probelm is that it is just sooo weak. The fragrace is very thin and airy to begin with and a single spray to the wrist is hardly detectable and drowing myself in this it becomes a vague skin scent in 30 min",12/21/22 19:24,Brdnz

Hero Burberry,"It's pretty generic, it smells good on my husband but doesn´t have a ""WOW"" factor.",12/20/22 13:20,Alicea
Hero Burberry,"The most 'whatever' I've felt for a fragrance.

It's clean, it smells good, but in a clean and smells good way that reminds me of slightly above average room air freshener with random sky blue packaging like Febreeze. How pathetically weak it is + the slight soapiness also contributes to this air freshener feel.

Nothing special about this at all, no twist, no mystery note that keeps you coming back for more.

It is totally devoid of personality and completely unmemorable. Your life would be exactly the same if you have or have not smelt this fragrance. Just pass on it and spend your money elsewhere.",12/19/22 11:27,doodluv
Hero Burberry,"Simple scent but absolutely beautiful imo. I love crisp, airy, masculine fragrances and this is just that. The note breakdown is a simple and fairly accurate description of what you are getting with this one. Fresh woods, clean/airy juniper with a touch of bergamot and pepper. There is a very slight soapiness to the scent. Even though it is not listed, I would assume there is a lavender note in here. Perhaps the overall scent could be described as a simpler, smoother, far more wearable version of Santal 33. The scent is extremely versatile - casual to formal, warm or cold- it’s a modern masculine scent that just works. Love this one, just wish performance was better. Will need to overspray for this to last more than 3hrs.",12/17/22 09:17,Rafrosa

The smell is good, I don't think it will offend anyone, at least the grand majority will like. I wore it only during the days, for casual things like getting lunch, or shopping around.

You would think there is vetiver in here because of that peppery wood smell, but it's just actual pepper with wood. But it smells like vetiver

Not ideal performance or projection but unless you want to shout out your presence with the way you smell its fine. It definitely isn't a 'wear you' cologne. I'm introverted, but not shy. Hero fits my personality perfectly.",11/04/22 12:10,BenD

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"I have a tester bottle that looks exactly as shown (vertical - not diagonal -white plaid design, tho without the cap) but labeled Burberry Limited EDT only, no Brit or Summer anywhere on the bottle or sticker. The sticker on the back states very similar notes but with some subtle differences to those on Fragrantica, they are as follows:
Top notes: lime, icy pear, green almonds (not tea)
Heart notes: white peony, sugared almonds
Base notes: mahogany wood, amber, vanilla beans ( not musk)

This fragrance opens with a crisp, zingy, bright and very fresh lime note that manages not to be sharp, is slightly green without being bitter. Within an hour it gives way to a delicately sweet “wedding” almond note, then it rests on a very smooth wood and vanilla/amber base. This phase lasts for maybe 4 more hours but is very close to the skin.
In the excruciating summer heat I don’t mind reapplying it every hour to enjoy the refreshing initial limeade blast.
Overall it’s an easy grab for hot summer days when you need a zing but still crave some sweetness 😊",06/05/22 03:55,Tinabill
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"My bottle of this fragrance with the same name edp and all, is designed like the burberry brit gold, red, and brit sheer.
From what I c tell burberry brit edp has the larger plaid design with bigger black stripes, mine is fine print with more like pinstripe plaid - in the same colour pallet.

My bottle is more sheer feing than recent burberry brit edp I have tested, the latter one is much more pronounced.
Both bottles have that same warm sweet wool nutty smell, with a cosy freshness. The lime is not at all citrus or dry, the pear is not fruity per se, perhaps lends a gentle sweet facet.

I very much enjoy the bottle with the larger print, i might use to swap/sell this one I have. Both are nice but just a preference.",12/22/21 18:10,dglightblue
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"One of my first ever perfumes.
Very easy to wear, and affordable.

The opening is very heavy in lime and tea for me, with a hint of sweetness from the pear.

That citrus and tea scent stays through the whole journey, but becomes more mellow, sweet with pear and somewhat smooth, thanks to the almond, and musk.

An easy buy, not overwhelming and very pleasant. Good purchase for a sensitive nose, amazing for the summer and good throughout the whole year.

The sillage is pretty weak unless over sprayed, the longevity is great.",09/25/21 03:18,marysunroyse
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"The opening is very citrusy, fresh and clean but it quickly deepens into a vanillic, almondy ambery scent. It's not exactly pleasing, nor is it disgusting. Very warm and cozy. Feminine and not too in your face. I don't get much pear to be honest, not a fruity perfume at all, BUT the tea is here somewhere behind if you pay attention. I find Brit Summer way better, more airy and subtle than Brit. Although both are immensely sweet which is why I stopped wearing them after 20. This is not a very mature scent. I place this on the same line asLa Vie est Belle or Black Opium... young girly girl perfumes. It's definitely a day scent, uncomplicated, smooth and happy. Smells like garden afternoons to me !",12/28/20 07:56,Cherihanei
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"In the top this is very very fresh. It reminds me of Elizabeth Arden Green Tea meets Shalimar Souffle de Lumiere. Lots of citrus, some tea and a little bit of baked lemon goods. There's peony and musk in the mix. Those are the notes for me. Not too complex. Wonderful for summer if you like sweet and citrus. It's much fresher and less dark and sultry than the Shalimar flankers.",06/28/19 07:53,gtabasso
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"I am in love once again with one of many fragrances by Burberry. A real delight. Those who want to compare it to Brit EDP or EDT, although nice in their own right, would be mistaken. There is no tonka, vanilla, or sugar present in this fragrance. Instead smooth green tea, and soft musk are added to the traditional peony and green almond. The warm amber and dark wood in Brit Summer is much lighter as well, leaving way for the musky, citrusy, almondy freshness of this fragrance. A nice warm weather fragrance that has very good longevity and silage for an EDT. Good for any occasion, can definitely be worn without offending others.",01/17/19 11:13,pamelalasalle110
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"Delicious, delicious! I instantly and easily loved Brit summer. Light, fresh, sweet citrusy. Now this scent reminds me of Disneyland since I wore it there and I could smell it all day. It takes more sprays to get longevity but get some on your shirt and you'll be catching yummy candied pear-citrus whiffs all day.

This is so fresh-sweet it is mouthwatering. I love lime and pear. Tea gives it a calming property and ensures this never becomes overly sweet or screechy. The sugared almond keeps it mellow-sweet. A perfect balance of calm/energy/fresh.
Wear this for a friendly perk-up, or for summer of course.
Try this if Brit was too heavy.
I think I am officially a Burberry groupie. Now, time to scour the web for an extra bottle as back-up. Summer lasts 6 months here!! I'd love my summer to smell of this.",12/27/17 11:30,Erinbath22
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"To start off I’m a man and I got this fragrance by mistake as I ordered the original Burberry Brit for men but got this instead.

BUT I looked at the note breakdown at the back of the bottle and thought the note breakdown looked interesting so I decided to give it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this smelled. After smelling this I was actually confused as this smells like it could be a mans fragrance or unisex at least as it smells VERY similar to Givenchy PI and due to the mahogany note in this I’d even say this is also more masculine than PI.

To describe the scent on its own this opens up with a nice blast of lime,tea and almond giving this a very smooth but fresh and relaxing smell.Once this dries down the citrus and tea stays in the background but then the almond and mahogany take over giving this a milky but deep masculine touch. I really love the Mahogany note in this which is similar to the Mahogany note in Mahogany Woods by Bath and Body Works. All in all I love this smell and it smells like a half lemonade/half iced tea mix if you then applied almond milk. It sounds weird but this stuff is delicious smelling and great for all seasons for both Men and Women.

Performance on this is great as it lasts 6-12 hours and this doesn’t project very well BUT it does leave a nice Sillage and you will get whiffs if this hours later.

Needless to say even though I got sent this by mistake I’m going to end up keeping this hidden gem and I actually like this scent better than Brit anyways !

First initial wearing review — 8 out of 10 ! Unique smell with a great blend of notes that’s good for all season",12/05/17 11:46,Ryanmmas26

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"I have a like-dislike relationship with this fragrance and have more than once considered giving it away. I'm glad I didn't.

I finally realized that what kinda spoils this fragrance for me is the green tea and lime, which initially open strong and sharp (in my opinion).

For this reason, I never spray it on my neck since it would be overpowering and screechy. If you must use it behind your ears, use the dab method. The wrists and inner elbow are best for sprays.

Once it dries down, the soft almond and amber come through leaving a creamy, warm scent.

The sillage can be strong if you use a heavy hand, but this doesn't typically last to the end of the day without re-spraying. Longevity might be better when sprayed on clothing.

I initially thought that this fragrance was best used in the summer as it's likely to project a lot better in warmer weather. Nope. I tried using it during the summer once and ended up with a headache-inducing cloying mess. My body chemistry doesn't do well with green tea and lime/lemon notes in warm weather, but I carry them flawlessly in colder months.

Burberry Brit has lemon in it, yet I find it to be a lot more wearable than Brit Summer. So if I were to pick between the two, I'd go for the original Brit.

I would suggest testing Brit Summer before you buy it, as those tart notes may not work well for everyone. I don't regret this blind-buy and I'm glad I held on to it.",08/22/17 08:35,Linda JK

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"In general, I'm a fan of the Burberry Brit family of scents, and I think that Burberry Brit Summer EDT is a nice addition to it. This scent opens with a strong lime/pear blast that is way too bright for fall/winter. Am sure this would be refreshing in the summer - which is, obviously, it's intended season. The tea shows up shortly afterwards, but on my skin, the lime dominates for a couple of hours. Eventually, it settles into a slightly sweet peony/tea scent with a hint of amber for me. I look forward to revisiting in the appropriate season.

Longevity - 6-7 hours
Sillage - moderate for first 2 hours, soft for the next 4, then fades almost completely away
Season - most definitely summer",12/28/16 14:01,lilybet11

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"Hi ladies, here a male short take on this...
I just bought it for a girl...it was a blind buy, what can I say? we were not dissapointed at all...it smells nice and citrusy in a nice feminine flowery way...something quite different to be honest...but in a good way...very distintive and feminine...you can feel there is quality in it...not cheap smelling at all and I guess a useful one in everybody´s collection...",03/28/15 04:02,daynierds
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"This Brit flanker opens up with a green tea/citrus combination, with the addition of a really juicy pear. You can grasp a hint of these notes in the original Brit, but you can tell right off the bat this is going to be a much fresher version!

The heart is pretty close in comparison to the original Brit - the musky, almost-powdered-rice-or-osmanthus-like quality of sweet yet bitter almonds. Fizzy and slightly musky, but the tea throughout the fragrance makes Brit Summer a little more crisp and sheer. Sometimes I get bits of Honeysuckle flower (real life flower, not ""In perfumery"" flower!), amongst the heart notes, though it is not listed here.

I feel this is a flanker situation where if you have one, you don't need the other - though I do find these are two bottles that are pleasant for winter vs. summer. Overall, when comparing the original vs. flanker side by side, I think Brit Summer wins me over with it's added freshness! It avoids any chance of the scent becoming cloying as it wears on.

Soft sillage, and decent longevity! I can always smell it all throughout a 7+ hour work day, and then some. Which surprised me, for a fruity tea scent! A nice addition to a collection that needs some uplifting notes.",01/20/15 22:22,Bloodlust

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"This a fresh green scent with a hint of sweetness, it has been very humid and sticky, thunderstorms etc where I am and I have found in these conditions this scent really comes into it's own, it smells great for oppressive weather and gives you a feeling of clean zingeyness.

I agree with Christinavictory about being reminiscent of a mojito, I totally got that yesterday evening during a storm!

For me it starts full on lime tea and green pear, as it warms on your skin you get a sweet peony and creamy almond finally vanilla musk woodsey notes, very nice indeed could unisex in my opinion.

I've found wearing it with dove body lotion seems to complement it well, I think it brings out the almond scent which stops it being to sharp.

For EDT I found it's staying power good, though you feel so fresh when you put it on I did respray 2 or 3 times yesterday even though 1 or 2 would have been enough.

I'm really pleased with this and it will be my go to in hot humid weather.

Recommended to my friend who got a spritz on paper in the shop during her lunch break and it smelt horrid, when she sprayed mine on her skin she couldn't believe the difference they smelt like different scents, so make sure you try on your skin otherwise you might be unnecessarily put off a lovely scent.",07/13/14 03:28,Englishrose4
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"I almost didn't buy this. Citrus fragrances always scare me because I'm afraid they're going to be too sharp. But thank goodness, there really isn't any sharpness to this.

It's like the lime was sugared down, I think someone mentioned lemonade? I totally get it! Like a super juicy half tea, half lemonade. I know there's no lemons in here, or technically straight sugar, but somehow that's what comes through in the beginning and it's awesome. It softens a bit to the peony but never quite loses the lemonade factor.

That may be a negative for some, but for a fun summer fragrance I think it's great, both for the really hot days and for the light rainy days. It only comes in an EDT, but it's pretty long lasting for an EDT so at least there's that.",06/17/14 19:07,stayclassy
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"EDIT: I've got a 3.4 oz bottle of this (sprayed 2-3 times, 99% full) up for swap! Contact me if you're interested ^-^


Just got this today in the mail!
I sniffed the trigger, and was slightly alarmed because all I could smell was bitter pears.
Luckily, it did not smell that way when applied on my skin.
First thing I notice is limes. Not the sweet candied lime, the real thing.
Second thing was a white flower of some sort (that I now can identify as peony.) It gave a ladylike undertone to the limey scent, but this perfume is really complex on me.
The limes and peony stand out the most within the first hour or so. It then develops a new side, losing that citrus edge and becoming fruitier. Like icy pears.
It dries down to a musky amber with traces of tea.
Overall, it's a nice scent but probably for the 25+ crowd.
Its fresh, citrusy, and musky. A little bit bitter.
I can appreciate it for what it is, but for a 16 year old, its a little bit of a joykill (at least for a summer fragrance).
Obviously this doesn't apply to anyone who enjoys fresh, sophisticated, fruity fragrances! It is still such a beautiful scent, and I like it much more than the original Brit, but I probably won't be wearing it much.
End thoughts: If you liked Brit, but want a fresher version, I'd say give this a try!",05/17/14 14:26,dad
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"I finally got this in the mail! Burberry Brit Sheer is one of my absolute favorite fragrances, but I had never before smelled Burberry Brit. Well, the other day I did go to the store and test the original Burberry Brit, and it just smelled TERRIBLE on me. Anyways, I got really nervous and then I read on here that Brit summer was similar to the original...and I was going to cancel, but the person I bought it from had already shipped it. I figured I might as well try it, and I am SO GLAD I didn't cancel it. This smells absolutely nothing like the original Brit.

I love London, it's one of my favorite places in the world, but there is nothing about this fragrance that screams ""British!"" to me. Instead, it screams ""Cuba!"" The description does not say that there is any mint or sugar in this fragrance, but I can distinctly smell both along with a strong lime and a little bit of rum. Essentially, this fragrance smells EXACTLY like drinking a mojito in a garden of peonies. It really brings me back to Havana. I LOVE it, A++

Edit: the dry down is a bit reminiscent of Burberry Brit. I like it way better in the beginning, but the beginning last several hours on me. While there are some similarities in the dry down, this is still a lot better than the original.",03/21/14 12:54,christinavictory

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"This creation by Burberry house was in my test list, but when I saw that many of you find similarities with the original Brit,I desided it's not worthed trying it, because I don't like vanilla in perfumes.
Today I was in the mall and I saw it on the shelf and I thought to myself ""OK, why not?"". It turned out on me was a fresh, a bit sweet lime-pear scent. After a few hours it changed to a mix of musk, wood and hint of peony. I find it lovely and very wearable spring scent!",01/07/14 06:26,cherry_lips
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"Brit summer is a gentle sister of the 5th Avenue Style in my opinion. Despite the difference in notes on the list, they both start with nearly identical burst of citrus, while in Brit citrus soon gives way to pear and tea in 5TH Avenue Style it stays for much longer with dominant rasberry and spice. It the end they are still, two very similar scents.. with brit being sweeter not so in your face fume.

Light, sexy fragrance for summer. It brought the image of sitting in an adirondak chair whose wood has been warmed by the sun and body heat on the back porch overlooking a lake. You're with someone special, sharing smiles and the occasional laugh. A vase of lightly scented flowers sits on a side table with a selection of iced tea, sparkling limeade with iced pear cubes and sugared almonds. A rather safe scent, but lovely.",07/14/13 06:38,Tiffanymr
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"This gem has surprising longevity for an edt. I sprayed it on at 9am this morning, and now at 5pm I can still smell it when I bring my arm up to my face. Other than the almondy base this perfume doesn't really resemble the original brit to me. It's dominated by the lemon note from the beginning to just before the end. The pear note is pretty prevalent throughout. My experience with this surprised me somewhat because I had read about how similar this fragrance was to the original, but I was not surprised in a bad way.

This fragrance is pretty fantastic. It's the sprite to the original brit's latte if that makes sense. Where the original brit is more creamy this one has a little more bite. It smells fresh and clean without being soapy or sterile. I would say that it could be unisex, but it leans very much more towards the feminine, and I'm sure that's mostly because of the pear involved.

All in all, I'm happy I purchased this one (at a discount from groupon *Cheer*). And I'm more than a little sad that this is only a summer fragrance.",06/23/13 14:11,gangel04

Update# 1:
this perfume lasts a lot longer than I thought it did...a few nights ago as I turned over in bed, around 2 or 3 am, I smelled Brit Summer. I was so surprised, as this was over 14 hrs after I had applied it. Brit summer projects more as the weather warms up.
Projection: arms length for 4-6hrs, then sits close to skin for 6 - 8 hrs
Longevity: 12 hrs +

Update #2:
Burberry Brit EDP is the better / stronger alternative to Brit Summer. Burberry Brit EDT had no almonds or vanilla when applied to my skin.

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"Burberry Brit Summer may have a similar scent pyramid to that of the original, but I can't say that they smell exactly alike. I much prefer this Summer flanker. It's softer, fresher and fruitier.

Anyone that follows my reviews, will know that I don't usually enjoy fruity fragrances. There are only a few fruit notes that I like, and pear and lime are two of them. These two notes, when blended together, create a scent that is sweet, green, juicy, soft and feminine. Thankfully nothing in this fragrance comes across as being too overbearing.

Brit Summer is a really delicate fragrance. It is far more subdued than the original Brit, which often turned sharp on my skin. I would most definitely reach for this flanker during Summer.

The heart is well balanced with sweet, mashed pears, green lime, soapy peony and sugared almonds. It's almost a gourmand, however I'd describe it as being more crisp and clean.

The musky drydown is even more pleasant, striking me as being rather sensual and soothing. If only this Summer flanker wasn't a limited edition. It's one of my pet peeves when brands discontinue limited edition flankers, especially when they smell better than the originals.

The sillage of Brit Summer is fairly light and inoffensive. The lasting strength could have been better, but it's certainly not disappointing. My word to the wise is to go out and test this flanker as soon as possible. I fear that its existence will be short-lived.",09/30/12 23:33,missk
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"Good choice for those who find the original a bit too cloying. A very fresh scent with a hint of sweetness in it. Almost certainly feminine, but not to a point of being girly girl. Just got this myself hours ago and so far I'm enjoying it. I got lots of green tea freshness which is balanced by the sweetness of the sugared almonds. I like it that way as it keeps the scent from becoming too syrupy sweet because of the sugared almonds or too bitter-green by the green tea. Of course other ingredients also affected the composition in some ways, but as a whole it is certainly to me a pretty balanced concoction. As I said, fresh yet sweet. Staying power is pretty decent for an EDT. This one is a sure compliment getter, provided if you use it in just the right amount. Highly recommended for just about any occasion, be it office or a special event. It is not so heavy so it is suitable for both day and night wear.",09/30/12 05:42,Tsukinohime
Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"I love this summer version of brit! I usually go for sweet perfumes, which I both love and hate, so I bought this to balance out my perfume wardrobe. It smells really good, sexy, fresh, and somewhat spicy/woody. I got this instead of the original brit because I wanted to stay away from the vanilla sweet drydown a lot of people comment on. Even though it's ""fruity"" in a sense, it's not a super sweet, victoria's secret type of fruity. I think it's quite strong and could be a good work perfume if you spray lightly. It's a perfect end of summer, going into fall perfume, as it is a green, fresh scent, but also gives you a spicy warmth and good lasting power.",09/15/12 10:00,Adureeuh

Burberry Brit Summer for Women Burberry,"The top notes are fresh and green, lifted by the lime and tea notes, and the pear adds just a touch of fruitiness, without causing the fragrance to feel sweet.

In the heart of the fragrance, I can't say that I detected peony or almond specifically, or any of the individual base notes, for that matter. What I did experience was a gradual increase in dewiness of a cool, green, minimalistic scent which evoked memories of sun-warmed blades of summer grass and the green Bumble and Bumble Seaweed shampoo I used to love a long time ago.

And just as I was beginning to think this clean, fresh, green, and somewhat unisex fragrance would be perfect for hot summer weather, I walked outside into the cold rainy morning, and realized this is a perfect ""California Winter"" scent for my skin.",03/17/12 13:58,Jillzilla

I do not know if it is because of the memories of this fragrance being the culprit for me starting my fragrance collection/journey, but it smells absolutely amazing to me.

I love the hate that this gets. Shows the shallow, delicate nature of the 'noses' here.

Anyone with any skin in the game at all for any length of time will get Essenza in the mid and drydown.

And don't sniff this up close on skin. I don't think this was designed for arm-sniffing. FK composes many fragrances that are made to be smelled IN THE AIR. Yes it projects. Yes it performs. Not a 'beast'. Wasn't meant to be.

No one is going to say 'Wow! Something smells great!' .....

...And then run up to you, grab your arm or sniff your neck on-skin and say 'I changed my mind I hate this now it smells like celery!' 'Or curry!'

If it doesn't work on your skin, fine. Tell the community how horrible it is, and keep the rating low, so there is less of it floating around and those of us that love it can continue to enjoy it.",04/12/25 06:20,Felixthreeone

I just returned from a fragrance haul, and this one was included in it . What a surprise ! It's incredibly fresh and delicate. While it's not overwhelming, it lingers beautifully on my skin for a solid six hours. It doesn't project strongly, or perhaps one becomes nose blind after a while, but I can still catch hints of the scent even after six hours. It's close to the skin but certainly not a mere skin scent. Discovering it was a pleasant surprise, and it's definitely a keeper.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"In my initial review I called this fragrance generic and weak, but I recently had a funny experience that has made me change my mind a bit.

I had planned to go to a concert with a couple of my male friends, so I wanted to wear a low amount of a relatively uncontroversial cologne. As soon as I got to my pals house, we went down stairs into his basement to jam a little bit. I had played drums for about 5 minutes then came back up the stairs to get a bottle of water. At this moment his mom came out of her room, and started walking down the stairs from the second floor of the house. Before she even got halfway down the stairset she said “someone is wearing WAYYYY too much cologne” which was equally as funny as it was embarrassing. Bear in mind I was on the opposite side of the room on the floor beneath her as she was saying this, and I had only sprayed 4 times. I was honestly shocked by this reaction because I had considered this one to be pretty weak and not a stand out in my collection compared to some other bottles I own. I still think you could do better for $40-$50, but it’s good to know that the fragrance works.",08/19/23 01:45,Masterschnozzle81
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"#205 of my ""Tour de Fragrance""

My experience with Burberry scents so far: Hero-reliable but boring, Touch-uselessly weak, Brit, London-generic. Indigo is not bad, it's just another generic scent. ""Meh."" Burberry Classic remains the only scent in the line I'd bother with, and I've not bothered with it. My one non-negotiable is performance. Indigo is not great, but it's okay. It has some projection till morning coffee break. It's a skin scent to lunch. But there is nothing here that isn't already on my fragrance shelf many times over and in scents I've given away. Nothing unique or that draws notice. In that sense it's much like Hero, but not quite as good in the dry down, and I've already passed on a bottle of Hero. Indigo is office safe, even carpool safe, so there's that. But once it dries down it really smells like you didn't wash off the shave cream after you shaved. So, I think its 3.88 rating is about right. It's a nondescript, indistinct, unidentifiable, characterless, middle-of-the-road scent (and who really wants that?). This was a sample for me, and I see no need for more.",08/10/23 06:06,JusttheFactsMan
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Orto Parisi has a fragrance very similar to this, Megamare, yet Mr. Burberry Indigo takes the win all day every day. Truly, a very unrecognized and forgotten dark horse fragrance that will sadly only gain notoriety upon discontinuation.

Those days of designers putting out daring and off the beaten path type fragrances have long been over, and Mr. Burberry Indigo is a prime example and reminder of what unfortunately happens.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"You've smelled this before. You may already have something that smells like this or close. Minty green, slightly aquatic, inoffensive, ""shower gel"" blue, versatile, mass appeal. It is quintessential designer for modern men. It fits the brief and can easily be lumped in with the rest of the blue fragrances (Sauvage, Bleu Chanel, Invictus, Carbon Luna Rosa)...but...

Francis Kurkdjian can make a fragrance and a darn good one. This is no exception. What first smells familiar and derivative actually shows some complexity every time you smell it. The aldehydic green notes remind me of old school powerhouses while the aquatic tones make it up to date.

Don't get me wrong, it's a like for me, not quite a love. However, I won't be surprised if I keep going back to this time and again; above the other fragrances I have that can do the same thing.",03/25/23 01:13,Corban Lucas

It smells like some sort of herbal ointment, but not in a good way. It seems to temper a bit more in the summer time when the greens soften up a bit.

Cool, classy, and for once true to the description from the company: An oceanside breeze off the cliffs of Britain.

I want to warn you right away. If you have previously owned hamsters or other rodents - The ""hamster cage"" effect is real and kept me from buying a bottle. Beautiful, strong, even formal, but unfortunately, a nostalgic olfactory misfortune at times for me personally. Do not let it keep you away from testing this one out, but it does require sampling with this degree of ""unlikeness"".

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Fresh Earthy-Green-Citrus w/ a hint of Spiciness & Aquaticness

doesn't stray far from the original Mr.Burberry EDT just more of an aquatic version.
opening smells exactly like chrome aqua same rindy citrus (lemon+bergamot+grapefruit) & sharp herbal-greenness (basil+mint, makes a clove like accord);
mid-dry resembles JV Artisan Blu, as tea & light violet (slightly powdery) comes out along with ""water notes"" to cut the green-herbal-spiciness some and bring a slight aquatic accord;
fully dry is slightly aquatic/watery with a hint of earthiness (like a lighter AdG Profumo) but almost undetectable;
versatile, can be worn year round, day or night, casual or office but not mass appealing imo due to its sharpness;

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"I just can’t get behind this one no matter how hard I try.

It’s too green and spicy. There’s something incense-y I detect from Mr. Burberry Indigo, slightly smells medicinal.

One thing I can say about this scent, it’s unique and if you like it, you won’t quickly get bored of it.

Not my cup of tea, but I can see older guys pulling this off.",06/19/22 11:35,gxbjw
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"I've never smelled ADG but this perfume is quite nice. It has a soft, mildly spicy aromatic freshness to it. The mint and rosemary really cut through and are noticeable notes, they're almost addicting. It's definitely more fresh than the other Mr. Burberry scents. It isn't a spectacular scent, but the well rounded blend of all the notes does make it a nice smell. It has the typical designer generic vibe to it, but the mint is stand out. Not sickening like Beach Hut Man (amouage) mint, a much milder and smoother mint.

7/10 scent.

Projects pretty good for 2-3 hours, then it's a skin scent. But i could pick up wafts of through the day for about 6-7 hours.

id consider a bottle at a cheap price.",06/16/22 12:29,PhillyFresh
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,Had this on for a few hours now. Its like bitter Acqua de Gio....got cheap for like 25 bucks for 100ml - great. Yeah. Its a more masculine version of Acqua de Gio. I enjoy the original and the flankers...this has same floral note as the OG AdG but attenuated by the bitterness...feels like it lasts longer too It grows on you. Its pretty cool. You know it reminds me of Sauvage. Doesnt smell the same way...but its aromatic and attenuated like that but with different notes. Kind of genius really,06/13/22 17:45,turnerscott
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Citrus aquatic opening does smell a bit like aqua di gio. Verrrry bitter rosemary sets this apart for sure, but they share an opening accord.

Have this layered under Fahrenheit edt & it’s pretty glorious on a very merry day in May.",05/18/22 08:54,StankFrank
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"A youthful spring/summer freshie. I agree that it is not like Armani's ADG, but it is very reminiscent of D&G's The One Sport. I gave up on The One Sport because of its appalling performance, though Indigo is slightly better performing and more fairly priced, albeit modest in terms of projection. Not expensive smelling, but all the same, thank you Burberry for releasing Indigo!",05/17/22 04:46,49424
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Very unique scent, does not smell like acqua di gio so here's what it actually smells like.

Opening is very minty & citrus but it's also quite aquatic in the opening, then it becomes more green/herbal and you can smell the rosemary in here but the fragrance always remains very fresh, minty, citrus and I think the rosemary combined with mint and citrus is just a gorgeous combination it gives a super fresh and unique scent with a lot of character.

With this said it actually reminds me a little bit of D&G K EDT, because it is slightly spicy and green smelling and it does what D&G K EDT does but just a little better in my opinion.

Don't be put off by the rosemary in this, it comes across as a slightly more herbal juniper smell in this fragrance.

To me this is one of the most unique fresh fragrances out there, it's full of personality and character and makes a great signature scent. Not a scent for everyone though, don't blind buy and also performance isn't the best but also not too bad either.

It doesn't deserve any hate and more people need to give this fragrance some love, plus look at the perfumer it's Kurkdjian the man knows his stuff!!",05/11/22 13:11,Dumbplings
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"This is a surprisingly good outdoor spring fragrance.

It's a well blended, fresh herbal, not too citrusy or too sweet. Really quite good in the right season and weather (spring), and not very expensive.
My favourite of Burberry's middling offerings.

And no it is not at all a clone of Acqua Di Gio. It's far less citrusy, and much more herbal fresh.",04/24/22 19:50,My2ScentsWorth
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"This is freakin' Acqua Di Gio man.
Like not even a little bit but full blown...which is a good fragrance in itself but, you buy a fragrance for it's own, not to be a copy of something else.

Fortunately for me, I got this sample when I bought another fragrance.

To everyone else, if you have Acqua Di Gio, you don't need this... and if you don't, you can go with this. Longevity is excellent for me.
Spring time is golden but can be pulled off for the summer as well.",04/04/22 02:14,EauDeBaldy
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"""It's not what I expected"". How is that even possible to expect how a perfume could smell before you smell it?? I'm cooking about 4 days per week, I know really well the smell of celery and this one it's not even close for me. I can smell rosemary, fresh mint and something heavy-smoky. I think that comes out of oakmoss. I enjoy freshies with oakmoss (p.ex. Hacivat). For my own taste it's a modern masterpiece and the first thing that came to my mind was Acqua di Gio Profumo. They are not the same juice but in the same philosophy. It wasn't my intention to offend someone and if I did it I apologize.",02/17/22 06:56,Fragscenthead
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,I am agree this smells like a more fresher Aqua Di Gio. I enjoy this right between spring and summer. Last about 6 hours and projects good for the first hour. Not groundbreaking but it isn't bad either.,02/14/22 19:25,Bobster

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Functions as a good summer work fragrance, especially when I'm set for a day of concentration-heavy work. I can also go straight from work to gym with this and it doesn't smell out of place. Something about Rosemary puts me in the mental ""zone"" seemingly powering up my working memory and promoting a calm and collected state of mind. When I'm feeling flat it gives me a zing and when I'm too fired up it soothes me. Probably not the biggest compliment magnet per say but it's more for myself, it's inoffensive and it does it's job well for what I intend it to be.",02/08/22 22:40,willfrederik
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Smelled this at my local Sephora and was not a fan. I was expecting something totally different. One reviewer commented that it smells of celery and I understand why.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"This is straight up OG Aqua Di Gio with mint and it’s bomb. I’ve been smelling Aqua Di Gio since I was a kid and got that vibe immediately.

I received it as part of a sample pack my girl got me from Sephora. Out of all the scents, I liked this one and Aqua Di Gio Profondo. And for 40 bucks for a 3.3 once on fragrancenet, it’s beyond a steal IMO. For sure there are better more well blended scents out there, but for a day at the beach, after the gym, casual little adventures, even to work when your burnt out on that Bleu de Chanel and Sauvage, Indigo hits.

Performance isn’t bad, it’s super inoffensive, and it’s really clean smelling. The mojito of fragrances.",12/30/21 21:29,Blackstone Rose
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Never had as visceral a dislike to an opening as this. Tested a sample and it was an immediate no. Maybe the drydown is better, but it smelled like pepper and herbicide over ADG and ... yuck.",12/08/21 03:30,fromthesidelines
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"This is super underrated in my opinion! I don’t see this getting as much love as other designer fragrances, but this one is unique. Minty and herbal goodness, this is like the dictionary definition of a ‘green scent’. I use this year-round, but I really like it in the spring and summer where it shines best imo when the higher temperatures really bring out the notes I feel. Longevity is not amazing, but I still get like 4-5 hours on my skin. All in all, a nice scent that you can appreciate on your fragrance shelf.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Green aromatic by Burberry.
It opens nicely with Green Mint and Rosemary notes and a touch uf fruity citrus. As it develops Mint becomes more sweet and Rosemary less prominent, also Tea and Violet notes are becoming apparent. Dry down is a classic modern woody with a pinch of Oakmoss. Nice release by Burberry and it should have been recognized.

For me: 7/10",08/23/21 08:17,djole12

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Smells fantastic to me. A very contemporary men's ""cologne"" smell. Indigo is not a fragrance that is blended into one ""perfume"". Rather, a kalaidoscope of all the notes, and they are very complimentary, of equal tone and they sort of sparkle together. You can easily single them out for your attention when you choose. A dance is performed for your nose and imagination. It's a delightful, baroque water garden impact, like the gardens of the Villa d'Este. So modestly priced yet elegant and effortless. The water garden dance lasts about an hour - which is decent for a ""cologne"" type fragrance. Then it's a pleasant mint and wood, which really is a bonus because many pretty cologne waters just disappear after their lovely opening acts.",08/06/21 19:47,Mystères du Château de Dé

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Smells nice reminds some herbal adg, like profondo, with a touch of hugo. On the other hand this is the least lasting fragrance in my collection. I thought some of my perfumes didn't last long but with this one I literally discovered the new depth of short lasting fragrance.",06/10/21 05:21,MSC
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"The opening is definitely different and a bit odd at first, kind of synthetic.
Right up front it’s citrus then the mint and rosemary followed quickly by the tea and sage. I find this fragrance reminds me of one I used to own called Freshwater from Bath and Body Works which is an Aqua di Gio clone.The biggest difference is this fragrance is blended a bit better and “toned down”. Once it dries down, it’s woodsy with the iso super. I don’t get that much Amber or Oakmoss…very subtle.
It does remind me a bit of Aqua di Gio Profumo which I own. Profumo is just a bit richer, but they are similar. Profumo on me is a beast.
I don’t find it to be anything more than moderate in the performance department.
It really needs the warmth of summer to bring it to life. I do enjoy wearing it as it doesn’t smell like anything else in my collection…definitely different and definitely masculine. It seems to do better on my clothes than on my skin.
If you like “green watery” Frags, you will probably enjoy this one.

I like this because of the 90's blue/green/herbal nostalgia. But I wouldn't wear this much (tis why I bought the 50ml bottle), mainly because it smells too 'generic'. But every now and again I crave a throwback to my youth. This satisfies my craving.

I can detect lots of rosemary in opening, which made it a quite unique scent.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Being relatively new to the frag world- I was very interested in adding a mint fragrance to my collection. After discovering Kurkdjian was the nose behind this and my affection for Burberry Touch, I thought this might be a good place to start. The opening is undeniably fresh, a spearmint bomb if you will. The spearmint though is somehow juicy/sweet at the same time, almost mouth watering IMO. The dry down is absolutely gorgeous, reminiscent of a basic ADG DNA but with that beautiful spearmint. Lol, I suppose a “spearmint-infused ADG” would be the easiest way to describe the scent.
It is quite versatile IMO, the mint notes give it a cooling, sophistication that make it suitable for most all seasons & occasions. The 100ml was an absolute steal at $28. This could be my new signature, but then again I do love mint...",03/31/21 08:40,Rafrosa

The output is very fresh, it can smell herbal, green notes, such as mint and rosemary, surrounded by citrus and floral notes, these first minutes are very pleasant, as if we were smelling a mojito.
As the minutes pass, the green notes are maintained, the citrus fruits are reduced, but a woody and aquatic base emerges. It reminds me a little to Artisan Blu.
Indigo is a daytime fragrance, perfect for use during summer and spring because of the fresh trail it gives off. In fact I liked it more than Mr. Burberry EDT.

Next it morphs into what could be described as a mix between an herbal Acqua di Gio and CK Eternity Aqua. It's like it wants to be AdG but has a big dose of aquatic herbalness lingering.

I initially disliked this but it's grown on me. Think of it in the vein of John Varvatos Artisan Acqua or Artisan Blu. An age 30+ cologne that isn't super committed to being any one thing, and just smells of a mish mash of different influences. This is like that but it's decent in the end.",11/28/20 01:10,rushrocker

I hear performance issues but boy not on me, in fact I am careful with the trigger. The price at discounters are good for this beautiful, quality juice, I am buying a back up for this and Azzaro Aqua as good things never last long with a good fragrance. The companies can’t leave well enough alone and it’s disturbing, and costly for us.",05/22/20 14:03,lbullard
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Good cheapie. If I was younger, or better yet, if I had a teenager son who wanted to know a good place to start I would say give Burberry indigo a shot.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"In the opening I get what almost smells like licorice. It's a big aromatic aroma in the opening and dark too. Once this settles that licorice aura fades and then it turns into a mint bubblegum type of smell that is very good and still maintaining an almost dark blue indigo edge. It's also pretty herbal throughout the duration. If you're patient with this one it will be one you really enjoy especially for the night and warm months. I don't think this is a daytime fragrance but maybe others will, maybe in spring and fall. It's a little musky too the way Kurkdjian usually makes them. Overall it's good and you can smell distinct while wearing this. I give this an 85/100.",04/20/20 02:56,Criglett Clussnum

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"The sea note in this is the exact same as:
l'eau majeure d'issey issey miyake
Zara Deep Blue Sea

so if you like the aquatics of this you might also like to check those two out.

I would say this is the superior smelling one of the three to me as it has a nice fresh aquatic citrus opening with some mint and rosemary peeking through.

Unlike the other two I have mentioned this is clean and doesn't have that dirty (almost stale urine smell) in the drydown due to the lack of musk.

Performance is so-so but this really is a casual daytime beach holiday type fragrance so not a dealbreaker.",12/03/19 12:03,jjames799
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Blind bought this at a local discounter (Marshalls/TJ Maxx)

I get the mint, and a slight rosemary green with a faint amber base...but its all very light and transparent....this stuff doesn't last long at all. It's a typical 3 hour designer ""freshie"". Sits close to the skin, no projection.

Probably a good dumb reach for basic summer, gym or office scent, but with the poor longevity....its really not even worth it. Although the scent is just ""ok"", its very boring and not worth even the discounted price. There's so many much better ones out there for less $.

Will not re-buy, and even though the scent is nice, i still wouldn't recommend to anyone. Not worth wasting your money on this...

The performance reminds me of a ""fake"" or ""knock off"", where the initial spray smells really nice,....but then 1 hour later your like ""where did the scent go???""",11/24/19 18:48,Bkkorn
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Aquatic, green, hints of citrus, woody/musky background.

This is a very good, feel-good fragrance. It's clean & a little soapy but not in a bad way.

It is true that it is similar to Acqua di Gio, Acqua di Gio Profumo, & a cheapie from the early 2000s called Nice Feelings by Sapil. The same aquatic, citrusy semll, with a hint of woods for all of these 4 fragrance.

Mr. Burberry Indigo is fresh & spicy, casual & happy. It has no similarity at all to any of the other Mr. Burberries.

The performance is really good. Above your average designer fragrance.

Overall, a lovely fragrance that deserves your testing time.

""Love""",11/08/19 01:14,AMajeedQT
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Field test:

3 sprays (one on each side and back of the neck). Currently at the 6 hour mark. I still smell it when I stand up or move around. Mostly get a lemon + rosemary/mint at this point with some light woods.

Opinion:

I have not liked a cologne from Burberry since the original Brit for men. The Brit Rhythm and other Mr. Burberry's were completely boring to me. This one is actually enjoyable.

At $30-$40 online, this would be a great gift for a young professional who needs an office scent for his first job.",10/07/19 12:24,realmarkvon
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"To be truthful, I was not expecting much from Mr. Burberry Indigo but, I saw it at a major discounter for dirt cheap and took a chance. I’ll say that I have the OG Mr. Burberry edt and that one is a pretty good performer that works anytime of year for any occasion. Not a Tour de Force but, it handles it’s business in a classy way. Indigo just completely punched me in the mouth! Not that it’s ground breaking or Oh My God! different, it’s just a well done fresh, semi citrus with a nice herbal feel to it. Very delightful and as inoffensive as a scent can get. Manly scent with a light fresh vibe that will work anywhere, anytime year round. Yes, probably a bit better for the warmer days but, the overall composition and combination of scents give a very nice overall melding of notes that transform modestly and softly during ones wearing. A little lemon & rosemary plus mint at the top and then it goes on a nice, mellow transformation into the mid notes of soft wood, oak moss and a light, semi sweet musk. It really transforms nicely and is a solid performer for me going 6-8 hours. Not to shabby at all......",09/29/19 06:31,Apocalypse6vs8
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"While both Mr. Burberry Eau de Toilette and Eau de Parfum run toward the direction of Calvin Klein Contradiction, this Indigo version runs directly towards the citric scents I know. To my nose, there's something of Dior Cologne or Armani Code Sport here, but not screaming so loud. Mr. Burberry is here, a bit shy, with the citric ruling the scent. Not particularly original, but nice anyway.",07/23/19 05:26,periquito89
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Nice, clean, fresh mint and slightly juicy citrus. Great for summer day time wear. Really nice if not spectacular or innovative. You wont go wrong if you want a clean, fresh mild citrus fragrance for summer.

People have compared this to Versace Dylan Blue. I like both but for me, the two are very different. Mr.B Indigo is much more citrusy (lemon) and juicy, whereas VDB is very one dimensional, focusing on an almost but not quite minty patchouli throughout.

Longevity is OK, not great. Overall, the smell is great.",07/07/19 06:53,Mo_Liverpool
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,God that mint wants me to puke.,07/05/19 06:19,dkroonen
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"STRENGTHS: crafted with quality ingredients, smells natural, decent longevity, ""nice"" smelling, probably safe for work.

WEAKNESSES: pretty generic, not a whole lot of character, expensive for what it is.


CONCLUSION: Mr. Burberry Indigo is a summer fragrance that's designed to be classy but inoffensive.

If your personal style is basic, if you find yourself in conservative environments, if you have some money to throw at a fragrance, then MBI is a good choice. Regular, down to earth people will like it very much. It's great for people who don't know a whole lot about fragrances and want a safe bet.

But if you want a fragrance that makes a statement, if your style is not conservative, if you want a fragrance that expresses your individuality, then MBI is a bad choice. Creative types will find MBI pretty boring. It's not a very stylish scent.

I think of this as being a daytime, professional scent rather than for date night.",07/05/19 01:06,sellersburg

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"This scent is considered safe, nothing ground breaking and is compared to other fragrances like Acqua di Gio Profumo, but I’ve smelled most that this is compared to and I find that this is the younger brother that has his own unique twist. Trust your nose and try it, especially if you’re knit picky. Wear what appeals to you for enjoyment.

I actually find this one very refreshing and prefer this to........ It’s perfect for spring casual wear with jeans, T-shirt and going out for the weekend; out and about. This fragrance is minty fresh and the rosemary adds a certain sweetness, further balancing the mint to make it a bit more sophisticated, without trying so you can wear that sports coat into the spring night and it’s still pulled off effortlessly.

The oakmoss base intertwining with the violet add that edge to give it character.

Like most say; this isn’t groundbreaking, but I don’t think it’s meant to be, like Baccarat Rouge 540, Lumiere Noire Pour Homme, Ultra Male or Grand Soir. Look in your closet; you have that clubbing outfit that gets you lucky or that suit outfit that makes you GQ material, which suggest the other fragrances that would fit appropriately with the occasions.

Yet, you also have that road trip favorite pair of distressed jeans and T-shirt outfit that makes your day effortlessly and confident. I believe Mr. Burberry Indigo is the fifth sense to complete the look. Francis Kurkdjian is no mannequin.

I love this masculine down low fragrance and will definetly rock this when I’m chilling. It’s a wardrobe staple.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Mr. Burberry Mojito

This fragrance may have little innovative, as is a custom lately, however It has some ""kindness"" to be highlighted.

The bottle is beautiful, has an excellent atomizer and I think that Mr (mister) is due to the detail of the bow tie under its huge lid.

1- first impression
Imagine sitting in a bar, facing the beach, feeling the pleasant sea breeze, conversing with your friends, drinking gin tonic, lemonades and MOJITOS; Well, I smell this triple of drinks in this cologne, (in the good sense of the word).

I can perceive very clear the mint leaf and that icy (frozen) and fresh sensation that makes it an ""uplifting"" smell.

2- Drying:
It reminds me of the 360 Red Men by Perry Ellis, only that in Mr Burberry indigo I feel a lot of rosemary, but both are fresh.

3- Its Name; INDIGO (A variation of the blue color)

Does it smell ""blue""? Well, it does not smell like Bleu de Chanel, but if you use your imagination thoroughly, you can feel a little vibe of Polo Blue, but the green notes feel much stronger.

The longevity is good and I do not complain about the projection. It is quite versatile, clean and feels more natural than synthetic. For summer evenings, informal and use in offices.

To be honest I would not pay the $125 that they ask in stores, wait a bit since Burberry perfumes can be obtained at a better price in a few months after launch.

Personally I like it, I do not love it, but I'm glad it's in my collection.

Update: I tested Polo Blue eau de parfum and there is a huge similarity among both fragrances.",02/22/19 15:00,nelsongil13
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"This can be best described as a ubiquitous scent. I imagine a European nightclub to smell like this. The inital blast of mint then it is oakmoss and violet. An earthy note. If I smelt this on someone I would think nothing about it. Now a lot people fall into this ""safe"" brigade, these are the people who wear Black, Navy Blue, or dark grey as it is the safe option. Nothing ground breaking.",02/05/19 04:54,Escoteric
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Very, very nice. This one has grown on me. I sampled it probably a dozen times before I finally purchased a full bottle.

Other reviewers have compared this to fragrances in the John Varvatos Artisan line, Polo Blue, and Bvlgari Aqua, and more. I honestly don't find this similar to any of the above.

Easy enough to find in major department and cosmetic stores (eg Sephora, Ulta), it's definitely worth testing, but different enough that I'd avoid a blind buy.

The balance of mint, herbal notes, and amber is delightful. The violet is very smooth, not piercing or scratchy in the least. The ingredients feel very high quality. In fact, if you told me this was a new release from Creed, I'd believe it. It feels green in sort of the same way that Green Irish Tweed feels green (but it does not smell like GIT), like garden-fresh and slightly earthy.

Versatile enough that you could pull this off at just about any time of year. I'll be reaching for this one often; it may even be signature scent worthy.",01/25/19 19:26,foreignshores

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"I honestly blind bought this one.

I am glad I did. $53 for a 150ml GIANT bottle. Couldn't pass that one up.

Upon first application, I immediately got a Varvatos Artisan Acqua/Artisan Blu vibe. Although they are similar, they also share their differences...which in this case is good.

The above Varvatos's are good, however, they turn very original really fast.

What separates this from the rest is the lovely, prickly, green mint and rosemary. This is an absolute beautiful use of the spicy rosemary. There is just enough to give this stuff a superb green dimension without being too ""in your face."" This is hands down the best recent/modern Burberry release. Very casual, very easy going, very appealing, and most of all different enough to establish itself.

OVERALL:

I get a lovely mint and spicy/prickly rosemary mixed with some aquatic notes infused with some violet and a juicy oak moss.

---Nothing new. In fact, it's 'similar' to Varvatos Artisan Acqua/Artisan Blu, however this is just so much better. It has more dimension and overall depth.

Also, the last thing I want to add is that this is my go-to bedtime scent. I've hardly ever worn frags to bed, but for the past 3 nights I have wanted to wear this. This is somehow incredibly comforting and uplifting. I love wearing this stuff before I fall asleep.",10/19/18 21:41,hullhockey91

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Excellent flanker. Minty, fresh, woodsy aquatic done right. Smells VERY natual, as if you crushed up spearmint in your hands that you just picked. No need to over explain. Just imagine yourself on a warm summer day wearing a crisp, white, long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up. Nice pair of chino shorts and a pair of tan driving shoes. You are dressed nicely, but not casual, and not dressed up. That comfortable but well put together middle ground.
You are outside at an outdoor restaurant on the water. Nice breeze, nice view, relaxed. Drink in hand, a vodka and tonic, a mojito, feeling relaxed, confident, soaking in the vibe, the outdoors, and your drink. You aura is calm, confident, smartly dressed.
That is mr burberry indigo. An outstanding summer creation that surpsasses its criminally hated and undervalued flankers. This might be their best fragrance made, period.",10/08/18 10:45,rerthegreat
Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Mr. Burberry Indigo is a green summertime masterpiece that smells natural and fresh. I do not mean masterpiece in terms of creativity but masterpiece in the sense that it perfectly executes the concept of a masculine fresh scent without resorting to generic aquatic notes as many others before it have done.

Indigo is undeniably masculine and earthy with realistic mint taking center stage amongst a backdrop of citrus accords. The scent is linear for the most part but that realistic mint note does die down a bit in the dry-down. All in all, a very easy masculine scent to wear. Performance is nothing to write home about but it certainly is in line with majority of modern designer releases.

Indigo is reminiscent of Dior Aqua Fahrenheit. If you enjoy scents similar to Aqua Fahrenheit, Indigo is a must-try. Indigo takes a completely different path than it's predecessors so try Indigo even if you were not a fan of the original or the EDP.

Indigo is a solid warm weather release and in my opinion it deserves a 4/5 ☆ rating",10/07/18 11:21,spray_and_pray

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Mint and rosemary (and I swear some basil is in there). I'm not sure if I like it because it is different, or because I think I can wear it. It is refreshing and could even pass for an essential oil of some sort.

I think this is a casual scent and even a comforting scent. It could possibly be an office scent too.

I don't know if I will buy it at it's current price though. When it gets under $30, I'll give it another look.

I do appreciate the trend of using fewer ingredients and blending them well though. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.",09/08/18 13:30,atarilynx

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Here's a modern take on fougere.
Nice minty herbal fragrance. The mint is very pleasant and uplifting, rosemary gives it a bit of an edge - but still not being too sharp. Everything underlined with very real lemon and a little but of grapefruit and oakmoss in the background.

Fresh, light, quite sophisticated. Good choice for hot summer.

Quite nice addition from Burberry house.

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Nice addition to the Mr Burberry line. Very different from the EDT & EDP to my nose. I get mint and citrus with aquatic notes. There is a resemblance to Ralph Lauren Polo Blue as others have mentioned but this is by no means a copy.

I got 4 hours from 4 sprays today, Summer climate 24C , which is not great but it's decent whilst it lasts and is a safe scent for lots of occasions.

It would be an 8 but performance is slightly lacking. Will test again in the colder months and see who it performs then...

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"I just sprayed some on my wrist and to me it smells 99.99% identical to Ralph Lauren's Polo Blue EDP. Very potent citrus smell but not potent in the overpowering sense. Very fresh and perfect for a summer day. Can't yet speak to longevity but if I had to pick between this and Blue EDP, I would choose indigo purely from a cost perspective; Indigo was going for like $108 CAD (for 100ml) approximately whereas I think I paid around $120-130 CAD for 100ml of Blue EDP.",07/06/18 09:10,jcravenw

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Incoming hate reviews. Looks like almost everyone hates ""generic"" fragrances nowadays. This is the fourth day of me trying Mr. Burberry Indigo. And I can say is that this fragrance is your typical freshie scent. Nothing compared to Mr. Burberry EDT or EDP. It's safe, fresh and the mint man. The mint here is blended magnificently which made the scent really smells ohh so good! Pretty versatile perfume, though I would only wear this during casual/daytime. I do not see it wearing in super cold climates. Longevity is not the greatest about 3-4 hours on my skin. Projection is pretty good on the first hour mark. It projects strongly, but quickly dies down to skin or closer scent afterwards.

It is a safe blind buy for me. I really love the scent! Better than his two brothers(or cousins)! But the performance is quite lacking. It's a new fragrance so it's quite expensive. For now, I would prefer the cheaper Hollister Wave than this or better yet Dylan Blue. I would really love to give a high remark on this if only it performed better!",06/12/18 07:18,ambrox

Mr. Burberry Indigo Burberry,"Yet another fragrance doomed to catch hell from almost everyone on this site. It's going to get bashed for smelling too trendy, generic, cheap, so on and so forth. Thing is, does anyone like anything around here? Every release gets treated like garbage. And yet you find that the product sells like crazy once you start shopping. So...this thing is great. Yes, it may feel like it's part of a trend in perfumery. Luckily it's not another sweet fruity invictus thing. It's not for the party going 20something (at least not to my nose), and while I haven't had a chance to wear for a long time, i'm not expecting long life from it. IN my case that is true of most fragrances. So how does it smell? Damn good. get your nose on it if you can sample it and you will probably like it. The opening feels mature without feeling old, which is a great achievement when you're talking oakmoss. violet seems to come to the surface pretty soon and while I'm not a huge fan of violate, i find it pleasant. Reminds me of the violet note used in Bvlgari man. It's strong and almost spicy. Overall I find this a pleasant release, and thanks to a great sales promotion at Macy's I was able to get 1450 for a good price in terms of $/ml. It's still cool in the northeastern USA and for me this is perfect. Looking forward to see what happens at when it warms up. cheers and enjoy your fragrances...even if everyone on this site tells you it's crap.

However, I find that it's not close enough to the EDP like I hoped. While I find this perfume pleasant and kind of close to the EDP, it's a lot more fresh and it doesn't have the creaminess of the perfume. Lasting powder is also a lot weaker unfortunately. Overall, it's a very nice fragrance albeit a bit forgettable. I'm going to try the korres Bellflower next to see how it measures up the perfume 🤞",10/28/24 06:46,Viiola
The Beat EDT Burberry,"Why was The Beat line ever discontinued? I was given my EDT by a family friend, it was discontinued by the time I started wearing perfumes two years ago so this is the only version I'm familiar with. Just checked the batch code and it's from 2011.

The Beat EDT is citrusy with tea and cedar wood. It's not sweet, mainly very fresh and clean making it perfect for summer. This should have been likeable enough to not be discontinued but here we are. Does Burberry have anything this fresh in their current offerings? I feel like they might have killed off a whole women's fragrance category within their brand with this decision.

I should mention I love the name of this line. From the modern British rock bands inspiration to my own association of the name with 60s beat groups. Does Burberry ever resurrect past fragrances? They should with this one.",04/26/24 19:34,anyuh
The Beat EDT Burberry,"This was my fav perfume and unfortunately I can t find It Anymore. It was perfect: fresh and relaxing, I could wear It everytime from morning till Midnight. Versace bright Crystal Is quite similari though.",01/19/24 02:54,CarrieWhite
The Beat EDT Burberry,"I've been wearing this fragrance for over a decade and it truly is my all time favorite fresh smell. It's bold and it stands out while also being inviting. I agree with other reviews that it may lean slightly masculine to some, but to me it's more unisex. The scent is not very complex but it's an interesting blend of ingredients.",07/27/23 18:58,CeeEmm of CO
The Beat EDT Burberry,"The Beat, by Burberry, is a tea-like cedar based perfume. It is a spa-like, peaceful, casual day wear type perfume. This could go anywhere and would be appropriate for office, school, dates, errands, lunch, brunch, etc...

The closest thing in my collection is Calvin Klein Beauty which has a similar cedar based lower note which grounds the fragrance and makes it feel more spa-like and down to earth.

The Beat is fairly simple and spa-like. The interplay of notes is young but not juvenile. The chemical interchange of notes has a sparkling Tinker Bell type quality to it...which keeps it from smelling generic. The tea notes have an optimistic type lift that smells fresh and spontaneous almost like the fizz in a carbonated soda pop (similar to a 7-Up/Cola type blend). The tea note seems to be the strongest association but then there is the soda pop fizziness which makes the perfume smell refreshing and commercial.

This reminds me of the younger sister/daughter version of Madonna's Truth or Dare (the 2nd version of Truth or Dare... the darker alto blend). The Beat is a lighter expression - and Madonna's Truth or Dare is a stronger and more mature smelling perfume, but with a similar chemical interplay of ingredients.

The cedar note is nice in The Beat- it has an earthy woodsy quality about it which grounds the perfume and makes it appear more ""down to earth"".

This general vibe of this perfume is pretty, a bit playful, and trendy.

I like this one.

This is Blake Lively's favorite perfume - I can see that especially after seeing the movie ""The Shallows"" where she plays the role of a surfer on vacation. The movie is kind of like vacation surfer girl meets jaws - and lives to tell the tale.

----------

If you like this type of spa-like peaceful perfume I would definitely recommend trying Calvin Klein's Beauty. Valentino's Donna Rosa Verde' is also a nice spa-like perfume, that has more of a candy lemon drop type smell to it. It has a similar freshness to The Beat perfume by Burberry.

Burberry Body perfume is fun and upbeat with more of a sweet, slightly sharp, ""bubble gum"" smell (there are some mint notes which makes this come across like a dentist's tooth polish - the kind that they use when you are in the chair having your teeth cleaned). Burberry Body is sweeter and possibly more juvenile than The Beat, but it also has a vivacious lift to the notes with that type of Tinker Bell sparking quality to it, when it is first sprayed. The longevity of this is short, but the notes are nice while this lasts. Burberry Body reminds me of some of the notes in Viva La Juicy's original perfume.

Madonna's Truth or Dare is very similar to The Beat - I would recommend this if you still wanted to keep with the same general theme of The Beat, but would like to have something that goes more business, elegant, dressy. (The Beat is fairly casual for an everyday type perfume).

-----------

Verdict:

I have moments where I really like this.
There is a subtle stuffy nose thing that is happening with this one, it is almost like it scratches my nose/throat -- very similar to the reaction I had when I tried Ivanka Trump's lemonade perfume. They both irritate my sinuses in some way.

This is less obvious than Ivanka Trump's but - the smell that I get is almost like when the TV is filled with static electricity. The fragrance has a dissonant almost static electricity when I smell it.

I'm sure that this would be good on other people and they may not notice what I'm talking about -

This is not bad - there are truly some great moments with this one -
But there are other perfumes that I gravitate to - a bit more.",02/17/22 09:31,correspondencepersonal
The Beat EDT Burberry,"Perfect work fragrance. It's fresh in a Zen peaceful way, not in a citrusy energizing way. The dry down becomes sweeter and I get really pleasant whiffs of this as the day goes on. Not girly but not masculine at all. I wish I got a bit more cardamom and cedar but this is beautiful, a staple in my collection now. Easy but not blah. Super different compared to the EDP, which is much thicker and much sweeter. I also love that one but not the same vibe at all.",10/29/21 16:14,Kristen_Marie183
The Beat EDT Burberry,"Blind bought this, looking for a new alternative to my staple CK spring citrus frags.
Love how it smells, but the longevity is SO poor on me. I feel like I got maybe 10 minutes max. I get a lightly floral citrus tea. It's beautiful, but what's the point if it's not even a skin scent anymore after an hour? :(
I decided to give the bottle to my mother, who loved how it tested on me - it smells much more like a woody floral on her, and the longevity she gets from this is hours!! She got tons of compliments wearing it as well. I'm thrilled it worked for her, but I would not repurchase it for myself.",05/10/21 13:13,lightbloom

Close to Bergamot The Body Shop discontinued, which I had back around 2005. wood and cardamom just walked path by these and waved at them.

The Beat EDT Burberry,"I wore this as a teen and it brings me sweet memories. I liked the sort of austere almost unisex vibe it gave off, made me feel as close to a strong professional woman a 15-year-old CAN feel.

I liked the grapefruit note, I lived in a place where it was not very popular, it almost felt exotic. Also, I felt like I was fighting against the stereotype of teen girls smelling like candy.

This is NOTHING like candy. It opens sharp and bitter and dries down bitter and herbal. I got a lot of ""are you wearing men's cologne??"" comments that only made me double down on my devotion to this jus. It fed my aspirations to ""not be like other girls"". It was a step on my journey to finding my current ""scent identity"".",04/18/19 05:29,aishmiqru

I only wish it would last longer.",02/17/19 13:30,Florence27
The Beat EDT Burberry,"Loving this fragrance, not as much as the perfume but great for layering as a pair. The cardamon and vetiver are much more pungent compared to the peppery perfume.

The Beat EDT Burberry,"I bought this back in 2009, I remembered it well because it was my very first perfume that I chose myself during my studies in Europe and there it was generally more green tea floral and dried down powdery on me. I loved it right away (my best friend thought it is kinda dizzying...but I chucked that opinion directly to the bin). I went through one bottle then I came across an old one on sale, from 2012. I am already back in my home country where it is always 27-30 degrees C and after 1 spray the pepper notes jumped at me. I was slightly surprised. I had to layer it with something more floral to get it smelling like it used to. I don't know because it is not very fresh or it has been reformulated. I still wear it though, because somehow the spray mechanism is really satisfying.",07/26/18 20:00,whitewindpower

The Beat EDT Burberry,"I have a sample of this and I like it. Crisp, clean, with a little spice so it doesn’t fall into the “clinical, sterile” type of scent. I can see owning a full bottle of this. The tea note is present but not overwhelming. I would like a sample of the edp to compare.

UPDATE: so, this is going to sound strange, but I have finally found a replacement for my beloved L’Effleur. It is NOT a dupe, but it gives me the same aura, especially in the opening. Huge thumbs up.",11/27/17 07:36,Nuitdenoel
The Beat EDT Burberry,"Late spring/summer in a bottle.It has the same vibe as Moschino Funny or Versace Versense. A blast of citruses followed by a relaxing tea note and a just a little bit of powdery iris which last for hours. Surprisingly, sillage and projection are pretty good for an EDT. When it's warm outside and I get tired of my favorite sweet/ oriental fragrances, I spray the Beat on myself and suddenly the day seems less torid and my mood improves.

The Beat EDT Burberry,"My first Burberry perfume. I have wanted to try this brand for so long, being English myself and I know how popular it is worldwide. This is definitely a spring scent, to me, as it is fresh, crisp and clean. However, it is almost like it contains a note I don't like as I get a really sharp scent from it, more suited to a male aftershave - this is quite a masculine smell on first spray and I much prefer the softer more feminine smell that remains after a few minutes. There is an undercurrent of a soapy smell too, which I like in a fragrance. I would wear this during the day and I think this would be a good interview scent, non offensive but something about it says I am in control. I am a big believer in anyone wearing anything male or female and this says that perfectly to me. Just a quick word on the bottle, I hate it. The only part I like is the Burberry print on the glass part. The top of the bottle and the lid are in a cheap plastic and an odd shape and although the perfume inside is more important, I don't like this bottle at all. Looking forward to trying more from Burberry though.",06/05/16 03:56,Helen70

The Beat EDT Burberry,"Very fresh, very citrucy and grassy. This smells young, sporty and is highly inoffensive. I can wear it year round, best suits me during the day, when I don't want to smell too specific, just need a blast of freshness and uplifting citruses.I reach for it most often before I go to the gym or run random errands. On me I don't get the Elizabeth Arden-type-of-green-tea note (or else I would have disliked this, as I hate the EA green tea!). Overall a very versatile fragrance, short to medium longevity, for the young at heart (or age:)

The green tea note is a true one, it smells almost exactly like dry green tea leaves waiting to be brewed. I appreciate that this smells like actual green tea. I've found that what often masquerades as a 'green tea note' in perfumes smells nothing like the real thing. This one is the real thing. The slight fruity complement makes it smell like a lightly flavored green tea. This is a light, fresh scent that is easy to wear. Unfortunately it does not last very long. After an hour or two it's basically gone from my skin. I've used both the EDP version of The Beat, and this EDT, and I like the scent of the EDT better.

It smells very good in sunny and cloudy weather, but I personally like it in cloudy weather a little bit more. I can wear it with jeans and T-shirt, shirts, leather jackets and big manly watch. At the beginning it smells very fresh and citrusy, I can recognize bergamot and mandarin which are a little bit tart. As the time passed, smell of citruses transformes into smell of tart green tea with lemon. I can also feel powdery smell of iris. And the last one note that I can smell is note of tobacco!

Actually I'm sort of used to the fact that a lot of Burberry perfumes are opening with the citrus note, but thankfully they all change their scent in a few minutes into something much more sophisticated. I can imagine wearing this after a long morning run. It's sporty and fresh.",01/16/14 12:55,lirael00
The Beat EDT Burberry,"After reading all these reviews I was wondering whether I would like this or not.
It's lovely and fresh to start with, the mandarin, iris and quince blossom are all there blending perfectly and you smell just like you've stepped out of the shower. I love smelling like that. Then it mellows into a softer smell which although you think might be fading away (many people have said it doesn't last) it really does last.
I sprayed it in the morning and could smell this beautiful waft around me all day. It's subtle but it's there and it's such a lovely clean smell. I've often envied other women who waft past me smelling so fresh and clean but I'm pleased to discover that can now be ME!! :) If you like strong lingering perfumes then this isn't for you as you will say it doesn't last very long. If you're looking for something clean and feminine that lingers and makes people want to sniff you then this is for you.
I'm finding some of the strong perfumes that last in strength all day make me feel quite sick after a while and you'll find men/women prefer a subtle clean feminine smell rather than those nose burners like Opium, Poison, Youth Dew!! I'm really pleased with this!! I think it's simply lovely and I smell great!! :) Happy Days",01/13/14 07:32,Rianna

The Beat EDT Burberry,"I'm surprised about all those negative or 'meh'-reviews for The Beat EdT as I have to say that for my untrained nose iT is a lovely summer scent. Uplifting, fresh, feminine, rather detectable. Not generic as so many reviews state.

Or maybe my admiration is based on the fact that although I've been looking for a fresh fragrance for ever, high and low, have found nothing but disappointment so far, until I sniffed this. The Beat manages to avoid all those rough corners that have put me off so many times before - it's not sharp nor masculine, it's also not soapy nor watery, not easily fleeting nor annoying. It's not ""watermelon-y"", not ""too young"", not too sweet, not air freshener or detergent-like, and not stingy. And to me that says (and means) a lot!

The Beat EDT Burberry,"My first impression was that of a very generic green tea and citrus fragrance. But who doesn't need one?

I see green tea as the 21st century lavender...a staple,the bottle you reach for when pretty much everything else seems too this or that for the occasion...job interview, meeting with friends, taking the kids to a theme park, a first date why not ?

After I have worn this on the few warm spring days we have had so far, I would say that the intensity of the top citrus notes as well as the somewhat harsh grassy ones weaken after about 30 minutes and let the floral and spicy sides of this composition add some warmth and complexity.The fragrance definitely seems more feminine at that stage, even though it remains on the fresh/casual side.



It has surprisingly good staying power , about 4-5 hours ; Green, herby scents aren't usually detectable on me after 1-2 hours !

The Beat EDT Burberry,"I cannot make up my mind about this one. Every time I smell it, it leaves a huge amount of SOMETHING lacking, and I keep going back to smell it to try to ""process"" the scent but I just can't. My first impression, honestly, was that this smelled exactly like soap. So it's an extremely clean scent, and also quite masculine - I'd say the most masculine off all the Burberry perfumes. This is something I'd wear when I don't want others to think I'm wearing perfume. It would definitely be safe for work since it has about zero projection. The scent doesn't come across as complex and is definitely ""safe.""

In the same time as it's really fresh it's also comforting. As if there was vanilla in it but in so small amounts that it doesn't get sweet or heavy at all.

The only sad thing is that the scent disappears too soon.

To me the EdP is a totally different fragrance. That one's just heavy - I can't stand it. The EdT on the other hand is perfect. So light in every way and just oh-so-wonderfully-smelling!",08/14/10 16:06,Petite poupée

The Beat EDT Burberry,"Strange as it may seem the top notes are similar to Moschino Funny and Incanto Bliss put together at least on my skin. It's fresh, careless and sweet, a totally wearable EDT for the summer. Although not listed, I can detect some pepper in it in the top notes. Unlike other reviewers say, this lasted quite long on my skin, it's just not loud. It comes to the signature Burberry soft vanilla/musk dry-down, just a bit fresher. If you have tried the EDP, you might recognise the mossy note in the drydown, but it's barely there. Certainly it has less character than the EDP (and it differs from it significantly), but it's still lovely.On clothes it leaves a clean laundry impression. Yeah, I already imagine myself wearing this at my favorite beach bar. This is more than perfect for summer and everyday wear.",05/28/10 04:25,LuluCoconut

The Beat EDT Burberry,"Both the original and this later, less concentrated version of The Beat had little lasting power on my skin. Disappointed was I that they hadn't made a more intense version of The Beat.

This fragrance was so light that I could barely smell it at first. A subtle citrusy opening was all that I could detect when I pressed my nose to my wrist.

Eventually The Beat EDT strengthens a little allowing me to enjoy the introduction of the tea and iris notes. This fragrance is very refined and classy, like MoietToi mentioned. However, it is a far cry from the original which possessed a boozy like quality that I really enjoyed.

The original had spunk, but this lighter version is enough to make me yawn. Summing up The Beat EDT; a basic yet pleasant floral with hints of citrus and tea. Need I say more?",01/15/10 20:09,missk
The Beat EDT Burberry,"What??? I´d like to know why Burberry released an EDT version of Beat. The original version, EDP, is so light and with weak staying power - it could be considered already an EDT.

IMO, this version is a waste of money.",12/01/09 04:26,susieqrj
The Beat EDT Burberry,"I was given this perfume as a gift from my Dad. Anyways I spritzed it on and I smelled this cloud of tea,lavender and something citrusy.

The Beat EDT Burberry,"Vetiver, tea, musk. very unisex, a bit of spring, but not especially original. Nothing sexy about it - which is surprising given the musk note - then again, it is a very synthetic musk. other fragrances might be peeking in and out here and there.... bluebell??? who could tell over the big domineering tea/musk/generic citrus aromas? cardamom is an absolute fav of mine, but undetectable here. Pink pepper? I know that's the hawt little ingredient for 2008, but where is it in this mix?

Could be a high end Burberry scent, could be the fragrance added to a man's deoderant stick, could be gym locker deodorant for a high-end raquet club. overall, this one gets a ""meh"".",04/16/09 12:05,Zhara

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"Aromatic & Green Chypre with Peach Tea drydown...
This is another contemporary interpretation of a chypre from master perfumer Michel Almairac. Opens with a burst of wormwood-chypre and dries down to peach-tea and cashmere. In the first couple of minutes after the spray dries, I can the feel the fruity green-apple & peach accented by the bitter-green, herbal & aromatic tones of wormwood. Wormwood here reads a little like a greener oakmoss with a dash of incense to my nose. Already the rose & tea are swelling through. As it transitions to the heart the rose & tea move forward and sandalwood adds a woody sweetness. This all rests on a fluffy musk & Cashmere wood base with hints of amber-vanilla. Performance is well above average.

Contrast to Body by Burberry EDP:
Also composed by Michel Almairac, these are very similar, although the EDT is slightly less sweet, and the tannic component is more obviously a tea note. Both are well above average performance-wise.

Contrast to Body Tendre by Burberry:
Also composed by Michel Almairac, these are very similar, although Body Tendre is more rose forward. Both are well above average performance-wise.

Overall: gorgeous green, aromatic chypre with peach-tea drydown and well above average performance that becomes beast mode when layered over its matching body lotion. It's a longtime love for me. Enjoy!",01/17/25 05:57,suzanne_ronald
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I really love the apple note in this fragrance, and it's the reason why I chose the EDT over the EDP.

I think of Burberry Body EDT as an ideal professional scent. It's a perfect one to wear to a job interview, or on the first day of a promotion, or just any time you want to feel put together and get taken seriously. While this is a very pleasant perfume, it's also quite serious, making it a good fit for a more serious-type person.
I'm a teacher, and this fragrance screams educational professional to me (think high school level teacher, school administrator, or even college professor).

And while I wouldn't necessarily say that Body EDT has masculine vibes, it definitely leans unisex.

Also, longevity and sillage are just as good, if not better, than a lot of EDPs. I get 6-8 hours wear from it on my skin, and it lasts all day on clothes.",03/31/24 17:44,Novalee_Marie

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"Burberry Body EDT reminds me of Givenchy Ange Ou Demon Le Secret EDT (the pale yellow one) but it's jasmine is replaced by rose here. fortunately I can't pick up wormwood. I can detect apple and rose and tea(which is one of rare green notes that I enjoy) in a light musky,woody base. it's notes are well blended and I don't find it too rosey, or too fruity, or too musky or too woody or too green. it's a bit of each of these blending together creating a pleasant,springy scent which I find versatile,easy to wear and ageless .it's fresh and crisp but also warm and sunny. I don't find it too unique or interesting but who cares? there's no need for every perfume to be earth shattering.it's work place friendly and can make a safe gift choice. longevity and sillage wise it's not too strong but not bad for an edt.it's recognizable for people standing close to you without being overpowering to bother anyone

I decided to get the EDT because it’s the sophisticated clean and fresh smell that I was looking for. Although it’s not the EDP version, don’t think you won’t get performance because you will.

EDP is a baby version of Tresor by Lancôme. It’s too musky and rosy for my liking.

It was difficult for me to pick between the two. I sampled them for several days because they are both lovely.
However, I decided in EDT because it’s more me.",12/11/21 07:04,Nanalvzpink
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I like the edt and the edp but it took awhile for me to get used to the edp. I assumed the edp would be better but i was wrong. This one, the edt, is better to me because the rose stands out more in this than in the edp. The edp has a really strong wormwood smell that is only deepened by the peach and its not good right away because of that. The edt on the other hand has the apple which opens the door for the rose to step in and use the wormwood as a doormat, which suits this scent far better.
the depth of the edp is far more my style as it lingers thick around my body and i love that. Although the airy crisp rose is a stunner too in the edt as it dances around and envelops leaving a trail as well. Im glad to have both since i crave both quite often. They have actually replaced my beloved Spellbound which i never thought that could happen. Not cuz theyre similar scents but the essence of the fragrance is similar.",10/23/21 14:17,Gemsense

Lovely!
It reminds me of the sadly discontinued Gucci Envy me.",03/22/21 22:31,Vanilla violin

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"This is a very lovely, fresh but warm, a bit unusual fragrance I think. I used to almost not feel that I had it on after a couple of hours, but then after a full workingshift at the nursing home when I walked by a couple of coworkers, they told me I was smelling so good. Sweaty and all..! 🙂 So I guess this goes well with my skin, then. But since I did not feel it so much myself, I went buying the edp. But unfortunately it’s a bit too strong for my nose - the absinthe, I think. So next time I will stick to this lighter version after all - I just have to respray a little, if needed!! And then I want the Tender version as well... maybe even more lovely. Well worth having both, I think! For spring and summer mostly.",02/15/20 14:33,Miasha
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"This is ok, it's alot better than some perfumes I've tried recently and more complex, it's pretty, but there is something about it that just isn't screaming LOVE to me.

This smells pretty much identical to the edp with only a small difference,..but for me that small difference is enough for me to much prefer the edp over this one, this perfume is basically just the edp backwards..with the edp the wormwood is more upfront and it makes the scent warmer and the fruit and rose is in the background but still noticeable, with this one the wormwood is in the background and the fruit and rose are upfront and prominent, this is basically the lighter daytime version of the edp.

I thought that I would like this just as much but I don't, strangely for me I'm not actually sure about the blend of the rose and fruit and so the wormwood in the edp actually took the edge off of that for me..I don't know what it is as it's still pleasant but it kinda ends up smelling dare I say it..like a peachy room freshener, not as bad as some that I've tried, nowhere near..but enough to make me not sure about it, the wormwood being more upfront in the edp takes the edge off of this for me and overall it just blends better and I actually enjoy the rose and peach in it because it smells more rounded, less sharp and less pungent with the wormwood taking centre stage, the edp is also alot more unique x",08/19/19 12:38,babyrose1985

A bit fruity, but not as much as you'd expect. It's fresh and woody, but soft and delicate. You can aid the silage and longevity by using along with Burberry's Body Milk, which smells absolutely divine. This fragrance makes me feel very feminine. The design of this bottle is absolutely gorgeous as well, Crystal-like with some define heft. The tall thin Body bottle is the perfect vessel to be held and easily sprayed.

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"As winter gives way to spring and the weather starts warming up, the EDP of this perfume is better replaced with this EDT that opens with cool, crisp apple and peach followed closely by rose and refreshing tea. A light sprinkling of woods and musk are not far behind and all of the notes are in harmony with each other. Eventually, the apple fades but tea, rose, a good amount of musk, and a light woodiness remains on the skin.

This is really like a “just out of the shower” skin scent. It’s aptly names “Body” and has become a staple in my perfume wardrobe. Great for everyday wear. Lasts about 5-6 hours on me that I can pick up faintly when I press my nose to my wrist, but there have been occasions that I was complimented long after. So maybe this lasts longer, but I just can’t smell it after a while.

People, especially men, seem to love this on me as well as the EDP during the winter time. Trick is, don’t spray this too heavily. When they pick up a subtle hint of this fragrance, it seems to make them turn their head and wonder, “where is that beautiful scent coming from?” It doesn’t bash them over the head. It’s intriguing, a bit coy, and alluring. For that reason, it’s a bit mysterious.",03/11/18 16:40,ChelleBelle84

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"Ahh yes... This is my favorite version of the Burberry Body line! The original was too heavy for me, but the EDT version strikes just the right pitch. It's an amped up clean skin scent on me - the apple is definitely there, but it's more tart than sweet, lending a crispness to the scent. Peach and rose are definitely prominent, just like the pyramid suggests. The original could definitely come across as a more ""mature"" scent, while I find the EDT much more versatile. The powder and woods are toned down, but still present in the dry down. Essentially, this Body smells like a combination of freshly washed skin, lotioned up, with some natural rosy muskiness. Clean and comfortable and elegant. Lovely and feminine.

And BONUS! I am in love with the oil spray, and the EDT is much more similar to the oil than the original EDP is. A few squirts of the oil and one spritz of the perfume and the fragrance envelops me in a comfortable hug that hints at something more.. Just a touch more intimate than friendly, not quite sensual, but the chemistry's there. ;) <3",05/07/16 20:22,kaejuntun
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I thought I remembered falling in love with this perfume after testing it last summer. However, regrettably, after buying a 35ml bottle online I discovered I must have been remembering a different Burberry fragerence as this is rather unpleasant on my skin, sort of tart and metallic but with a nauseating sweetness, my brother mentioned it smelt just like Turkish delight, and I agree! Fresh and fruity at first but as as it dries the main note I can smell the rose/Turkish delight. To me its a very cold fragerence, reminds me of cool glass, I suppose like roses in an elegent glass vase on a fresh spring day. I can see why others love this, its delicate and fresh but unfortunately just does not sit well on my skin. This is probably a long shot but does anyone in the UK want to arrange a swap (preferably for another fresh, fruity spring/summer fragerence, but I'm open to trying other things)?

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I have the spray-on body oil version of Burberry Body. It is very light and pleasant. On first application it reminds me of canned lychees. Then it develops into a barely-there soft-musk scent with a perceptible woody tone. I have to put the back of my hand up to my nose to smell it after 2 hours or so; by then, there is the faintest hint of tobacco (might be the tea). I don't get any rose or apple tones. This is a keeper: a your-skin-only-better scent for sure. Funny, but the dry down of this reminds me of the considerably less expensive Cafe Cafe, albeit much more subtle.

When it settles down, it becomes warm ( sandalwood, I think). It's a pity that I don't get all the base notes- no vanilla, no cashmere. It's musky and keeps some of the apple sourness, freshness.

I can smell the wormwood in the opening, then it's mostly rose with a hint of peach and tea on my skin. These are the notes I have been able to distinguish, so far. It's classy and sophisticated.

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I agree with flowergirlsusie. This is lighter and fresher than the original Body edp, which I found could get quite sickly and a bit cloying (I imagine the edp would induce headaches in those that are sensitive). The apple in the opening of this EDT makes the scent crisp and airy. The apple note is not like the one in dkny delicious. I found it to be more like the note in the body shop apple shampoo from a long time ago. This perfume is also woodier than the edp and I found this to be enjoyable. It is a clean scent and easy to wear. Good for day wear and I would say any season really if it's just for day use. Others found this scent pleasant and I had a couple of compliments on it.",03/16/13 10:37,pixiepuff
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I got the tester for this one. When I first sprayed it, I thought: ""No way, I'd never wear this!"" Then, as it dried down, I began to detect a really nice rose and peach smell. What I like most about this is those two notes. It's rather soft, sensual and feminine. I wouldn't wear this everyday, as I'm more into unisex fragrances, but I do appreciate this one. Pricey.",02/10/13 10:30,anna.dkr5

Burberry Summer for Women 2010 Burberry,"Extremely baffled with this one. The first time I ever tried it I seriously couldn't smell a thing! I could smell a very light woody flowery scent from the sample vial I had, but the minute it touched my skin it was like water. Decided to give it a couple more chances a short time later, and the next couple times I smelled a very light, fruity aquatic scent that lasted for about 3 hours or so. Well, last night I put some on right before settling down in front of the TV, and this time it was like the first time. Barely there! I would catch the faintest whisper if I turned my head a certain way, but it smelled very watery and not much like a perfume. Even that faint whisper was gone within an hour. Anyone else have this experience? I also have the 2011 summer edition which is a lot better in terms of sillage and longevity.",11/12/13 16:24,Beckylynn8881

Burberry Summer for Women 2010 Burberry,"If one can find the earlier version (the one with the pink rope writing), I would recommend seeking that out as it's an unrivalled summer scent, making use of herbal, sweet and fruity notes to maximum effect. If not, though, this year's release IS rather good - a mandarin and apricot yogurt scent, with the same Burberry Summer dry-down of its predecessors. Perfectly sweet and joyful, with expected lasting power; this would accompany a summer dress very nicely. I would note the Burberry Summer scent has got sweeter - I just hope it doesn't get sweeter again next year, as that would push it too far into candy ubiquity.",06/29/10 00:14,pennypencil

Burberry Summer for Women 2010 Burberry,"oh Burberry!
You did a better job last year.
I preferred the 2009 edition.

This is a weak one. Has no sillage and lasts very shortly.
In the beginning I could smell currants and pomegranate, and I thought the scent would be just stronger than the previous edition, possibly even for evening wear. But then came the middle notes, so faint ... Very light flowers, couldn't even detect which ones. And that's how it stays. I don't get any woods or musk in the drydown, just those pallid flowers.

This fragrance is not bad neither good. But that's ok. You don't have to fall in love with every flanker, do you ...",04/28/10 04:16,vertigo
My Burberry Festive Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Really inoffensive scent. Not super original, but very classy and girly. It's a sweet rich floral and soft patchouli.

Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"burberry summer
(why are there years missing?

summer going into autumn so cooling off.
about 5 sprays to inner elbow - the tester was a bit stuffed but i got a reasonable amount out.

lovely green floral
gently zingy - not sour, not sharp, but a little angular and crisp.
one thought came to mind as Oscar de la Renta Flor seems and feels like its similar to this - that one is much zingier in a limey bright zing way, burberry summer is toned down.

i prefer this to my burberry blush which i have tried recently (that one was a bit too similar to others i either have at the time or have tried, not a bad scent tho)

ok sillage - its not loud, ive had a good three hours with it and it lingers on fabric well.",03/05/19 01:18,dglightblue
Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"Fan of all things Burberry. This one is a light, green floral I ❤ for daytime casual wear.

A friend gave this to me because she wasn't a fan, but I really quite like the subtle sweetness behind this, and the added woody notes. I find that although Burberry are not always at the top of my list of favourite perfumes, I always find their fragrances strange and compelling. The combination of orange and musk in this is pleasant, alongside the pomegranate. I don't find it as distinctive as a lot of other perfumes though, and as genny17 said it's a 'safe' scent that is nice but not overly memorable. It also doesn't last too long, but the scent itself is an interesting warm-floral fragrance.",02/06/17 15:30,Lyoness

Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"I have to say that I love this fragrance!I was shopping one day at Younkers department store and saw this at the fragrance counter so I sprayed this on and went on my way.This is so pretty.I usually like more heavy amber and tropical fragrances but lately I have been craving fresh and airy scents and have been looking for a more natural fragrance to add to my collection.This is very natural smelling for a summer scent no strong alcohol smell at all.On my skin I smell pomegranate, lily of the valley,freesia and a soft woody base.If I could pick one word to describe this scent I would say fruit sorbet.It is cool and airy and the citrus smell stays all the way through the drydown.The woodsy notes are soft but noticable.I have dry skin and the 2 squirts I sprayed on my wrist lasted a good 6 hours.This is not going to be a silliage monster but if you did 4 squirts on the neck and a couple squirts on the inside of the arms people would smell you as you walked by.This will be fabulous for humid hot days and nights as there is something romantic and elegant about it as well.I think soft flowers,italian fruity ice or fruit sorbet with a touch of green and soft woods.The bottle is so pretty as pink is one of my favourite colors.This will not make you feel sick as it is very natural smelling.If you had to pick one fragrance for summer I would say this is the best summer fragrance I've smelled so far.Men will love this as well as they tend to like soft clean smells on a women.Pair this with a cute floral sundress and some gladiator sandals and you will get admiring glances and you wont kill everyone with a strong overbearing fragrance on a hot summer day.This is fruit sherbet in a bottle!LOVE IT!",06/09/13 12:00,tropic sugar
Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"This has the word “garden” written all over it. Smelling it straight out of the bottle it smells like the tomato plants in my garden, very green with a hint of bitterness. After it’s sprayed I get a strong hit of Lily of the Valley -a transport back to my grandmother’s garden. I thought maybe the floral would be too strong for my liking, but then after about half an hour, it really lightened up; almost too much. I keep pressing my nose to my wrist to drink in my summer garden. The lasting power is not good on me, so I don’t think I’ll purchase, but I think it’s really nice. They really managed to bottle nature with this one!",04/29/13 13:26,Melly26
Burberry Summer for Women 2013 Burberry,"Very aptly named as it is a perfect scent for summer.

It's light, it has a lovely freshness and ever so sweet and faintly floral. It is really pretty while being a wee little bit woodsy. It has a watery freshness to it that I really like.

It is perfect for an inoffensive scent. It doesn't project much at all.

Longevity is 3 hours - if that. Great summertime scent you can wear for anything. Spraying clothes and using an unscented lotion helps it last longer. I still have to bathe in it quite a bit because it just doesn't last. It will be perfect for HOT months when you want something refreshing, lightly sweet and floral.


I will have to buy multiple bottles as it is a limited ed only.

He's got that romance by the sea vibe going on.
This fragrance is Francis Kurkdjian’s enthusiastic,marine, bright and a bit ozonic take on jasmine with the tender trace of bergamote in the opening and with a nice,peaceful, woody and mossy drydown.I think it's a unisex smell.

Longevity - 7/10(7+ hours)
Silage/Projection - 7,5/10(moderate projection and silage for the first 1-2 hours,than sits closer to skin for the duration of the scent's evolution)
Weather - best in spring and summer.
Age - 25+
Compliments(low-medium-high) - medium
Scent - 8,5/10

Main notes according to me -
jasmine,marine notes,aldehydes,moss,violet leaf:.

The drydown is nice,peaceful,woody and mossy and I get some moss,woodiness and flowers.

Emotions -romance by the sea,enthusiastic,marine,bright, sensual.

Occasion -For more or less any ocasion.

Clary Sage Burberry,"You’ve got to respect a house like Burberry trying to add something different and interesting to the market, and Clary Sage does just that. But sadly, I really don’t enjoy this, it leans far too heavily into the herbal facets, to the point it doesn’t even smell like a fragrance anymore.

It’s a sharp, dry and herbal affair, with a strong presence of sour Mediterranean vegetation, and particularly loose leaf green tea. There’s a strong green and earthy character to it, it’s very leafy to the point of unpleasantness.

As I said, it doesn’t smell like a fragrance, instead I can very well picture people thinking you smell unclean if you wore this. I commend the creativity here, and it’s clearly a well made fragrance, but the actual smell is a no for me.",10/05/25 09:48,RGH01

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"I don't understand why this version was called Intense since the original version seems stronger to me with more pronounced florals, particularly the rose. That also performs much better than this. While this starts off very strong, it quickly nosedives and becomes a skin scent whereas I can easily smell the original Body for hours on end. I also don't care for the woodiness of the dry down here. I prefer the sweeter musk and amber dry down of Body, even though the intense version has the same base notes. It still comes off very woody and dry to me.
Maybe at this point it doesn't matter, since this has practically disappeared from the market with only a few bottles showing up on secondhand sites now and again at inflated prices.

Rich powdery sexy . Great longevity, heavy sillage .
It's becoming one of my favorite perfumes",06/11/18 22:57,Helen123456789
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"This is quite potent and needs to be applied at a bit of a distance. The first hour is quite sharp, but then it becomes a gorgeous, sensual musky frag. I'd say it might be too much for office wear but a perfect choice for date night. Many compliments will come your way!",02/03/18 04:08,hoppie66

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"Gorgeous! Long winded story warning! Had a spray from the tester & was so disappointed. I can't describe the smell. Walked away & waited for my prescription to be filled. And then, miraculously, I detected grapefruit & floral. I bought the EDP & have just tried it again several hours after the tester. It's delightful. It certainly has the Burberry tang I find in the other Burberry perfumes which is attractive. So glad i waited a while & let the scent dry down. Very elegant & wearable. Versatile. I could wear it anywhere! Love, love, love!",02/02/17 23:32,eleanor.lepage
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"Thought the scent was so sexy at first. Never felt like that before. Fell for it and bought it the instant.

Buy this if you can handle it. It still is sexy.",10/21/16 07:03,vermoth
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"I don't find anything special in the classic version of Burberry Body, but the intense version is gorgeous and classy. This is clean,rosy scent. İt is perfect for summer but I love it so much that I can use this perfume in every season.

Since I bought it, I haven't use any other perfumes. Normally, my mother doesn't like perfumes and even she said that 'what a beautiful scent is that.'
However, there is a disadvantage in this scent for me. Longevity and sillage are very poor. I am very surprised when I read comments about its moderate longevity.",08/14/16 10:11,pink_pepper
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"One of my favourites. Body Intense is so young and elegant, modern and classy at the same Time. It has a good lasting power on me (6+) and get's frequently noticed by strangers. Starts a bit strong and you may be scared by the wormwood but it developes into a cosy, discreet fruity and very powdery scent. If you question yourself whether buying the original or the intense version, choose the Intense. Difference is not big but this one is a bit warmer and deeper. Lightly sweet, generous and wearable 24/7. Love it!",06/19/16 12:40,HillTop
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"So my mum wore this originally a few years ago and i thought it smelt nice and suited her but never thought to wear it for myself.
I tried it out today out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was on me.
I wouldn't call this perfume sexy, pretty or feminine but it is beautiful. Its not like any other perfumes at all.
Its so warm and comforting like a hug and its starts quite soft and drys down quite woody.
Overall i found it quite clean, soft and dynamic.",05/20/16 04:25,Edemay

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"This perfume smells very differently from the first half an hour that you apply it to the hours afterwards, my advice is: spray it, wait 30 mins and then take your conclusions. Probably and bit too musky and powdery for some but I love it. For me it's a modern take on roses, very elegant, creamy and powdery with a hint of peach.

UPDATE: unfortunately this perfume at the end of the day gave me a headache, not sure why.... sad because I really liked it.",03/01/16 05:13,SSousa

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"This the first Burberry perfume that I have owned or even tried and it's a winner to me! I could see this as a daily wear possibly a signature. Definitely a crowd pleaser. First blast is rose, rose, rose....reminds me of Chloe EDP. After a few minutes it settles down into a lovely clean powdery vanilla floral. I do see the similarity to clean skin after a shower. Great longevity, great sillage.

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"Overall: 8.25/10
Here's Why:
I feel like Burberry hit the nail on the head with this one.
It's by no means comparable to niche fragrance, but it is the best of the Burberry Line.
Warm, soft and classic.
Easy to wear - likable.
Some of the reviews on here comparing this to detergent - I have no idea what note they are picking up on as I have had nothing but wonderful things said while wearing this.
It is definitely more feminine, but I wear it anyways because I don't follow the men/women rule - if I like it... I wear it.
Performance is great.
Blends well with others, I specifically like this with one spray of JPG Le Male.
Overall, a winner.",02/10/15 13:20,FeelingRisky

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"Perfect 'womanly' smell.
It's creamy, warm, feminine and super musky. I don't get much fruit, just a hint of peach then it's all cashmere wood, sandalwood for a solid 6hrs +.
A perfect rainy day, giant jumper affair for sure.

Edit:-
I'm quite surprised, but I'm actually really loving this!
It's one of my favourite grab and go fumes and my obsessive collection is over 100 deep these day's, so I'd say that speaks for itself.",10/30/14 04:06,amywamywoo
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"I LOVE this fragrance, it's really clean and fresh.
I do not smell the rose though, the woody notes are more noticeable on my skin.
It lasts around 5-6h so moderate longevity.
The bottle it is really pretty but since I have the 85ml it sticks out between all of my other perfume bottles (that are quite big as well since I always buy the biggest bottle available) and it looks kind of weird so I tend to set it horizontally instead of vertically.
I'd give this perfume 8.5/10

EDIT: This time I could also smell the rose and the drydown was a very warm vanilla! Love it even more!!",10/27/14 10:19,xNanaOsaki
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"This is a clean deep scent. Clean as in fresh out of the shower clean. A bit powdery and this Intense version is somewhat sweeter than the original in my opinion. Deep due to the woody notes.

Perfect for hot summers - makes me feel fresh.

Great longevity and sillage, over 6 hours.

A man complimented me on it and confused it with Pleasures by Estee Lauder. Now, they do not smell alike at all - Pleasures is flowery and Body is well not :D - but I do get where he's coming from. They're both 'intense' loud perfumes that give off a neat crisp vibe.",07/15/14 08:12,bleuciel
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"A lot alike Body EdP but with little more woody notes. Wonderful. In base a hint of powder that dances around you. Timeless -both young and mature women can wear Body EdP Intense in my opinion. Longlasting on my skin.

Ganska lik Body EdP men med lite mer tränoter. Superhärlig. I basen hittar jag en mjuk pudrighet. Tidlös - både yngre o äldre kvinnor kan bära Body EdP Intense tycker jag. Väldigt hållbar på huden.",04/28/14 06:11,Mooniq
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"This intense version of Body is very similar to the original. Even the notes are the same. I might be wrong but I think that the original Body has more intense rose note, while this one has slightly stronger wood note.
Both perfumes are so similar that I must admit I don't have many new words for this one. Both are delicious, elegant and signature scent material.",03/14/14 10:38,ScarlettX

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I have the Gold Limited Edition EDP, which I think is the same as the regular Body EDP, but in a differently shaded bottle. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) The bottle design is very nice. It's not something I would have purchased for myself, but I'm giving it a try. As others have said about Body, it's quite soft and clean. I get the 'hairspray' and even the 'scotch tape' (ha!) that have been mentioned.

There are no notes that come forward very strongly. I think the best use of it for me will be as a canvas for layering other fragrances, helping to weave them together. Today, after I showered, I put on Red Flower Hammam Cardamom Amber Oil, then a spray of Sonoma Scent Studio's Ambre Noir, and a couple sprays of Burberry Body. Later I added Red Flower Guaiac perfume. That may sound like a lot, but everything is very warm, mellow, and comforting for a winter day. I'm also going to try it layered with Allure to pick up the peach and vanilla notes, and with some of my rose fragrances.",12/28/13 15:43,vartenouche
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"I get why people compare the smell of Body to hair spray and soap. Just give this perfume a few minutes to mix with your body chemistry before you form an opinion. Imagine a clean scent that smells like a nice shower, freshly washed hair, and clothes fresh from the dryer. That's what this scent gives me. Usually that 'i just got out of the shower' scent, goes away in a matter of minutes. Using this fragrance allows me to have that smell all day. It's great for the office or even as an everyday scent while running errands.

I don't expect to get compliments with this perfume as it doesn't really smell like perfume to me. It just smells of fresh lien and a more intense version of how my skin would naturally smell after my morning routine. The name Body is perfect! This scent can also be used as a layering scent. I've used it with different types of body splashes and they all mesh well.

The packing of this fragrance is amazing. It's luxurious, classy, beautiful and chic. The downside to this fragrance is the price. I believe I paid $100 for a 3.4oz which is a little pricey for a perfume that doesn't demand attention and probably won't be complimented often. However, the price can be justified with the fact I haven't found anything cheaper that lasts as long and performs as well. 1-3 spritz and it lasts all day. I'm not sure if I'm going to repurchased, but I will enjoy every last drop.",12/27/13 18:25,MeaNutri
Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"Sometimes its make me wonder why Michel Almairac created this perfume because I really adore some of his creation. This smell tooooooooooo common already.

I would pick-up Gucci Guilty Intense anytime over this one.",11/26/13 22:40,Vastalux

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"Blech this is actually kind of gross...ugh I hate being so negative but this is one scent I never want to smell again. It really synthetic smelling, but its quite heavy maybe even a little cloying. The peaches smell too ripe in a bad way almost like they are on the verge of rotting. The rose smells like a overly sweet rosewater and I barely pick up the woods and musk...According to the notes this should be right up my alley and I usually like all the Burberry fragrances, but it totally ended up not working for me. This is one of the scents that should have a warning label saying ""Warning!Try at your own risk.""",06/08/13 22:10,yuugainotenshi

Body Eau de Parfum Intense Burberry,"There are two koncentrations of Burberry Body, EdP and EdP Intense. Make sure to test both! This review is for the EdP Intense.
I have never been fond of Burberry-scents before. OK, London is fresh and nice, and The Beat is wearable, too, but the rest of the Burberry-scents are way too sweet and heavy for my taste. I have never owned a Burberry-scent before.
But Burberry Body EdP Intense got me! I find similaritys to my old fav Cristobal by Balenciaga and to Chanel Allure EdP. Body EdP Intense is female in the same way as these two frags, just a little softer in it's expression. For an new release, I find Body EdP Intense a unique scent.


Det finns två koncentrationer av Burberry Body, EdP och EdP Intense. Se gärna till att prova båda. Detta inlägg handlar om EdP Intense.
Jag har aldrig förut varit förtjust i Burberrys dofter. OK, London är fräch och trevlig, och The Beat går att använda, men resten av Burberrys dofter är alldeles för söta och tunga för min smak. Jag har aldrig ägt en Burberry-doft förut.
Men Burberry Body EdP Intense fick mig på fall. Jag hittar likheter med min gamla favorit Cristobal av Balenciaga och med Chanel Allure EdP. Body EdP Intense är kvinlig på samma sätt som dessa två dofter, bara lite mjukare i sitt uttryck. För att vara en nylanserad doft tycker jag att Body EdP Intense är en unik doft.",12/30/11 12:28,Maggan

Burberry Sport Ice Burberry,"You cannot deny the smell of Burberry (nothing to do with actually liking/disliking it).

While I do think all Burberry scents smell somewhat alike, I have strong favorites (Beat) and strong dislikes (Brit) within the brand. I think it absolutely is a good sign, that a brand has a face.

As for Sport Ice, it smells like a dream of sea, sand, summer and an expensive leather bag. Kind of dreams one has during the the Fall, waiting for the paycheck and vacation or reminiscing vacation long gone.

Colder scent suited for spring, summer or even for colder weather. Refreshing splash of ginger soda and salt water and ... yes, a floral detergent.

It's ok.",07/11/15 00:34,PastelMoon
Burberry Sport Ice Burberry,"I live by the sea & so enjoy the salty sea air & marine freshness on a cool, bright morning walk. I live in the countryside & love the way the ozone clings to my washing when I line dry it. What I don't like is when these beautiful, natural, cool, fresh scents are ruined by some cheap & overpowering fake citrus musk.

Ice is the person in front of you who cleaned their shirt in budget lemon washing powder - the one that assaults your nose with its industrial strength fuzzy-musk & citrus scent.

Of course, there are many people who love this pseudo-fresh musk scent (Lord knows I slip-stream enough washing powder folks as they mosey on down the street). But, for me Ice doesn't cut it. Mix the soft citrus bakery scents of some CKin2U types, mix with some ozionic 90's classics & then dump in a washing tub full of bright, white, fuzzy clean musk. You get the picture: nice, clean-without-the-green, soft citrus musk.

Burberry Sport Ice Burberry,"Burberry Sport Ice is thankfully more palatable than Burberry Sport which was a synthetic disaster to my nose.

The composition is mostly citrus with an icy twist, and combines delicate musky and sandy undertones to give it that little hint of originality. Yes, it does appear to be a cold, frosty scent, and although refreshing, I think it could also suit moderately cold weather, especially a rainy day.

It's not a sillage monster, but it projects rather well for a subtle citrus-based fragrance. Many are mentioning the ginger note, and while it's present, it's not particularly prominent. Burberry Sport Ice falls either into the category of being a clean citrus fragrance or an aquatic. Floral isn't the right word to describe this perfume.

I'll agree that it reminds me of a chilled glass of soda water, especially since I feel that this fragrance radiates a somewhat sparkling quality. It's feminine and inoffensive, which are two things that have drawn me into liking this fragrance. However I must add that I'm disappointed in Burberry for producing way too many forgettable flankers and not coming up with new fragrances like the classics, which were the reason why I came to love Burberry in the first place.

For a Summer scent, Burberry Sport Ice is right up there as being a pleasant and wearable fragrance. I find this fragrance a little similar in both style and scent to Burberry Brit Sheer, so lovers of that perfume will most likely enjoy this.",04/09/11 06:26,missk

Society Burberry,"Society is class and sophistication bottled. At first the scent intimidates
almost smells dirty. Stong and bold, after settling into it you realize it is dirty...sexy dirty. A well blended Burberry classic that may not be suitable for younger women. Definely not a beginner scent. Projects well and lasts 6-8 hours. A masterpiece that can't be compared to anything I've ever smelled.",07/11/23 20:25,pamelalasalle110
Society Burberry,"I'm not crazy, after all. Every time I've worn Society (vintage) I thought I smelled cassia/cassis/blackberry/redcurrant, and apparently others do, too.

Sillage seems moderate, I have a co-worker who is quick to complain about whatever I'm wearing, and her silence at this one seems to confirm it, although I try to use a light hand (4 sprays max, unless it's weak.)

Cassia and similar smelling notes are a challenge for me, but I like this. I'm a fan of Chypres, so the other notes are familiar to me. I occasionally get a waft of air that reminds me of Dana Tabu. Something about it makes me think of middle school, (I attended '95-98) so I'm wondering if a teacher wore it. It makes me think of the cultural expectations of moms of that era, stereotypically feminine yet somehow asexual.

I'm not sure what occasion this is for. I wear it to work, and can't imagine where else. Church, a family reunion, maybe a wedding? Somewhere a little formal but not a place where you need a tool of seduction. Not a job interview, either, could be migraine inducing for some.",05/19/22 21:50,swedishmilk15
Society Burberry,"Oh, do I feel privileged to have a wee sample of this beauty!

For some little while I have been extremely fond of vintage floral bouquets. Some are soapy. Some are challenging. Most are Big and Gorgeous, others sensitive and delicate.

Burberry Society strides right down the middle - neither massive nor shy. The name is utterly appropriate. More like an elegant woman wearing a linen dress with corsage than a young girl wearing a vintage Laura Ashley dress, but either image is appropriate.

The first whiff was quite reminiscent of DVF's charming Tatiana. Indeed, the orange blossom is to blame! As the fragrance develops it leans another direction altogether and even slightly resembles EA's Splendor. Splendor has too much Freesia by far for my skin, whereas the lilies here give a similar effect without being overwhelming or shrill.

I will not lie. If I found an inexpensive bottle I would buy Society, but at the current prices I will hold fast to my other delightful floral bouquets without a backward glance. This is not as distinctive as Sung (greens and narcissus!) or Estee Lauder Beautiful (roses AND so much more!), both of which are fast favorites of mine. Distinctive or not, Society is Stunning, however, and you will not be sorry to have met her. :D

Spring in a bottle.",04/22/22 15:13,drugstore classics
Society Burberry,"Society is one of the best Osmanthus perfumes I have smelled to date. It smells like natural osmanthus. I love this perfume, this is the Osmanthus scent I've been searching for. A super stunning yellow floral/floral perfume. Why do they discontinue these older gems? This smells like class, elegance, and like old money. Gorgeous. I will be buying more mini's of this beautiful scent. If you love osmanthus you need to find a bottle or a mini.

Edit: 6/13/22 This has an osmanthus/orange blossom darkly seeped smell. Like all of the notes have been steeped to make a darkly brewed tea. Really lovely.",03/21/22 15:09,LSAUG
Society Burberry,"Translating this fragrance is like deciphering the code to a great many youthfully vintage perfumes - one stammers with anything more than monosyllabic noise and big facial expressions. Society fits well into the same, leaving breathless mouths agape, and ""wow"", ""well"", and ""whoa"" descriptors. Although I feel this site portrays, in large part, an approachable catalogue of perfumes and their identifiers, I feel missing the cassia top note just plain negligent. Supported by research on other sites I feel confident when I say, that despite very strong character support provided by Osmanthus, Tuberose, and Gardenia, Cassia dominates from the start through to final gasps of dry down. It is for this very reason some may find such strong uric notes to challenge them out of wear or welcome. In fact, I would share that inkling if not for the vast play underfoot. Torpedoes of light, sweet and musky, entwine with the woody and smoky tones encasing a heart of amber. On the surface, placid waters remain still, confidently smothering the passionate torrent below. Dubious floral chords arise sporadically, and convincingly summon a gentle floral presence before, again placing the wearer in the heart if a traditionally pungent chypre. As for this chyprephile, and bonafide perfume enthusiast, I can only say my affections remain fickle.

Society Burberry,"Bought this out of curiosity... because its compared to my belove scent tribu.
I personally cant detect the resemblance of these two. Maybe distant cousins..

Burberry society is classy, feminine and truly burberry english.
Society is for the mature and sophisticated bosslady.

Flowery, strong and potent...definetely not for the faint of heart.

Longevity is eternal and silage is more than an armslenght.

If you like me like vintage perfumes this is for sure a must try.

Society Burberry,"🙂 okay, so... Burberry scents are usually so well blended, it's kinda hard for a newbie like me to recognize the notes. but i'm working on it. i have one of those humble, tiny bottles. upon first ""splash"" it was just so-so. but after the drydown i got a really nice, exotic medley of flowers. i do get the tuberose. i do get the hyacinth. and there's a hint of something cool and fresh. almost minty. its really nice. distinguished and respectable. this strikes me as a unique, pleasant, and professional ""boss scent"". something an established entrepreneur would wear.

Society Burberry,"I have the vintage, and this fragrance is a VERY vintage scent. Lovely. The main notes in order are: a deep, honeyed, rich floral; osmanthus, orange blossom, mimosa, orchid, oakmoss, hint of rose, musk,",08/12/19 17:28,gtabasso
Society Burberry,"Review of vintage edp:

OSMANTHUS. Plummy, suedey osmanthus. I love this note- it is always much darker than I expect it to be, and for me that alone makes this an evening scent. If you want to like leather, but find you can't wear it, try osmanthis- it's a very similar effect, without the harshness or tang you get with leather notes.

In the heart, I get mimosa and a light orchid note, warming BS and softening the scent.

The dry down is greener, with a touch of green hyacinth, bergamot, and incense added to the now soft osmanthus.

Over all, I find Society to be warm, a little dark, plummy, with light floral and citrus notes. Very elegant, with an almost voluptuous vibe, but restrained. Think of a full skirted dress with a cinched in waist- controlled, but very, very feminine, and you can't help noticing the shape of the body underneath. Not in an obvious way, but you are very aware of curves ;)",05/23/15 20:31,lotus and jasmine

Society Burberry,"For me this is a classical indolic scent in the vein of Joy or Kate Moss Vintage Muse - not at all what I expected from reading the other reviews. Society is quite smooth and rich, evoking an elegant 80's vibe. It's definitely NOT a cold or sparkling scent on me. The top notes from my bottle are musty, which could be because my bottle is a little old, but the heart and base notes are still good. Sillage is moderate and longevity is quite good on me.",10/30/14 04:31,jenniewebb
Society Burberry,"I'm surprised there are no berry notes listed in the opening. For me, this scent is about rich, dark berries over a base of moss and musk. I loved it when I first smelled it, in the 90s when my late father gave it as a gift to my mother, and I love it still. Look for the original Burberry version, not the later reformulation by another company. The original version will say ""By Burberrys"" on the box and on the bottom bottle label, under the perfume name. There's also an image of a white knight on horseback on the original's red, rounded bottle cap. For a special treat, layer the original version under a quick spritz of Hanae Mori!",05/15/14 17:55,FaunAromatic
Society Burberry,It's like having a mouth full of 5 flavour lifesavers. Only better. Truly one of the unique fragrances of yesteryear. Therefore in the hoard category. I must add an enveloping aroma. best of Burberry's scents ever. Not available here any more either.,08/25/13 08:36,Tine1world
Society Burberry,"Still on the fence if this is 'love', or just 'like', but leaning towards love, at the first spritz.

It was nice, well behaved, proper fragrance, certainly flowery but very well blended.
Gardenia seemed prominent, and African orange flower poked through, not so much of the hyacinth or rose though, a hint of vanilla, all ever so lightly but nicely ""smoked"".
And then there was this monster something that was sweet nearly to the point of cloying... is that osmanthus? I have never came face to face with the real osmanthus, so I do not know how it smells.
I was thinking how could anyone put so much of ""it"" into the fragrance but, at the same time, I was strangely drawn to it. It reminded me of something from the distant past, perhaps a place, or a flower I smelled in passing, but I could not recall what that was, only that I actually liked that smell.
Apparently, still do.

Overall, I get this feeling that Society is very aptly named as I keep imagining it worn at a fancy dinner in a fancy garden, by a well dressed, well versed woman who could very possibly bear a title of Lady. After all, this is Burberry.
I get this feeling that pairing Society with jeans and tee shirt might be a sacrilege, nevertheless, I will most likely do it as I'm a rebel.

I'd say Society is a nice fall fragrance, not so much for dead of winter, but ideal for the Indian Summer.
Sillage: rather soft, no tail.
Longevity: amazing! I took a long shower with one of those Dove Cashmere Oil soaps and, several more hours afterwards, Society is still here. And the drydown is heavenly; I can't stop sniffing my wrist...",09/14/12 23:08,jedikitty

It is inoffensive. I spritz it on my way out the door to no where special.

I do not mean to damn this frag with faint praise as it is pleasant.
If the bottle was a bit groovier I would suggest it was for a young girl. The staid presentation of bottle and box is at odds with carefree ,casual fragrance.

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"Aromatic & Green Chypre with Peach Tea drydown...
This is another contemporary interpretation of a chypre from master perfumer Michel Almairac. Opens with a burst of wormwood-chypre and dries down to peach-tea and cashmere. In the first couple of minutes after the spray dries, I can the feel the fruity green-apple & peach accented by the bitter-green, herbal & aromatic tones of wormwood. Wormwood here reads a little like a greener oakmoss with a dash of incense to my nose. Already the rose & tea are swelling through. As it transitions to the heart the rose & tea move forward and sandalwood adds a woody sweetness. This all rests on a fluffy musk & Cashmere wood base with hints of amber-vanilla. Performance is well above average.

Contrast to Body by Burberry EDP:
Also composed by Michel Almairac, these are very similar, although the EDT is slightly less sweet, and the tannic component is more obviously a tea note. Both are well above average performance-wise.

Contrast to Body Tendre by Burberry:
Also composed by Michel Almairac, these are very similar, although Body Tendre is more rose forward. Both are well above average performance-wise.

Overall: gorgeous green, aromatic chypre with peach-tea drydown and well above average performance that becomes beast mode when layered over its matching body lotion. It's a longtime love for me. Enjoy!",01/17/25 05:57,suzanne_ronald
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I really love the apple note in this fragrance, and it's the reason why I chose the EDT over the EDP.

I think of Burberry Body EDT as an ideal professional scent. It's a perfect one to wear to a job interview, or on the first day of a promotion, or just any time you want to feel put together and get taken seriously. While this is a very pleasant perfume, it's also quite serious, making it a good fit for a more serious-type person.
I'm a teacher, and this fragrance screams educational professional to me (think high school level teacher, school administrator, or even college professor).

And while I wouldn't necessarily say that Body EDT has masculine vibes, it definitely leans unisex.

Also, longevity and sillage are just as good, if not better, than a lot of EDPs. I get 6-8 hours wear from it on my skin, and it lasts all day on clothes.",03/31/24 17:44,Novalee_Marie

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"Burberry Body EDT reminds me of Givenchy Ange Ou Demon Le Secret EDT (the pale yellow one) but it's jasmine is replaced by rose here. fortunately I can't pick up wormwood. I can detect apple and rose and tea(which is one of rare green notes that I enjoy) in a light musky,woody base. it's notes are well blended and I don't find it too rosey, or too fruity, or too musky or too woody or too green. it's a bit of each of these blending together creating a pleasant,springy scent which I find versatile,easy to wear and ageless .it's fresh and crisp but also warm and sunny. I don't find it too unique or interesting but who cares? there's no need for every perfume to be earth shattering.it's work place friendly and can make a safe gift choice. longevity and sillage wise it's not too strong but not bad for an edt.it's recognizable for people standing close to you without being overpowering to bother anyone

EDP is a baby version of Tresor by Lancôme. It’s too musky and rosy for my liking.

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I like the edt and the edp but it took awhile for me to get used to the edp. I assumed the edp would be better but i was wrong. This one, the edt, is better to me because the rose stands out more in this than in the edp. The edp has a really strong wormwood smell that is only deepened by the peach and its not good right away because of that. The edt on the other hand has the apple which opens the door for the rose to step in and use the wormwood as a doormat, which suits this scent far better.
the depth of the edp is far more my style as it lingers thick around my body and i love that. Although the airy crisp rose is a stunner too in the edt as it dances around and envelops leaving a trail as well. Im glad to have both since i crave both quite often. They have actually replaced my beloved Spellbound which i never thought that could happen. Not cuz theyre similar scents but the essence of the fragrance is similar.",10/23/21 14:17,Gemsense

Sweaty and all..! 🙂 So I guess this goes well with my skin, then. But since I did not feel it so much myself, I went buying the edp. But unfortunately it’s a bit too strong for my nose - the absinthe, I think. So next time I will stick to this lighter version after all - I just have to respray a little, if needed!!

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"This is ok, it's alot better than some perfumes I've tried recently and more complex, it's pretty, but there is something about it that just isn't screaming LOVE to me.

This smells pretty much identical to the edp with only a small difference,..but for me that small difference is enough for me to much prefer the edp over this one, this perfume is basically just the edp backwards..with the edp the wormwood is more upfront and it makes the scent warmer and the fruit and rose is in the background but still noticeable, with this one the wormwood is in the background and the fruit and rose are upfront and prominent, this is basically the lighter daytime version of the edp.

I thought that I would like this just as much but I don't, strangely for me I'm not actually sure about the blend of the rose and fruit and so the wormwood in the edp actually took the edge off of that for me..I don't know what it is as it's still pleasant but it kinda ends up smelling dare I say it..like a peachy room freshener, not as bad as some that I've tried, nowhere near..but enough to make me not sure about it, the wormwood being more upfront in the edp takes the edge off of this for me and overall it just blends better and I actually enjoy the rose and peach in it because it smells more rounded, less sharp and less pungent with the wormwood taking centre stage, the edp is also alot more unique x",08/19/19 12:38,babyrose1985

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"As winter gives way to spring and the weather starts warming up, the EDP of this perfume is better replaced with this EDT that opens with cool, crisp apple and peach followed closely by rose and refreshing tea. A light sprinkling of woods and musk are not far behind and all of the notes are in harmony with each other. Eventually, the apple fades but tea, rose, a good amount of musk, and a light woodiness remains on the skin.

This is really like a “just out of the shower” skin scent. It’s aptly names “Body” and has become a staple in my perfume wardrobe. Great for everyday wear. Lasts about 5-6 hours on me that I can pick up faintly when I press my nose to my wrist, but there have been occasions that I was complimented long after. So maybe this lasts longer, but I just can’t smell it after a while.

People, especially men, seem to love this on me as well as the EDP during the winter time. Trick is, don’t spray this too heavily. When they pick up a subtle hint of this fragrance, it seems to make them turn their head and wonder, “where is that beautiful scent coming from?” It doesn’t bash them over the head. It’s intriguing, a bit coy, and alluring. For that reason, it’s a bit mysterious.",03/11/18 16:40,ChelleBelle84

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"Ahh yes... This is my favorite version of the Burberry Body line! The original was too heavy for me, but the EDT version strikes just the right pitch. It's an amped up clean skin scent on me - the apple is definitely there, but it's more tart than sweet, lending a crispness to the scent. Peach and rose are definitely prominent, just like the pyramid suggests. The original could definitely come across as a more ""mature"" scent, while I find the EDT much more versatile. The powder and woods are toned down, but still present in the dry down. Essentially, this Body smells like a combination of freshly washed skin, lotioned up, with some natural rosy muskiness. Clean and comfortable and elegant. Lovely and feminine.

And BONUS! I am in love with the oil spray, and the EDT is much more similar to the oil than the original EDP is. A few squirts of the oil and one spritz of the perfume and the fragrance envelops me in a comfortable hug that hints at something more.. Just a touch more intimate than friendly, not quite sensual, but the chemistry's there. ;) <3",05/07/16 20:22,kaejuntun
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I thought I remembered falling in love with this perfume after testing it last summer. However, regrettably, after buying a 35ml bottle online I discovered I must have been remembering a different Burberry fragerence as this is rather unpleasant on my skin, sort of tart and metallic but with a nauseating sweetness, my brother mentioned it smelt just like Turkish delight, and I agree! Fresh and fruity at first but as as it dries the main note I can smell the rose/Turkish delight. To me its a very cold fragerence, reminds me of cool glass, I suppose like roses in an elegent glass vase on a fresh spring day. I can see why others love this, its delicate and fresh but unfortunately just does not sit well on my skin. This is probably a long shot but does anyone in the UK want to arrange a swap (preferably for another fresh, fruity spring/summer fragerence, but I'm open to trying other things)?

Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I have the spray-on body oil version of Burberry Body. It is very light and pleasant. On first application it reminds me of canned lychees. Then it develops into a barely-there soft-musk scent with a perceptible woody tone. I have to put the back of my hand up to my nose to smell it after 2 hours or so; by then, there is the faintest hint of tobacco (might be the tea). I don't get any rose or apple tones. This is a keeper: a your-skin-only-better scent for sure. Funny, but the dry down of this reminds me of the considerably less expensive Cafe Cafe, albeit much more subtle.

I am a huge admirer of Body EDP, however I wouldn't wear it during summertime, I find it too heavy and smokey on me. This nice edt version is the solution for this, I think it is nothing like ""old lady"", it is a really delighting and smiley fragrance, maybe not for teenagers though.",08/11/14 23:49,Percoon
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I've been searching for a new fragrance for a long time, testing and spraying whenever out shopping. I always seemed to go back to this so I finally made the purchase only to discover that my daughters think I smell like ""old lady""! When I wear this I smell vanilla, sandalwood, peach and rosy powder? I like it, but won't purchase again as I don't want to smell like ""old lady"". So off again to find the perfect fragrance.",08/10/14 22:27,Lolypa
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,Fresh rose and peach smell. beautiful. Smells better that body EDP. I love it.,01/30/14 12:25,neda173
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"Lovely light fragrance for every day. For me, the EDT is fresher compared to the EDP and the longevity is good. It starts off bright and rosey then after about half an hour it becomes soft and powdery. I like the bottle too.",12/28/13 15:56,Lucy Peach
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I have loved perfume, sine the first time I bought my first bottle. Over the year my my taste hasn't changed, but I still hadn't found the ""one"". Recently with a lull period of not wearing any perfumes. I found Burberry Body. This perfume is me (today - described in detail within the scent). I love it. Powdery and woody smell, with musk and fruit scents, after a few hours the woody/powdery scent comes out more and the one important thing, is that my husband loves it on my skin. I love this smell.",10/05/13 17:36,ticklemetania
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"First seconds after spraying I feel some cool, refreshing, ""sparkling"", fruity champagne, then comes the sugar coated but still sour, mouthwatering apple followed by a nice rose bouquet.
When it settles down, it becomes warm ( sandalwood, I think). It's a pity that I don't get all the base notes- no vanilla, no cashmere. It's musky and keeps some of the apple sourness, freshness.
I imagine it on a young, modern woman wearing high heels and following the trends.
Nice, ""positive"", sunny perfume for summer but nothing unique I would recognize.",07/20/13 06:26,Juliana6
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I like the smell of roses. It reminds me of the rose garden my grandmother used to have when I was little. That said, this perfume doesn't smell like 'old lady'. Well, at least not to my nose. It's subtle, fresh, and puts a smile on my face. It' also somewhat soothing. I can smell the wormwood in the opening, then it's mostly rose with a hint of peach and tea on my skin. These are the notes I have been able to distinguish, so far. It's classy and sophisticated. It won't offend anyone unless you bathe in it.
I'm going to test it a few more times, then perhaps get it with my Sephora discount card within the next couple of months.",07/19/13 11:21,anna.dkr5
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I agree with flowergirlsusie. This is lighter and fresher than the original Body edp, which I found could get quite sickly and a bit cloying (I imagine the edp would induce headaches in those that are sensitive). The apple in the opening of this EDT makes the scent crisp and airy. The apple note is not like the one in dkny delicious. I found it to be more like the note in the body shop apple shampoo from a long time ago. This perfume is also woodier than the edp and I found this to be enjoyable. It is a clean scent and easy to wear. Good for day wear and I would say any season really if it's just for day use. Others found this scent pleasant and I had a couple of compliments on it.",03/16/13 10:37,pixiepuff
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,"I got the tester for this one. When I first sprayed it, I thought: ""No way, I'd never wear this!"" Then, as it dried down, I began to detect a really nice rose and peach smell. What I like most about this is those two notes. It's rather soft, sensual and feminine. I wouldn't wear this everyday, as I'm more into unisex fragrances, but I do appreciate this one. Pricey.",02/10/13 10:30,anna.dkr5
Body Eau de Toilette Burberry,May give this one a try if it's softer that the original edp. Actually the latter is a very good one but way too sharp on my skin.,07/01/12 07:53,dina
Hero Burberry,"I agree with others that it is the most practical, but it is not generic smelling like some say. It’s a woody fragrance, yet the EDP is the most woody for me. I get a lot of compliments on this. I like it a lot. It’s professional smelling. You can find testers on EBay for around $45. Crazy",11/10/25 18:25,CDCD
Hero Burberry,"The EDT version is the cleanest-smelling and most practical version. It's truly fresh and quite masculine. The other products in the series can be a bit boring with their leather and coconut notes, but the final stages are all very clean and practical. I think they offer a quality profile that's not too noticeable yet, but blends in well.

There are four fragrances in this series, and all four are different from each other.

I'd like to help those interested in this perfume sort:

Clean, light, bright, vibrant, and sophisticated: EDT
Slightly subtle, but relatively energetic, with a slight coconut note: EDP
Deepest, very leather-themed, close to the skin, and uniform: PARFUM
The coconut is the most pronounced, vibrant, and leather-themed: PARFUM INTENSE

My preference for this particular fragrance was definitely the EDT version. The only version in the series that feels different is the EDT. If you're blind-buying, go for the EDT only. It's inferior to the others in terms of longevity, but on average, all of them last 4-8 hours.",11/08/25 15:47,erkek

that said the whiffs are pretty nice, and this is quite strong, even if the smell is just ok to me, I would wear this if I got it for free or something lol, a spray on my hand happened to latch to the sleeve of my sweater and its been here for over a week!",10/31/25 20:07,literallyrickgrimes

Hero Burberry,"This is definitely a safe blind buy. I love the edt for daily use, it's powerful in the beginning, very spicy, but quickly calms down and you can really appreciate the scent in its fullest form. I'm not great at describing all of the notes, but to me this is such a good blend of citrus and woody, neither is begging for the attention, which allows you to really appreciate both for what they're worth. It's such a simple fragrance that you can't really go wrong with purchasing it and as long as you can handle the spicy opening, you will really like this for a good daily and year-round fragrance.",10/14/25 07:09,Rjles

This is the BEST cologne I’ve ever smelt and I’m so shocked that more guys don’t wear this? When I get a boyfriend if he doesn’t already wear this I’m buying it for him because it is so good.,09/14/25 17:40,chlomartini
Hero Burberry,"Surprised by the ""low"" score on this one. This fragrance (EdT) has given me several unsolicited compliments from strangers and friends over the years.

This is a safe, clean scent. Phenomenal for office and brunch (!). Works great for all four seaons. You can easily use it as a date-fragrance as well.",09/11/25 06:41,Sky Captain
Hero Burberry,"What I smell in the drydown is tonka bean, same as in Burberry Touch. I doubt that they are logging the Himalayas to get Himalayan Cedar. Or the Atlas Mountains for Atlas Cedar. Those are all made-up notes concocted from coumarin. Boring.",09/10/25 01:33,Mancorp
Hero Burberry,"This is totally my kind of scent. I love woody colognes, and this one delivers. It's almost entirely built on a warm rich cedar base that is very masculine and appealing. It brings lots of peppery spice to add character and the juniper and bergamot give it liveliness and lift. There's just enough sweetness to smooth things out a bit, and the overall accord is a traditional woodsy one but with a modern refinement. This is a great versatile all season scent that's safe but interesting. The only knock is that the performance is pretty average, with several hours of moderate projection before it becomes more of a lingering skin scent. This is one you will need to reapply it you're looking for an all-day scent. But so-so performance aside, if you like woody scents you still can't go wrong with this one. I dig it.",09/09/25 08:02,doggymcnuggets
Hero Burberry,"I got a sample of this with my Sephora bday gift which was a mini bottle of Her. I thought it smelled nice, ask my boyfriend if he wanted it & forgot all about it. Tonight we went out to eat and in the car I kept getting powdery, masculine, clean whiffs of something off him. He smelled soooo good. I complimented him and he told me it was this. Will probably be getting him a bottle for Christmas, bc it def suited him well. I think this may be a “boring” option for people who are really into cologne collecting, but it’s a nice gift for guys who just like to smell nice and appreciate a little something nice.

Someone else said it semlls like holister there honestly right smells similar.",06/06/25 13:49,xavier060700
Hero Burberry,A slightly sweet and smooth citrus with a nice touch of cedar. Great for daily wear but shines in high heat weather. The most versatile in the hero line.

This is very similar to DH2020 especially on the drydown where it’s literally just iso e super. I already have the purest form of that in m01 so this would just be redundant DNA for me.

Funny how it doesn't remind people of anything else but other flankers of Hero and Wood&Wood by Issey Miyake. 2000+ votes and only three similar fragrances, I haven't seen anything like that on Fragrantica.

This is one of the only fragrances that I would call truly ""woody"". This is absolutely cedar heavy. So much cedar that it comes off smokey for some reason. But still the performance is underwhelming + I quickly become noseblind to it.

Overall nice woody scent with a fresh spicy accent. 4/5 or maybe 3.8/5",05/04/25 07:06,semyonsemyoff
Hero Burberry,"I just wanted to add context to the other reviews who say this is “generic”. I feel like it might give off those vibes because it is blended so incredibly well. This is actually a positive if you are looking for a very inoffensive, office, or first date friendly fragrance.

I liked the EDT better than the EDP because I felt the EDT was a little closer to the skin. It has a gentle presence that isn’t too old or young. On the one hour dry down, the sweet cedar kinda gives a tonka bean note.",05/02/25 20:36,Wildnectarsantal
Hero Burberry,"Meh. Smells cheaper than Hero Eau de Parfum.

honestly, it’s pretty similar to Hero Eau de Parfum. It’s more like the leaves of a tree, just faintly in the distance, like you're walking through a park with your dog. It’s grassy and, frankly, kind of boring.

It doesn't really smell like a person at all. More like a used leather bag and jeans. It's just kind of there. Flat and uninteresting.",04/19/25 17:04,sagebelknap
Hero Burberry,I did not expect to like it so much. Just wish the performance and longevity were better. Scent bubble pushes for 3-4 hours and then becomes a skin scent.,04/17/25 03:52,302JH
Hero Burberry,I received this as a sample from Sephora. Its starts out with a very strong bergamot note and then quickly fades into a light dusty woody scent which doesnt linger long. This is not a very strong projecting fragrance. It definitely sits close to the skin and leans masculine. It reminds me of a weaker Born in Roma Uomo. Not full bottle worthy in my opinion. This would be a good fragrance for someone who wants a light woody smell.,04/16/25 15:44,Alchemy de Enigma
Hero Burberry,"I bought this fragrance when it first came out. I loved it then and I rebought it and still love it. However, I love the opening. That’s it. The projection and longevity is weak. Which is kind of a shame because the scent profile is incredible. It’s SUPER Bergamot heavy. It’s probably the most bergamot in a fragrance I’ve ever smelled but I really like it. I see how people compare the harsh opening to bug spray, but it kind of tickles your nose in a good way. Overall good everyday grab in the spring/summer time. Wish it lasted longer but great scent profile. 7/10",03/24/25 19:35,Connormaroney

Some might call it boring, but it's anything but, personally I think it's sexy and has character. The first time I wore it I wasn't overly impressed, but what I find is that the more I wear it the more I appreciate it's simplicity and versatility. It's a grower for sure. Performance could be better, but it's not terrible. I get around 5 hours of moderate projection, and moderate silage. Signature scent worthy and a 5 for me.",03/01/25 17:36,Cologneinhaler

Becomes slightly earthy, maybe some leather?
Turns woody/coniferous, then balsamic.
More woods, a little smokiness.
Becomes a pleasing cedar wood skin scent.
As it warms off the skin it has a soapy-apple aroma.

Nothing is too synthetic or low quality, impossible to offend anyone and gets the job done. Great for all seasons in office-daily use, can be bought for very cheap prices; I believe 150ml bottle can be found for 70 usd which is a pretty good deal. Scents like this one, MB explorer, Monclear Pour Homme or Missioni Parfum are amazing all year rounders without smelling just like fresh clean citruses. They have some depth and character in them. Wished it was a little bit stronger tho, doesn't last much longer than 5 hours but projection is satisfying.",02/07/25 01:07,divineintervation1994

Hero Burberry,"Woody bergamot and cedar open Hero. Sweet cedar heated with spice; defanged black pepper. It fills up your olfactories with comfort. I imagine a chest of drawers built by hand by your grandfather. It radiates the care he put into it. This is where the name Hero comes into play for me. While the Adaminotaur swimming around is cool, that hits somewhere nearer maybe the imagery for Musc Ravageur.

Here, Hero brings the thought of one you look up to rather than a savior or a superhero. One who can does things you admire and things you hope one day to be able to do.

The warmth of Hero is somewhere in the neighborhood of Spicebomb or the Night Vision EdT, while staying nearer to the trees rather than all inning the pepper. The sillage is large, even 2 sprays on the back of my hand got attention from a few people 5 feet plus away from me.

Another bit of imagery, which i touched on in my first impressions video, was the image of a stuffed animal lion. A small and favored comfort to a child, the lion also being a heroic figure itself. Maybe one set inside that handmade cedar cupboard in hope its comes to life to be a protector.

A bit into the dry down, a warm apple note tinged with cider cozies up. Autumnal, cedary and dry with walnut, mature.",01/24/25 07:27,jarroditshallbe

It smells woody and spicy but not in a warm terms. It sounds like it’s a basic smell, which it could be but it has something that makes it stand out compared to others in this price range.

Hero Burberry,"I find it interesting that 2 of my most favorite designer scents (this and D&G K EDT) are also 2 of the most hated amongst the fragrance community lol. I love this stuff. Bright with a hint of spice. People say it’s generic but it’s quite unique to my nose. I went back and forth between if I liked this or the EDP more, but I think the EDT is my fav. If I had to strip my 40+ bottle collection (niche, designer, and clones/cheapies) to 10, Burberry Hero EDT would make the cut. Plus my wife likes it on me as well. It’s longevity is it’s only drawback in my opinion. Projects really good for me for maybe an hour and then suddenly turns into a skin scent. I have a dupe roller ball oil that I sometimes wear with it to help.

Edit: The more I smell this, the more generic it gets. It reminds me of the Armani, invictus, saint laurent, zara, legend, jimmy choo, coach, boss, etc odors of the sweeter kind. It's still good, but less unique than I first thought with a sample.",10/05/24 13:08,Turbo

Hero Burberry,"This was ""meh"" to me on intial spray, but, for some reason, I kept wanting to smell it.

After a few days, I realized that this is really good. It's not a heavy or resinous scent, just a lightweight, sweet cedar with a little spice.

Appropriate for just about any occassion or season; it's not sweet to the point of seeming juvenile or dry to the point of smelling overly mature. Longevity and projection are on the lighter side of moderate.

You can get the 100 mL for under $70 right now on discounters, and I think that's fair.

In the end, this went from a ""meh"" to a firm ""like.""",08/28/24 14:11,FragranceAnon
Hero Burberry,"Honestly nothing ground breaking. It’s an inoffensive fragrance that works for any season or occasion. You really cannot go wrong with this one. The projection and longevity is shit, but it’s ok since you can overspray. The bottle really speaks volumes for how creative this fragrance is. You’d be better of buying Versace Dylan blue or Ysl y EDP, but if you’re looking for a yellow ish bottle, get this I guess. Also if you’re new to fragrances and need something that works for everything, maybe get this, but I’d still recommend the previously stated fragrances more. Other than that I would not recommend. Kinda alright I guess.

Hero Burberry,"I'm coming back to this. This has the ""cologne"" smell familiar with the classic masculine fragrances. I really like it. Suitable for more mature men.

Hero Burberry,"IN LOVE WITH THIS! The scent is familiar.. maybe reminiscent of Sauvage? Y? Terre d'Hermes? .... But oh my.. that one is soo simple yet so addicting... It's RAW cedar wood for once.. Barely affected by other notes.. It has a sweet woodiness to it.. enhanced by the non-empowering spiciness of black pepper and the green accord of juniper.. and the bergamot is here for a soft citrusy touch, that balances the woodiness.. This is just.. PERFECT... Not a singular synthetic note to my nose... Smells like hiking in a deep green forest...

Hero Burberry,"Citrusy spicy opening with a warm wood in the background. Definately more for day and warmer months, as it lacks the sweetness and heaviness of notes like leather to make it appropriate for cool weather.
This gives me the same vibes like Sauvage, that is, a spicy bergamot opening with a warm base ( here it is wood instead of amber ). The wood lingers for the drydown, providing a serene, warm, soothing feeling, smelling like cardboard / recycled book pages with tea, peppered with spicyness, sitting close to the skin.
A mild, generic, inoffensive and likeable smell, projection moderate, longevity moderate. For the price I would say not worth it.",07/13/24 00:54,evilherojoseph

Hero Burberry,"I could really see Adam Driver using this. It is masculine to say the least but it also has some kind of sweetnes to it. While it may not be a groundbreaking smell, it is definitely good. This could go nice inbetween 10-22 C°. Nice with an overcoat and a light jacket.
I like Burberry in general and this was something that I expected to be good and it fulfilled my expectations. It has that overcoat-scarf-hat combination kind of smell (by that, I mean it would suit that trio really good). Because it was not groundbreaking, I was really in the middle of a 7 and an 8 and at the end of the day...

Hero Burberry,"People have to understand summer fragrances, some climates are hot and humid and you will be very limited on what you can wear and enjoy, and this definitely won't shine in Switzerland summer, this is needs a Dubai, Bangkok, Indonesia kind of humidity and this will shine, it gives me a cigar humidor vibe not that i am saying it smells like tobacco, this woody with hint of herb, i used to wear the discontinued Dsquard he wood, probably similar scent profile but to my nose Burberry hero EDT is the winner, i have ignored hero because realistically Burberry makes super safe fresh fragrances for the summer, not alot of character in them if that makes sense they are your typical YouTube reviewers safe for likes and views, not this one tho, i don't care about your European beautiful summer breeze wear creed smw or rasasi hawas for that, you live in high humidity climate sample this one, look for 2-3 ml sample give it a try for that humid night out, i have a sample of this, and i do have some nice collection for the humidity this is on my wishlist and will definitely pick up a full bottle",06/14/24 03:49,rolls.oud&cigar

Hero Burberry,"Got this as a sample kit with the 2 flankers as a gift from buying London. Honestly, this is pretty nice. On my skin, it's really weak though.

Hero Burberry,"I honestly think this is a masterpiece. It's a very woody fragrance but with a warm, slightly sweet hint to it. It's masculine but sexy. Youthful but sophisticated. I could wear this all day long, every day. At work, on a date, just lounging round the house... I can't get enough of this smell.
It's perfect for all age ranges too. It's just a great all round classy scent. I've recently bought a few supposedly woody fragrances on my search for a new signature scent. Terre d'Hermes, Dior Homme Sport, MontBlanc Explorer but this is hands down the best of the bunch and as soon as it hit my nostrils, I knew I'd found the one.
Projection and silage is average. It's not beast mode but it's not a poor performer either. It's what I'd expect from this sort of price point and there's nothing stopping you from applying a couple of extras sprays after a few hours if you want to top up the performance.
This gets a perfect 10 from me. It's my new signature scent and is probably the best masculine woody fragrance available today.",04/22/24 10:13,Brett_Sinclair

Hero Burberry,"Bergamot provides a fresh, citrusy aroma, juniper adds a crisp and slightly woody note, while cedar offers a warm, earthy scent. Sets down nicely on the skin and is not too overpowering or masculine.

The combination smells refreshing and comforting, and the fact that i find it unisex highlights its versatility and appeal across genders. A well-balanced and elegant fragrance can certainly be appreciated by anyone! I really like it.",04/10/24 09:21,VanHessen1234
Hero Burberry,"nobody gives burberry hero any recognition, the scent is amazing, its a fresh spicy at first then it develops into a woody cedar scent, its a very pleasant smell that is super underrated, the bergamot note is super nice and smells amazing.
the longevity is about 7-8 hours which is enough to wear to school ( which is mostly what I use it for ), its also fancy enough to use for formal events like business meetings, I preferred to wear it during spring. its projection is kinda mid, it projects well for the first 3 hours but after that it isn't as noticeable.
it costs about 120$ cad for 100ml, not a terrible price but not worth it honestly

Hero Burberry,"Sure, it may be non-complex and fairly simple... but it's a really nice masculine scent. I agree with the reviewer who said it actually ends up being quite unique in its simple goodness. It certainly is versatile. I really like it... although the woodsy vibe isn't my favorite profile overall. Only issue I have is, the performance is unremarkable, while the price is still high compared to other casual frags like Mont Blanc Legend or what have you. So you can overspray it and smell great, but it's a tad pricey for that type of thing. Still... it's an easy everyday reach, so if you like that woodsy profile, go for it.

BTW -- I find using the EDT in the daytime and the EDP in the evening is a great way to go with this.",02/17/24 00:21,bartca89

It’s a fresh, lemony-spicy and tingly opening, then slightly woody, very inviting and „manly“- sweet (just teeny-tiny bit). What’s best is that it doesn’t start to smell „old“ or „worn tor too long“ as I think lots of the gentleman’s perfumes do (like Dior sauvage or gucci guilty etc). In short: Smells like a manly man who just showered and is always in a good mood with a big smile on his face but in a cool, not goofy way",02/15/24 14:12,Filolek3037

My partner loved it and when I was around the house I only sprayed twice and never more than 4. So definitely projected within arms length and smells pleasant. It's rather safe and hits it's stride best on a warmer day. I started to associate this scent with moments in my life I needed to be daring, brave or courageous towards the end of my 100ml bottle and the funny thing is so did the people around me because they've smelt this off my skin for so many years. I created this signature identity around this fragrance which makes me consider picking up the EDP for winter.

Hero Burberry,"This and the EDP are unique. Nothing smells like them. They stand out on any walk through smelling of a departments scents. It's not blue and it's not ambroxan and it's not sweet. This bucks the trend. It doesn't smell like any older or classic scent so it really has potential to create new and unique impressions on people. This stands out. If you smell several scents in a day and also smell this, you will understand. Closely harmonized accords of a gentlemanly and sexy wood, not smoke nor tobacco. Not fresh citrus or sailing scent. This is a sophisticated lumberjacks go to, the homesteading bitcoin investor who home schools his kids and knows self sufficiency and tradition forever trump the worlds cheap plastic values and fake virtue signalling for ""diversity"" and conformity.

There's nothing wrong with this fragrance, really. The only problem is that it's been done a thousand times over and it offers nothing new.

It's more polarising in the community, but at least it's not boring.

At the end of the day, Burberry Hero does its job: makes you smell nice, but that's all it does. It might wow some people who don't know much about men's fragrances but it's completely mediocre to the learned noses. Just like Adam Driver: he acts, and that's all he does.",07/29/23 13:08,washudtoj

Safe, Simple, Cedar

Like all Burberry scents there's nothing out of the ordinary here. You end up with Juniper and Cedar, pleasant, inoffensive, mildly projecting, completely safe for office wear. This is a total snoozer, but the performance is at least middling with a cedar note that will make it to lunch.

Hero Burberry,scent is amazing just wish it could last longer,07/19/23 07:39,lufragrance420
Hero Burberry,"This is a basic but well-executed masculine fragrance. It was designed to sit squarely in the middle of safe market ground. In my mind it's reminiscent of some of the stronger men's colognes from the 1980's and it's appealing to the same type of wearer. Despite its simplicity it does have merit. It opens with a compelling raw bergamot smell, intermingled with juniper berry to give it deeper tone. There isn't much else to it but the wood. It smells good, is unambiguously male, and can be worn by nearly anyone.

The fragrance community might be disappointed by it but there is a good reason this is a best-seller in the US right now. It's a mass market departure from the Blues in a way that does not feel dated. The bottle design and marketing are communicating all of this pretty clearly too. It looks like a golden-hued brick with bold lettering, even moreso than Terre d'Hermes. In an calculating way that clarity makes it stand out even more on a shelf full of gaudy Paco Rabannes.",07/16/23 19:42,BananaXango

Hero by Burberry is like stepping into a fresh cedar forest on a brisk morning.

Hero Burberry,"I think Hero is a great name for this masculine, somewhat warm and powdery, slightly sweet cologne. The notes are simple but very clear. This is a very understated scent that doesn't offer much from afar but up close is very nice.

This could easily be a signature scent and should work for men of all ages, although I do think this would fit a more quiet, understated type of person. 7.5/10 on scent. It does smell nice but nothing I'd go out of my way to smell, yet at the same time it would be a great blind buy. If you consider price then this could easily be an 8 or 8.5/10 scent.

After a couple of months with the sample, I'm bumping my overall score to an 8.5/10. This is just a really great, everyday, casual scent that I could see myself buying one day.",06/30/23 18:03,Psalzarulo
Hero Burberry,"Burberry Hero EDT: A warm, soft, fuzzy, woody frag. Would make a nice gift for a man just entering the fragrance world, but a woman could rock it as well. Not loud, not a whisper, perfect in between. I like it a lot more than Hero EDP. Great job Burberry.",06/28/23 10:48,girldeadbug
Hero Burberry,"Upon first sprays, it doesn't seem like this edt will perform well. While Hero is not a strong fragrance, it does give some sillage and lasts a few hours. If you like woodsy and spicy perfumes like I do, it sure could be a signature/wear anywhere anytime scent, or a good inoffensive work fragrance. You can get 5 oz bottles for great prices",06/27/23 21:48,pilotdc
Hero Burberry,"It's completely fine and wearable for every day.
If the price drops to where other Burberry scents are. ( Like 40 bucks) i can completely understand people making this their signature scent.
Right now i feel that scents like Explorer and Dylan blue will have more of a wow effect for a cheaper price.

In general i personally like to wear something different that makes me stand out and i gladly pay a little more for that so this is not for me.
In a world where everything in a perfume store at least smells nice, this for 70 bucks for a 100 ml is not a great pick up.",06/26/23 06:53,Basman0

Performance is good but not worth the full price. Not an everyday option after real-world use, especially in hot weather. Strong projection fades with moderate longevity",05/17/23 04:25,Parfumpop
Hero Burberry,"I'll first start with a story. Almost 30 years ago, as a high school student, I purchased a cheap Imperial Leather deodorant, a green one. It was a typical fresh masculine fragrance with lots of pine/juniper notes. Well, it proved to be a an absolute magnet for schoolgirls and I often received compliments from them. Mind you, I wasn't a popular guy, so, yeah, that fragrance kind of made me popular :) It wasn't my cup of tea though but I didn't hate it. And actually I thought it smelled more expensive than it really was. I haven't encountered a similar fragrance recently.

Well, I got some samples from a beauty store today, and when I finally sprayed the Burberry Hero on a paper I immediately got those old memories of that Imperial Leather deodorant and all these girls that were mad about it. I don't know whether the Burberry Hero and that Imperial Leather deo are exactly the same, I'm only relying on 30 years of fading memory but I'd say they are in the same ballpark. And while it may sound like comparing the Hero to some cheap deodorant, that was not my idea. It's a very nice and masculine fragrance that you can't go wrong with. It's not one of those masterpieces that everybody talks about, it's also not one of these polarizing fragrances that people love or hate. It's just a very nice, above average quality, well-crafted and safe fragrance with old school hints (no pun intended), fresh, manly, assertive but not overpowering. I'm not sure I would purchase it and I will have to demo it to my wife and see whether she would act as a teenage schoolgirl (pun intended).",05/17/23 03:58,CyberGene
Hero Burberry,"Got this as a small sample, and from the first sniff off the atomizer I thought - nice! I like the woodiness of this, with a lot of cedar. It's the note I like in other perfumes, plus juniper is ingredient for gin, my favourite spirit. Pleasant smell, but I have to say that I can't pick it up from my clother after few hours, it could last longer.
I still need to compare this one to EDP I also have for tests, but I believe the notes are slightly different as well.",05/16/23 23:29,czajnik
Hero Burberry,"Hero is manly, woody, and fresh. No sweetness or something horribly chemical here. Mr. Guichard's professional hand can be detected in this product. And though the fragrance is not particularly distinctive it is indeed very ""nice"". It lasts some 6/7 hours and projects discreetly. It is a very ""professional"" office scent. Is it bad? Not at all: it does very well what it has been designed to do. Is it particularly memorable? Certainly not. Try it.",05/13/23 19:13,Palosanto

Hero Burberry,"Hero EDT is clearly very spicy and woodsy and it's same characteristics stay until the end. However, it's not new smell. I find it very close to Dior Savage. Someone who doesn't want to spend 100$ to test this one can buy Ajmal Kuro (also a clone of Dior Savage). It's about 85% clone of Hero with super beast mode projection and longevity. It will be available at around 20$ or so. Hero is not worth the price I feel and also the blend is not that great. I would rate it 5.",05/09/23 10:08,hiteshvs
Hero Burberry,"Very woodsy, very fresh, very nonoffensive, but also very generic. It’s not a bad scent, but you’ve probably smelt something very similar before in other popular fragrance.

I haven’t really seen this comparison before, but it kind of reminds me of LNDL by YSL. I think it’s the bergamot/cedar with a hint of spiciness that makes these scents pretty similar. But LNDL smells way more sexy/interesting/delicious than Hero. Hero kind of smells like LNDL’s depressed younger brother, haha.

Overall not too bad. Not really interested in buying a decant/bottle, but I can see how this can appeal to some. It’s a great office fragrance due to it being nonoffensive, clean and manly. But it doesn’t wow me a whole lot.",05/03/23 16:51,LOUDPACK

Hero Burberry,"In two words: Quality, Understated. It's not challenging or head turning, rather its understated and mass appealing. Making it great for the office and daily use. The minimalist bottle allows you to really appreciate the little details. It exudes quality, very heavy and solid feeling in the hand and the weighty magnetic top adds to that. The color contrasted atomizer is really good, maybe amongst the best, which is a good thing because you will need quite a few sprays of this to have it project and last. The fragrance notes do not contrast or change over time, rather they merge into one singular understated olfactory experience which is a fresh yet dark wood. Its smells familiar and comforting but you can never quite put your finger on what it is which is what keeps drawing you back for more.",01/25/23 17:39,bashar11

Hero Burberry,"I really like this! Sure, it's nothing ground-breaking, but it's probably my most worn fragrance. Super mass-appealing and its simplicity is what makes it great IMO. It's like every male fragrance mixed together. It's citrusy, woodsy, metallic, musky, fresh, and aquatic all at the same time. Opening is great but the dry-down is fantastic- a super clean smelling, slightly soapy citrus which I really love. I dont really think it's ""dated"" as many say. Just an all around great fragrance that's an easy reach. Only complaint is the longevity but it does its job. I get like a solid 6 hours with this usually. 8/10",01/07/23 21:40,enzoespin

With that being said this stuff smells absolutley fantastic and is super mass appealing but the probelm is that it is just sooo weak.

It's clean, it smells good, but in a clean and smells good way that reminds me of slightly above average room air freshener with random sky blue packaging like Febreeze. How pathetically weak it is + the slight soapiness also contributes to this air freshener feel.

Nothing special about this at all, no twist, no mystery note that keeps you coming back for more.

It is totally devoid of personality and completely unmemorable. Your life would be exactly the same if you have or have not smelt this fragrance. Just pass on it and spend your money elsewhere.",12/19/22 11:27,doodluv
Hero Burberry,"Simple scent but absolutely beautiful imo. I love crisp, airy, masculine fragrances and this is just that. The note breakdown is a simple and fairly accurate description of what you are getting with this one. Fresh woods, clean/airy juniper with a touch of bergamot and pepper. There is a very slight soapiness to the scent. Even though it is not listed, I would assume there is a lavender note in here. Perhaps the overall scent could be described as a simpler, smoother, far more wearable version of Santal 33. The scent is extremely versatile - casual to formal, warm or cold- it’s a modern masculine scent that just works. Love this one, just wish performance was better. Will need to overspray for this to last more than 3hrs.",12/17/22 09:17,Rafrosa

It may not pull as much attention as some of you off-color suits, but it does what it is supposed to and it does it very well.

The scent has a very familiar/generic fresh & herbaceous opening which is why I believe this fragrance doesn’t get much attention. While nothing jumps out at you in the opening, the magic happens when the melon and aquatic notes emerge in the dry down. The dry down is absolutely beautiful and one that will get you plenty of compliments.

This is not your typical, youthful, fruity summer scent (Nautical Voyage, etc), but rather a classy, fresh/aquatic, masculine summer fragrance that may be your best blind grab in hot weather. Essentially, this smells like a melon-infused Versace Pour Homme

Because like other aquatics scents this is not blue or oceanic. This one little melony and bit aquatic, it is a best blend for both. For those who like aquatic and fresh scents and like to try bit different I recommend this. But this is not for someone who expects a aventus or a tom ford style fragrances. This is a simple non complex scent and does its job of what it says. You will smell like you just splashed from a pond or a river. It lasts just like any other fresh scents.

Burberry Brit Splash for Men Burberry,"“Saltier. Woodier. AdG”

For my review I will be using AdG as a comparison. It saves me from having to talk about notes.

I think if you are an AdG purist you might not like this juice. I think for some people AdG is the classic fresh aquatic for men and that’s ok. However, this is perhaps what a younger AdG fan would wear at the beach. To my nose there is less lemon/citrus and more woods in here. Despite that I get a saltier note that reminds me of the ocean. Wearing it I get average projection and performance on this one. For a designer cologne I got this at an average price (~$40). Pack this one if you’re headed to the beach.

Verdict:
7.5/10 - Functions for me as a beachier flanker of AdG. While not original, it’s a better than average scent with decent projection and silliage. Price is average to below average. Safe blind buy. I’ve had my bottle a year and it’s half empty. Haven’t thought about repurchasing yet.",07/28/18 10:17,smellyoul8ter

Burberry Brit Splash for Men Burberry,"I have a sample of Burberry Brit Splash for Men and I must say the full sized bottle is easily redundant. If you have any number of Acqua di Gio scents including but not limited to most Acqua di Gio flankers, Michael Jordan 23, Perry Ellis 360 Red (for men), Zegna Uomo, Liz Claiborne Curve Appeal or even Usher He, then Burberry Brit Splash is a fragrance you can skip on.

I find that Brit Splash is a very light but melon heavy Acqua di Gio style aquatic. It lasts about 5 hours tops with an hour or so of soft to medium projection before becoming a total skin scent. It is entirely generic and unless you go to online retailers, you will find it highly over-priced for what you get, especially when you compare it to comparable scents that do what this does but actually better. Michael Jordan 23 is about the same note wise and is much cheaper for about the same sizes and gives the same performance.

I would rate Burberry Brit Splash a 6.0 out of 10. Why, it isn't strong and is a dime-a-dozen scent that is sold often for inflated prices. If you don't have any Acqua di Gio style scents including clones like Perferred Fragrance H2O or Belcam Geau, maybe this is a buy, but only if you can find it discounted.

No, but I don't wear any everyday. I'd put it in the rotation during those seasons though. I think it's easy to like. Does it last forever? Maybe not, but it lasts though. You know, I don't understand why people get so caught up with projection, that it has to fill up a friggin room. Too much is just too much. It makes a great fragrance offensive, you become ""that guy"" to everyone. I think a lot of the haters on here are ""those guys.""

He loves its comfortingly autumnal vibe: warm, spicy, smokey and earthy; it feels to me like a sitting on big black tyres by the campfire on a chilly night in the pine forest with a dram of whisky shared with your best friend. Reflective memories....

Midnight Journey Burberry,"#987 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""
First off, this smells nothing like Bvlgari ""Orom."" It resembles Joop ""Absolute"" insofar as myrrh comes across like an incense note. But there's really nothing out there that I've run into in my explorations that really matches up with this, and for me uniqueness counts a lot. The myrrh is really strong in this, and I love myrrh. But the Burberry Signatures Collection you have to order directly from Burberry and it's not cheap. $295. If you're a man, before dropping that kind of green, you should first get Amouage ""Boundless."" You can find it for $170. The overall note combination is more masculine, and it combines myrrh and incense. So for this kind of scent I think it's a better overall choice for the guys.

That said, this scent performs, no doubt about it. And it definitely get's noticed. Can't imagine anyone being disappointed with longevity and sillage. It's not office wear. Dates maybe, formal occasions definitely. I like it enough and it's unique enough that I would order a bottle for my collection if I thought I'd have occasion to wear it. But I'm no longer seeing the classical pianist for whom I got a symphony series subscription, and that was the only formal event I attended regularly. And I have a couple hundred other acquisitions on my list. So this can wait.",11/27/24 07:39,JusttheFactsMan
Midnight Journey Burberry,"Similar to Joop Homme Absolute - it shares the pepper and smooth woods (similar wood accord as CdG Wonderoud, too) and cool green feel, but this has less of the creamy/smoothness of Joop Absolute, here being more spiced with a dry and almost cool/minty green thyme and smooth earthy ginger. I get a hint of cumin and there's a good and rich, natural vanillic base. The lavender and especially the rose is primarily here just to smooth things out - the rose does take center stage briefly in the mid dry down, especially if your skin heats up. Thisnrose accord smells like a baby wipe, and that's not a bad thing to my nose. Over the cool green woody aromatic base it pulls the fragrance towards fougere category. Mostly the rose functions like the rose in Memoir Man, a glue to bond and smooth the notes together.

It smells a bit like Memoir too, even sharing a bit of cool green minty wormwood effect, but it doesn't have the liquorice notes. It stays greener, simpler, and again leaning more classically fougere.

Other points of reference are Andrea Mack Coven (share some greenness, though no clove here and less earthy overall), and the aforementioned Joop Homme Absolute and Wonderoud. They all share black pepper and some smooth, velvety wood synthetic (pashminol?). Whatever that chemical is I absolutely love it. I'd recommend just going with the Joop for most, it's far less expensive and has more of a creaminess in its florals that probably makes it more mass appealing. This is drier but more elegant - it doesn't try as hard to please as Joop and thus registers as more mature.

One last point of reference is Guichards very own Bleu Turquoise for Armani. The way Guichard combined the incense, black pepper and vanilla into the core accord of that scent is identifiable here, too. The rest of the drapings are completely different so the scents don't really smell alike, but that smooth and sweet peppery richness is here too, this time in shades of purple and green. Bleu Turquoise? No, this time it's Mysterious Alexandrite.",09/25/23 19:52,SculptureOfSoul

Burberry Summer Women 2009 Burberry,"I'm with missk on this one. I was to get another bottle of the 2007 edition of Burberry Summer, but they sent me this instead. It was a surprise, but I wasn't disappointed.
It starts a lot fruitier than the older edition. Rarely can I tell prety much all the notes in a perfume but this was the case. A light burst of mandarine, followed by a fruity mix of red currant and grape (riesling as the olfactive piramid on the bottle says). The cassis, the grape and litchi blend really well giving the perfume this sour sweet berry smell that lingers on through the middle and base notes. Slowly the flowers show up and mellow the citrus and the fruits, while the cedar of the base blends with the musk to give it something of a greenish (mint/moss-like to me) nuance sometimes even from the start.I still have a few drops left of the other bottle and I can tell they share the same powdery, a bit green quality in the drydown wich I happen to enjoy.
The lasting power of the 2009 edition is better on me and hot weather gives its contribution to the delicate sillage. Actually it's one of the few frags that I can tolerate in the blistering heat (I think we got over 40C at noon!).What I've noticed with both fragrances is that when I can't smell them anymore, others still can. I've been wearing this for only two days and got complimented by friends and colleagues near me.It's very well done so it sits smoothly on the skin for hours. It's just what I need for summer: a light but still present and unique enough fragrance that I can enjoy every day without actually smelling like a chemical fruit syrup. Surprisingly, I got plenty of compliments on it, same thing with the 2007 edition (someone said it smells tempting - bergamote and freesia, go figure:D)",07/26/10 00:06,LuluCoconut

Burberry Summer Women 2009 Burberry,Not for me. It smells kind of synthetic and cologne-like along the lines of CK 1 but not exactly.

Burberry Summer Women 2009 Burberry,"Burberry Summer '09 is a lot fruitier and fresher than its predecessor.

While this version maintains the pretty floral notes found in the original, the added notes of litchi, mandarin orange and red currant gives this fragrance so much more character. Crisp yet delicate, I find this fragrance much better suited to hot climates.

I tested this fragrance on a relatively humid day in the city and I'll admit that I felt very refreshed simply by wearing this scent. Rather than being sharp or potently fruity, Burberry Summer '09 sits smoothly on the skin and never feels too sticky.

It is a perfect balance of fruits, florals and woodsy notes. The cedar and sandalwood in the base notes has an almost clean, soapy quality which rounds the scent off nicely.

So far this would be my choice if I had to choose a Summer scent from the Burberry line.",11/20/09 00:16,missk

I am mostly a gourmand lover, but this fragrance is just so lovely that I can't help but adore it. On my skin and to my nose, it smells like lemons, peony, and rain on the pavement. It smells really fresh and clean. It reminds of Acqua di Gioia as well as Air di Gioia. I think if you sprayed both you would get something similar to Her London Dream (Acqua has lemon, Air has peony). It has a cologney note so it could easily be unisex and may come off as masculine to some people. I live in a hot climate and it is working well in this weather. I think it is a spring and summer scent. It seems to sit closer to the skin. I will be buying the full bottle. Love it!",10/08/25 13:55,summervanilla

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I have a very refined sense of smell and taste. Now, flavours and fragrances can absolutely be subjective, but in my experience, this perfume has been a BIG disappointment to me.
I am a huge fan of Burberry Her, and I am also exploring the other versions of it. Impressive how many there are. As soon as I wore this perfume, I realised it was a big mistake, and I wanted to wash it off my body immediately, but I couldn't, I was already out, and had to endure this smell all day long.
Let me try to explain what this smells like.
At the very beginning, as soon as you spray it on yourself, it gives you a very brief illusion that they nailed it again. Wrong. That's until it dries on your skin and you start noticing that it's changing. It slowly but not that slowly turns into a perfume that smells cheap and bought from Poundland for a few quid. I hated wearing it. It did stick to my skin for quite a long time, so I had to smell something I disliked so much for hours and hours, blending with my skin's pH. I honestly don't recommend this perfume. I know that there are plenty of people who like it, and that's ok too. However, in my opinion, there must have been an unusual mix of notes resulting in an unexpected fragrance that comes out only a bit after spraying it. I could have been the ginger, I suppose. Hard no for me. Invest in Burberry her, the regualr one, Eau the Perfume.",06/26/25 02:15,melindalaconca

Likewise I don't smell any tea in this fragrance. On the whole it just has a murky, ambiguous Arnie Palmer vibe. I do smell ginger, which gives it a little spice and enhances the lemon, and I also smell a nice sweetened amber in the drydown.

Generally speaking, Burberry perfumes are not inexpensive, but this one really lasts, has a fairly strong sillage, and it is NOTICEABLE. I wore it for a day and kept getting so many complements.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"This one is a head scratcher, as it shares none of the recognizable Her DNA that one finds in the EDP, EDT, and Intense. When I saw the name, I wondered if Burberry was going for a mix of London and Her. Since I like London but find the floral sometimes a bit screechy, I was intrigued by the idea of a “Herifying” London. But not to be.

I get a ginger musk, with a peony-floral supporting note. After seeing lemon listed as one of the notes, I can tell it’s there (although this might just be the power of suggestion).

I got this as part of a sampler set with Her EDP, EDT, and Elixir—London Dream was the wildcard, and I would have bought it for the other three regardless. But as much as I like the others, the floral-ginger-musk scent here really isn’t working for me, sadly.",08/05/24 09:15,13DelanceySt
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Skin test. winter.
So I don't agree with with I'm hearing online about online about scent, I don't think it is a cleaner type scent (if so, a flipping nice one!).
I got a gentle but bright floral fresh scent, not incredibly ginger or lemony (but they are there) nothing like the Hermes ginger (which I find horrific) and not at all like the Chloe nomade (which feels like a totally different scent).

I get a more fresher type, a touch of woods, clean, a smidgen dry, a pinch of ginger, and a few drops of lemon.
Really nothing like the really lemony scents out there.

I'm disappointed on the longevity, it goes a bit flat on me too. I got a lovely half hour or so and it waned from there to not much at 3-4 hrs.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Burberry Her London Dream is quite different to the original fragrance and is less sweet, which may be more appealing for some.

This flanker opens with a sweet, feminine blend of rose and peony. The rose accord in this fragrance is bright, effervescent and lemony with a dash of ginger. The composition overall is a crisp, Spring-like floral with less sweetness than its predecessor. Burberry Her London Dream dries down into a smooth white musk with a hint of amber, that smells more like ambroxan on my skin.

The ginger note in this fragrance brings to mind ginger ale, and whilst this accord is not overpowering, it adds a slightly edgy tone to this flanker. If I were to compare the original Burberry Her EDP to Burberry Her London Dream, this flanker is her edgy, tomboy little sister.

Unfortunately, most fragrances containing a dominant peony accord react poorly on my skin, further amplifying the tart, sometimes sharp aspects of this note. This flanker smells like ginger scented vinegar on my skin, so adding this fragrance to my collection is a definite no from me.

The sillage was moderate and the longevity average, lasting approximately 5-hours on warm skin. It's not a stand-out from the Burberry line, but it is an incredibly pleasant citrusy rose which would suit warmer climates.",07/06/24 22:29,missk
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Reading all these reviews for London Dream Burberry Her and I've come to the conclusion that I'm extremely lucky in how this fragrance suits my skin chemistry.
London Dream opens up with a blast of Lemon and ginger with the rose and peony in the background against a smidge of ambery musk, but after 30 minutes and it's all rosy amber and musk with hints of the other notes, after two hours and the fragrance reaches its final phase which is just this amazing Amber musk with something earthy and floral beneath it, it smells otherworldly at this point and it stays on my skin in this phase for the next 10 hours with good projection around me, and by like the 12th hour it's a skin scent, but it's still noticeable if someone hugs me.
I seriously don't know what magic Burberry did here for such a fresh fragrance to last over 12 hours on my skin, but I'm here for it.
Compliments pour in whenever I use this scent, and despite it being a woman's perfume, on my skin the scent becomes quite unisex, it's a fresh floral musk amber scent and I love it.
9/10
I dont care that it's marketed for woman I'm going to rock this as long as Burberry keeps making it.",06/02/24 10:33,Myentherin Govender 38
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"London Dream has been my go to scent for years now. It’s more of an everyday wear perfume which I enjoy, great for after a shower on a day out. It carries that sophisticated smell with for me the Rose being the star and after a few minutes the musk and amber settles in so nicely. The zest of ginger and lemon goes away a bit quickly for me. If you love the floral but not too powdery and has warmth this is the one for you. I can’t give this one up!",05/06/24 07:15,chloeburgos1
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"The weather has warmed up and this fragrance is softer and sweeter, much much better than it was in the cold winter weather. It was way too sharp and citrusy in the cold weather but it’s been 55 degrees Fahrenheit and it’s much nicer now. I thought it was the dry down of Pink sugar lolli pink but it’s London dream 💗 I love it now",05/01/24 21:38,Gemsense
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Burberry Her London Dream to my nose is a fresh, citrusy, powdery, and musky floral fragrance. It smells like a youthful, fresher, and lighter version of Twilly d'Hermes Eau Ginger. (I find all Hermes perfumes too mature and strong.)

Ginger in a fragrance is not what I usually go for. But when I tested both perfumes, Her London Dream spoke more to me even with just moderate projection and longevity. Actually, I used to smell this type of fragrance from older people back in the day. But to my nose, Her London Dream was tweaked to smell younger and trendy. Overspraying this however brings out that mature vibe so I avoid doing that.

Some days I like this but some days I don't. With that said, I'm just going to enjoy my bottle until its empty. 😊",04/25/24 01:45,jdluvz

I’m on my 3rd bottle of Her Blossom and my 3rd bottle of Burberry Goddess. I’m not a fan of Burberry Her or Og Burberry, and not a fan of London Dream now either.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"This is a very perfumy-perfume and a very typical designer fragrance. It's not bad but not that good either, it's ok. Nice office scent, not offensive at all. I like the lemon and ginger opening and dries down on my skin slightly sweet. Doesn't last at all, I would say 2-3 hours then becomes skin scent. This smells nothing like the original Burberry Her so if you don't like that fragrance because of its sweetness then you might like this one as this leans more unisex in my opinion.",03/04/24 11:11,Smellywaterlover

The sillage and longevity are not the best but the great thing about this fragrance is that it is not offensive at all, because it’s so clean smelling — you can wear this anywhere that you want to wear perfume but may be alittle apprehensive because you don’t wanna offend people with sensitivities : I.E a plane or office. I’ll throw this out there too, great fragrance for that time of the month also as our sense of smells are thrown off. My favorite fragrance from the Her line, easily.",02/07/24 15:45,haus0fXI
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"gorgeous gorgeous scent -- even more on paper. I wish it smelled as good on the skin as it did on the paper but I really like it nevertheless.
On my skin I find the sharp beautiful brightness doesnt last as long.. instead it evaporates shortly and the dry down gives me a ginger scent combined with a powdery skin scent closer to L'air du temps.

I love to wear this fresh out the shower because it makes me smell extra clean.",01/14/24 10:50,Sarra816
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I don't like the original Her and I love this. Spicy fresh opening dries down to a soft rose within a few minutes. Sillage and longevity aren't amazing but for the office I do prefer that so I don't overpower anyone.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,I regret buying this! It definitely smelled better in the store and on paper. Opening is so sharp and it doesn't grow on you and the smell doesn't get better on the skin after some time. I have a full sized bottle unfortunately...now I'm experimenting with layering...so far it's more bare-able when layered with Gardenia from Zara. Don't buy it!,10/22/23 15:45,MTK82
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Burberry Her London Dream is my default work fragrance. The bite of ginger and the sweetness of peony give this fragrance a fresh 'morning' feeling. The musk makes it warm and inviting. To my nose, this is a fresh, citrus, musky delight. I do overspray to increase the sillage but it does not bother others. On the contrary, I receive compliments on this fragrance every time I wear it. It's such an easy reach and the price point is reasonable. Although I do gravitate toward niche fragrances, Burberry Her London Dream meets all of my daily scent needs.",10/21/23 09:22,kirpope
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,This was the least favorite of Her and flankers I’ve tried. It lost the fruity part of Her that is delicious and became floral heavy. I personally am not a big floral fan so this to me was like a bathroom air freshener due to the lemon/ginger mixing with the floral notes. I gave it to my coworker and she fell in love (granted she never smelled any of the Her scents before) and it absolutely radiated from her when I walked by her in the hall. So I can see it working well for others,09/02/23 20:35,QueOndaGuera
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I love this perfume with a passion. It's insanely addictive to me!

Nothing like the original Burberry Her. I dislike the orig. Burberry Her but this one, Burberry Her London Dream, is absolutely lovely.

A newly bloomed rose with morning dew on it, fragrant peony and a slightly soapy undertone. Ah! Beautiful.

Very bright and refreshing but not in a sharp or citrussy way. So addictive I start to crave it. I tested this in the store and I wasn't going to buy a new perfume for a while but after trying it I couldn't get it off my mind and had to order it the same day.

I don't think the beige bottle really suits the vibe of this perfume well, I think it should be another pretty pastel color like the EdP and EdT Burberry Her bottles have.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Not an unpleasant scent overall but it has a somewhat disjointed feel to it. The base notes smell similar to the original Burberry Her EDP but the ginger and lemon feel completely detached. It is very clean and subtle, it has moderate projection and longevity but it's never terribly strong. I'm not typically one to assign ages to fragrances but London Dream does feel very 'young'.",05/19/23 07:34,bloodorangesoda
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I saw this perfume sold for a very discounted price (60$CAD for 50ml) so I blind bought it. Burberry perfumes are a bit difficult for me but I like this one. It does remind me a bit of Olympea, I think it's the fresh-but-warm general feel of it, although London dream is creamier than Olympea.
It's not groundbreaking, it doesn't have monster sillage (unless you overspray), it's not incredibly sexy, it's not too floral, not too sweet...
But it is a simple, nice, well blended, easy to wear perfume that you reach for when you have no clue what to wear that morning but you want to just smell good without being offensive. Perfect for the office, people at any age can wear this easily too.
A nice mix of ginger, musk and a bit of flowers. I like it.",05/04/23 17:19,Gypsy French
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I thought I would have left a review on this but I went through them and I don’t think I did, strange because I LOVE LOVE LOVE this perfume. I had once got the viva box from SDM a few xmas’s ago and got the original Burberry Her and I don’t know why I had exchanged the coupon for the full size because I hated it lol so I went and smelled the rest of the line and I love the fresh smell of this. Fresh perfumes are my vibe and this is right up there with my fav coach poppy flower , very close second to that. If you like fresh scents like straight out do the shower than you’ll love this. If you like the original Her you will likely not like this. Her Blossom is also nice, but that’s more floral and this is clean zesty fresh.",04/26/23 08:36,Dort0625
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I like this zesty sweet fragrance due to the strong ginger note. However it's what I wear when I have a boring outfit on because it doesn't fit a particular mood for me. I bought a travel size of it and only have a few sprays left. I don't see myself getting a full bottle of London Dream unless I start missing it.

For a lemon and musk fragrance, I much prefer Yellow Dream. For a ginger kick, I much prefer White Tea Ginger Lily. However, this does smell really nice!",04/13/23 07:29,Susi.312
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Warm floral with citrus punch. Not fresh in my opinion actually can give a headache when over sprayed, but when used right very beautiful winter/autumn scent.
Used it a lot this winter. Very comforting and as I mentioned before there’s something warming about it (mostly because of ginger). The only actually interesting her IMO.
PS the only problem it doesn’t last more than 2 hours. Not on anyone, but this problem of all “her”s.",02/22/23 14:26,Barbarossa
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"London Dream is nice but very perfumey and unimaginative. The lemon and musk make for a smooth, clean blend. I can’t really think of who would wear this though. It’s hard to describe. Boring is the first word I think of, but I also can’t see a boring person wearing this because… it has a little bit of personality I guess? The lemon and the peony is its saving grace. The longer I have it on the more I think it’s not terrible (the amber emerging?) but still, not a must-have. If you like clean fragrances, give it a sniff, you might really like it.",02/06/23 14:08,girldeadbug

But If your sensitive to fragrance and want a light, fresh, summer scent, then this is most def is 100% for you. I suggest sampling 1st if you can though.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Burberry Her and Her London Dream are definetely different scents but when I sniff Her London Dream from the air the smell is OG-like.

For comparison: Her London Dream is the watered down and less fruity, cleaner version of Her Edt. Edt is the transition between the OG and London Dream in terms of intensity.

Overall I love the scent but I wish I didn't go noseblind to it after 30 minutes. As others mentioned it is office friendly and the perfect work fragrance for me. Clean but neither like a plain bar of soap nor a shampoo. I agree with the review that said this smells like luxury hotel sheets.

I already appreciate the fragrance but I am pretty sure that more sensitive and trained noses would appreciate it more.

I am very surprised about how its perfumers formulated Burberry Her London Dream to have a fresh and light opening without any single trace of the dense ambery floral during the heart and base notes.

There is more to it than it seems. Definetely deserves more hype but I decide to gatekeep it.

update: I adore this scent. It’s my favorite out of the Burberry Her line. Gingery & lemony rose but the peony makes it a little sweet. It also lasts pretty long.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I tried this in a Sephora sampler in the fall, and although it didn’t stand out enough to use my scent certificate on, it was memorable enough for me to buy a travel rollerball of it later. I’m trying this again on a gorgeous day, it feels like spring and this scent is just so clean and perfect. I really love the lemony ginger top notes, and the soft beautiful floral heart. The musk and amber base notes are present through the whole performance. I feel like once the top notes fade away, you can smell the peony and base notes all playing together, I don’t really pick up the rose, but they’re having a lovely time. The drydown is a little powdery but not overly so. This isn’t a groundbreaking scent, and it’s a like rather than a love, hence me not buying a full bottle, but it really is an easy reach for a sunny spring day. I don’t usually go for something so musky, but the amber note rounds it off beautifully, making it more wearable for me and less “old lady-like”.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"This is quite inoffensive and is essentially what you would expect it to be from reading the notes on here. A little fresh, a bit zingy from the addition of ginger, softly floral and cleanly musky. The lemon in the opening is very nice! 

I realize people dislike the word ""generic"" (people hate everything lately, I give up), but this really is and I believe it's a decent way to describe it. Still, there's nothing wrong with that sometimes, and it's absolutely OK to have an easy-reach. For instance, I wore this to church this morning and it's nice for situations like that.

I can see how people are saying it's unisex, but I do think peony tips it into a femme trajectory as it dries (I don't care, wear whatever you like, the gender thing is asinine). Peony is listed as a heart note usually, but I personally always find that it endures and becomes a base element too.

This fades into the intimate musky drydown pretty quickly (rapidly develops), and stays that way for a few hours before becoming a true skin scent. It's summery and pleasant.",02/06/22 11:59,ShadowsofLight

The dry down (at least on my skin) smells just like the opening of Gucci Envy Me which I adore so much. It's clean, bubbly, and playful.",11/02/21 14:48,megkaybeee
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Smells like original her, but more lemony . Nothing special . Too floral",10/02/21 11:42,Mariyamokshina
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Not the typical Burberry Her. It lasts really long on me. Around 6hrs on my skin and days on clothes!!! Sillage and projection is moderate. If you spray like 6-8 times projection could be beast. This starts off fresh and kinda unisex but it turns more feminine after a few minutues. Then this turns sweet and powdery as its base but there still its freshness into it, probably the ginger and lemon is still a little bit in the background. I love this. For me this is not soapy. It doesn't smell like generic for me too. I smelled a lot and owned several perfumes, and this really is designer quality. Perfumes nowadays are gourmand, I love how different this is from gourmand, for a change. It has depth and I like how balanced the citrusy freshness, floral and sweet it is. This is love at first sniff for me. I tried this at the mall and I thought at first that this is the OG because for me this has the OG qualities and the OG being the flanker, but I was wrong. This is stronger, fresher and more long lasting than the OG. I love both Burberry Her and London dream but, I'd choose this over the other. 💖",09/19/21 21:00,pink_cloe_angel
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"This is one of those fragrances that kinda smells different as it dries and fades away. It starts as a bright scent, with strong notes of ginger and lemon, then once it is dried, it smells more of peony and lemon with notes of rose, and by the time it is fading, it smells faintly of white floral and of musk. It is fairly feminine, and it is warm yet fresh too.

The performance is not the greatest, but good enough for the value. It has an intimate-to-moderate trail and lasts for about 3-5 hours.

7/10. Great zesty and gingery scent, performance isn't the best but it's not too bad either.",09/16/21 07:44,JessVanEgg
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I wear this almost every day. It goes on bright and zesty, but begins to dry down to a powdery floral, and in the end it’s a straight up unisex musk. It doesn’t project much at all, and since I live with somebody with chronic migraines and allergies, that works out very well for me. This is also a great layering perfume to any scent that needs a bright lift, but I love it so much that I often wear it alone. This is great for the office, the classroom, or anywhere else you need a practical, versatile, won’t-trigger-headaches-in-anyone scent.",08/19/21 07:36,rosebudhoney
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Lovely fresh, easy to wear scent. Perfect for the office. Like others have observed, it doesn’t last a terribly long time, enabling respraying or switching to a new scent halfway through the day.",08/16/21 10:13,JenPin5
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,To me it just smells like an ok soap. Definitely not remotely close to the original Her. Just a rose peony soap,07/29/21 04:26,Bombalurina
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"This is so generic and meh- it smells like an adidas perfume I had as a teenager in the 90's back when adidas didn't really do perfume. A generic boring floral that smells nothing like Burberry Her, which I own and find quite special. Why it's called Her and put in the same bottle as if it's intended as a flanker I have no idea.",07/15/21 15:51,natalia6032
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Fresh, a little sweet and perfectly pleasant.

The opening blast for me is warm amber, fizzy lemon and light florals. I get the musk and ginger in the dropdown, but it fades really quickly on me. I don't think this flanker has much to do with the original though, they don't compare at all. When I first sprayed this, I imagine I'm sat outside in a linen sundress sipping a light, fruity tea, the breeze carries the scent of laundery detergent from the clothes and whe washing line and cut roses.

Is this groundbreaking by any means? No. I also think the bottle doesn't really match the juice. This perfume reminds me of a light, breezy summer scent. Reminds me of an Eternity Summer flanker, but I can't for the life of me remember which one.

Overall, London Dream is a pleasant, easy scent that's effortless to wear. I like it, but I wouldn't purchase a full bottle.",07/14/21 05:27,Jasmindee
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"This one is pleasant. It’s the least like Her, and most like Her Blossom. There isn’t any of that salty beach accord that is in Her. The initial freshness from the ginger and lemon goes away in about 5 minutes leaving a pretty cozy light floral. If rose is in here, I can’t detect it on its own. Maybe ever so slightly peony. But for the most part it’s an unrecognizable light floral with an Amber musk that stays for 3 hours. I actually appreciate that as re-spraying gives that freshness again, or it allows me to put on something else entirely. I really want to try Her Intense.",07/08/21 16:58,Miss.Tara
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,This goes great in California weather it was 113 degrees out the other day and it made me fell super fresh. This is now my go to on super hot days,06/29/21 07:29,Sheflynolie
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I absolutely LOVED this perfume when I smelled it in Sephora. I immediately got this citrusy, gingery, borderline gender neutral laundry fresh musk. It just smelled like a person who smells really, really good. You know? It seemed like the perfect scent for a more androgynous woman like me. Unfortunately, when I took it home and tried it out on myself, I was way less impressed. It definitely smells better on paper than on skin, and pulled way more feminine on me (maybe I’d gone a little nose blind while going thru samples at Sephora? No idea why I originally thought it was a little masculine). While the opening was still beautiful and very likable, it rapidly faded into this really boring, average joe, could-be-any-old-perfume generic floral. I kept trying it hoping it would grow on me, but it didn’t. I ended up returning it. I’m bummed that it didn’t work out, for a second I thought I’d found my signature! I’d recommend this for, like, someone’s nice mom or as an inoffensive first perfume for a teenager.",06/26/21 13:20,Unklejazz
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"A fresh opening but immediately lots of floral too. When I sprayed this I thought Gucci Flora! They share the citrus/peony/rose and smell very similar. This one is a bit softer and sweeter, but low projection and sillage.",05/03/21 11:39,fyetan
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Enjoying this! It is one of very few peony have frags that I can get on board with. I was kinda hoping it would smell like a ginger lemonade, but it doesn't. It is still very nice, clean, and those notes are detectable! I could see this being someone's signature very easily. It doesn't speak to me in that way, but I can't really imagine a situation where it wouldn't fit and be appropriate to wear. A fairly unique, versatile, easy grab.",04/23/21 09:42,kasey_skywalker

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I agree with DarlingNikki and Kai_11 - this an odd one and I have had conflicting feelings on it. I've decided that on my skin it can have a salty sweet feeling - similar to Olympēa but it can change depending on the climate/weather/humidity.
For me, I can tolerate it better on my clothes rather than my skin, it smells sweeter that way and less masculine. It is an OK scent, I like the fresh vibes from the lemon and peony whilst the spice from the ginger is ok. I wouldn't blind buy and I won't be repurchasing after I try and empty the 50ml bottle I have .",04/02/21 05:17,ME.fragrance
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I think DarlingNikki said it, but this one is definitely a head scratcher... not that it’s very complex, but I was initially so excited about what I got after first test. Immediate ginger, rose and a light vanilla- gorgeous and warm, but bright and clean- I was in love from start to finish. I thought I’d test once more before buying a full bottle (which has been a bit difficult to find at a decent price)... aaaand nothing like the first time- generic light floral. Meh. So I tested again today and realized it’s definitely my body temp and the weather/seasons. First test was in cold weather, cool body temp = beautiful crisp, notes clearer, emphasized. Today is hot and humid, and my skin is obviously warmer = a generic floral, pretty but nothing like what I got in cooler weather.
Overall it’s nice, and easy to wear, but only works beautifully for me in colder weather.",03/31/21 07:58,Kai_11
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"If you could bottle the Easter holiday in a fragrance, this would be it.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"1) Watery, rosy
2) Nivea cream
3) A bit of fennel

Lovely, light and not very long-lasting. Completely different from the original. In fact, it is closer to Burberry Rhythm for Her Floral than the original Burberry for Her. A great option for those who enjoy clean and easy-to-wear florals. I suspect this will get some dislikes for poor performance but I don't mind it. In fact, I'll take that over those strong ones that stick to my skin and clothes even after washing.",02/20/21 20:02,KBreckenridge
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Is it just me or does anyone else smell wintergreen with the initial spray? I'm guessing its the ginger? but I definitely get a blast of breath mint wintergreen! Bizarre initial spray, but the drydown is a sexy floral musky amber. I'll give it a second chance because once the initial weird ginger? scent wears off it's quite lovely.",01/31/21 13:13,ScorpionX
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"This one is a head-scratcher for me lol. I first smelled it from one of those Ulta paper samples and was immediately intrigued by the fresh, sexy dry down. Got a sample and hmmm... This is really nice, yet confusing on my skin. It smells like I sprayed on cologne that a guy in his mid-20's would consider an easy reach type of fragrance. I almost washed it off because the amber note in the base smells more like ambroxan (an aromachemical I despise) but I wanted to see how it finished and yeah, this one is a no for me because I end up smelling like a 25-year-old British guy with casually good taste lol.",01/30/21 07:38,DarlingNikki
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,I love this scent but just a warning to Burberry her lovers thinking about blind buying it DONT DO IT. This is nothing like Burberry her it is more of a fresh laundry detergent smell sitting in a bowl of wood with one single piece of fruit in it. That being said it is my favorite scent lmao,01/06/21 11:10,Carolined282
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I got a sample of this , and it is a basic pretty perfume. Feminine, floral , mass appealing . Non offensive . A safe buy to smell like a put together lady . Soft peony and rose with a slight citrus . This could be used as an everyday type of perfume .",12/19/20 14:30,Virgo92093!
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Oh, this is really lovely, but as others have mentioned, the longevity is very poor. Clocking in at a bit shy of 2 hours is a huge disappointment as the fragrance itself is divine. I received this free sample in a Sephora order and chose it because I love Burberry Her. But Burberry Her is a beast for longevity on me, whereas this is lacking. Also worth mentioning, this is really very different from Burberry Her - Burberry Her on me wears with a synthetic strawberry note which is oddly enjoyable, but Burberry Her London Dream is far more floral with just a slight bite of citrus. It's a very delicate rose fragrance, and to be honest, I wasn't super thrilled about the option for the sample because I normally don't like rose, as it often wears very overpowering on me. However, this is delicately rosy like PDM Delina and Givenchy Irresistible (I don't consider these dupes, just that the delicacy of the rose reminds me of them slightly). A bummer that this is a pass.",12/14/20 16:48,justlikemagic
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Does anyone smell the original Herbal Essence shampoo in this? Especially in the opening. I really liked it, but got a headache 5 minutes or so after I tried it so it’s a no for me. To bad because Herbal Essence smelled so good.",12/10/20 16:27,SniffyLarue
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"So as strange as this may be, I had bought the original Her, when I tried it at the store I loved it. Got it home and after I wore it a few times it made me smell like cat pee-NO JOKE!!! It was putrid. I did actually swap with a gal pal I met on here :) and then I bought the newest Viva Box from SDM and this was in it and it’s actually beautiful m. What the actual hell??? I don’t get it? Why does this smell so food but the other he so disgusting on me? I just can’t figure it out-any ideas I’m all ears!!",11/24/20 21:11,Dort0625
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,Does anyone else smell watermelon jolly rancher????? Well that's exactly what it smells like on me along with rose but it's like an alcoholic rose. I smell some faint boozy or alcohol very faint but there... I like it 3 ppl have said you smell good so that's always a plus ...its Autumn and I smell it on myself when I'm outside and I really like that.. the silage is moderate for me but I spray 4 good ones and it stays... ill say 8.5... also I layered it out Kkm Kardashian Glam and that really is a fresh girly smell !!,10/17/20 17:10,Ariesflygirl
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"Like the other reviewers said, this has nothing in common with the original Burberry Her. In my opinion it would fit better as a My Burberry flanker, it has a similar lush, dewy texture and some notes remind me of it, mainly the rose and something about the base. I like My Burberry better though, this one is a little harsh.

Her London Dream is a tomboy-ish, sporty version of a light peony and rose floral. Especially in the opening I get a borderline screechy 'blue shower gel'/'fake woods' note, no idea where that's coming from - it doesn't smell like lemons or ginger. Later the scent turns a little warmer and creamier thanks to the amber and musk. It's nice enough and not offensive, but not very special. I think Burberry has many better fragrances. A dreamy, hazy lighter version of Her with additional florals would have been perfect for a flanker called London Dream, this scent should rather be called My Burberry Sport instead.",08/24/20 11:14,SailorV
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"London Dream has nothing to do with the DNA of the original Her and Her intense, which are nicely done nowadays gourmands (obviously inspired by Baccarat Rouge and Delina;-)).

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I received a sample of this. Nothing special about it. It's a floral scent that borders on sweetness, but not quite. I agree it has a tea like quality to it.

Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"I found this to be a very pleasant fresh sweet and floral perfume. Perfect for summertime!

The only drawback is longevity and projection.",08/02/20 09:27,snoopyQ
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,I love this fragrance. I find it a lovely fresh fruity floral. The lemon and ginger are the top notes for me and as it dries down the the Rose comes through with just a hint of musk. I’m not getting any amber but I’ve only wore it once. I also found the sillage to be better than the original Her. After a couple of hours it was still a lemony Rose but I detected a hint of a green note (wet grass). More than happy with this buy and expect I will wear it often. ❤️🍋 🌹,07/07/20 09:31,Arraminta
Burberry Her London Dream Burberry,"@viarya: nope! Not even a little bit!!!

I got a sample of this today, and thought it was ""Burberry Her"", which I love (I also really love ""Her Intense"".) So, I couldn't figure out what was wrong, because (on me) this is intensely floral, and kind of a weak tea, smell. But mostly overwhelming flowers. Now that it's drying down, some musk is definitely coming out.

I realised that it was actually ""Her London Dream"", and came to read the notes. I definitely don't smell any amber, ginger, or lemon. And, I don't really smell the rose; I would say the floral that is so strong is the peony.

DEFINITELY don't blind buy this thinking that it'll be like ""Her"" or ""Her Intense""!!! It's really completely floral.

Also: very weak sillage, and faded after a couple of hours. Personally, I really don't like it, and will give the rest of my sample away.",06/13/20 17:09,bdragonfly12345

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Smelled beautiful when I first sprayed it. Green, woody, warm and minty. Then, a few minutes later, I thought it was sharp and bad. Then, thirty minutes later it was even better than the first few minutes, and it stayed that way for the remainder.

I've noticed some green scents have a sharp, bitter smell towards the opening. I guess that's what threw me off. I get the same from Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme, which I also like.

Performance is on the low side of average for me, which makes it good for the office. Smells modern without falling into the current super-sweet trend.

This doesn't blow my mind, but it's a solid, masculine fragrance that would suit most occassions.",11/22/24 14:50,FragranceAnon

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"not synthetic, quite the opposite actually. very all-round great everday but mostly office fragrance. the citrus notes really pop off as soon as you put it on, but it will weaken over time. when it comletely dries down, on my skin it smells identical to a steam sauna, although i wish the projection of the drydown and general fragrance were much longer (3-4hrs for me), the sillage isnt great at all either, but you cant have everything

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Don't listen to others, this is a wonderful fragrance made by famous and super talented Mr. Francis Kurkdjian from MFK. Trust me, he wouldn't produce something ""terrible"", ""medicinal"", ""weak"". Like oh my god where do you people come from? If you are a nose blind or just a slump don't expect miracles after just buying the bottle, it requires something back from the wearer as well.
You pay designer and want something niche in return. And no this fragrance cant make you young and beautiful, it is just a fragrance and for the price this is AMAZING FRAGRANCE. Yes, just like I said Mr. Burberry is for the young Mr.businesses man dressed in Burberry trench coat and don't expect wearing puma sport pants and think you can pull this off. This fragrance like many other before it requires style, mojo character, a special event etc then you'd understand it.
Did you see Bleu de Channel fragrance commercials? Yes a guy like that would wear this fragrance and you would bend your neck while passing by him on a street, capish? For the rest of us, buy it, wear it, and imagine you are that guy from BDC commercial you might get different results from the rest of people 😀

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Mr. Burberry EdP is a fine offering. Justin Copeland called this ""a designer version of Masculin Pluriel"". I can see where he's coming from with that, though the extra class and quality that MP has is exactly what makes it good. So the emphasis on the ""designer"" part shouldn't be neglected. This edp is far more interesting than the edt, which I found a run of the mill cologne smell.

I'd like to draw attention to user scottgiles86's review below and his words: ""This is a ""dad version"" (that's a good thing) of a blue fragrance with more focus on woods and aromatics versus ambroxan. Smells much more refined and not as sharp, screechy, or metallic as Sauvage or Dylan Blue, neither of which I enjoy. ... I generally don't like ""blue"" fragrances, but this one is alright.""",04/06/23 08:54,Made by Kouros

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Off the top I smell Mint, a plesent root beer accord some patchuli and a “dark herbal” accord in the vein of anise, wormwood, or absinthe but not entirely any of those, just that character. Smells slightly daring compared to many designer offerings in a department store. Masculine cool weather leaning, mysterious. To me it smells very “English”. To my nose this is very much in The ballpark of YSL La nuit De lhomme LE PARFUM,
Which is a great scent however cost wise it’s not much more than mr.Burberry parfum. Mr.Burberry is lacking that French style of perfect proportions and is missing some of that “date night” scent appeal. A 3.3 oz bottle of Mr.Burberry can be bought for $59.84 while a 2 oz La nuit de lhomme le parfum can be bought for $66.14- both from fragrance net. If it wasn’t for this I would hold Mr Burberry in a higher light but regardless the rating for this is far too low and I think this is more of a 4.00 rating and up. Best Burberry I’ve smelt.",02/20/23 18:04,B-Knows

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"This is a sexy mysterious scent but sadly ruined by awful performance.

Tiny splash of citrus up top, but the main notes are the spicy cardamom, mint, and although its not listed I get violet in the mid-dry down. Ultra classy and despite all the heavy notes it doesn't feel sharp or aggressive.

The performance on this however is horrible. The scent bubble is small from the start. Maybe if you go heavy with the sprays you could get some attention for an hour or so, but it's a skin scent after that.",11/21/22 09:43,Fazh97
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I was so taken aback by this, enough to completely re-evaluate my initial boredom with the brand. Sure, I love My Burberry Black but that one is super bold. However, when I purchased a 30mL of this in a panicked hurry for a date I forgot to wear a scent for... my world turned around. It's eyes rolling back in your skull good, coming from a guy who generally prefers more feminine and unisex fragrances. A pleasant spicy citrus with a fun little minty twist. I don't have many grapefruit or mint scents and this really fills the void. Very masculine, lasts a long time, projects well, cute bottle... who can complain?",09/25/22 10:10,DT953
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Smells lovely and high quality but the performance, for the price point and being an EDP, is just not acceptable and is a massive let down. It performs a lot better on clothes.",09/05/22 02:40,Sam96438
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"EARTHY-GREEN FRESH SLIGHTLY SPICY WOODY CREAMY

it's not sweet like most of the offerings these day (which probably why it doesn't get much love and also because of the sharp opening),
opens with sharp Mint+Grapefruit+Cardamom+Tarragon+Lavender+Patchouli mostly, but smooths out and develops as it dries.
in the mid it gets earthy & green fresh woody & warm,
the full dry is the best part, creamy sandalwood kicks in with the earthy-green clean slightly-spicy freshness (like an earthier Azzaro Visit, which is underated as well)
I'd say it's a versatile, classy/sophisticated, masculine, 'Modern Fougère' fragrance but has a faint woody powderiness that adds a softness to the composition. there are better projecting & more 'mass appealing' offerings at the price point but not many which are as unique, distinct & deep.

Projection/Sillage': LIGHT, arms length scent bubble for the 1st 30mins to an hour but mainly an intimate/in-close scent.

Performance/Longevity: GOOD, about 7-12 hours (on fabric), it's an intimate fragrance mainly but stays a good while.",06/08/22 22:53,abahvdbs
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"A nice, albeit forgettable fragrance, opens with a very zingy citrus leads to an amber and nutmeg drydown. There's something that has an almost sour note in there.... certainly at the beginning, whether it's the grapefruit mixing with something I don't know, but it's different. For an EDP it's not particularly long lasting.

Do I regret buying it? No.... would I buy it again? No",04/17/22 12:01,Luxfare
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Let's keep it simple.

I like the smell, Ill agree with the notes above, I tend to think it's a little zesty and peppery (spicy) at first but it really just dies in the arse, the ceder stays for a couple of hours but no more. I wore this at a concert, and it was warm and strong at first but really just dies. My parter loves the smell, but also agrees that you cant smell it a few hours later.

I'd love to love this, but I payed like $80AUD for a tiny bottle, and I need about 6 squirts to get anything decent.

I work a 12.5 hour shift, so I want it to last as long as possible. For me, Mr. BURBERRY just doesn't do it for me. Longevity just isn't there for me... maybe for others it seems but for me... I can't justify ever buying this again.

I feel a woman could wear this without an issue, but it isn't femme. I think it's a smart smell, and perhaps a stronger female or a female in power such as boss, manager could really pull this off.

Day or night use in my opinion.
More suited to spring and autumn.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Undeniably a great fragrance that receives a lot of compliments but lacks greatly in performance. For this reason its an often underated fragrance. A lot of people tend to go for it due its value for money but are then disappointed by its performance, not something I would blind buy unless you test to see how it works on your skin.

It opens up with with fresh and spicy notes before developing with a slight warmth kind of vibe. Its not something i would wear during the day. More so suited for evening/night or winter occasions. The strength of it is mediocre, once the scent has opened up and evolved, it becomes very bleak and lifeless. Becomes very much like a deodorant in all honesty. The overall performance is poor, skin scent for myself after 1 hour. Almost nothing after 3 hours!

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Mr. Burberry EDP is criminally underrated. I tested the EDT version from a friend of mine and liked it, but it was missing some elements I would consider in a fragrance. I did more research on the EDP and figured why not.

The price is amazing for the value you will be getting from this. Honestly, it has a premium smell and aura. I wore this to work for a week so far and got so many compliments from my female colleagues. They wanted to buy some for their partners and kept sniffing with their eyes closed, in content of the scent.

This stuff is great, I really believe that if it was released by Francis Kurkdjian in the MFK line, people would rave about this. No, this is not groundbreaking, but it won't break the bank either! It's appealing and a safe buy. If you're looking for something bold then look elsewhere, this will not meet that expectation.

Performance wise, I am not sure why it is so poor for others, but on clothes and skin, this has lasted me every work day (8 hours). This is by far the best bargain buy I have had in a while. Bought the 100 ml tester version for ~$45.00. Only strange thing is the batch code says '0056', which dates to the year of 2000, but this was released in 2017.. Anyways, I do recommend this, especially on a budget. Ultra versatile and price friendly. Personally worn as an office scent and for casual days.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Wow. This stuff is heavenly. First off, I’m a huge fan of these kind of fragrances: a simple, clean/fresh opening and a warm, woody base, wrapped together by soft, green, floral spices. This one is nearly perfection IMO. I also love Mr. Burberry EDT. Some people call that one boring, which I can kind of understand, but still, I think it’s a fantastic fragrance that is super fresh, classy, and versatile.

The EDP version is significantly better in my opinion, as the EDT did suffer just a bit from an underlying bitterness, and I felt it needed something more warm or floral to balance things out and tie it all together. This EDP does that and then some, significantly improving it in the process and making it even more inviting and smooth.

The opening is fresh and citrusy, but not quite as bitter and green. It adds more spice to it, which makes it feel deeper and more complex immediately. The addition of cinnamon is exquisite and kind of genius IMO, it adds warmth and complexity. The scent overall still feels fresh, a bit cool/slightly aquatic almost, but the added cinnamon and patchouli blend together beautifully and bring out the zest of the grapefruit and the warmth of the cedar and sandalwood. The lavender is beautiful and rounds out the green notes and cardamom.

In my opinion, this is a masterpiece designer fragrance. The quality of the ingredients is surprisingly good and blended together so beautifully, Francis Kurkdjian really knocked it out of the park here. I think for daily wear, this is better than Sauvage, BdC, Aventus, all of those. Not every fragrance needs to shout your arrival from the rooftops. I prefer something deceptively simple and blended to perfection, and Mr. Burberry EDP absolutely nails it. Plus, everyone else will be too busy wearing those other, more popular scents, and you’ll be the one who stands out when it matters most :)",06/03/21 17:20,Bfreepro417
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"This is like MFK Masculin Pluriel - designer edition.

Im a huge fan of Masculin Pluriel and been wearing it since 2015. I first sampled this last year and was surprised how similar it felt to Masculin Pluriel. It seems like Kurkdjian made MP in a designer bottle for Burberry with some small changes. Just a more modern. Its as if they merged Masculin Pluriel with something like Chanels BDC edp.

Its a fantastic scent and for me it screams summer holidays at night.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I adore this juice. No surprise knowing the perfumer... Right when I smelled it I knew I had to have it. I impulse bought this, but it was worth it to me. Recently wore Mr. Burberry below the belt, wearing another frag up top. I was in the club restroom and I smelled someone I was like man some dood got a killer frag I wonder what it is... then I realized it was my crotch 😅

This juice suits all occasions, all weather. It’s classy, neat - a proper gentleman. It’s fresh but spicy, green and blue at the same time. Great fresh out the shower scent. Reminds me of Polo Blue, but a bit darker. It can be dressed up or dressed down ,but the bow tie on the bottle should tell you what this juice was intended for...

Update: the tube to the atomizer will not fit a Trevalo.",01/11/21 23:24,SweetPeaPea
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Classy & reserved. This is a Gentleman’s scent for the modern day man. I say that knowing that this isn’t a groundbreaking creation nor does it have to be to have it considered as a good fragrance. On me, I love the woods with its warm and semi sweet drydown. You get a light kick in the beginning with the Cardamom & Grapefruit that is accompanied by the mint note. It has a soothing lavender with a slight spiceness from the nutmeg & tarragon that is warm yet clean smelling, almost as if one is standing in today’s contemporary barbershops taking in all the ambery and fresh cleanliness of the environment. In the end it’s a nice patchouli, vetiver with a subtle cinnamon and sandalwood finish that is nice and simple that honestly won’t offend a soul. It smells like a man who’s got his shit together. It’s professional, manly and yet has a warmer side to it. It has garnered a few compliments every time I wear it. The weakness of Mr. Burberry eau de parfum is its projection or, lack there of and the soft sillage. It resembles D&G The One edp in performance, not in scent profile as The One has the Tobacco, Ginger and Orange blossom to give it a sexier and richer body. After a couple of hours someone really has to be close to you to catch a whiff or two. I use 5-6 sprays, one behind each ear, three on the chest from shoulder to shoulder and a quick spray on the under shirt and I’m good to go for a full day at the office. It transitions easily to the evening for a night out for drinks with friends and colleagues. This is good for almost all year round wear and can be ones signature scent except for maybe the real hot & humid days of summer. There are better scent elixirs out there indeed that offer better performance to boot but, this is not a bad scent at all and for the low price (I paid $45 US for a 5oz. bottle at a discounter) just spray a little extra on. Solid juice, period.....",01/08/21 14:56,Apocalypse6vs8
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I have read a lot of reviews and I'm pretty shocked to find that most of you do not have any experience with fragrances. Mr. Burberry is an absolutely women killer perfume with a unique smell, it's modern, luxurious, sexy, and a strong compliment magnet. I have a huge collection of perfumes from big houses like Creed, Mancera, and other cheaper perfume from Dior, Chanel and so on, but this cheap fragrance from Burberry it's a f***ing steal and a beast that kills many many types of fragrances from big houses. It is not a perfume for any person, it just for a real gentleman who has tasted it, for somebody with that likes quality and for somebody who wants to impress. It's for somebody who wants something unique. It's a very mysterious fragrance that will bring questions from all sides. Maybe because the nose behind this perfume it's Francis Kurkdjian, and after knowing that, you should know that everything that I mentioned above, makes sense! I never thought that I can find a such gem fragrance for such a price. It was initially a blind buy and i never regret it. Rather than Bleu de Chanel, Dior Sauvage, i would use Mr. Burberry without even thinking twice! This cheap fragrance deserves a place near Mancera and Creed without any doubt! Try it and you will see!",12/21/20 07:23,TheFragranceMaster
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Amber woody (patchouli-vetiver) with fizzy zesty fruity (grape beverage vibe) undertone.

Another review mentioned Bvlgari Man, but I feel more similarity to Bvlgari Man Wood Essence, but this Burberry is less medicinal.
I might also mention D&G The One Gentleman (similarly spicy lavender with fennel in place of tarragon).

Dupont Signature Men is like a more smoky balsamic + coumarin version.

Ferre In the Mood for Love Man shares some similarities but with more prominent coumarin and orange blossom, it performs better than the Burberry.

Where the Burberry excels in compared to the ones I mentioned above is its versatility and easy to wear quality. A safe, pleasant scent for the 'nice guys'.",10/13/20 02:25,ObsessedJoydjay
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Mr. Burberry Men EDP opens with a low projection of spicy and woody accords. The cardamon and tarragon are the most noticeable opening spices, both create a green herb, anise-like accord, the tarragon is more prominent with its anisic touch; the mint is a brief tone, it comes up just for a moment and then it dissipates; the grapefruit is also very soft and it is almost unnoticeable. The opening is all about the spices and everything else is far behind. As the fragrance commences to dry-down, the woody, benzoin, and nutmeg accords join the blend, once again their projection is very low, the combination of woody accords and benzoin creates a soft resinous touch that adds depth to the fragrance. The lavender is a faint distant floral note. The patchouli and vetiver add a soft green touch; the cinnamon joins the cardamon and tarragon enhancing the spicy accords. The most noticeable changes from the opening to the dry-down are the dissipation of the mint, and grapefruit notes, and the development of the very soft green and vetiver accords. The spices come up at the opening and continue into the dry-down. Once Mr. Burberry Men EDP has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a very low projection, spicy (mostly tarragon), and resinous woody fragrance. The fragrance feels classy, earthy, faint, formal, light, masculine, mature, modern, nocturnal, resinous, inexpensive, warm, weak, woody, and pleasant.

BATCH REVIEWED: 2020.
WOW RATING: 4/10. The spicy accords are fantastic; the fragrance’s potency is very poor.
DISLIKE RATING: 1/10. The fragrance is spicy; some people could find the spices unpleasant.
UNIQUENESS: 3/10. Spicy fragrances are very common.
MASS APPEAL: 4/10. A basic spicy fragrance with low mass-appeal.
PROJECTION: 1/10. Low, about 1 foot around the wearer.
SILLAGE: 1/10. Low, almost none.
APPLICATION: 6 or more atomizations to compensate for poor performance.
LONGEVITY: 3/10. About 3 hours with less than 1 hour of low projection.
SEASONS: Fall and winter, or colder nights.
OCCASIONS: Formal and casual. This is an office-friendly fragrance.
VERSATILITY: 4/10. Limited to the colder months and, casual or formal wear.
GENDER: Masculine. The spicy and wood tones lean it to the masculine side.
AGES: 30 and above.
RECOMMENDATION: Mr. Burberry EDP is a great scent, but its performance is below EDT, very disappointing. Not recommended.
SIMILAR: These are examples of similar fragrances. Bvlgari Man (no the Black version) EDT includes softwood and fruity notes; Cuba Gold Men EDT is an affordable woody, floral and spicy fragrance; Guerlain L'Homme Ideal EDP By Guerlain includes softwoods, almond, and other notes; Hugo Boss - Boss The Scent Absolute EDP features woody, ginger, and rum notes; Terre D'hermes EDT Spray, is orange and grapefruit based but it contains soft/sweet wood tones as well; Prada Luna Rossa Black Men EDP is a mostly peppery and woody fragrance; Tom Ford Oud Wood is a very pleasant, soft woody fragrance, however, very pricy; Acqua di Parma Men Colonia Quercia is a great woody, and spicy fragrance; Pasha de Cartier Edition Noire is an elegant and versatile, slightly sweet, ambery, aquatic, and woody fragrance; Mr. Burberry EDP is a spicy and woody fragrance, pleasant but very weak.
SUMMARY: A very low projection, spicy (mostly tarragon), and resinous woody fragrance. The fragrance feels classy, earthy, faint, formal, light, masculine, mature, modern, nocturnal, resinous, inexpensive, warm, weak, woody, and pleasant.",06/24/20 14:20,piyux

Herbal & fresh. It smells as if you are outisde a green, wet park on a cool day.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Got a tester size bottle for fun from Tj Maxx.... regrettable, smells like that generic old cologne smell that you pulled out of your grandpas closet when you cleaned it out, or that smell like when you smell a cologne from an antique mall from a bottle that was from 1968... That smell like it had been sitting there in the closet for 35 years and only about 1/3 was ever worn, thats the smell I get from this... I've worn it about 5 times and come to the same conclusion every time unfortunately. Granted, I LOVE Burberry scents (London, Touch, Brit, Original), but this is not for me... Can see it being a great signature scent if you were born before i'd say 1975, it does have pretty decent longevity around 5-6 hours for me, with about an arms length projection for about 2 hours of that.",09/29/19 13:58,EN1990

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I began with an open, even hopeful mind when I first tried MR B Parfum. I wanted to like it, so please understand this is as objective as I can be in a review- I have no axe to grind here. You know that guy who is pleasant to be around, but you just can't remember anything about him that stands out? He's probably nice, calm, and strives to please, but that's exactly his problem. He withholds his opinion if he thinks it will ruffle anyone's feathers, tries to be cool at times, but the attempt usually fizzles and results in mild awkwardness. This is Mr Burberry EDP: the feckless nice guy in your social circle. It has modest sillage. A melange of light spicy/musty smells that just fails to evoke much emotion at all. Now, if your situation calls for a mildly masculine, trepid, slightly beta fragrance that will never insert itself, here it is.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Ok. I get it now. I fully understand the 3.54 rating on this fragrance.

First, do I like it? Yes it's a good fragrance. For an EDP it's a little above average. I'm getting 8hrs...with 8 sprays. Yikes! Not good for an EDP.

Second, it's very pleasant and non offensive. The scent is somewhat linear to me. About 10mins after you spray that's the scent you get till it fades.

I smell cardamom, tarragon, patchouli and light sandlewood. It's nice but quite middle of the road.
Is it worth buying. Yes, for a super discounted price. I would not pony up full bucks at Macy's for it. I got it cheap at TJ Maxx.

If your looking for a quality frag, non offensive and great office scent then this clicks all of the boxes.

If your looking for the next best thing...then this isn't it. 7 out of 10. Good, but average.",06/11/19 12:40,Rtiggs
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"This is such a beautiful perfume! My husband has a 100 ml bottle and he's almost out. Considering his bottles last for years sometimes, I think it says a lot. I just sprayed it on myself to see how my skin reacts to it.

It is a well-balanced perfume, appropriate for office work and for going out. I think that both younger men and men past 40 will like it, because it is non-offensive and it makes you feel fresh and put together.
I think I have a thing for patchouli, because I noticed I like a lot of perfumes containing patchouli (So elixir, White patchouli etc.)",05/18/19 11:30,Happiness_in_a_Bottle
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I purchased this fragrance for my husband simply because I have all af the My Burberry collection and fell in love with the lot of them. This fragrance is nice and wearable, but feels like it shouldn't be linked with the MB collection. Aside from the black botte being, quite deceptive just as mine is. It is a nice wearable fragrance that surely wont offend, great for the office. It doesn't project as well as it should, and can very well be a unisex scent. It is more minty and fresh as opposed to the manlier, deep, spiciness we adore from most men's fragrances. Nothing dark of alluring in this bottle. Just a safe, inexpensive purchase. I probably won't be blind buying the Indigo version, but I'm not disappointed either.",03/25/19 12:41,pamelalasalle110

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I don't normally like spices like cardamom and cinnamon, but I must say this is pretty well-blended! None of the ingredients are too piercing to my nose; this scent smells warm, aromatic, and slightly vanillic on my skin. I imagine this would smell great on a confident, smartly dressed young man.",02/12/19 19:43,zhiang0113
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I'm currently wearing this scent and i Love it for sure. Fresh, elegant, masculine yet it could pass for Unisex scent as well.

Performance is good, i still smell myself after several hours and after taking a shower , however it dries down to a very generic scent, nothing headturning.

Love it but won't re-purchase once i'm done with it. For now, i'm enjoying this beauty..",02/09/19 03:53,Samiology
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Very dissapointed. As mentioned this is like a £1 shop fragrance. Initially it is strong and then after 30 mins whooosh gone. It is a bit like a Mr Adolescents first sexual experience, cant wait to try it and rampant, then over and done with. You think what was the hype? Is this all its hyped to be? A very poor quality fragrance, given its an EDP it dissapoints even more. Miss Lady of the night just made the easiest money she is going to.(well Miss Lady of the night in this case is Mr Burberry, So disspaointed with this fragrance. I was not impressed with Mr Burberry (orgininal) EDT, they all smell so cheap like a European nightclub. This should not have a ribbon tied to it but should have a tag like one finds on the deceased.",01/31/19 09:22,Escoteric

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I was initially unimpressed with this but then it became a strong like! For me it has all the qualities to be a versatile/all-seasons/signature type scent veering towards formal and maybe smart casual, in a similar way to Bleu de Chanel, although I'm not suggesting they smell alike as they don't to my nose.

A fresh, woody, spicy, masculine aromatic fragrance nothing incredibly new but it's very decent.",12/23/18 09:50,TrephineArtist
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I get mostly patchouli, cardamom, cedar and grapefruit. Theres also a slight hint of mint in the background.

This is a very fresh, dark scent. It's not necessarily dark, but its a heavier fragrance, more well suited for the colder weather.

You can tell it's a designer fragrance, but it exudes class and confidence.

This is not entirely suited for high schoolers, but it also isn't suited for 40+ businessmen. It's mainly for a younger/middle aged, clean-cut, smooth individual. Definitely for the modern man.

Class, confidence, sophistication - Modern, fresh, dark, sexy.

I've worn this out once and it was a great experience. Performance was above average.

Love this stuff!",12/05/18 21:42,hullhockey91

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,Nice and spicy but not manly enough in my opinion,11/16/18 10:29,zadewee
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"This cologne has its own clientele of noses It is generally a good smelling cologne but you have to time in your application. At first sniff you will feel it has some spiciness and manliness in it, also it tells you that it has a potential and a character of its own. Sadly the scent does not hold it After the 1hr time frame to me it becomes just a scent you have smelled before nothing unique it doesn't draw me into it.

how did I get a compliment? I just got lucky that I put this on before approaching a superior of mine who is a very classy woman and perhaps she prefers that spicy manly not over powering scent that looks to smeel unqiue and that's it the ""you smell good"" sentence was given I always wear colognes whenever I will interact with her and this is the only one she complimented me with",09/03/18 03:18,zyleric
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I’m surprised by the average reviews here, I get a lot of compliments on this one. The opening spray is similar to the EDT but the drydown is deeper and darker; the cinnamon and patchouli come together very nicely. The original EDT is pretty linear, it reminds me of lemon infused water over volcanic rocks, which is fine if it’s hot out. But this is more like cinnamon herbal tea over volcanic rocks. Adds another layer.",07/09/18 21:47,Knows2Nose
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Got a sample vial of this. Sooo mild..not gross but smells like something I smelled before, but I dunno what. Is the regular one as mild? For an edp this is some faint stuff...a bottle would probably alert a room, lol.",06/29/18 00:27,lespritz.1

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,This is a great little scent: it opens strong with well-balanced spicy wood freshness that has a lovely dry down.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Not bad as masculine fragrances go, although with 4 sprays you hardly get anything. 7 to 8 sprays on skin and clothes is what I would recommend if your tastes are for fragrances that exude a very clean, soapy, casual fragrance. This is great for work, studying in a library or running errands. This is a different fragrance, but not stand out stature. Best suited for rainy or slushy spring and summer days.",03/27/18 08:17,Farhaatabd1102111
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Underrated fragrance.

Clean sophisticated citrus patchouli with minty touch. Dark fresh scent and very masculine.

Complements getter, cheap. In the same genre of bleu de chanel.

It exceeds versace dylan blue and dior sauvage in terms of quality. Smells much more natural without the annoying ambroxan note of these two.

The only drawback is the poor longevity. Performance is ok in the first half hour only.

Great deal for the price.",03/16/18 14:04,Tazahr

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"After testing this, I can see the case for the dislikes. The main/prominent note here is Patchouli. I personally don't like patchouli but I own Tom Ford's Black Orchid EdP which I love and patch is a main player. The patchouli in Mr. Burberry is of low quality and makes this fragrance smell like sweat :( The bottle is nice though. Burberry was trying a shower gel like fragrance like BdC. This is a total fail!!",01/15/18 11:18,James99
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"All the negative reviews are just not justified. You can get a 1.7 oz bottle of this now for $30, which makes it an absolute steal. This is some seriously high quality juice that does not smell like Bleu de Chanel edt or edp, as a lot of you are saying. This is not so incensey, not so ambery. This fragrance is verging on gourmand territory because the patchouli mixed with the cardamom produces a savory sweetness, but thankfully the grapefruit holds it back from being too edible smelling. It really is well blended and took me by surprise after i read all these negative reviews. Plus the bottle is beautiful, and the name is awesome if you're known for wearing Burberry clothing. The only criticism i could have for this fragrance is its poor performance, but i don't really care because that makes it even more versatile, and i can over-apply since it's so cheap. This will be making best cheapies lists soon enough, i have no doubt",01/03/18 22:58,mmcdonald36

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I have a small sample of this from when I purchased Dior Homme Eau. Simply put, this has parts that I like and parts that I dislike. It opens fresh and colorful, then quickly transitions into something halfway between LB Roma Uomo (old school spicy sweetness!!!) and JPG Popeye. I'm a huge fan of Roma Uomo and I detest JPG Popeye so that's where I stand with this thing. It's honestly pretty boring to me and doesn't have the attractiveness or mass appeal that other generic/boring fragrances do. Pass, for me atleast.


Edit: After spraying my small sample again and giving it another try it is starting to grow on me. Not a favorite or one that I would purchase for myself but it definitely is pleasant smelling. Bottle still looks ugly though.

Edit 2: Definitely grew on me a lot. Very pleasant fresh mint/grapefruit based scent with that old school Le Male DNA. this is what JPG Popeye/superman thinks it's doing. Can't see myself getting a full bottle as the bottle itself is atrocious, but it definitely smells very very good.",10/07/17 15:04,Dihydromercenary
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"I'm glad I gave this fragrance a chance, it has not disappointed me at all. Patchouli is one of my favorite notes and this stuff has it in spades. The grapefruit adds a nice fruity vibe to it and of course the cardamon makes it a bit spicy. 12+ hours of longevity and 4 feet of projection, go easy on the trigger because this juice is quite potent.",08/10/17 06:33,adamthompson06
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"This is a fairly nice scent, but it's nothing special or that different from the original Mr. Burberry.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Totally agree with the person below me, not amazed by the smell and performance of this frag, longevity is pretty legit btw, but why so much hate before even giving it a try.

Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"It's good. But I guess if you love fragrances and tried and tested many perfumes, you won't get overly excited.
It's warm and masculine. It has a sort of wet and humid quality.
As I said, I like it but at the same time I know this fragrance can easily transform itself into a generic/boring male perfume.
It is well executed, you can tell there's knowledge behind it but at the same time...meh.
I guess I should wear it and see the reaction.",06/25/17 17:12,esteban747
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"Not gonna make an in-depth review because is too late, just wanted to contribute my 2 cents because I see it has a poor review, probably because the longevity and sillage as I see a lot of people rated it poor. I read the other reviews last week but I can't remember them now so...

·I would definitely rated higher than a mere 2.42, at least as the scent goes.
·I can feel very clearly the citrus, given the notes I would thought it was gonna be more discrete. I think it mixes well with the other notes.
·I understand what the description means when it says ""more suitable for evening occasions"" but I could use it for daytime too.
·With just my first sprays I felt it was too weak, so I sprayed some more about 5 minutes later(I'm testing it and I like to be able to smell them easily and for my wife to be able to smell it at a distance) and it went to weak mode again after 5 minutes or so(maybe is my nose getting used to it, but it doesn't happens this much as with other perfumes).
·At this rate I would say the longevity won't be that much but its being an hour and 15 minutes and I can still smell it (skin scent and outside in the balcony with some draft I could smell it a little bit in my surrounding air), which beats Gucci perfumes.

Conclusion for now: I like the smell but I don't like the strength, for my taste is somewhat weak even for a safe perfume, but you have to do your own test for this as my perception of it might be different from yours.",05/08/17 14:52,Aceborne
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"First impression, I Like it a Lot! :)
I will update soon..

Update

This is one of those fragrances that put smile on my face whenever i sniff :)
So, Wow!
This is more of a night time fragrance, it has perfect balance without being overly dark and not too bright either. Also it's not too sugary or not too citrusy.. It's modern, but without Ambroxan, major ingredient in this days fragrances.

It has spices and flowers that is my impression, i can sense the flowers in it, this notes gives this fragrance freshness, not to fall into the dark.
Longevity and silage is moderate, not too strong, just perfect!
In one word, Lovely.",04/27/17 10:39,ProtonN
Mr. Burberry Eau de Parfum Burberry,"What -- A -- Shame

Been testing this for a couple days now, and I just can't get myself to like it. To me, the patchouli is obvious, along with the nutmeg and cinnamon, with maybe some amber and lavender in the background. It's more elegant than anything and possibly meant for formal occasions???

But no matter how you spin it, I can't help but feel that THIS SMELLS CHEAP. Something along the line of Avon or a celebrity frag. Don't get me wrong it's not bad or awful, but it does seem incredibly generic in a powdery sort of way. Believe me, there are MUCH better and less expensive options out there.

The bright side is that it does get a little better after the initial spray, but not by much. Longevity and sillage are below average on me. Oh yeah, and my 60yo mom liked it. LOL. BURN.",04/08/17 08:35,MrHonest

I even like it much more then L'homme Ultime by YSL which was too boring for me. The only issue with Mr.Burberry was the performance.

The original smelled nice/mainstream, but was terrible in performance which was surprising because I will try anything done by Kurkdjian - top 3 in the game.

So with that, I will definitely try this being an EDP - with added notes of Cinnamon and Amber.

That said, why would Burberry keep on ignoring what was clearly their biggest ever men's fragrance ""London"" - want to drum up excitement for your brand again - come out with a London Intense (EDP) or London Parfum, or London Noir - instead they come out with the Brit Rhythm line? Maybe the most boring line out there.

Oh it’s me!” All day with this perfume, I see others saying it doesn’t last long for them, but one spray lasts me all day and even onto the next day, and on clothes it still smells fresh the day after.

London Burberry,"Two hours at Gatwick waiting for my plane to take off and a wonderful duty free full of fragrances I can't find in my country, all for me. A perfume lover's paradise, right? 😍🥰🤩😜
And that's how I got to know Burberry London. From that day on, I couldn't stop looking for this fragrance in my country, I had an incredible need to have it in my collection!!! I smelled it all the time on the plane, floral and a bit citrusy at first, a little bit shampoo-like, more creamy as the minutes went by, and floral-musky-woody at the end.🌸🍊✨️🫧

The most prominent notes for me are honeysuckle, tiare flower, and peony, mixed with a delicate and cozy musk. This perfume smells divine! Perfect as a signature fragrance because it is very versatile, not too intense, which makes it wearable all year round. Very feminine and sophisticated, an unique and a very beautiful scent!

With this one, I declare myself an unconditional fan of Burberry fragrances, I want them all!!! How can they make such beautiful fragrances? 😍😫🥰",09/03/25 05:39,Sandra25
London Burberry,"Really disappointed. Love the scent but it wears off so quickly. I don't want to say it's an old lady scent, but it reminds me of mall fragrance departments in the 90s. Personally I like that scent. It smells mature and brings to mind gold lipstick cases with the ridges. But it's gone in an instant. Paris Hilton Fairy Dust is in the ""reminds me of"" list and I would agree. Fairy Dust is a much better price, lasts longer, and doesn't quite have the 90s femme fatale scent down, but close.",08/15/25 22:24,batheOrEDP
London Burberry,"Despite seeing this scent for years, I finally dabbled into the Burberry world with this bottle since she was clearanced at TJ Maxx for just $50 for a 3.4oz edp…and my very first thought was “Dang, why did I wait so long?!” It smells divine, light yet opening to more depth, serious yet casual and mature yet feminine. All of these things weirdly made me think it would be a great graduation perfume for my daughters once they start looking for their adult jobs. It’s a scent I likely will wear to the office, then layer on something deeper and darker on top of for evening.
However, I do think this is an agreeable smell of lovely florals for those that understand Burberry’s line usually do still have a threaded scent component across all of their perfumes, and I do still get just the minor hint of rose soapy smell in the opening but to me it’s not bad… it doesn’t smell like my grandma’s shaped soaps she’d keep above her toilet. It smells like elegance, yet focused. Debating going back to see if I can get another bottle at that awesome price.
Glad I took the leap into this first Burberry scent but I am not seeking out the entire house collection.",08/11/25 00:27,Spunkytater

It’s such a pretty scent that wears well for any occasion! I usually enjoy a Dominique Ropion creation so it’s no surprise I like this! Although I find this would wear best in the warmer months, I think it could easily work any time of year!",08/02/25 01:25,Ismellgood2024
London Burberry,"I first discovered this scent in 2008 in San Francisco, and I've been in love with it since. This is the perfume that has gotten me the most compliments. It is a strong and mature scent, perfect for cold days. It smells expensive. As a lover of white florals, this is like an opiate for me. I can't get enough of it, and it never gets old. Huge bravo to the creators of this masterpiece.",07/28/25 15:43,JaneDoe12
London Burberry,I did not like this at all it smells like desitin cream. I tried giving it a few tries but its just really not good. I'm a burberry fan. I adore burberry her and love burberry brit sheer much better smelling perfumes and would reccomend them over burberry london anyday. Unfortunately I will not be using this ever.,07/20/25 21:53,nicconix
London Burberry,"It's a classic. I always have a bottle. I wore it heavily around the 2009 to 2012 era. I wore it as a night time, going out fragrance. Crazy, because the notes don't suggest that, but it was my sexy evening scent. Loved to wear it in winter, too. Again, not what you'd think.",07/11/25 14:32,Smellgoodfeelgood84
London Burberry,"Very pretty perfume. I love that tangerine in the opening is so divine and unique. I know it’s not a new perfume at all but def a goodie. My gave it to me because it was given to her and she didn’t line it and I happily took it off her hands. (Im in my 30’s) I where it all afternoon came home and took a shower, and I can still smell it, which is very rare with a lot of the perfumes that I have. One of the previous reviews said it smells like glam jasmine by Michael Kors and I can definitely say that is 100% true it reminds me so much of that perfume which I owned back in like 2012 or 2013 when it first came out . The Jasmine note definitely coming strong after about two hours and a whole lot during the dry down .",07/07/25 20:55,Foxiiroxii
London Burberry,"Everyone is saying jasmine for this but I feel like rose is more prominent, which surprised me as I have always thought that I do not like the scent. Maybe it is the citrus freshness accompanying. It is comforting, sophisticated -- not bold however shows that you put effort. Can easily be a day to day perfume but not much. Would I purchase? Maybe. Is it good enought to be a signature scent? Maybe not.",07/07/25 00:39,aslaydiin
London Burberry,Ahhhhhh as a pure poison lover… this is not what i expected.. The tuberose here reminds me of the tuberose in gucci bloom that rotten flower smell and this is not what the notes say… i get a minty tangy rotten tuberose no jasmine for me honestly i really wanted to like it but that is not my thing… 3/10,07/01/25 11:00,Onlyclean

London Burberry,"Wow, this really is a jasmine bomb. I keep going back and forth with this one. Sometimes I like it a lot and sometimes it’s just too much for me, too sweet, indolic and dense. But just when I think decluttering, I smell it again and notice it’s too nice to declutter. 😏
It reminds me of Flora Gorgeous Jasmine. But that one is lighter, fresher and greener. And FGJ has mandarin instead of clementine and tangerine. Clementine can be tricky on my skin and I think it is the note that sometimes bothers me a bit in this frag. But fortunately it fades away rather quickly.",06/09/25 08:37,Scentaholic74

London Burberry,"London is a cool, dewy floral, with zesty mandarin for a touch of freshness. Stays pretty much the same throughout its 5-6 hours wear with arm's length projection. The packaging is simple yet elegant with a square bottle wrapped with a piece of Burberry fabric. Safe, simple and unassuming so should be great for work, but for more special events you might want something with more character.",06/06/25 01:54,fragrantbarbie
London Burberry,Almost identical to Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine.,05/30/25 21:28,stargoose
London Burberry,"I’ve gone back & forth with my opinion on this fragrance a lot. I love the main notes - Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Tangerine, Musk. But there’s something about this that is just too mature smelling even for me (I’m 34). There’s a sharpness to it too, which I personally do not mind but I’m aware that something like this could very easily give those around me headaches & that makes me apprehensive to wear it.

It is woody, but not in a creamy way. It’s very dry. I don’t get any brightness or juiciness in this except for maybe the first 5 minutes. It eventually transforms into a dry sharp woody jasmine with some muskiness. I love Jasmine but I wish this had a bit of sweetness. Overall it’s just okay & definitely only suitable for fall & winter.",05/26/25 16:49,Glyceryl
London Burberry,"OH ok...first impressions: I'm running through the forest by my house as a kid. Im going to see if the honeysuckles have bloomed yet and I think I already smell them blooming off in the distance. I run by a freshly bloomed rose bush on the lawn as Im heading into the forest and I pause to smell the one new rose thats bloomed, then I keep running. I immediately pull the snack I brought in my pocket out and start to eat an perfectly ripe orange/tangerine as the juice runs down my hand. I run by a field of jasmine and like Dorothy does in the field of poppys, I pass out in the jasmine. When I wake up I finish eating my orange, but the honeysuckle vine is calling my soul. I then get up and keep running...that honeysuckle was the reason for this whole adventure in the first place. I finally arrive at the honeysuckle vine. I spend hours upon hours pulling the honeysuckle flowers off and eating the one drop of honeysuckle juice in each one. It smells beautiful. It tsstes beautiful. Then as I walk home covered in the smell of honeysuckle juice I pass a freshly fallen sandalwood limb that has ever so slightly disrupted the dirt when it fell (this is the patchouli, and I despise patchouli unless its Chanel's patchouli, but not to worry because a master perfumist like Ropion knows women don't want to smell like a headshop and obliques us with just a touch of it to round this vision out).

This scent reminds me of my childhood (though by no means a child's perfume), running wild and free through my parents lawn and then into the forest next to their property. Paynight below me is right. For me, honeysuckle is the dominant note. Then orange and Jasmine then a hint of rose/peony (my nose picks up peony as just a sharper, fresher rose) in the back. This one reminds me of when I'd shove my face into a vine of honeysuckle towards the end of summer as they're falling off the vine they're so ripe. This is a piece of art...this is a Dominque Ropion. Must love flowers, the olfactory fragrance pyramid, and very well rounded perfumes as opposed to the random ingredients for baked goods spilled on yourself all at once to form a linear gourmand. I love both. But when I want to smell like the queen of the forest fairies🧚🏼? I'd wear this. I'd put this firmly in the ""wifey"", MILF, elegant, classy, sexy, grown woman category. I'd wear this all year around, day or night.
Edit: compared to perfumes today? The longevity is eternal and the sillage? My husband can smell me across the room (and he likes what he smells). It's been a LONG time since I could spray a perfume in front of me and walk through it and that last me all day but this is one. This 3.4oz will last me so long it'll probably be passed down to my daughter when I die it performs so well. Most perfumes today have to be oversprayed directly on your person for them to last til the end of dinner. Even the super expensive ones. Not this one. I do not remember the girls wearing this when it first came out in 2006. Hell no. I remember Juicy Couture, Britney Spears' Curious (if you couldn't afford, or didn't know about, the far superior Ralph Lauren Blue for women in its hayday before reformulation), Victoria's Secret Love Spell body mist, so many other VS body mists, and if you were a prep with a lil money, Clinique Happy. But, not this...a newly released Burberry by Ropion may have been too expensive for the teen girls in my public high school. It doesn't spell like something a child/teenager would want to wear though. Not sweet like food enough like JC and not aquatic enough like Aqua Di Gio at all to put it in that era's fragrance fad. Save yourself the $140 they're charging for this 19 year old perfume on Amazon, and by God use an outlet fragrance retailer like perfumelux or The Perfume Fragrance Empire on eBay, FragranceNet, and pay $30USD. Trust you will get the authentic product those 3 retailers. They have been in business about 20 years, have over a 1.5 million reviews and sit at an over 99% satisfaction rate.

London Burberry,"This is my hidden gem.
I have Burberry Goddess, and am well acquainted with the rest of the range. I love most Burberry fragrances, and understand why they're so popular - however, nothing can beat London for its relatively inexpensive price point.
I've had it for years, and will never grow tired of it. On first application, it seems a little synthetic or chemical, but if you allow it to settle for a minute, the beautiful honeysuckle note will emerge and the fragrance will begin its transition into something much more refreshing. Notes of jasmine and peony are very prominent. London is a very sweet, very floral fragrance, but I do not find it overpowering, even despite its strength. Rather, I think it's sophisticated and refreshing. It's perfect for a date or a night out.
If you're a fan of sweeter scents like me (think Giorgio Armani My Way Nectar), I think there's a good chance you'll enjoy this. For what is a very low price for Burberry, it's not a tremendous risk either way.",04/24/25 19:50,alexisshegog
London Burberry,"Hm, it’s hard for me to imagine that someone could hate this scent. I think it’s very safe, inoffensive and classy.
For me, it’s mostly jasmine with a hint of rose and citruses. I expected it to be more sweet than fresh, whereas I got the latter. For me it’s better :) but it also has a hint of sweetness in it if you’re into it, it’s just discreet:)
Nothing groundbreaking or super original, but I can’t deny that it’s elegant, feminine and probably liked by many.",04/24/25 03:51,Punika

It seems alluring since its Burberry, but honestly as I experimented with the gifted perfumes this wasn't my favorite...I would wear it though, and everytime I decide to take it out of my storage box and sniff it it brings me back to the days when I used to wear it...So I guess it is quite memorable. But I wouldn't purchase again--its not too girly, not too sweet, not too warm, one of the commenter's said it would smell good in cooler weathers which is true...Again I feel this perfume doesn't have a personality",03/15/25 19:41,greentea67

London Burberry,"This perfume made me rethink how I label perfumes with styles or appropriate ages.

When I first got it I thought it seemed dated and like it's for someone older. It reminded me of the jasmine heavy perfumes used by my lovely grandmother and her friends. But my daughter, who was probably 10 at the time, got a whiff and was delighted by it. She said it smelled perfect on me and that if I didn't want it, she'd like to have it. It occurred to me that she'd likely never smelled anything like it before. She'd of course have none of the associations I have with it and her feelings about it are independent of any bias. I tried to sense it with her fresh nose, and she was right. It is so sweet with such a round, floral beauty.

It's not my style - I prefer a more soapy floral and this is quite honeyed - but it is something I reach for occasionally when I'm looking for something different. I'd love smelling it on someone else.",02/15/25 07:09,Indignatious83
London Burberry,"I highly disagree with the comment two below- this is green and watery for sure with light wet lush florals. It’s fresh and bright and just all around pleasant. Smells best in cooler weather. I think it’s delightful and very feminine. It’s well blended and dewy. It kind of smells like ink. You know when a pen leaks? It has that smell but more spring floral.
The dry down is musky candy. Florals always turn to sweet candy on me so I like it. I might keep a small bottle around cuz florals go very well with my chemistry.",02/03/25 11:10,Gemsense

London Burberry,"Cheap and obnoxious smelling low quality jasmine.

So insistent, sticky, and tacky. And lingers on for HOURS. HUGE BLIND BUY REGRET. Nothing, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, masculine or gender-bending in this as others here for some reason proclaim. It is not respect-evoking, nor is it a photo-realistic jasmine. No green or watery quality to discover here that should be associated with jasmine and/or London.

No citrusy brightness. No rose of any sort. No woods anywhere to be found.

And it allows absolutely no room for betterment by layering it with this or that... it would only compromise and contaminate a better perfume or olfactory blend.

Smells NOTHING like Pure Poison or Boucheron Jaipur Bracelet. Lacks the coldness, green quality, milky smoothness, and the polish of those two exquisite masterpieces. And Jesus del Pozo in White? Not even in the same galaxy. Now THAT was a masculine-leaning cold-as-ice barbershop white floral that I miss dearly.

In fact, the drydown of this mess is identical to the wretch that is CK Beauty. Hate this juice when it gets called 'CK Beauty'; hate it when it (apparently also) gets called 'London'.

Basic rations as a cheesy abhorrent white floral.


PS: If you absolutely MUST own this abomination, at least buy Beauty. Its sculptural sublime bottle is truly a work of art. This one is a glass block wrapped in a poly-something rag...",01/28/25 18:54,pasha

It’s a pleasant tangerine-y jasmine. Not as strong as the (not similar but same family-ish) L’Interdits I own, but nice all the same.

It’s quite a quiet performance so I think it may end being an office or workday scent for me.

I think I’ll happily work my way through this bottle but never repurchase. Pleasant, unremarkable, nice.",01/24/25 10:24,Gillzathrillza
London Burberry,Strange no one notices that it’s better and very similar to super expensive and overhyped Ella K Camellia. Check it out. Camellia seems more screechy and rougher from the start.

FD is more sunny and bright, more youthful and cheerful in my opinion. I’m guessing due to the peach. Burberry London is more serious, a little bit melancholy and matronly, in my opinion and definitely a hair spray vibe. It’s mainly honeysuckle, jasmine and musk in London.

London Burberry,"Best honeysuckle ever!

Burberry London begins with the tender sweetness of honeysuckle, like the first kiss of sunlight on a quiet morning. But just as the warmth of spring unfolds, a sharpness lingers in the air—a cool breeze cutting through the floral sweetness, reminding you that beauty is never without depth. As jasmine joins the delicate dance, it layers a richer, more sensual note, enhancing the elegance of the honeysuckle without overwhelming it. And as the scent fades, musk and sandalwood wrap around you like the evening’s embrace—soft, yet unforgettable.

A fragrance that dances between softness and strength, timeless yet always fresh.",11/22/24 04:20,pfelis
London Burberry,Quite likeable jasmine and tangerine fragrance. Nothing bad but was not interesting enough for me to keep it after wearing it a few times.

London Burberry,"♣ MBTI ♣ ESTJ 💼 – Confident, put-together, with a touch of nostalgia.
♣ Character ♣ Regina George 👠💅 – Sharp, polished, with a hint of sweetness.
♣ Wear Style ♣ Office to weekend 🏙️🍸 – Best for a woman who can balance work and play with ease.


London Burberry for Her is like a nostalgic trip back to the early 2000s—a mix of 2000s grownup fragnances and Alien with a sophisticated twist. It reminds me of a woman working in finance during that era—sharp, stylish, and always ready for a girls' night out afterward. The fragrance has that same bold sweetness but with a dry edge that makes it feel a bit too sharp for regular wear.

The standout for me is the honeysuckle note, which adds a lovely, sweet, floral touch, softening the otherwise dry composition. It’s pretty, and I can see why many enjoy it—especially if you're into bold, honeyed florals. But it’s definitely not an everyday fragrance for me; it’s too dry and almost makes me want to sneeze from the sharpness at times.

It's great for a night out or special occasions when you want to stand out a bit, but wearing it regularly might be a bit much. Overall, I’d rate it moderately positively—definitely a good pick if you want something reminiscent of that *early-2000s finance boss* aesthetic, but it might not be the best for all-day wear. 💼👠",11/10/24 10:22,Heliotrope72
London Burberry,"It’s a nice perfume. But even though it’s kind of fresh and sweet, it’s also quite dry and sharp to my nose so i didn’t enjoy it that much. It’s more like a classic perfume.

London Burberry,"This takes me straight back to my hedonistic days of yore gallivanting around London. I never had this perfume myself; my signature scent was Armani Code back then, but someone that I was close to must have worn this as when I smelt this recently it was like I had been transported back in time to 2007. The sense of nostalgia was so strong that it actually unnerved me. It’s mad how fragrance can do that to you.

I love the combination of the floral and citrus notes in this and I think if you like these types of notes (especially jasmine) chances are you will like this. It’s bright and sexy and just gives off good vibes. Definitely full bottle worthy in my opinion, even if purely for nostalgia purposes!",11/03/24 10:21,Mandie731
London Burberry,"This is a jasmine bomb! But the sweet kind, not the one that turns into pee when it dries down.

I am a jasmine fan, however, I can see how most people find this type of white floral scent disturbing/too mature.
It is not that the perfume itself smells stale, old, vintage or anything like that.
I believe it is the stereotype we have regarding strong jasmine scents.

If I would care less about what my husband and people around me like, this would be probably a great everyday perfume for me in spring (and maybe even the colder months).

I tested this on paper only and can still smell it 24 hours later (it is faint, but it is there).

Feels very adult, very self-assured, sort of reminds me of staying in someone else's home, bundling in clean sheets and taking a bath with foreign floral soaps.

I had high hopes for the tiare but I don't get that note at all. Overall, this is a nice classic fresh floral scent and good projection for about 3 hours. The drydown is barely noticeable as a skin scent and I would say it's like a fresh musk. I get the addictive creamy floral in the air but it just doesn't come across that way on my skin.

London Burberry,"The smell of happiness on a sunny day. This perfume is one of the most underrated perfumes on the market. It's giving timeless; it's giving joy; it's giving jasmine bomb; it's giving fresh and funny. To my nose, it's an exciting and unique mix of jasmine, honeysuckle, and citrus with depth, and I guess it's the patchouli/sandalwood combo? It's sweet, but honeysuckle sweet with a fresh twist as I do not perceive tiare flower. It's not a linear scent; sometimes I get jasmine; later I get the clementine, and somehow, if I focus, the honeysuckle; it's never the same feeling at each sniff I get throughout the day. A bright and happy perfume for a colourful and happy day, a mood lifter, a best friend you giggle with and is hugging you all day long. Versatile as long as it's used in good weather, I do not see myself wearing such a bright and pleasant perfume on rainy days. This is sunshine during the most pleasant weather day in a bottle.

I still have my mom’s first bottle because I loved playing with the fabric around the bottle.",06/12/24 08:32,Futonbean

London Burberry,"Back to the basic and gorgeous scents of the 80's, 90's and early 2000's. They last, they are different, they are memorable, they are distinct.... there are so many today that smell the same. I'm opening the old stash in the back of my closet and bringing those older babies to the front line now. They need to be cherished and shown off for their uniqueness. :)

Burberry London is one of those babies. Just amazing....still, after all these years.",06/03/24 15:40,Elsee

London Burberry,My favorite inoffensive work scent. This is what I would imagine a rich british lady to smell like. Smells like generational wealth. It’s an easy go to although on my skin it lasts 4 hours. This is perfect for people who are not into gourmand scents and just want a fresh perfume that could be worn everyday and anywhere.,05/29/24 14:16,scentbias
London Burberry,"I gave her so many chances, I forgave her over and over. I wanted to love her, she's named after a city that opened my young, innocent eyes and left me with a lifetime of fond memories. I wanted her to take me back to Primrose Hill and those days of disposable income, weekends in Paris and meeting my Sloane girlfriends on Sundays in Covent Garden. I wanted to relive it all. Instead the only memories stirred were of a cheap toilet spray my Nan used. The disappointment. The heartbreak. I will probably give her another chance to prove me wrong.",05/20/24 01:03,Lisafrompaps

It's strong enough but not too strong and it lasted on me all day (it disappeared quickly from my skin but I smelled it all day from my hair, actually I could still smell it after washing).

London Burberry,"Usually when I smell a perfume it takes a while to decide whether I like it or not, but this one was WOW. Sniffed it, bought it. How can you not love the smell of honeysuckle? It has such an unique smell, classy, a bit tangy and vintage but not overwhelming. It does hit you slightly as the toothpaste smell does, but not in a bad way (its not minty). Id say it can be a pretty safe blind buy for those who love white flower fragrances. I wish i could wear it all the time but its a bit bold for summer and spring, i associate it with a chill theater night, wearing a long cozy coat and enjoying the smell of honeysuckle around the city gardens.",04/30/24 05:19,iasm47

OK scent.",04/20/24 06:14,captchapple

London Burberry,"This makes me feel lika a sophisticated british lady, in a good way! The scent feels classy but not too mature. It’s a strong floral but the rose really hides behind the jasmin so it doesn’t get that old vibe. Would recommend that you try it first though, this fragrance might not be for everyone. But I like it!

I sprayed this before going to work and when my stepdaughter came home a while later she asked her dad ”who smells lika an old lady here?!?” hahah… But I love it so it’s going nowhere!",04/17/24 09:18,sandraaalindgren

You find yourself in a charming suburb, with rows of tidy houses and well-kept gardens. The rain is tapering off, and you're out for a stroll, wearing your Burberry waterproof trench coat, a silk scarf, and a coordinated umbrella. It's a weekday, but by some strange circumstance, you're not at work that day.

London Burberry,"I’m a huge fan of florals and have recently been coming to enjoy white florals due to some Elizabeth Taylor perfumes I recently got. While I love them, they do have a kind of dated feel to them. However, London by Burberry manages to feel so sophisticated and modern. I’m absolutely obsessed with it. The Tiare flower in the dry down is so gorgeous. Truly such a clean, feminine scent thats perfect for everyday. I might have just found my new signature scent. i love it that much",03/19/24 22:27,JoannaV22
London Burberry,"I almost bought it, luckily I waited until tester dry down on my skin, and sincerely it was like a male perfume on my skin. I don't know why, maybe because sandalwood with musk.

London Burberry,"Imagine jasmine wrapped in a hazy fog of tiare flower, and when your nose goes searching for the jasmine you knew was there (because you just smelt it, didn't you?), you find it disappeared in a licorice-y pool outside the English Gardens while you were drinking orange pekoe...

Clean, plush & opulent jasmine... I've come back to this one after awhile, and I had forgotten how good it is - another Dominique Ropion gem (signed by DR & Jean Marc Chaillan). I was craving a scent like this, looking forward to spring. The white-florals are blended so beautifully here - I'm a fan of the way Mr. Ropion blends white-florals. Opening with a bright burst of honeysuckle & tangerine with hints of rose, but already the buttery & succulent tiare-jasmine combo is swelling through. As it transitions to the heart, the white-florals come even more forward with peony adding to the velvety plushness & clementine boosting the fruity-citrus facets. At this stage it takes on a more opulent white-floral feel, and the tiare here is not quite beachy but still buttery, while jasmine is clean & citrus-y. This all rests on a sandalwood, musk & patchouli base that keeps the plush white-florals going for well beyond average performance with gorgeous projection. This isn't a dupe of anything, but at times I catch reminders of other Dominique Ropion white-florals. This is a must-try for lovers of white-florals, and a longtime love for me. Enjoy!

Update 07/20/24: sprayed this on the back of one of my hands this morning. It's just as beautiful as ever. Classic, gorgeous, multi-faceted jasmine scent that's at the same time traditional & contemporary. Beautiful, velvet-y sillage aided by peony. Still a love.",02/28/24 06:40,suzanne_ronald

I'm not good at all in recognising the notes of any fragrance, however I know what I like and what I don't. Whenever I like a fragrance, turns out it has predominantly white flowers (especially jasmine). It was the same this time. Ever since, London is my absolute favourite and the only perfume I cannot stay without.

Then as it dries down jasmine is in the forefront and you start to get the musk, sandalwood and patchouli. It is a little bit reminiscent to the original Juicy Couture fragrance.

Final stage is just a nice woody Jasmine with some warmth. I don’t feel too strongly one way or the other about this perfume. It’s an easy to reach for, put together scent.

Side note: This layers really nicely with Versace Eros edp",02/21/24 14:26,Glyceryl

London Burberry,"I love this perfume! One of the best floral/jasmine scents I've encountered so far, and it's reasonably priced.

However, I recommend only wearing this perfume in humid weather as I have noticed that the dry down of this perfume tends to change depending on how much humidity is in the air. For example, in dry weather I really hate how the dry down ends up smelling, it makes me think of cockroach spray and poverty (if you're unfortunate enough to know, you know) and it makes me gag a bit. In more humid weather however, it smells more like what it's meant to smell like, which is a woody/musky/patchouli scent.

I guess it would make sense that this perfume smells best in humid weather as the UK is known for its year round humidity. I live in a drier climate so I don't wear this perfume as often as I'd like.",02/09/24 08:34,dreaming-in-moss

London Burberry,"I finished a 30 ml bottle then moved on to other scents and forgot about this gem. I recently repurchased it in a bigger bottle after remembering why I love it so much. It's so, so well blended and you can now find it on sale easily (I paid around 20 euros for 50 ml). I'm currently trying to reduce my collection to under 10 perfumes, and I'm keeping London permanently as my fruity-floral pick, mostly because it's so versatile. I love the opening, the tangerine is so well-blended with the honeysuckle but I don't get rose at all. The body is also lovely, jasmin and clementine, wow! What a combo! I would have loved to smell more tiare but actually none of the notes stand out on their own, which is awesome. I get why people have said it's similar to L'Interdit, it shares some vibes and it's probably what Givenchy would come out with if they wanted to add a freshie flanker to that line (let's not forget that London came out over 10 years before the current L'Interdit version so who is copying who :D). If I were to compare it to something I'd say it's more similar to Boucheron Quattre but much more sophisticated and longer lasting. Another thing that made me fall for this one is that it does not go to the dry-down quickly. Surprisingly, it works great in colder weather, definitely not a summer scent but I love it as my autumn and also winter fragrance when I'm not in the mood for hardcore woody-vanilla-amber bombs, almost like a pick-me-up when you're missing spring too much :) No huge projection but you get 4-6 hours on the skin (more on clothes). I associated it with preppy chic outfits, some oxford shoes and a nude trench coat, on a rainy but not too cold autumn day. Feminine but not too delicate, girly but not immature (on the contrary, it has a sophistication to it that any similar crowd-pleasers don't), overall an awesome purchase and even a safe blind-buy I would say, for somebody who you would describe as ""bubbly"".",01/18/24 11:38,cristinap9587

London Burberry,"One of the freshest, most beautiful Jasmine - Honeysuckle scents I've ever tried.

A beautiful, luxurious floral scent with British style from Burberry. It's like a trip to London full of fog and drizzle, with beautiful White Flowers gardens behind ancient paths. Both classic and modern, I imagine this is a lady wearing an elegant white or black dress like Audrey Hepburn, holding an umbrella and walking through a flower garden in the rain. Wear Burberry London on rainy days, buy a bouquet of fragrant flowers, take a walk through the ancient streets and you will see how magical this scent is. The whole of ancient, beautiful London falls into your eyes, as if London on rainy and foggy days smells like this.

Rating: 9/10, although the longevity on my skin is quite poor, every time I wear Burberry London, people compliment me and ask “What perfume smells so good?”. This is my Signature Scent, I hope Burberry never stops producing it!!!",11/19/23 12:09,thaochipnd

Later, I got more of the citrus brightness which really balances out the heavy jasmine and keeps it from getting too intense and weepy (like, say, Gucci Bloom, which is just too much indolic jasmine). Very pretty.",11/15/23 05:40,Grimdeux
London Burberry,"A very successful blind buy. Saw this on offer in TK Maxx for £19 for the 30ml so decided to give it a try. I have many perfumes but I seem to always come back to those with white flowers and in particular tuberose. This is like a breeze of white flowers, a mere hint with a dash of citrus. There is something very comforting about it. It does have a bit of a fresh shampoo scent but in a good way. I am now going to buy the 100ml. A great every day fragrance.",11/05/23 02:53,Danifresh

London Burberry,Today mainstream notes that still make you feel very extraordinarily beautiful. I wore it once with a cold limiting my sense of smell. I randomly caught a whiff of the scent and fell in love all over again. The first spray delivers as much as the dry down. Very gorgeous everyday fragrance.

I'd say though it does feel mature, like a white woman in her older 40s/50s, so I tend to not reach for it much anymore. It is sweet, but for me the roses are kind of overpowering and I don't tend to get anything past the top/middle notes. Doesn't smell very citrus either, almost completely floral for me.",08/31/23 07:56,yayimhere

London Burberry,"I can see partially why people compare Burberry London for women to Pure Poison, since they are both white florals and they both have citrusy nuances to them. Burberry London for women though isn't as woody or as citrusy as Pure Poison is to me.

I mostly smell both jasmine and honeysuckle in this fragrance, with honeysuckle being the more predominant note of the two. I get a hint of citrus from the tangerine and the clementine in this but not a lot of it and I can't really smell the rose, peony or sandalwood in this at all. I also have to say that I've never smelt tiare flowers before so I can't comment if I smell it here or not, though I have heard people say it's apparently similar in smell to jasmine? This fragrance also becomes slightly more citrusy towards the drydown on me.

I find this perfume very feminine, elegant and youthful in an innocent kind of way. I could imagine a beautiful late medieval French princess in a wildflower garden wearing this in the spring while all of the flowers are in bloom and the sweet bees and beautiful irridescent hummingbirds are pollinating the flowers. The princess would be wearing a blue dress with a fleur de lys pattern and an ermine fur trim and she'd be plaiting her long wavy strawberry blonde hair, while decorating it with small honeysuckle and jasmine flowers.

I got about 8 ½ hours of wear on my skin and I had moderate sillage, giving me a very nice scent bubble. I got this perfume for a song and it was a very good blind buy at Chemist Warehouse of this discontinued perfume... there was no tester at all but I was able to buy it for $50 AUD! I really wanted a perfume that actually smelt like honeysuckle flowers and though not a soliflore, this comes fairly close to it.

Because of all of that, I'd give this perfume an excellent 9/10. It's a beautiful white floral and honeysuckle girl's dream come true!",08/18/23 02:13,WhiteFlowerPrincess
London Burberry,"Dear @ Lotte_Liese, thank you so much. Your explanation is truly helpful. Yes I believe that Burberry London gave me such a classy feelings, and it's much more elegant, that what I remember from 10 years ago when I tested it back then. But I needed a help to refresh my memory 😊 thank you again",07/24/23 17:42,Rama Rama
London Burberry,"Dear Rama Rama, believe me when I say that Gucci bloom and Burberry London do not share the same DNA, they are similar in that they both share the jasmine note, but they express this note differently.
Burberry London opens as tangerine citrus fresh and then the two main notes- honeysuckle and jasmine take centre stage. Pink floral notes from rose and peony make appearances but do not overpower the two main notes. The patchouli note is not noticeable until it dries down, but even that is pleasant as it becomes more musky, but still retains its white floral bearing.
Gucci bloom on the other hand is tuberose over done to the point it does not smell like a natural tuberose, there is jasmine, and it can be smelt, but to me it is often overpowered by the tuberose note. Gucci's Bloom was a solid dislike to me, but I very much appreciate the elegance of Burberry's London.",07/18/23 01:43,Lotte_Liese
London Burberry,"Please can someone tell the difference between Burberry London and Gucci bloom 🙏
I know how Gucci bloom smell, but as for Burberry London I had it many years ago I don't recall the smell but I remember tons of Jasmine which is the same vibes cross my mind when I hear Gucci bloom a Jasmine bomb so what's the difference?!",07/06/23 15:16,Rama Rama
London Burberry,"If I smelled this without being awate of the notes I could've sowrn amber would be part of its composition! This is a jasmie forward fragrance with a sweet citrusy opening. The clementine is so realistic, it's one of my favorite parts of the fragrance even if you only get it for a little bit. However, the most enjoyable part to me is definitely the drydown, SO creamy!

Because of that warmth I mistook for amber, I had the idea of layering this with casablanca from Swiss Arabian and oh my god, caramel pairs so well with it! It results in a comforting, classy, not too loud, but yet very interesting scent profile.

I get excelent longevity with this perfume, up to 8-10 hours with just 2 sprays. Projection however, I feel is not that great, and is probably closer to a more intimate kind of sillage.I live in a very warm environment (Mexico) and I still wear this during summer wihtout any issues!

All in all, this perfume is a 10/10 for me! For how divine this smells, you'd expect it to be a more expensive fragrance for sure.",07/01/23 15:33,joexulaje
London Burberry,"I picked this up for a steal at local pharmacy. It is one of those interesting fragrances that smells different each time I wear it, especially with what comes across in the top. Sometimes it is the most delicious tangerine clementine citrus and at other times the very realistic honeysuckle is more prominent.

Ultimately to my nose it dries down to a pleasant jasmine fragrance. I think it is well blended. The citrus departs quickly for me so it is very much a floral dominant fragrance on my skin.

I lived in London for a time when I was a lot younger and I think there are other fragrances from Burberry that evoke the city a lot more. For example Burberry Brit Rhythm. Burberry London is much more, English garden in the summer sun, scent coming off the flowers, while sipping a delicious orange soft drink, kind of vibe.

I look forward to trying it in the really warm weather because it has poor longevity on me in the cooler weather. Still, a lovely refined smelling floral scent that is worth spraying, especially when it can be bought so cheaply.",06/30/23 14:38,Lovescents3
London Burberry,"In my opinion, this fragrance doesn’t match the male counterpart or the design of the bottle. It’s a simple but charming perfume that is very feminine.

This could be worn any season during the day in my opinion, but I think spring - early fall would be best.",06/03/23 22:02,Jscents39

London Burberry,"For me, this is jasmine bomb – on-the-nose, essential-oil level jasmine. Too intense. After a while I can feel honeysuckle and it saves the impression for me. Several hours later, it morphs into tiare with some powderiness from musk. This is a gift for white flowers lovers, and especially for fans of jasmine.

Maybe this one should be worn on rainy days, as many reviews here suggest. Otherwise, might be too sweet. It is elegant and timeless with lifelike representation of flowers, and I do want to love this scent, but I guess I’m not the biggest fan of jasmine – not in this concentration, at least.

London stays on my skin until the evening and lingers in my hair the next morning. With jasmine sharpness gone it’s a gentle and sweet impression. Projection is pretty decent too. I had a chance to smell this fragrance on a colleague, and I caught a familiar scent from across the room, as soon as she entered – sweet and clear, as if wind brought it from blooming shrubs.

Overall, beautiful, but not my cup of tea.",05/15/23 02:21,Julipet

London Burberry,"Clean powdery and creamy office friendly scent.

It is one of those fragrance that is perfect to be a signature office scent. It is elegant, creamy, powdery and long lasting one the clothes a little bit less on the skin, I always take my flanker with me if I wear at work to reapply it when needed.

The creaminess of the Tiare Flower, Jasmine is perfectly combined to the citruses such as the Tangerine and the Clementine, as well as the pink florals such as the Rose and Peony. Making it a girly woman's fragrance. ""Girly Woman's fragrance"" by the flowery tone to it, it is not a childhood reminiscent scent or a childish perfume.
Then you get a subtle depth and powderyness with The Musk, Honeysuckle, Sandalwood and Patchouli. The Patchouli isn't strong on the blend, which, once again, makes me enjoy it's presence like in my other perfumes containing a small and subtle patchouli note.

I highly recommend giving it a try, the overall design is simple yet really elegant with that signature Tartan pattern from the house of Burberry. It smells so elegant and feminine you'll be the talk of the office with such an effortless perfect blend.

It is a 7/10 because it lasts less than 3 hours on my skin, but good on my clothes. The sillage is really decent though.",05/01/23 06:04,Jade-Ange D
London Burberry,"I've been looking for an affordable white floral perfume for the warmer days of spring and I blind bought this based on the reviews written here. For me, though I smell some citrus in the first few minutes of application, this smells mostly of honeysuckle and jasmine and stays that way for the entirety of its life on the skin, which is 3 to 4 hours. I'm still on the fence whether I like this enough to keep the bottle in my collection. Sillage is great and people said they were able to smell me from a great distance but considering I literally dosed myself in London before leaving the house it would be unusual if it was weak",04/27/23 11:22,batuhanavci
London Burberry,"Imagine jasmine wrapped in a hazy fog of tiare flower, and when your nose goes searching for the jasmine you knew was there (because you just smelt it, didn't you?), you find it disappeared in a licorice-y pool outside the English Gardens while you were drinking orange pekoe...",03/26/23 16:54,suzanne_ronald
London Burberry,"I think this type of perfume is set for specific moods if that makes sense? It has something very sophisticated, classic and maybe more vintage feel to it? I usually wear Perfumes depending on my mood, and for this one specifically I enjoy it most on rainy days, fall afternoons, or trips to the library. It has something gentle yet very memorable about it, which is why I adore it a lot! However, I can understand the people who are not a big fan of it, as it is a very specific smell that might be too ""old"" or ""powdery"" for them. I personally adores it and if you are someone who enjoys sophisticated, calming scents I would 100% recommend it",03/22/23 02:39,Aly_03
London Burberry,"I’ve been looking for a good honeysuckle perfume and bookmarked this to buy a full bottle at a later time. I just got into perfume collecting 8 months ago and have plenty of white floral perfumes like Tom Ford Velvet Orchid (magnolia and jasmine), Valmont Jazzy Twist (magnolia and tubereuse), Perris Monte Carlo’s Jasmin de Pays (jasmine), Zara Tokyo (iris), and DKNY Golden Delicious (Lily of the Valley). So I’m not sure if getting this would be redundant for now. I’ll wait until I’ve exhausted one of the others.

Honestly, I’m afraid that this will be a boring mash-up of Penhaligon’s Coveted Duchess Rose, which has rose and mandarin orange, with Velvet Orchid without the rum. But some Burberry perfumes like this one are extremely affordable, as a 50 ml of this goes for £23 on Makeup UK.",03/17/23 19:43,Willowthewisp

London Burberry,"It was a blindbuy for me. I love jasmine and this was on sale so I had to give it a try. It didn't disappoint me. Such a lovely jasmine bomb, sweet, mysterious and clean, almost soapy.
The jasmine is very pretty here, it reminds me of gucci bloom, mugler alien or dior pure poison. (Not the whole scent, only the jasmine, these are pretty different perfumes overall.)
Very long lasting, it lasts all day on my skin and the sillage is amazing as well.
It's maybe a bit dated, but in a classy, timeless way.
I wouldn't say it's a safe blindbuy, but if you like jasmine and stronger, sweeter and somewhat clean fragrances you totally need this in your collection.
It's also signature scent worthy as it has the perfect balance and it's versatile.",03/10/23 12:15,Dori002

London Burberry,"I love to wear this one during spring and summer. On my skin it gives an inoffensive scent of sweet tangerine. Which makes me think of a glass of lemonade during a sunny day. Together with fresh florals of jasmine, tiare flower, tuberose and honeysuckle. I always feel quite energetic and optimistic when I wear it. Defintely one of my ""feel good"" scents. It also has great performance!",03/03/23 23:31,Woodamber
London Burberry,"If you are thinking it’s going to be anything like the pear dessert that is Brit, you are in for a surprise. To my nose, London has a heavy, vintage-y feel to it. It opens with tangerine and settles into clementine, and with having the citrus on top and the middle, you can catch it throughout the wear of the fragrance. Jasmine and tiare flower add a heavy, floral tropical vibe. Sandalwood and patchouli add additional depth. It’s complex for a designer perfume and I enjoy how the notes play out, but not my favorite.",02/28/23 03:14,amg7613
London Burberry,"Burberry London is such a safe, clean and feminine perfume for ladies. It is my daily going-to-the-office perfume because you only need two / three sprays and it will last ALL day long. Personally I love fresh white floral scent and this is one of my overly used perfume for going out (day and night). Some people hates it for being a granny scent maybe because of the white flowers but for me it smells very pretty & sweet (not sugary sweet which is a plus for me). Great quality for its relatively low price point (compared to other designer perfumes). That’s why Burberry London is a Love for me.",02/25/23 18:27,dianaFreebird
London Burberry,"This smells so soapy, like Irish spring soap. And nothing else. However it does last forever and 3+ days on clothes but I can’t get over the Irish spring in it 😂",02/22/23 14:03,Cheyahhcarly
London Burberry,"Me personally loved jasmine fragrance, and I loved this perfume so much!. The scent is beautiful, elegant, and classy. I think this perfume was unisex? since I'm a guy and wearing this. Totally worth to buy!.",02/17/23 00:48,fallonkessler
London Burberry,"I am not crazy about most traditional juicy white florals, like gardenia or tuberose, but I adore tiare flower. On its own this perfume is kind of a lot just because it is almost linear tiare with a sprinkling of musk and sandalwood, but that makes it stupendously good for layering. It can brighten up heavier scents or bring them to the tropics. It is pretty by itself, but for me in my wardrobe it really does a lot of heavy lifting to liven up other scents. The tiare note makes me feel very happy though, it is creamy and sublime, almost cloyingly so, yet it manages to stay on the safe side of that line.",02/14/23 09:05,silverlocusts
London Burberry,"Got myself a bottle recently as I had good experiences with blind buying a few other Burberry perfumes (except for Beat). At first I thought this was a little meh and boring, but I do find myself reaching for this before going to work when I'm not too sure what else to wear, but want to smell professional and polished. So I would regard it as my reliable and trusty work week perfume, with good lasting power and enough interesting notes to enjoy smelling whiffs of it throughout the day. I also like the fabric covering, it's cute, and feels a bit more secure when I'm handling the bottle after putting on moisturizer and won't smudge the glass too!",02/11/23 06:07,Pearlstar
London Burberry,"Quite simply, this is happiness in a bottle for me. Delicate fresh white flowers sweetened with a bit of juicy tangerine and clementines. The rose and patchouli are almost undetectable to my nose, so if you are usually avoidant of those notes I think this perfume will still work for you! The dry down is a soft floral musk and this perfume has great performance with moderate sillage.

I wouldn’t say that I feel particularly luxurious while wearing this, but it does make me feel classy, fresh, pretty and put together! I personally don’t find this to smell mature as some have stated below, but I could see how this might attract a slightly older audience; this fragrance has more of a classic vibe than it’s more youthful fruity floral contemporaries.

Burberry London is inoffensive, fresh, delicate, slightly juicy and well balanced. Suitable for most occasions and seasons, but really shines in the spring and summer. A little gem in my collection!",02/04/23 12:37,MauveBee93

London Burberry,"A favorite white floral of mine! It's classic for a reason- delicate and feminine, sweet and fresh.

London Burberry,"I so wanted this to be my new favourite, but it smelled like the cerutter/cigars my grandmother used to smoke, smokey leather. No honeysuckle just this salty smoky smell. Totally not what i expected. Smell stayed for a long time and stayed the same. Maybe just a bad chemistry reaction. So glad I did not just blind buy.",12/02/22 07:32,KarenDK
London Burberry,"Burberry London is such a gorgeous fragrance!
It's bright and feminine, uplifting and lasts well. A wonderful harmonious balance of fruity and flowery . She's juicy, with the gorgeous sparkly brightness Tangerine brings to any fragrance, along with a very nicely rounded Clementine without the sharpness it sometimes imparts.
These citrus have a wonderfully creamy, almost cashmerian presence.
Playing an equal and oh so feminine part of the main show are the artistically balanced white florals. Good quality Jasmine and Frangipani like Tiare flowers of excellent quality are the lead sisters here, rich and sweet but by no means sickly.

The patchouli is absolutely muted under the rich blanket of long lasting fruity florals. I like patchouli, but for those who don't, worry not, as it is balanced well and plays fair with the sweet musk and rounded sandalwood, making for a fairly linear fade out, although the Rose makes a little more noise here than at the juicy start.

A beautiful fun sweet juicy white floral without being sugary, without being gourmand, without smelling done or generic, and is absolutely not cloying.
It's a bright happy go lucky fragrance.

I have it and love it so much I bought it for my niece, who also loves it.

I think Burberry London is a safe blind buy for a feminine fruity white floral summer/spring fragrance. A crowd pleaser with real character and uniqueness.
Definitely safe to buy for a woman with a bright youthful personality, and at a great price point.",11/29/22 19:55,Kheila
London Burberry,"Really lovely find. I feel like these days you don’t get too many straight-up floral fragrances (they’re usually floral woody, citrus floral etc) but this puts the rose and jasmine at the forefront. Very feminine, perhaps slightly mature but I’d say anyone 25+ can get away with it. Leans slightly more to cold temps but it’s pretty versatile; I could see it in summer or winter and day or night. Great longevity and sillage. Seems to be selling pretty cheap so great value for money.",11/22/22 19:55,arizonaruby
London Burberry,"Picked this up by accident, had I tested beforehand, I would have never bought it. Now I can say that I am happy for this accident as it definitely grew on me. For me this will always remain a winter scent - representing the anticipation of the spring and the times the sun grows stronger melting the snow. I don't like wearing it on rainy days though, somehow it feels too much. It is a veryyyy long lasting and mature scent :)",11/22/22 11:45,antonia33
London Burberry,"I tested Touch Weekend Her and Her Intense by Burberry and I liked all of them. Now I am eager to test London. Though it is an old scent (from 2006), the reviews show it is still popular. I will edit when I try it, the name London is kinda enchanting",11/22/22 06:16,marinejuana
London Burberry,"Disagree with ppl calling it mature. It definately suits all ages and I remember the school corridor smelling like Burberry London in 2017. Every girl whore it!
The perfume is very inoffensive and powdery. You can sense the fruits in it, but not in a crispy clean way. I'd say the musk/jasmin/florals are the most outstanding. You don't really sense the citrus notes at all.
The best way to describe this scent is comforting, like a warm blanket.
10/10, this fragrance will forever be in my heart.",11/04/22 22:58,AttePatte
London Burberry,"I really want to love this, but it's just so powdery that it makes my throat itch. It does dry down to let the white florals come through, but it has a bitterness to it that I just can't love. It might be the musk. Definitely not a delicate scent at all. Siliage and longevity are great though. An occasional perfume, not everyday.",11/03/22 06:02,GiGiRi
London Burberry,"I started wearing this perfume at 15 years old and still love it 6 years later. I know some people think its quite mature and more stable for 50+, but I wholeheartedly disagree. I think the patchouli and musk with the white florals make it wearable for any age. It's very versatile and inoffensive. This used to be my everyday scent for years. I have always gotten so many compliments whenever I wear it, people said it was addicting. Personally I'm into niche fragrances, but this is one that will always have a place in my collection. If you're thinking about buying it I highly recommend. Maybe do a skin test first, but it's simple enough to be a blind buy (in my opinion).",11/01/22 08:30,Sunny_spritz
London Burberry,Powdery white florals with bitter musk and very little fruit. It's very mature smelling suitable for someone 60+. The silage is a BEAST and this is very long lasting.

London Burberry,"I may have reviewed this already, but I finished my bottle of this and have to have another asap! I’ve tried a lot of different fragrances since buying this last year and it’s one of my very favorites.
I mistakenly bought this, thinking it was Brit, but the reviews were good so I tried it. At first, it was a strong like. Then I wasn’t sure. It was different than most fragrances I had or had tried. As time went on, I grew to love it. It feels classy and elegant to me. It’s the perfect scent to spray on a scarf or cozy sweater. I think it works for an everyday scent but would be very appropriate for a wedding, dinner with the in-laws, etc. It’s slightly sweet and fruity at first, but not juvenile. It’s cold, but approachable. I thought it would be a spring/summer scent until I read that it shines in cold weather. And it does!
The longevity is about 5-6 hours on me. The silage and projection are moderate. The value is excellent though. Sephora sells a 1.7oz bottle for $85 USD, but you can easily find a 3.3oz bottle under $60. London and Miu Miu led me to discover that I prefer floral woody musks over gourmands.",10/14/22 07:37,GladToBeUnhappy4
London Burberry,"This is a sharp sweet floral and a classic one too.
Good for going out on the crowd not to offend people with your perfume. An office, teachers enclosed space scent. Classic Elegant for me same as the burberry brit edp and edt; an old all time fave.",10/06/22 21:37,jklovesperfumes
London Burberry,"I had a vague memory of London as one of those pleasant crowd-pleasing perfumes that I didn't need and certainly didn't crave at the time. My opinion was positive even if somwhat without definition. I like sunny happy perfumes full of creamy white and yellow flowers and I'm preparing myself to the grey cold weather ahead. So I got a bottle of London.

There is a great possibility that it was shaken to oblivion in transport and probably reformulated too. I didn't recognise it at all. I'm still quite in chock, this smells like bubblegum to me. You know those big, pink, sweet ones that are a mounthful, perfect for making big obnoxious ballons that pop loudly an drive parents and teachers insane. You can not behave in civilized manner whith those in your mounth, no matter your age, you feel insolent and bratty and the need to exercise your jaw nearly to dislocation is overwhelming. Yes, those bubblegums. Nothing to do with today's politicly correct spearmint flawored sugar free little, hm, gums.
Tangerine and clementine are lovely, I'm not sure I recognise any honeysuckle or tiare. Slightly animalic and plasticky jasmine adds another layer of irreverence to the mix. I like it, it makes me feel young and punk, but I don't know if I can stand to wear it. I'm not that person anymore. There is still a possibility that all this screechiness will calm down and enter more stirred than shaken state of existence.",10/06/22 09:51,jazzfan

London Burberry,"My first musk love!! I remember being obsessed with this fragrance when it came out. I would go to the mall often and smell all the fragrances at the department store and this one always made me stop in my tracks. There is just something scrumptious and cozy about this white floral, citrus, and musk blend. It smells divine to me! I wasn't able to get my hands on a bottle as a teen, but did get one a few years ago from fragrance(net). I love wearing this scent in cold weather. I think Burberry London for her is often overlooked nowadays. Don't sleep on this super affordable floral musk!",09/29/22 05:40,realitygreene
London Burberry,"This is a light sweet floral, with a clean musky finish, like a more innocent and less sexy Narciso Rodriguez for her. It lasts well on my skin, doesn't project much, so it would be a very safe scent to wear to work or travel with.
Really cozy but fresh and balanced.
A little gem.",09/22/22 11:33,Marie76
London Burberry,"Learning to love this, it’s really pretty and (as a 22 year old) feels nostalgic for some reason. Maybe some older girl wore this when I was young.

But like someone said below I love really love it when I pair it with a vanilla.",09/15/22 08:22,palencia
London Burberry,"Floral Petrichor

On my skin it smells softly floral with a watery petrichor accord. I didn't expect the petrichor smell or watery notes at all. I don't get any honeysuckle and the citrusy notes are very faint.

A very soapy white floral, this is definitely a fall/winter scent, but it is beautifully soft and timeless. I think almost anyone could pull it off! Not too casual, but still good for everyday wear. This is a perfect signature scent - I don't know why it isn't more popular! To me it is very old Burberry - lots of plaid and khaki colors, classic, almost old-fashioned. I could see someone loving this if they were into that sort of look.",08/30/22 13:30,oliviababovic
London Burberry,"Beautiful . You must like florals to enjoy her. Bright, white floral, that has sharp edges (which I enjoy in this) and there is a detectable juicy citrus undercurrent from the tangerine and clementine. She’s very mature, with a light vintage quality. However, I may not keep this one. Only because I feel this would wear me. It would have to be a special occasion, like college graduation, formal wedding, anniversaries at a five star Michelin restaurant. In conclusion she’s bright, juicy, mature and EXPENSIVE.",08/25/22 08:15,Cristidarling6387

On my skin I get mostly tangerine, clementine, tiare flower and some woody notes, in the backround also other flowers. I can smell coconut, I think that comes from tiare flower. Not everyone mentioned tiare flower, but I can smell it clearly. This can be worn every season and every time of the day. Some years ago I didn't like it, but I guess my taste wasn't so developed then, now this is love. I think it will be one of my favourite scents. I have also Burberry Brit for her, it's also very good, but this is better.",08/23/22 08:25,anitasaastamoinen

London Burberry,"A slightly citrusy white floral that reminds me of body spray. The tangerine/clementine note is the best part, as it is very realistic, but the rest of the scent is a tad generic.

London Burberry,"Okay so...

I ran from this originally because I've been running from London, because I've grown bored of it after literally growing up there and spending weekends right in the centre.

I'm a Londoner but I'm also pretty extra.
And that's why this fragrance is perfect.

The obscene florals, and almost cheeky tangerine... honestly it just plays with you, flowing through and around the honeysuckle.

What people don't realise is that London is pretty humid, so you need something light and breezy to carry you through.

Combined with some linen (linen suit if we're going to work), this is a blast of refined British elegance.

You can dress this fragrance up and down.
It can be trashy sweet, like the old 00s Indie scene, or refined enough to go to an Oxbridge Ball or formal x",07/10/22 10:10,mariaakanbi
London Burberry,"This perfume gives me preppy chic vibes. Old money (maybe long lost) and sophistication that sometimes comes with it. When I wear this I feel put together and professional. BUT only 2 sprays for me, this perfume is strong! The scent is light in spirit but has a strong presens.

I get honeysuckle, tangerine and jasmine. For me strong jasmine can be difficult (turns indolic) but in this the strong jasmine stays beautiful. Tiare I don't get, but I think it gives body to the fragrance.

I LOVE this perfume and I will always have it in my collection. I often notice that I smell some white floral scent and start thinking what I would change in it. The result being Burberry London. <3",06/22/22 14:52,LauraSH
London Burberry,"My first bottle of London is soon finished, and will definitely be replaced. I like to buy a new perfume for every new summer vacation of a certain length, and this one was the one I bought to be my companion to Vietnam in 2019 with my husband and kids. I used it every single day, and thus it became The scent of Vietnam. After the holiday I would give the perfume a short break, and use my other fumes again, and when I after a while pull it out again, I get transported to the holiday destination immediately! You should try that. Anyways, London is for me this ultimate happy, carefree, adventurous, smiley scent. It gives me immediate lift-me-up, and the days when I use it, always become brighter and sunnier.

Burberry London will always have a place in my collection and in my heart.",06/20/22 08:38,Katrin77
London Burberry,"London was my signature scent some 13 years ago. When I first sprayed it on I just knew we were meant to be a couple and that was that. I used it exclusively untill I ran out of my bottle.
A few days ago I saw it online heavily discounted so bought it for old times sake. Note to myself: never do it again! I remembered the scent all wrong. I thought it was patchouli heavy - instead it is flower heavy. I remembered it to be spicy - it is sweet instead. Now I find it too mature and don't understand why was my 33 year old self so smitten with it.
Well, I will try it again when the weather turns cool in autumn as it is mainly a cold weather parfume. The performance is still outstanding tho, London lasts long on the skin with good sillage. It is a pity I don't really like it now.",06/19/22 09:34,VargaZsuzsanna

London Burberry,"Ok, I wrote My first review after I first Applied “her” and was overwhelmed by this sharp masculine scent.
Once it mellowed it matured into a pleasant modern floral with lasting power and a hint of fruity sweetness. This is a complex sophisticated thoroughly modern fragrance. Ideal for daytime, maybe at the office or just hanging about.
Don’t judge this fragrance without giving it a chance to mellow. It releases its warmer notes, like musk, sandalwood, patchouli, it becomes quite pleasant.

I had the oddest experience the 2nd time I put it on, I started to pick up on the honeysuckle and couldn't un-smell it. I despise sticky florals, and honeysuckle can be one of them. From that point on I couldn't stand this perfume, all i smell is heavy, cloy, sweet tackiness. Hard pass on this one, it's the only Burberry I dislike this much.",05/29/22 21:38,2Ladybugz

London Burberry,"Fragrance for classy, confident and carefree woman, but more 40+ than for someone 20+. Passed to my mom.

They are long lasting. Honeysuckle and tangerine gives the ""younger"" vibe, but middle notes prominent with jasmine make the scent for someone just a tad more experienced with life than me. Carefree-ness comes from jasmine, too - from my perspective it has tendency to ""invite"" you to smell the perfume more. It does not have the ""suffocating"" phase, like Alien has for me.",05/14/22 08:15,blueally
London Burberry,"I think I just found the scent of my life! Libre is currently my signature for work but I think it’s about to be replaced with this.

London Burberry,"This is the third fragrance from Burberry that's gone in my regular rotation in the last 6 months and I have thoroughly enjoyed that they're very much different from one another. The first was Brit - sweetly punchy and unassuming. Then came Weekend (seems like I'll wear anything Nathalie Lorson created) - herbaceous and rainy. Now there's London. Dominic Ropion has a well-earned reputation and London does not disappoint. I can't speak for how well the name suggests the city bc I've never been, but if this is what it smells like, I'll be moving there shortly.

I adore honeysuckle in perfumes and London begins with a hefty dose accompanied closely by some citrus that keeps things from venturing too far into ""heady"" territory, but it's a struggle. Gentle rose and peony wander in to lift things up a touch, but it's the jasmine that runs the show as the base notes start to become more noticeable and ground the florals in a damp, loamy garden that somehow reads creamy. London remains pretty linear from there. It has staying power and I'll enjoy it as a light floral musky skin scent at bedtime. I'll smell it again when the warm water hits my chest in my morning shower.

London is a keeper bc it's a wonderful, well-formulated, white floral beast and it lasts, without choking out your companions. It's a great value and has also been endeared to me by the compliments my children always give me when I wear it. I find it suiting our cool SoCal mornings and warm afternoons very well this spring. It lifts my spirits and lightens my heart so it'll be a permanent resident in my fragrance cabinet.",05/02/22 16:58,Rcates78

It might be coming from smell of orange and other flowers…The scent is well mixed fresh flowerly, fruity scent with musk. I love it. It rests on my skin long…maybe around 5-6 hours.

London Burberry,对比所谓的“仙女香”ag忍冬，我觉得无论是气味表现还是价格，这只伦敦女都能完爆她。大大方方的湿润白花透着橘的甜美一路芬芳。虽然尾调是普通花麝，也比那支留香贼短中调开始变植物根茎，尾调全是黏腻吲哚的货色强。,04/14/22 06:26,snowwhite_rouge

I will not buy that perfume since I am Romanian and the use of that word is not OK in my culture. This lasts a good 6 hours on my skin and longer on my clothes.

London Burberry,"This is 1 of my fav perfumes ever, I love jasmine and jasmine scented fragrances, this perfume is predominantly a jasmine perfume, the jasmine note in this is beautiful and floral and prominent but not too overpowering at the same time, with a hint of citrus. I find this perfume to be very versatile, suitable for both younger and older women, you can wear it day or night, wear it every day or for special occasions, it really doesn't matter with this particular perfume. Overall this is a beautiful and elegant floral fragrance that's not too overpowering or intimidating, it's 1 of my absolute fav go-to perfumes to wear!",04/04/22 07:09,LindaL100
London Burberry,"This was a blind buy that I desperately wanted — and tried — to like.

It starts off smelling like a pleasant cup of tea with hints of white floral and rose. The jasmine note comes out soon after and stays for the entire duration. It becomes a beautiful and soapy fragrance; it's potently powerful in florals, with just a hint of fruity. And yet, there is something about this perfume that smells somber.

This is what I imagine Lunafreya from FFXV would wear — a woman who conceals her fears and despair with a confident façade. London is the embodiment of a seemingly delicate and kind, yet ambitious and powerful leader who readily makes calculated and convoluted decisions to reach their end goal.

It has a large sillage and is extremely long-lasting. It's fitting for anyone who wishes to wear a strong and powerful, attention-catching fragrance. This is certainly an attractive fragrance on others. Unfortunately, the abundance of white florals is nauseating and headache-inducing to me. I still find it beyond cloying in cold weather. So while I appreciate how well the notes of this fragrance blend together, I cannot stand smelling such a robust fragrance on myself for hours.",03/24/22 14:17,Albedo

I very nearly got rid of my bottle, but wore it the other night and I was completely captivated. It’s creamy and fresh and masculine without being overly macho, not that that’s a bad thing. Timeless is a word you’ll see associated a lot with this one. I do think this would be cloying if oversprayed or in very high heat though.

It may not grab you the way other scents may, but I think that’s why I love it. It’s just a great, classy, scent that can take you from work to an evening out with ease. It has a warmth and at the same time, some of the herbal and citrus top notes are a bit cold. At today’s price, this is a great blind buy for those who have never had it, in my opinion.",06/19/25 18:59,Mountain_Man

Such a classic men's scent. Burberry have some crackers.",06/17/25 11:23,ashroloie
Burberry Men Burberry,"By my estimation, this is one of the most tastefully formulated masculine classics on the market, and I genuinely struggle to find any circumstance where this fragrance would not be appropriate.

It is decidedly masculine — the lavender, mint, and vanilla notes put this squarely in classic barbershop territory — but not overwhelmingly so by any stretch. I am certainly not opposed to these sorts of fougeres, lavender bombs, and traditional superdude fragrances — I am a Drakkar Noir, Fahrenheit, and Polo Green defender as much as anybody else — but this fragrance is more a tweed sports coat than a leather biker jacket, if that makes sense.

There really does seem to be a timelessness with this one that fascinates me to no end. It unquestionably presents like something you would have expected to smell thirty years ago, but by no means does it feel dated like some of its other designer peers (Obsession, I’m looking at you and shaking my head.) They aren’t on the note breakdown, but I feel like you do get a little bit of this tobacco/cinnamon/grapefruit trio that seemingly defined the 80s and 90s — but it is masterfully balanced with a sharp bite of bergamot and fresh florals that keeps it eminently wearable today. I genuinely think any man of any age can pull this off convincingly, and given how rare it is for a man to even wear a scent these days, I actually think it could have some surprising affect as a date night fragrance, too.

It is as safe a reach as there has ever been, but without compromising in complexity, which is nice to see compared to the ever-increasing trend of shorter and shorter note breakdowns from newer releases these days. I find myself picking up different characteristics throughout the day if I smell my wrist — and at least for me, it does in fact perform well enough to do that — and if you’re one to care about such things, I’ve gotten a compliment or seven from wearing this at work, at family dinners, and even relatively serious formal functions.

It is a truly legendary scent in the more moderate, temperate weather that you might see in the spring and fall, but the amber, vanilla, and sandalwood give this a surprising amount of punch as a cold weather performer, and at least for me, the bergamot, jasmine, and mint easily keep this from being overly sweet in all but the most oppressive of summer days; I might not reach for this on a July day in Arizona, all things equal. Anything under 90 degrees, though, and this fragrance stays very, very fresh on the nose.

Performance is not beast mode by any stretch, but at least on my skin, I’ll still catch whiffs of it every now and again at the very end of a work shift (this is easily on my Mt. Rushmore of inoffensive work reaches), which is pretty good for an EDT at this price point. It never projects more than an arm’s length, but it doesn’t disappear all that quickly either, and it lasts about as long as you could expect a fragrance at this concentration and note makeup to last. I almost don’t want this to be a performance monster; I almost think it’s part of the charm of this fragrance, the fact that it truly holds fast to the timeless cliche that a fragrance should be discovered, not announced, and accomplishes this goal without being a total ghost, either.

It might seem strange to wax this poetic about a fragrance that is, by my own admission, relatively average, but it is a representation of my philosophy on wearing fragrance condensed into liquid form — the most common male fragrance is body odour and you do not need to douse yourself in eight sprays of Ultra Male (love that fragrance, by the way, not slander) to bring attention to yourself when you walk into a room. It is vintage but holds up over thirty years later; it is masculine in a way that signals competence and intelligence more than flash and sex appeal; it is a dumb reach that does not come off like one whatsoever.

I think any young person starting a collection should have a bottle of this, honestly. I think that highly of it. It is fresh and warm all at once, and for a novice fragrance enthusiast, maybe one who is hoping to be wallet-conscious and get year-round performance out of it, I can’t endorse it enough…and I’m not even sure it’s my favourite men’s release from Burberry! (I swear they’re not paying me for any of this, I just might be one of the world’s most vocal Burberry Touch truthers of all time. Review incoming for that when I have time to write a novel about it.)

Burberry Men Burberry,"I've been picking up sample vials and decants of all sorts of fragrances these past few months looking for something new and exciting. I keep thinking that my next ""signature"" scent will be something niche. Something that, not too long ago, would have been outside of my price range. I keep coming back to Burberry, though. I wore Burberry Touch for Men for years. I still love it, but it's started to become overly cloying to my nose after the first hour or so. Burberry London for Men is my go-to scent for fall and winter evenings and nights. And now, Burberry Men is my versatile go-anywhere, do-anything scent. The opening is bracing and refreshing and reminds me of stepping outside on a cool spring or fall day when the sun is shining and it's just barely cold enough for breath to condense in the air. I think this scent is particularly suited to those transitional months, but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work well in summer or winter, too.

Out of curiosity, I picked up a 10ml bottle of what I believe to be a 1991 version of this, which has the same (but miniaturized) bottle shape and a very similar smell, but with the old branding - it reads, ""Burberrys of London for Men."" I assume that it, at one point, smelled more or less the same as the modern incarnation of this fragrance, but in the small bottle I acquired, that phantom apple scent so many people get from this is less green and crisp and more brown sweet, and not necessarily in a good way. I figure the bottle I have just hasn't aged well, but it was an interesting difference.",09/29/24 22:27,kqfka

And yes, Montblanc Legend Blue is almost a dead ringer for this..... and as they say, being copied is the highest form of validation.

I think Burberry Men is a perfect fragrance for work, and also super classy for daily wear. If you're into old-school masculine classics, you really can't beat this for the price.

Burberry Men Burberry,"Stay with me because this comparison may sound a bit off-kilter. But this fragrance has always smelt to me like stepping into a time machine and being transported to the peak of the print magazine era in the 90s. This scent is reminiscent of walking into a store in 1998 and opening up the crisp, freshly printed pages of a glossy color magazine or the satisfying moment when you peel the plastic off a newly printed purchase (not that this fragrance smells 'plasticky' at all).

I know printed magazines don't really exist out in the world in large numbers like they used to, so that comparison may be a bit lost on half the people who read this comment. But as a Gen Y this always reminds me of the smell of glossy, freshly printed magazines in the 1990s.

The new reformulated modern version is ""okay"", but trust me, if you really want to experience this fragrance in all of its glossy print glory, go hunt down one of the older bottles packaged in the red boxes.

Man, this also, for some reason, makes me distinctly think of air travel as a kid in the late 90s. Back in the days of 747s and being able to go up into the cockpit as a kid, perhaps I smelt it a lot around that era when I'd fly from Sydney to London to see family. Happy days, an extremely nostalgic scent.

As an aside I have always much preferred this over CK Eternity.

Smells Like: 1960s-era Michael Caine wearing a Mac Coat walking down a London street smoking a cigarette. Effortless swagger but very much in a ""British"" way, more restrained, confident but not American ""brash"". I feel like this fragrance was very much so purposely made for the Square Mile/Canary Wharf ""new money"" set of London finance bros in 1995, possibly in response to Platinum Egoiste being released two years earlier (though to my nose they smell nothing alike).

09/01/24 Edit: I recently reunited myself with the old Red Box (Tartan strip) formula. It's as good as I remember and FAR FAR, FAR superior to the current formula, which was my most recent bottle (I previously owned the Red Box formula in the early 2010s). Guys, go on the grey market and find the Red Box formula with ""Burberrys Of London For Men"" printed on the bottle NOT the current one that just has ""Burberry For Men.""

It didn't seem as drastic between the two as I hadn't smelled the old Red Box original formula in over a decade, but the two versions genuinely DO smell quite different from each other. The Red Box formula has SO much more punch and depth and smells much more smoother which is absolutely insane considering the ancient batch code on the old bottle I acquired. I hate to say this, but the current modern formulation has definitely been butchered from what this fragrance originally was. Testing them both side by side, one on each arm is night and day. If anyone comes across this comment, trust me, go pick up the Red Box batches before they become extinct.",06/09/24 19:58,delancy
Burberry Men Burberry,"This is one of my all time faves. One of my earliest purchases & the first true love fragrance I can remember. I bought this at Macy’s when it first came out. I was broke. I had to have it. I had just enough money to get a small bottle. That bottle turned into many more bottles. I still love it to this day. Clean & classy is what this scent exudes.

I do see some small elements of Platinum Egoiste in this like some have said, but they’re definitely completely different. Burberry is smoother & a bit softer. The cedar pops a little more & has a sweeter tone. Platinum Egoiste is crisper, a bit more sharp, & soapier than Burberry. They both smell like pure class & can be worn with a suit, or a t-shirt & jeans. They’re both very versatile scents so they have that in common.

I will always have a bottle of this as long as they make it. If I ever had a signature scent, this was it. Everyone back in the day knew what I was wearing. I even had cousins who bought it for their boyfriends because they loved it on me lol. It’s funny, but I almost feel like as I got older, this fragrance helped become a gentleman, because it was always there with me. Man, the memories this gorgeous fragrance brings back…",06/08/24 21:57,jsn
Burberry Men Burberry,"Came here to review this as one of my all time favourites. Just clean fresh, 'manly', tobacco note (at least I've always experienced it as tobacco, maybe it's musky ambery oakmossy lavender or something), some very clear bergamot in the beginning. It is honestly not obviously razzle dazzle clever, but I always feel good when I wear this, so perhaps it is. In my head it is a 90's image of what Michael Caine smelled like in the 60's or a Burberry Mac if it were a scent.

With those images in mind, it might be getting a bit old school now, but then stuff in this bracket - like daytime, work, clean, professional is (currently) trending sweeter or more obviously citrus in this kind of area of scents, or kind of WTF like all the blue clones, so this is cool with me, it's not overblown or heavy.

Burberry Men Burberry,"GOOD & SAFE MANLY CHOICE

Burberry for Men is a very masculine EDT. No Burberry perfume has ever achieved this class again. A real insider tip that creates the bridge between modern Burberry sweetener and classic men's EdC in a friendly and, above all, stylish way.
It is indeed a very classy, trustworthy and inexpensive man's scent! You may use it almost all along the year both during the day or night. It has a perfectly balanced blending, more Urbane Latin than typically British. Nevertheless, the scent would certainly suit James Bond perfectly.
It opens fresh and a bit green. It dries down woody with a very smooth development and an above-average performance.
If you have any doubts on what to apply today... this fragrance is always a good and safe choice. It's an excelent Office fragrance.
It's a ""Call Me Sir"" type of cologne.

My opinion: If you are looking for a versatile elegant & manly fougére, you found it. If you have not tried it yet, it will be a nice discovery and almost on a par with Platinum Egoiste or Lalique White... So far it has been unfairly overshadowed by many inferior Burberry ""melanges"".
It's inexpensive, with above-average quality. I do recommend it, and it's safe enough for a blind buy.

Burberry Men Burberry,"I had this back in the 2000s and recently bought my self a bottle and in my opinion it's still smells good today as it did back then, performance it's great, I sprayed it on my hand about 1pm and could still smell it on my hand at around 9pm, if you want a great smelling old school scent, then this is the one, I cant fault it, I would say it's more for men in there 30s/40s I cant see the younger generation going for something like this",02/22/24 02:33,Ricks6982

Burberry Men Burberry,"Burberry for Men, also known as Burberry Classic (red box) is a sweet, creamy woody scent with great longevity and sillage. This only needs a couple of sprays to be noticeable by those around you. I don’t know how this scent has fared with reformulation, as my bottle is over 10 years old. I regret only buying one 30ml before it was reformulated. When I tested on the back of my hand, I get a quality, masculine, barbershoppy fougere that lasts all day. There is a distinct smooth, creamy quality to the woodiness that exudes class and sophistication. I feel this is a great choice for the office or a night out, but it is not a casual scent. It begs to be dressed up.

This is an excellent choice year round, except for spring or summer days above 20 Celsius. In the heat this radiates a bit too much and turns a little musky. There is a natural musky woody base, that plays with amber and vanilla upon dry down. This is not a noticeably sweet scent as focuses more on dusty woods and lavender. This is a recognizable scent that projects about 6+ feet from you, and leaves a trail of sillage that will be remembered. I continually get whiffs of it throughout the day, without having to sniff the scent directly. This is a quality built scent. I appreciate its longevity on my skin as it usually eats fragrance. Mine may be a vintage formulation with more oakmoss, but it projects and performs wonderfully. From what I’ve read below, it does not seem as though it is much weaker with reformulation. There have clearly been several restrictions made by the IFRA since 1995, but I believe the scent is mostly intact. This is a classic woody scent that does not smell as if it were created in 1995. It has a modern feel, but is best suited to men 30 and up in my opinion and experience. This is a compliment getter for the confident, well dressed man. This scent profile should be in every man’s arsenal. It projects a clean, confident, woody, lavender based fougere that lasts nearly until your next shower.

A strong application would be two sprays to the top of your chest/lower throat, and one behind each ear. This gives you a potent scent bubble that shouldn’t choke out others, but beware, this fragrance is rather strong. This is not for every occasion, but could easily be an office worker’s (or any dress shirt employee, like a teacher’s) signature scent, as it is a masculine and inviting fragrance. There is a warmth to this fragrance that comes from the amber and vanilla in the dry down that makes it great for colder days. It has the strength to cut through cold air and leave a trail outside too.

Overall I say this is a classic for a reason, and has stayed in production since 1995 as a staple to men’s fragrance. It is also inexpensive, as 100ml can be found currently for $50 Canadian and under with tax for the current formulation, which I have not smelled, but would like to add to my collection. This certainly smells like a more expensive fragrance. There is a smooth creaminess that is worth waiting for the dry down to enjoy, but you will enjoy every stage of this fragrance journey. I currently have about half of my vintage 30ml and will treasure it along with my other classics.

Scent: 10/10
Longevity: 9/10

Burberry Men Burberry,"*Edit 01/08/24*

Having worn this several times, I would place Burberry Men in the 'gourmand' category moreso than 'woody'

On my skin, thyme becomes the strongest contributor by far

Gourmand scents confuse me because personally I don't understand the allure of smelling edible

While I still enjoy this cologne, Burberry Men pushes the gourmand boundary right to the edge for me; a single sprig of thyme more and it would topple over the cliff

11/02/23

First Pass - I don't like any of Burberry's other fragrances and wasn't expecting anything, but this swept me off my feet

As someone who likes sweet, woody fragrances, this was a delight. Woods. Hay. A little spice. Faintly reminiscent of Stetson, but more refined and balanced

1 Hour Later - All of the opening scents are still there, but the wood has grown to the front. Cedar for sure, some wisps of fir

What a treat. I never thought I would find a fragrance I liked as much as Ralph Lauren Romance, but this is quite good

Burberry Men Burberry,"I've had this for a few years now. The mint note is intact and still rules the roost. The fragrance in all is so restrained--not weak, necessarily, but refined--that I tend to spray it onto my clothes as well as walking through a mist of it. (I don't usually spray directly onto my skin, as I don't like to ""bruise"" my perfumes, but this one would probably not be excessive if sprayed directly, in moderation.) On clothes, the fragrance predictably hangs around a good deal longer and the mint is perhaps further accentuated (as a kind of fresh ambience). This therefore remains a ""love"" for me; I don't need it to be a huge attention grabber. Burberry are often good for James Bond sophistication over getting all up in the grill (mixed grill with fried nostrils) of everyone in the same room as the wearer.",09/30/23 11:27,woomanmoomin

Burberry Men Burberry,"Really disliked this when I got it–for like $20 at Burlington, as it happens. The thyme seemed to overwhelm, and in a way that reminded me too much of a spice cabinet's dried herbs rather than something I'd like to smell on myself. Also, an inescapable scent association: I am almost certain at some point in elementary school I had a male teacher that wore this, so I thought it smelled ""old.""

I've come around. I still don't get vanilla or mint; herbal notes of thyme, lavender, and geranium predominate to my nose, as well as maybe the cedar. And it's still not an everyday for me, but it's a fragrance that I've indeed received compliments on, and now it seems to fit me a bit better as I approach thirty. Spring, fall, winter... It goes well with a sweater. A good scent for, say, dinner with the family or a Sunday morning at church, and a solid office/meeting fragrance too.

It's mature, which honestly made it just perfect for those thirty-something teachers I had in school. In some ways the same ""genre"" for me as Terre d'Hermes.",07/24/23 19:54,Dylp7707
Burberry Men Burberry,"Platinum Egoiste clone? No. Beautiful combination of maturity and playfulness, formal and casual, complexity but simplicity? Yes.

This is an ensemble work, with all elements playing a part. Starts with a juicy citrus accord, then the lavender and jasmine aromatics join the fun at around the 15 minutes mark. At 30 - 45 minutes, the most unique aspect comes forward, i.e. the combination of the thyme, mint and geranium. You start to think that two transitions are all that this has when a bit of barbershop accord shows up (this and the lavender is probably where the Platinum Egoiste comparisons come in). But the barbershop doesn't take over, it just joins the aromatics and the mint/thyme, and all of them play together on a field of amber and musk, with some sweetness and smoothness from the vanilla.

So, lots going on, but it doesn't do it in a pretentious French manner, because this never gets fussy. The warm base makes this a very comforting scent, the barbershop elements provide the masculinity, the thyme/mint accord the green element and the aromatics keep it all light. Just a super versatile and completely enjoyable scent. I got this in a blind swap, and feel very lucky to have done so.",06/09/23 08:47,sniffer 65
Burberry Men Burberry,"A very nice minty, woody opening. The citrus is mild and smooth and this fragrance develops a powdery and pleasant floral note. The final dry down is dominated by a smooth amber note. I often struggle with amber based fragrances on my skin, but this one maintains a beautiful smoothness from start to finish. Vanilla and amber create a slight sweetness in this fragrance, but it’s not overpowering.

A high quality fragrance, better for cooler days and good for the office. I think this is better for guys 30 plus years. I blind bought this based on the notes and the reviews and don’t regret it. It’s a very pleasant fragrance and will be appreciated by others around you.",05/17/23 06:30,Michel Silencieux

I'm so glad I did.. it's a lovely bergamot lavender scent..I also pick up some jasmine. On the dry down I get some woodiness. It's a light scent, great for spring, summer.

Burberry Men Burberry,"Cool, crisp, elegant masculinity in a bottle.

This scent from my birth year (1995, 28 years ago) has hardly aged a day. My vintage 1997 bottle (which reads Burberry's of London on the label) is bright, breezy, sharp, juicy, and fresh, with an underlying sweetness and creaminess which makes this simply one of my absolute favorite wears in my collection. Is it the most original scent? No. If you're familiar with 90s fragrances, you will detect that classic DNA in the oversoul of Burberry Men. This is essentially an aromatic fougere with an oriental twist. I think it'd be best described as a mix of Platinum Egoiste and Allure Homme (the OG, not Eau Extreme) - it's got that sharp, metallic, aromatic freshness of Platinum Egoiste and the smooth, creamy, succulence of Allure Homme. This is the definition of effortlessness. You can weaar this any time, anywhere if you want to smell clean, classy, and fresh. It might not garner you the most compliments in the world, but everyone will agree that you smell good. The only strike against it in my mind is the performance. Even a vintage bottle like the one I have isn't the longest lasting scent, netting me about 4 or 5 hours of longevity and light projection. But that's alright with me - there's so much pleasure in reapplication.

Overall, this is one of my favorite 90s fragrances. It is just so damn good. Scoop up a vintage bottle on Ebay while the going's still cheap.

Burberry Men Burberry,"""Burberry Men"" sprawls you out on the floor like a drunken Jerry Seinfeld spouting gibberish about why no recreational drugs come in suppository form. I don't find it very wearable, but I would certainly use it as aromatherapy to chill out and listen to some spoken-word Shatner.

""Burberry Men"" is so calming that it is like time slowing down. You are laying on a grassy hill in early fall while the wind tussles your hair. Tree-covered hills surround you, your to-do list is empty, and Shaquille O'Neal is dry-humping your leg. Ahhhhh!

2023 marks the 28th anniversary of ""Burberry Men."" That's 28 years of making our eyes water, our knees wobble, and our nostrils tighten up like a cold-water ballsack. I love how they've left the bottle design alone, right down to the unusual size options of 30, 50 or 7,852 ml (the latter known as ""The Spadey"" since it is the size of David Spade).

I don’t really get a 90’s vibe from this, it feels timeless, a scent for every man at any age. Better for spring and fall, I don’t think it would work with extreme temperatures.

Burberry Men Burberry,"I don't quite know why I like this one, but I do. The thyme in the opening and the cedar work really well with the rest of the notes.

This is definitely a fall fragrance, and something more for the day than the night. Great for office use. I recommend 5-6 sprays and it'll last a good 6 hours. Cedarwood, sandalwood, amber, vanilla, and musk all are in the dry down, meaning it can be layered later in the day (wait 6 hours).

Really it could be worn anytime from fall to spring, during the day or night, but ideally it is a fall scent. Great value at its price point. It pulls compliments, and because it's a relatively little used fragrance these days, it gets people's attention.",10/26/22 20:00,ry_ta

I reviewed it maybe two years ago and at the time, it seemed attention was few and far between.

I can attest to the fact that it’s not dated or “old man.” It is different though. It’s light, classically herbaceous, and sweet in a delicate, classy way. It came out around the same time as fragrances like Curve for example (no resemblance) so it’s from a time when fragrances were getting pleasant, mellow, and void of anything divisive (and this wasn’t worn by the masses, so the DNA is still fresh).

It's very masculine in my opinion, but not stereotypically so (as in old school harsh and a punch in the face type). It has a spiciness to it while also having kind of a smooth, somewhat calming, and very unique quality to it. I would also say it fits into the soapy category to some extent. It's really well balanced. I think anyone past the teen years could pull it off, but would generally say it's a more mature fragrance. My only criticism is that it's slightly less than moderate performance from what I can tell.",03/19/22 22:51,jbuzzz

Burberry Men is a 100% masculine fragrance! The combination of mint, citrus, lavender, woods is very nice and balanced!

Burberry Men Burberry,"The first fragrance I ever bought with my own money back in 2006. I sold that bottle many moons ago but I recently repurchased after hearing rumors of discontinuation. I wanted to forever own a bottle of my first fragrance.

Its minty, bright lavender opening is invigorating and the creamy cedar and sandalwood dry-down is very calming. It reminds me of better, carefree days. Careful on the trigger as the first 30 minutes are strong and you can expect this to be detectable for 4 to 5 hours on a good day.

But more like a body spray or deodorant. It has a synthetic quality that doesn't always feel great on the skin. The drydown does linger for a while and the smoky mint is nice and refreshing. This is good for everyday, casual. It just doesn't have a great strength, so I had to use a lot of it.

Burberry Men Burberry,"TL;DR: Stuck at Marshall's/TJ Maxx and can't decide if this is worth the money? It is. Go for it

This is something that I had a mini of for so long, liked it, and saw the bottle on clearance at TJ Maxx for like $24 for a 50ml. I figured it was worth a shot to get the full bottle because I liked the mini.

The mini was a dabber bottle, so I don't think I got the full effect. I haven't gotten around to reviewing this until now, and I haven't really given it proper wear. But from my initial impressions, this is an excellent, masculine, pleasing, simple and easy to wear fragrance. It has a ""cologne"" or ""barbershop"" kind of smell, and yes I see the similarities to Platinum Egoiste. I'm not sure what not is sweetening this one up, maybe the sandalwood? But the combination of notes is extremely pleasant. As it evolves, the scent becomes sweeter and softer. It is not very linear which I like. This is a really good fragrance.

I have always been a Burberry fan, and this is a very easy to wear fragrance. It may become my second favorite very quickly, my number on being Brit.

This is a clean, barbershop-like (not too powdery or anything), cologne that is not dated even though it came out years ago. I think this is a good every day fragrance. Not distinct enough for a signature fragrance. Good for casual wear, office wear, hanging out. It's really nice and I feel that Burberry always puts out great offerings.

I normally feel that Burberry's fragrances for women are better, and I still feel this way. But this one shows that there are some very very good Burberry fragrances for men. Touch, Brit, Brit Rhythm Intense, and even Weekend are good Burberry offerings as well.

This is a more gentlemanly cologne. It has a very familiar scent that I just can't put my finger on.",06/22/21 12:09,Guccipordior
Burberry Men Burberry,"I really like this one from Burberry. I will say that the opening reminds me of bug spray, but I've never cared much about the opening of any fragrance anyway because by the time I'm out the door it's in dry-down mode which is when it really matters. To me it's a quality, well blended fragrance with more of a mature vibe but not ""old"". It's also slightly more dressed up than for errands with shorts and a t-shirt but perfect for the office, drinks, dinner, shopping, or a night out--casual or dressed up. I avoid it on those 90+ degree summer days when I prefer something fresher. Performance is moderate on my skin for 4-5 hours with two sprays on the neck and one on each forearm. If I need 8+ hours, I'll go a bit heavier on the trigger. It's affordable but very high quality in my opinion. I'm glad I have it in my collection.",06/21/21 11:56,scentluvr

Burberry Men Burberry,"I love this, always have and always will. I was a channel platinum agoiste fanatic for years and it was my signature scent for a long time. However during the mid 2010s I found that egoiste hadn't aged very well and became very much an older gent fragrance, they really went hard on adding more patchouli and cedar wood notes and seemed to completley drop the metallic moss element which made it sexy, fresh and flighty. Was really upset that a classic which had seen me through many years had been thrown to ruin. It was a nostalgia that I thought I would never get back.

Was in a bargain drug store and Burberry was on the shelves in amongst a fragrance Pompeii of many others which had been heavy hitters years back. Being a huge anglophile I gave it a blind buy, my heavens was I surprised. This fragrance was PE improved ×10. It was everything that PE was in its heyday but with a sweeter and more airy presence which I love. Immediately upon application I received loads of compliments. The silage on this is perfect, it's not too over powering but instead lures people in with a subtle air of confidence (I have never been one to want to invade a room with an ostentatious smell). With the dry down it gets better and better where the sweetness really shows its presence. All for a fraction of the price of Chanel PE. This one is a proper gem and is simply a perfect fragrance for all, I cant believe what I had been missing all these years, a solid 10/10",04/28/21 03:33,McCary90

Burberry Men Burberry,"The pyramid in this one has been changed over the original formulation and it now lacks the vanilla in the base and the jasmine in the middle notes. What I get is a incredibly sweet, mellow and creamy amber fragrance. The opening is cologne-y, with very light citrus and lavander notes (I don't smell the mint honestly). It turns alcoholic and boozey as soon as the initial bergamot-lavander accord fades, which happens pretty quickly, with a distinct tart fruity note to it - someone mentioned pear and I think it's pretty close to an unripe pear indeed.

Burberry for Men reminds me of a cup of warm milk with some booze and lots of honey in it - it's comforting and warm and definitely suitable for cold weather, but a bit too sweet for me.

Burberry Men Burberry,"This reminds me of a cold but sunny winter day, with just a month left until spring. It’s a delicately sweet, frosty essence of light fruit (almost pear-like?) subtle florals and fresh spicy herbs. Not overly male and not quite female. Not necessarily geared toward attracting romantic pursuits either (IMO); though undeniably classy, clean, lovely and reserved.

YSL L’homme seems fairly similar, though not entirely.

I first tried it in ‘07 and was fascinated with how different it was—not in a challenging or complex sort of way, just different than mainstream fragrances I had been around up to that point. I bought 100ml around 2012 and still have 25% of the bottle. It doesn’t excite me enough to be a daily driver, but it’s nice to smell on occasion (though if I’m being 100% honest, and depending on the day, I may or may not care enough to replace it when it’s gone).",02/08/21 05:20,eriksimon

Burberry Men Burberry,"This review is for the ""Burberrys for Men"" vintage version of this (red box, plaid bottom, Burberrys, not Burberry, London label, the earliest 1995 edition). This is a pleasant, classy woody/fruity/spicy scent that smells a bit 90s/early 00s but not unwearable, at all.

I get mint, some fruity accords (not citrus - more like blueberry?), a bit of lavender, and some green herbal scents up top. The base is classic vanilla/musk/wood 90s base. Very little, if any, sweetness. It's an office scent, a daytime scent, an inoffensive scent.

I remember smelling this something in the last decade at a Nordstrom Rack and it wasn't nearly as nice as this (way more synthetic to my memory and I immediate thought ""no way.""). This is pretty natural, pretty clean. I get solid longevity, 5-7 hours, with a few hours of moderate projection.

Burberry Men Burberry,"This was one of the first fragrances I have ever received: it was gifted to me on my eighteenth birthday.

Burberry Men does quite well overall, although it's quite a soft fragrance with a moderate-poor longevity and a moderate-faint sillage.

The olfactory pyramid is quite static, but pleasant: I recall sensing jasmine, golden tobacco, thyme, cedar, sandalwood, with an honey talc-amber, musky finish.

It is sweet and ideal for younger men. I'd advise it for daytime and as it's very versatile, can be also used for college/office.

Undoubtedly it gives you a signature englishman scent, even if its performances are just... average. Nice nose, crowd pleaser fragrance.

Burberry Men Burberry,"So when I was younger in high school I was a bit of an Anglophile and consumed anything and everything British. I wanted to smell British so I would wear some Burberry stink I would buy at the mall (what I am reviewing). I thought it was my signature scent and everybody loved it. I cannot recall how many sprays I would use, or where I would apply them, however there was a major shift that occurred. When I got to college this website came out called ""Facebook"". You might have even heard of it. Well in those days Facebook had these applications you could have on your page. One of the applications that I had on my page was called ""Honesty Box"" which was where friends, or other users (if you were public) could write you a message and ""be honest"" anonymously. I only ever received one message in that box which read ""You're really cute, but you wear too much cologne."" From that day until about last month I never wore a fragrance again. I am 34 years old today.

Since that day I kind of wrote off fragrance wearing as somebody who is trying to impress, or appear suave but just appearing as lame to most people. Kind of like those middle aged people who have overly white veneers or dentures. You ain't foolin' nobody, man! I am come a long way and with help of my girlfriend have fallen in love with fragrances. Don't get me wrong, I find most of them to be cloying disasters, but I liken well integrated fragrances to everything else pleasurable and slightly hedonistic (wine, coffee, spirits, etc).

I need to revisit this bottle of stink in my ripe, old age.

Now that I have blabbed on a good amount I will tell you, young friend, don't overdo it or you might receive a message in your very own honesty box.",04/13/20 11:40,patrickBOOTH
Burberry Men Burberry,"This is a review of a fragrance which was bought in 2020.
This fragrance is not for everyone for sure. I imagine Matthew McConaughey wears this in the ""The Gentlemen"" movie! English vibes with a touch of a sophistication and aristocracy are all around.
The smell - It starts off, I would say, very harsh. You will feel a blast of spices which fades away rather quickly. The initial notes could be off-putting for someone. After that, the sweetness mixed with some kind of sourness starts to kick in. The woody part of a fragrance appears when it fades away.
This is a very well-blended fragrance. I agree with others who said that you couldn't detect any particular note.
I can't even describe the smell. It neither sweet, nor fresh. You just feel pleasant vibes of it here and there.
Age group - definitely 35 and up.
Longevity is around eight hours, easily. The smell stays on clothes forever even after the washing.
Projection - it's almost a skin scent with a very good projection for an hour or so.
Occasion - definitely for business! Great for office environments.
Overall I recommend this fragrance for those who like quality and sophistication, do business, don't like anything mass market, want to be different and want to be an English gentleman!

There are other fragrances that do similar things to me, and I've found that I really can't stand syrupy lavender scents. I wanted to like Missoni Parfum Pour Homme, but that candied lavender note was too much.

Burberry Men Burberry,"Burberry for men has to be the definition of a grey fragrance. Not in the mysterious sense, but in the sense of grey. A grey wall. A Nissan Sunny. Something utterly boring.

It's not a bad fragrance.

It's scent and construction is indicative of it's 1995 release date.

You have bergamot and lavender in the top, sandalwood and cedar in the middle, and the base is laundry musk and cedar. Sprinkle a bit of mint on top and voila.

On paper, Burberry for men sounds intriguing and interesting.

In reality, it's utterly flat. I am not sure what they did, but the scent comes across as 2D and dull.

Any textures are non-existent. None of the notes are trying to catch you attention.

If you want to buy a mid 90s woody aromatic, I implore you to skip this. Get Hugo For Men or Escape for Him. Both are much more interesting and compelling choices.

Longevity is mediocre - 4-5 hours.

I just don’t think it’s a scent that could ever be considered old or dated. Tonight wearing it, I caught a slight similarity to Bleu De Chanel parfum(2018). The woods and citrus gave me that impression. Of course the mint is tuned up more here than BDC parfume.

Burberry Men Burberry,"A pretty basic scent in my opinion and another scent that I wish on fragrantica you could give a neutral rating as it’s not great but definitely not bad either.

To describe this scent is a bit weird which I guess is actually a good thing as it is different !
But this opens up very minty with some citrus and thyme,making this kind of herbal but also fresh. Once this dries down the sandalwood and lavender kick in and your left with an aromatic but also kind of creamy type of smell. When you smell this up close it’s kind of synthetic and scratchy smelling but in the air you do smell a nice fresh,creamy aroma. When you smell this in the air is my favorite part of this scent.

Performance is average as it lasts 4-6 hours and projects moderately BUT be cautious as this is very strong in the first 20-30 mins but quickly dies down to a nice subtle scent bubble.

Overall rating-6.5 out of 10 ! Kind of generic but pleasant enough to get a passing score. Also the price on this is very cheap so it gets points for that as well. BUT I even have cheap frags I would pick over this. Even from the Burberry house Burberry Touch easily beats this in scent and performance.",11/10/18 04:12,Ryanmmas26

I am the kind of person that believes in wearing different fragrances for different occasions. Burberry Men is the business causal scent in my wardrobe, the khakis, button down and loafers wearing, Honda Accord driving gentleman of my fragrance universe. A little mint, a little lavender, woody base, a touch of sweetness: all the ingredients of a classic male fragrance. It behaves modestly yet faithfully, never offending and never calling attention to itself. Some occasions call for a perfume after this manner, and Burberry Men is my #1 dumb grab when occasion demands I don a suburban-dad scent. It is my favorite? No. Is it a revelation? No. Will it make stranger do a double-take as you walk past? No, none of that. However, it is perhaps the most well-mannered, mild, pleasing scent I have yet encountered.

Burberry Men Burberry,"Okay the photo shows Burberry London but this seems to be the listing for Burberry Men - that's what I have and that's what I'll be reviewing here. There's a different listing for Burberry London.

Right after applying, the scent is incredible. It's very sweet but not in an excessive way at all - the citrus, thyme and sandalwood all balance it out perfectly.

The real problem is it doesn't last long enough. After an hour or two it fades and it doesn't fade in a fun or interesting way. It just retains a weak trace of some of the ingredients but not all. If I smell my wrist after an hour or two it's sort of incomplete and unsatisfying compared to the initial spray. Other colognes can change and become even more interesting throughout the day but this one doesn't.

Apparently this has been reformulated so it's possible the older bottles had better longevity.

It's a good scent but I'd prefer something else with better longevity even if it weren't quite so heavenly on the first spray.",06/29/18 00:48,gentel
Burberry Men Burberry,"A perfect 90s fragrance that can not spoil your shopping ...
Conventional, stable powder scent with floral chords! Interestingly, my skin is more acidic and mistyer, but in the air it is more floral and aromatic.
Gently simple and yet a sympathetic ""snob"" fragrance.
I personally like it. Whatever season you can wear gentleman fragrance,
but not on the classic line, but with a modern twist to the floral aromas!
In my country the ""tester"" version is very ""friendly"" at 12-15 €,
which is great value for money! I can only say: You can not miss this!",05/22/18 10:51,joe38
Burberry Men Burberry,"It is a pleasant, light scent BUT it has practically no longevity or sillage. I had to use ~8 sprays just to be able to smell it on me an hour or so later.

Burberry Men Burberry,"Elegant and masculine. It opens crisp and clean and progresses to a woody dry-down. It smells slightly sweet and creamy in the air, but up close to the skin its sharp and dry.

Burberry Men Burberry,"I am very grateful that Burberry still makes this fragrance, although its availability appears to be somewhat limited in Australia. This classic creamy woods scent deserves to be more well-known among the younger consumers. In my opinion, it far surpasses many of the masculine offerings from the current Burberry line.

Burberry for Men is the epitome of class and masculinity. To my nose, this fragrance smells both fresh, soothing and soapy. The most dominant notes to my nose include lavender, sandalwood, cedar, musk, amber and mint.

I accidentally tipped the majority of my 1ml sample onto my wrist in error but was pleased to find that this fragrance is relatively inoffensive. I think most men would enjoy wearing this fragrance as you can either dress it up or dress it down. Burberry for Men is extremely versatile.

When my partner eventually grows out of the sweeter masculine scents he often wears, I will be sure to introduce him to Burberry for Men. I also wouldn't have any objection to owning and wearing a bottle of this myself. The creamy sandalwood accord makes this fragrance perfectly unisex.

The longevity is superb and the sillage moderate to soft, depending on the number of sprays. I sincerely hope that Burberry will continue to manufacture their 'vintage' fragrances as I admittedly enjoy them far better than their current offerings.",03/28/18 03:15,missk
Burberry Men Burberry,"The herbs in the opening give this scent a barbershop feel. There is a solid mint blast that mellows into thyme finally ending in a woody musky drydown. nice, fresh and elegant. a perfect workspace scent. Not in your face and don't see anyone offended by it. Good longevity. disagree with the Moschino Uomo similarity comment. Uomo? starts out much more citrusy and mellows more creamier than Burberry Man.

Burberry Men Burberry,"This is my favorite of the Burberry colognes. It's a rather unique fragrance that is classy and sophisticated. It's interesting that people note mint as being the dominant note. For me, I feel like thyme is the dominant opening note. It opens up in savory herbal way. The mid notes are floral with jasmine really showing up followed by a nice warm amber finish. Performance has been variable. From the same bottle, I sometimes get beast performance and longevity while other days the fragrance is gone in 3 hours. I live in a dry climate so your mileage may vary. It's definitely not a super sexy fragrance. It wouldn't be my first choice for a date night. But it's amazing for the office as it comes off as very professional. Although I would argue this works better in the colder months, it's fresh enough that you can easily pull it off during the summer if you're a one cologne kind of person. For how popular this fragrance is, few people seem to recognize it so it'll definitely make you stand out. It's been my signature fragrance for years now and every time I go and explore other options, I always come back to this one. It's that good.",12/05/17 09:56,mithion

I can see why this has many more likes than loves. It's missing a wow factor. Me personally I love mint so it's a definite love. The mint is more fresh and clean than the herbal ""plant"" mint in ultraviolet man for example or the very earthy mint in roadster cartier. It more resembles aqua allegoria herba fresca but think more woody and less watery.

Burberry Men Burberry,"The only way I can describe this scent is a light mint and lavender type clean smell with a light musky vanilla dry down. Not heavy at all. Very well blended but projection on this scent will surprise you. When I sprayed it on I liked it, but it's a hard one to describe. I didn't think it was that special when I smelled it on myself, but when I came home I was shocked how the women in my life reacted. My wife is very particular and will rarely tell me I smell good. When she smelled this she instantly told me how elegant and manly I smelled. My daughter also immediately said , ""wow you smell fantastic"". I was amazed that a scent I thought to be mediocre, was so highly praised by two very picky women. I own many, very sophisticated fragrances. Even Dior Sauvage, Chanel Allure Homme Sport Extreme or Bleu de Chanel did not get me this same reaction. This scent is extremely elegant yet also very manly according to my wife. This might possibly become my signature scent. Even tho it's a bit hard to smell on yourself, don't let it fool you. This is a good one, believe me.

The lavender, thyme and oak moss segue towards this great musk, amber and vanilla dry down.

Timeless, inimitable, and ridiculously underrated. My nose mainly detects the intermingling of cedar, crisp mint, and a little lavender on the side. This was the first fragrance I ever fell in love with and subsequently purchased for myself. Unquestionably English and sanguine. Sillage is good. It radiates within one foot of the wearer.

As far as the scent goes... I don't love it and sometimes I don't even like it. For me it is an average fragrance with average performance. Most days I tell myself ""F%$# average!!!"", so this is not really for me. Burberry is one of those houses that just doesn't appeal to me at all.

London for Men Burberry,"Burberry has accomplished an extraordinary feat, I must admit. They have introduced two outstanding fragrances within a single line: London for Women and London for Men. Such occurrences are exceptionally rare, and only two other duos come to mind that have achieved a similar level of success, namely Eternity/Eternity for Men and Obsession/Obsession for Men by Calvin Klein. However, let's focus on our protagonist for today, where I can confidently affirm that Antoine Maisondieu has impeccably fulfilled his assigned task. London for Men embodies both masculinity and refinement, encapsulating the essence of Britishness in a sleek bottle. Its warm and leathery-fruit heart may draw comparisons to Jo Malone's Pomegranate Noir, but the pronounced tobacco undertones swiftly establish their dominance. The undeniable innovation of this composition has sparked admiration and countless imitations. Moreover, the culinary notes present in these perfumes served as the foundation for remarkable creations, such as Tom Ford's exquisite Tobacco Vanille from the Private Blend line. It is worth noting that due to its weight, intensity, and profound aroma, London for Men thrives best during the colder months, making it an exceptional choice for winter. I wholeheartedly recommend it to all tobacco aficionados seeking olfactory delight in their fragrances.

London for Men Burberry,"Even after almost two decades since its launch, Burberry London continues to captivate with its unique blend of notes. This is evident in the fact that I have repurchased it three times, a testament to its lasting appeal. As many suggest, it’s one of those rare scents that actually remind fragrance enthusiasts of Christmas time.

TOP NOTES
The opening is fresh and aromatic. It took me a while to realise that this freshness is actually coming from bergamot (usually a strange note inclusion in this sort of mix), which gives a crisp edge that keeps the scent from feeling cloying, while lavender lends classic fougère freshness. Immediately beneath both, a warming thread of cinnamon and a hint of cracked pepper are present.

HEART NOTES
When the heart arrives, the perfume feels more textured. Leather shows up as a rounded, slightly sweet kind of leather — the smell of soft gloves or an old book rather than raw hide. By this stage, the cinnamon’s heat is tempered, woven into the leathery fabric, and marks a pivotal moment in the fragrance’s character: it smells like an evening where the weather is cool, the lights are warm, and every detail matters.

BASE NOTES
The dry-down shifts toward tobacco leaf, guaiac wood, opoponax — a blend of subtly smoky, resinous, woody notes.
Tobacco here is not sweet pipe tobacco; it’s drier, closer to leaf and the residual warmth of a wine-bar aromatic haze. Guaiac wood provides a creamy, woody backbone that prevents the scent from becoming overly resinous or flat.

OVERALL
A considerable amount of time has passed since 2006, and trends have changed. For me, this fragrance has stood the test of time, and nothing really captures its magic that still makes people smile when they wear it. One of the best releases from the early days of the new millennium, back in the time when fragrance houses took significant risks to give us something new and interesting.

London for Men Burberry,"This is my third time reviewing the same bottle of Burberry London purchased around 2020 at a guess. I can't speak for newer bottles.
Back in February '22, like many others on here I complained about the poor longevity.
By December '23, while no means a power house, longevity was a lot better. I remember applying first thing on Christmas morning and receiving positive comments mid afternoon.
I've pulled it out of storage again recently and can definitely confirm that it seems stronger and longer lasting than the last time it had a run out.
If you've previously felt let down by London's promise and have consigned it to the 'will never wear again' storage area, I would encourage you to give it another go. It could be that you owned that elusive stronger, better performing version of London all the time.",10/29/25 06:41,Spendthrift

London for Men Burberry,"Rating: 9.3/10

Burberry London is often called “the Christmas fragrance” and I totally understand why. But to me, it’s a bit more complex than that. Maybe it’s the name, maybe it’s the iconic Burberry plaid, but every time I wear it, I get this vivid image of London itself: a sophisticated gentleman walking through misty streets after a light rain, the scent of damp cobblestone and morning dew in the park. It’s atmospheric, classy, and timeless.

I’ve never actually been to London, but if I had to imagine the smell of the city, this would be it. The blend of cinnamon, leather, tobacco leaf, and oakmoss paints a picture that’s both cozy and elegant. It’s warm and nostalgic, yet modern.

This is the kind of scent that feels tailor-made for fall and winter. Perfect for cool evenings, holiday gatherings, or simply when you want something comforting and sophisticated. It had been on my wish list for quite a while, and I’m genuinely glad it’s finally part of my collection.",10/28/25 18:08,Illusent

The smell conjures up images of falling leaves, trench coats and scarves and all kinds of other cheesy fall cliches that you could possibly imagine and it is amazing. Definitely a 10/10 for me.

Then I glance at my watch. It is already 5 p.m. Time to pick up my date. We are headed to a fancy Italian restaurant. As we finish our dinner, she leans in and says, “You smell good tonight.” I smile, thank her, and give my glass of Pinot Noir a little swirl.

London for Men Burberry,"This has been my signature scent for years, and it’s one I keep coming back to. Your experience with it will depend heavily on both skin chemistry and season. While many describe it as “Christmas in a bottle,” that’s never been my reality.

On my skin, the character shifts beautifully throughout the year: in spring it opens up as a fresh, spiced green – almost like cut grass layered with tobacco leaves. In the colder months, it leans more into tobacco and cinnamon, warm and comforting without ever becoming cloying.

It’s also one of my most complimented fragrances, and at this point, it feels inseparable from my identity. For me, it’s a perfect 10/10 – in every season but summer.",09/21/25 06:15,danthom

London for Men Burberry,"Nose Note #612

Compared to this CK Shock for Him is completely trash. If you compare them side by side they are very different + Shock smells very unnatural. This one is just good, the quality feels much better
But the performance... Well, I find it disappointing. It is barely average. Sillage is not great at all. It performs about the same as DG The One both EDT and EDP. And the scent profile is kind of similar. It's not a light scent, but performance is still very mediocre.

But I still like it so much that I'd say this can work at any season. It's not strong enough to choke you out in high heat.

If you are expecting a tobacco scent I think I'll be disappointed. It's doesn't have real tobacco.

London for Men Burberry,"Fall in New York walking past high end luxury boutiques. Standing next to my boyfriend who’s actually wearing old spice deodorant. A man walks by in a long wool coat and I think, damn he smells good. We walk by a cigar shop into the park where it starts to rain. The smell the dry leaves getting wet fills the air accompanied by wet bark.

Initially
Cedar, leather, tobacco but oddly juicy maybe fig accord. Sweet powdery. I get an undertone of apple peel.

Dry down to a pleasant metallic lavender, cedar chest, leather chair, pipe tobacco, wood pipe, talc powdery smell all while retaining that signature scent that is consistent in most Burberry scents I’ve tried.

This is well blended, masculine leaning fragrance. Definitely a bit generic but perhaps as a fan of niche houses over mall, luxury fragrances it’s not exiting or unique to me. However this is a lovely city, classic scent that skews over 30 sophistication or night out. The performance is good. I’ll likely wear this on occasion but will pass it on to my boyfriend.

London for Men Burberry,"The fragrance opens up with a strong lavender that lasts for about three minutes before the sweet cinnamon tobacco with leather comes through. This state of the fragrance gives me a strong connection to a Christmas candle you buy during the holiday season. This aroma stays consistent with a moderate projection off my skin for about an hour. After the first hour, the projection gets closer to the skin. Leaving an aroma of tobacco and leather with a woody and somewhat booziness addition that lasts until the end of the wearing. Unfortunately, the fragrance typically lasts 3-4 hours on my skin. Due to this, I wear this fragrance along with iso e super to boost longevity. Doing this generally extends the dry down to about the fifth or sixth hour.",08/13/25 08:45,Grimmace525

I could see this being a very versatile fragrance if used correctly, I definitely think if you're clever about it, this could work in an office or school. No notes on longevity yet, it has definitely toned down in the first 20mins or so, so it's shaping out to be mid in terms of longevity.

Decent starter frag for winter, I really enjoy the smell, 7.5/10",07/11/25 20:28,Bahnschrift
London for Men Burberry,"Review 14
""Autumn Memories""

My first serious cologne buy. Old reliable to me, safe to wear virtually in any situation. Cinnamon, lavender, tobacco just pair beautifully in intimate settings. A compliment getter if you are into that sort of thing. I had dinner with an exgf one night after not hanging out for a long while and when we went back to her place on the couch we ended up hooking up unexpectedly. She outright blamed the cologne scent which I found amusing. Instant nostalgia for me personally that transports me back to my early 20s. Decent longevity and sillage for couch/intimate settings. Social or date nite.

London for Men Burberry,"Epic Journey Into the Bottled Yonder, 228
-------------------------------------------------------
Purchased May 2025
This week I noticed this has the same dry down, the far - hours later - dry down, as Bogart Pour Homme. There's many down thumbs to this above and that's simply wrong. The truth shall come into the light, as they say.

FatLipWill below on 09/19/2023 said so, which confirms my finding that Burberry stole the BPH dry down not to mention this came two years after BPH. Deal with it. Have to say ""yours truly loves BPH more than this one"", it's more brash and manly but aren't all scents situational?

Having said I love both, London can barely be oversprayed for me. It's maximum three sprays per location otherwise there's a cloying that lingers quite a while and I cannot stand cloying in anything.
Freshies are the worst at this. See, for ME the entire scent has to be genius, from the top to the bottom and everybody nowadays focusses on the top and moves on.
You guys are being fooled into the best tops with castrated bottoms. I've tested all your trendy and favourite stuff and it's become simply pedestrian. Do read on.

The more I write my reviews, the more a certain inevitable truth regarding this entire industry and community reveals itself to me - and always by happen stance. It's the strangest thing, and to be Frank (where has he gone??) my reviews suffer for it. They've become ramblings innay.

This wasn't going to be a full fledged review, but since I cannot get more out of Burberry London, since it's so basic, the review has written itself.

It's a very nice and warm, wholesome scent. But as you probably have read, it's not what I'm particularly after. In fact I don't know what I'm after in scents. I'm constantly exploring, I'm looking for something and I don't know what it is. Though I long to seek something deep and rich like the old days. But I don't want a long lingering dry down of oakmoss that easily cloys like the old days. I sense my tastes changing.

OK let's not be hard on ourselves, just the wallet ((WILL YOU PULL OUT THAT BLOODY VIOLIN) calm down John Cleese, you've never said that though a viola would suffice).

They've destroyed all our old favourites to function/perform like anything new. Reformulations are done for a reason, they're not just to cut costs but to obviously keep up with the changing landscape of this unbelievably expensive enthusiast's hobby. They make them more user friendly and welcoming to the latest generation whose balls will never descend, whose chest hair will never see the light of day.

The people who do not understand that society used to be amazing, brilliant and polite - much like Burberry. Now it's if you're rich you must be an arsehole and let it be known you're rich, ergo an arsehole. Seriously could use a violin now.

But mates, I wish somebody had informed I needed this years ago - 8 or 9 years ago in particular.
A man simply does not brag about Burberry London, though it's another tool in his shed. You must own it and if you don't know why you're missing something from your set of tools, it's the Burb. Ramble on.
8/10

P.S.:
My bottle is the clear glass with the chromed cap, juice functioning as it should. I do not suffer performance issues as many say but I do believe it could be better for the money I paid for it. Shortly after, the same chain of chemists dropped the price by $30 only to recently raise the price back to what I paid for it... I've since destroyed my violin, how about a harp?

London for Men Burberry,"I am extremely happy with this! Blind bought it on clearance for a great price at a local shop before a night out, only having read some reviews online and seen the notes. It smells phenomenal... IF this sort of pallate is what you're seeking.

It has this very deep, masculine scent, filled with tobacco and darkness. Not overly smoky, not super spicy and peppery either. A very smooth and elegant trench of darkness coating your presence. As for performance, it opens with what felt to me like a strong sillage (3 sprays neck, 1 chest, 1 each wrist.) However after 30-60 minutes it died down to a more intimate projection, which I think is more suitable for this scent anyways. It's strong, it's potent, and I could totally see it getting too strong if overdone, so I like the smaller sillage honestly. The longevity is slightly above average for an EDT. I'm still catching base notes about 4 hours later, which is nice for a night out. Not crazy, but certainly not bad.

Overall, great purchase. Especially if found on sale. If you want a very dark scent, well suited to nighttime and colder seasons, this is an excellent grab for budget buyers such as myself.",06/13/25 22:18,julien04
London for Men Burberry,"This impeccably designed bottle houses a distinctive fragrance; while many perceive a tobacco note, I detect the aroma of a dense pine forest.

The bottle's design is, as expected from Burberry, flawless. However, I am somewhat disappointed by the projection and longevity. Over-application should be avoided, as it may induce nausea and headaches.

My personal rating is 6.5/10; however, my girlfriend finds it highly appealing, and it consistently garners positive feedback.",06/07/25 12:10,Eventic

London for Men Burberry,"I get mostly tobacco from this one, with some faint Christmas spices. I picked the wrong time of year to pick this stuff up, but don’t plan on keeping it, as I’d prefer something more pungent and with less tobacco. Wore it once on a rainy day a couple weeks ago. Projection and longevity are ok.",05/29/25 09:12,The Enward
London for Men Burberry,"Navy Cut Symphony

Burberry London unfolds like a seafarer's story: a bold opening of tobacco leaves steeped in rum and molasses, cut with black pepper and cinnamon. The scent evokes the intimacy of a well-aged navy cut tobacco, dry yet intoxicating, drawing you into its spicy warmth and port wine undertones.

Then, like waves calming after a storm, it transitions—soft mimosa glows beneath supple leather, reminiscent of old taverns and worn jackets. Resinous opoponax and guaiac wood add depth, mellowing the spice into whispers. Finally, it lingers with an ambered glow, not shouting but quietly enveloping, like fading sunlight over the ocean.

Elegantly composed yet accessibly priced, this fragrance offers a timeless dance of sweetness, spice, and nostalgia—a modern ode to age-old adventures.

London for Men Burberry,"A very nice and unique fragrance however unfortunately I think it got reformulated because I had a decant about five years ago that had a really strong leather base to it, but when I bought a full bottle that leather base was almost not detectable.

London for Men Burberry,This fragrance is basically Christmas in a bottle. Spicy tobacco and sweet at the same time. It’s almost like smelling a fancy latte and then smelling tobacco curing in a humidor. Meanwhile your mother in law is baking Christmas cookies and someone just brought home a fresh cut fir tree to decorate with ornaments. Warm and spicy and sweet. I’d say this fragrance would make most sense in the fall. I’d also say that this is really meant for a more mature crowd. But I suppose a young man could wear it while cosplaying as “old money.”,05/02/25 09:40,-Specs-

The notes may look challenging on paper, but the actual scent is very inoffensive, cozy and likeable.

London for Men Burberry,"This is a true gentleman's fragrance a timeless classic that exudes elegance and warmth. From the moment I first sprayed it, I felt transported to a cozy evening in the heart of London.

The opening is a burst of spicy cinnamon, perfectly balanced by fresh bergamot and calming lavender. As it settles, the heart notes reveal a delightful blend of leather, rich mimosa, and hints of port wine, which feels both sophisticated and comforting. The dry-down wraps me in a warm embrace of tobacco leaf guaiac wood, and a touch of sweet opoponax a balance that’s both masculine and soft.

The design of the bottle deserves its own praise. The iconic Burberry check wrapping gives it a stylish, British flair, and it looks fantastic on any dresser.

What I love most about this fragrance is how versatile it is. Whether I’m dressing up for a formal dinner or enjoying a quiet evening at home, it feels like the perfect companion. Its longevity is impressive, lasting several hours while leaving a subtle trail that invites compliments.

For me, London for Men is more than just a scent, it's an experience. It captures the essence of sophistication and coziness that feels like a warm scarf on a crisp autumn day. Highly recommended for those who love rich, warm, and slightly sweet fragrances!",03/19/25 08:10,arno85
London for Men Burberry,"Looking at a majority of the reviews, this gets an unfair amount of hate. You can't expect much out of this, usually sold for under $50, you get a nice, spicy, warm fall (designer) cheapie that really, you cannot go wrong with. Of course when this came out it was probably better quality, but reformulations exist fellas. I was lucky to get my hands on a bottle for free, however it is the new batch and needs maceration pronto. I will agree, it does have the Christmas in a bottle vibe happening, the longevity isn't impressive, but you gotta love this stuff. I find it to be slightly similar to Mugler Amen (1996) crossed with CK Shock. Not a bad scent profile for it's time. It is incredibly spicy, in fact this was once my most hated fragrance ever, I had referred to it as smelling like a ""spice cabinet"" As time went on I grew to appreciate older frags, given this isn't that old, I decided to check it out once more. Needless to say I enjoyed it. I definitley see more Burberry fragrances being added to my collection.",03/14/25 10:41,SniffScholar
London for Men Burberry,"To Felixthreeone, it's ""suffice to say"" not ""suffice it to say"".

I agree with hamid666, fragrances ought to perform. It is ludicrous to applaud a fragrance for ""not being too loud"" and so on, given that we have the agency to control the number of sprays that we administer. If a fragrance is powerful, one can spray less if one wishes. However, if it's weak, it's a different story. Nobody wants to spray twenty times so that they can be smelled, and even for those who overspray, the scent will dissipate near enough all the same.",03/14/25 06:04,Fred Hillman

London for Men Burberry,"Very nice and so wearable. This is an office-safe perfume - non-offensive. It feels like wearing a clothing that was marinated in cinnamon flower - in a very good way.

It lasts for at least 3 hours on my wrist despite being in very dry country. But I noticed the scent persists for over 8 hours if sprayed under the collar. My wardrobe smells like I've stored-in some flowers inside. This scent performs well in hot summer (currently going through heatwave at 34c~39c as I write this review) - which means this would work much better in winter. So I'd say this frag will work on all seasons.

London for Men Burberry,"Cinnamon-tobacco perfume that smells like winter. It has some boozy undertones to the scent, as I believe port wine is listed as a note in other sites. Has some freshness-old school barbershop vibes with prominent lavender and leather soothens the cinnamotobacco blend a little bit. Of course, it has a few drawbacks too. First of all, it is sadly weak for this DNA and doesn't project a lot. Second of all, it might be very redundant for those who already own one fragrance i the tobacco genre especially if the fragrance they own offers higher quality. The third drawback is it gets boring too quick for me, but the reason could be I own and smelled a lot of different tobacco perfumes. Very great for those on a budget but if you have Spicebomb, Tobacco Vanille, Side Effect, Wanted by Night etc. you don't really need this.",02/07/25 01:14,divineintervation1994
London for Men Burberry,"On my skin, I experience a soapy clean sensation with this fragrance. It gives me a total different feeling compared to all the popular tobacco and vanilla covos people compared with, It is not a dense fragrance.

London could be a spring easy option or a cool summer night out.",02/01/25 21:20,Parfumadict.
London for Men Burberry,"Smells somewhat nostalgic. Kinda old school.

London for Men Burberry,"Burberry London for Men is an absolute masterpiece that often gets overlooked in the fragrance world. If you’ve ever wished for a scent that perfectly captures the warmth and nostalgia of winter evenings, this is it. The opening hits with a bold, hot tobacco note, rich and slightly spicy, immediately making you feel like you're wrapped in a cozy scarf on a cold night. As it settles, a smooth sweetness emerges—an addictive blend of woody, leathery, and amber tones that’s both comforting and sophisticated.

This fragrance doesn’t just smell good; it tells a story. One whiff takes me back to childhood Christmases, sitting by the fireplace with a mug of hot cocoa, toasting marshmallows over the flames. The crackling fire, the soft glow of amber light, and the joy of waiting for Santa—Burberry London somehow bottles that magical moment.

Despite being such a gem, it’s criminally underrated. Nobody seems to talk about it, yet it rivals some of the best winter fragrances out there. It’s warm, inviting, and perfect for cold days when you need something that feels like a hug in a bottle. The projection is moderate but intimate, like a secret you want only those close to you to know.

If you’re looking for a fragrance that feels personal yet luxurious, Burberry London for Men deserves a spot on your shelf. It’s more than just a scent—it’s a memory, a feeling, a winter wonderland captured in a bottle. For me, it’s a favorite that I’ll keep coming back to, year after year.",01/25/25 01:29,Cadens_frags

London for Men Burberry,"I think every man needs this, 30 plus for sure. To me, it's not just a Christmas scent. This is one I am wearing in this cooler weather and even to bed because of how warm and masculine it smells. My wife says I smell like a sexy ginger bread man which is hilarious, but those spices, wood and tobacco make it a great universally liked scent. There is nothing else in probably 100 plus scents I've sampled that smells like it. Now, it does not smell like Calvin klein obsession for men, but I feel that it is a similar wheelhouse of the setting the fragrance is aiming for. It's probably liked far more than obsession for men (which I love), but it's worthy of some love all through fall and winter. Cheap to buy at discounters, even at Ross or Burlington it is reasonably priced. Longevity is good for price and an EDT. Projection is good enough, it's not beast mode but you don't really care while wearing it bc it puts you in a good mood! Get it, just order it.

Imagine Wearing A 15 Year Old Leather Jacket, (Not Brand New) While All Of This Is Going On. Not Off Putting, To Say The Least.

The Initial Opening, Blasts You With Cinnamon. Reminds Me Of Spicebomb 80% Initially. The Middle Notes, Of Soft Lavender Kicks In Making It Slightly Baby Powderish.

Smooth and Soft Leather/Mossy/Tobacco/Baby Powder With Just A Light Hint Of The Cinnamon Left.

London for Men Burberry,"I cant deny it, i looooove this stuff. Im pretty much a vintage snob, and when people talk about ""modernizing"" old school fragrances, this is THE apex in my opinion. I dont typically like sweetness, but this is perfectly sweet and it works amazing with the tobacco and cinnamon.
This is very masculine, but not macho. Think of literally sitting in front of a fireplace with a girl on a winter night. shes snuggling up against you and youre both falling asleep with a smile on your faces. Thats the exact picture i get from this. There could certainly be a Christmas tree in the corner of the scene as well, and indeed even with all the fancy or rare stuff i own...i still wear London on christmas.
So weve all heard the main drawback...performance sucks. Its not a lie, although i get better performance than alot of people are claiming, and thats with the newer formula too. But...for those who are saying ""when this came out it was much stronger and long lasting""...you arent imagining things. In fact, even though this came out in 2006, for a couple of years there was REAL oakmoss in this. Not an oakmoss accord or a bunch of synthetic evernyl, but actual oakmoss extract. If you find boxes with evernia prunastri actually listed, then you have a bottle from the first few years and it will perform alot better. Even those arent ""beastmode"" but it projects better and longer than the new formulas, youll get a day out of it.
In conclusion, this is one of my favorite fragrances on earth. Antoine Maisondeau created a masterpiece of modern perfumery in my opinion, and the fact that this is ~$30 is incredible to me.",12/27/24 14:57,Seanhh1986

And that's it. It's gone. No one will ever smell this on you.

London for Men Burberry,"A warm and pleasant fragrance with mass appeal that can easily be blind-bought.
Manly but not masculine, more gentlemanly and refined.

It seems Americans associate the smell with ""scented pine cones"", and thus Christmas?
I had never heard of or smelled scented pine cones before, so I don't get any 'Christmas in a bottle' association from this...

It is a very intimate fragrance, meaning projection is not great if that's what you're after.
It lasts about two to three hours. You will not smell it on clothes afterwards; it dissipates completely.

Easily wearable for any man, or boy at any age.",12/09/24 14:29,oysteims

Anyway, this smells like the sweaty inside of a children’s rubber Halloween mask - the odours mixing with condensed remnants of the user’s breath, who, it seems, may have been sampling a non-alcoholic mulled punch. Also there’s an unlit cigar in there.",11/19/24 06:09,MCLXIX
London for Men Burberry,"This fragrance revolves around a single chemical called Guaiyl Acetate which is an acetate of Guaiacwood, which is strange that Guaiacwood isn't listed in the notes. Its much warmer and cozier than Guaiacwood which is usually quite smoky and is sometimes compared to bacon. Guaiyl Acetate isn't used often in large amounts in other fragrances which makes this somewhat unique. Its supported by patchouli, and a few other things in trace amounts like lavender, coumarin and Verdox (the apple smell). It's a great unique smell, prefect for winter nights and occasions with friends and family.",11/18/24 15:49,Advatra

London for Men Burberry,"This is my cheaper winter fragrance this year (more expensive one being Tom Ford Eau d'Ombre Leather) and I'm really satisfied with it.

Opening is heavy of lavender and begamot, then the cinnamon joins in, this is where I think people get a 'shaving cream' type vibe, it's kind of similar to Quorum Silver, although Quorum is heavier on the woods and is a bit more versatile. But then, the leather, woods, and moss develop - it's very smooth, warm, attractive, and inviting. I get that it smells a bit too 'clean' for some people cause of that opening, but to me it just gives it a more mature feeling. It's not too overpowering or heavy- those notes lighten it a bit, and keeps it from becoming something like Spicebomb Extreme.

Like, you don't smell like a Christmas candle, but you do smell clean and put together, but with that undercurrent of the spices from the cinnamon and tobacco to warm you up. This would go great with your classic twee-jacket professor outfit.

That being said, 100% a cold weather scent, but suitable for basically any occasion within that.

Silage is relatively strong, and it lasts for quite some time. IMO a safe blind-buy, and a staple of any guy's winter collection.

... only it isn't. Not to me anyway. What does remind me of Christmas is the smell of fir needles and fir resin. The smell of a Christmas tree, in other words.

London for Men smells nothing like that. It has the scent of the potpourri used to perfume a quaint bric-a-brac shop in the Cotswolds. I do think it is most suited for the colder months, just not specifically for Christmas.",10/05/24 03:56,John Legal

London for Men Burberry,"I’ve had this scent for as long as I can remember—it was one of my first fragrances, and trust me, it’s truly masculine in the best possible way. It’s not overpowering or offensive but rather has the vibe of a rich, sophisticated, and smart gentleman. It’s definitely a compliment-getter!

The only downside is its longevity—it only lasts around 2 to 4 hours. But considering the price, you can overspray without hesitation. The opening is noticeable, but it’s the drydown where the fragrance starts to weaken, which is why overspraying helps.

In terms of ingredients and how they’re blended, it’s top-tier. The quality feels almost niche, especially considering the creativity behind the composition. The tobacco is beautifully mixed with cinnamon and lavender, creating a balanced scent. There’s also a hint of leather, but it’s soft and inviting, not too intense—just enough to keep things interesting and pleasant. Can be worn for both teenagers and young adult men.",10/02/24 15:22,Khalil_geo
London for Men Burberry,"Excellent fall season scent. I don't get it why people associate this scent with Christmas. The opening of the bottle is absolutely fantastic. I get some warm cinnamon, powdery lavender and cozy leather. In the dry down I get a sweet cherry tobacco pipe note with a medicinal opopanax resin and oakmoss. The dry down on this bottle reminds me a little bit of Ralph Lauren Polo green with a cough drop vibe to it. It smells great but it doesn't last long. I usually carry this bottle with me to reapply. I sure wouldn't mind an eau de parfum or a parfum version with a stronger backbone to last longer and cut through the cooler days and evenings.",10/01/24 20:39,miguelramos213

London for Men Burberry,"Coat and cape, umbrella and boots; a few sprays of London for Men, and you've got someone ready to take on the world and smell divine. London for Men is an ideal fragrance for the months when the cold gradually starts to set in. I want to try it in summer, but it brings to mind scarves, stuffed coats, warm chestnuts, orange leaves and turtlenecks. The colour of the fabric on the bottle is a real clue to the concept of this fragrance. My nose perceives an addictive blend of cinnamon, bergamot, tobacco and wood. It reminds me of a fancy cigar bar and trench coats. It's fresh but deep, cold and warm, spicy and sophisticated, can be worn on many occasions during the cold seasons, and is, above all, timeless and ageless. Perfect for work, but also a drink with friends or a dinner party, it can be worn anywhere and anytime by anyone, in my opinion. The blend of all the notes I perceive and their good balance makes it a fragrance that will never be too much no matter the situation.

I'm just not a big fan of its performance, which I find very average, if not mediocre, and have been for years - my first bottle was bought in my teens, around 2008, and I thought it was a bit weak even then. But it doesn't matter; still purchasing it when I am running out and I love to overspray on because it smells so good and its not expensive at all!!

London for Men Burberry,"Highly rated, but still underestimated. I Never smell this on anyone, and i feel spesial wearing it (note that i mostly have niche fragrances, and still, this is a easy pick).

The main notes i get is: Cinnamon, tobacco, Bergamot, and lavender. I pick up a cherry note, but it's not listed.

At first, it's all tobacco and cinnamon that catches my nose, but after only a minute or two, the lavender and bergamot shines through, and makes this a beautiful autumn/winter fragrance. The bergamot keeps lighter then it should be with that note list, and the lavender gives the clean ""out of the shower"" feel. Tobacco and cinnamon makes it warm and cozy, without being too Chrismasy. You seriously can't go wrong with ""Burberry London Man"" on a chilly/cold day. Warms the heart and pleases the nose.

It's a autumn/ winter fragrance for sure. Night time, with possible daytime wear. Probably not a perfect work scent, but i wouldn't complain if my colleague wore this all winter. Casual - semi formal.

Personal score: 9/10. If you haven't tried it. Get your nose on it. It's pretty cheap, smells of nice quality and is a joy to wear.",09/12/24 07:06,ZeaMoore4

This fragrance is -a walk at a Christmas morning, when out there is cold fresh air from the snowy mountains, and you pass by a bakery where they making pastry for gingerbread- in a bottle. Yes there is some pine in it but that whats makes it special, wearable for a mature man. This will be my fragrance to go from October for sure alongside with Bentley for Men Absolute. Two fragrances that, if made by houses like Creed or Parfums De Marly, would now be referred to as Top Top one of the best perfumes ever made. But hence its Burberry it flies under the radar and remain relatively cheap thank god. I bought a 100ml version for 45$ so I would say its damn cheap too!
I say this fragrance have some old school vibe, I really love ""christmas"" and cold weather parfumes like TF Noire Extreme, Althair, Angels Share etc, but this have something in it, it must be the lavender / oakmoss combo which reminds me of ""Pine"" but its just different from all of the other cold weather fragrances.

Light sweet cinnamon, pine, wax and oddly, rather shower gel vibey.

Reminds me of those Christmas 10+ years ago when I still had the fortune of having my family close and everyone being able to gather.
The cold fresh air from the outside, the warmness of home, all those presents right next to the pine tree and the smell of bread in the air… the memories.

Takes me back, but even then, this fragrance isn’t an absolute love for me since it is pretty linear and it can get rather annoying.

Lavender with mimosa and a weird leathery note of tobacco-like wood with some sweetness thrown in there combine together to make an intoxicating lightly sweet flowery warm spicy fougere that lingers around you like the festive aura of an aromatic burning candle. It no longer smells like tobaco/leather/flowers, but simply, london burbery, the same way fahrenheit doesnt smell like violet and leather, but just fahrenheit, you know ?This is a smell that gets strongly in your face, remains fairly constant throughout, fills a bubble around you and warmly welcomes people in, perfect for colder weather.

London for Men Burberry,"Notes of Cinnamon, Lavender, Bergamot, Leather, & Mimosa Flower hit you all at once & makes for a very unique opening.

The Leather adds a bit of darkness, but overall Its opening smells like a Potpourri that doesnt know if it wants to be a late Sumer Potpourri with its dark Citrus, Lavender, & dried Leafy Woody-like nuances. Or a Fall Potpourri with its dark Honeyed Cinnamon, & dried Leafy Woody-like nuances.

The Mimosa Flower adds a mild Floral Dusty, Honeyed sweetness.

Many people claim to pick up on a Phantom Note of ""Port Wine"". I do not.

I cant pick up on this fragrances Tobacco Note either. Or should I say that the dried ""Leafy Woody-like"" undertone that I do pick up on isnt discernable to my nose as a note of ""Tobacco"".

It smells more like dried Pelargonium to my nose. Which is why this fragrance smells so much like Potpourri IMO.

What I smell in Burberry's London is pretty straight forward.

I get strong notes of Cinnamon, Lavender, Leather, Mimosa Flower, & a dried fragrant Woody Leaf that smells more like Pelargonium. Which makes the overall composition of this fragrance smell like a Potpourri that can be used to transition from late Summer into Fall.

Nevertheless Burberry's London is a true classic. A love for myself & many others. One that will no doubt be around for a very long time.",07/02/24 09:34,NOSEYBODY

London for Men Burberry,"I was tempted by the fragrance gods again, this time to purchase a 30ml bottle of Burberry's London for a very reasonable price. A familiar voice inside reminded me that I have over 70 scents already, what do I need another one for?

I haven't even smelt London, but I know it's often described as the definitive Christmas perfume. So I did a mental inventory of the scents in my collection that could claim the title as the ideal partner for Christmas.

My personal perfect companion is Potion EDP from DSquared². This Annick Menardo creation is a spicy/woodsy melange that totally fits the occasion. When that runs out, Bentley For Men Intense could step in with a more boozy/spicy spin on things. Then there's Givenchy Pi, Tom Ford's Noir Extreme, Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb, Comme des Garçons 2 Man, Dior's Eau Sauvage Parfum...

Common sense has prevailed, no London just yet as I'm sorted for Christmas options.

London for Men Burberry,"Forgot I had this in my collection. It was just sitting there, so I decided to give it a wear. And wow I forgot how good this stuff is.

To me this has a fresh, out-the-shower type of quality (in the best way possible) which i find pretty unusual for sweeter and tobacco-based fragrances, but i’d say it works very well here. It blends everything together, making the tobacco and cinnamon notes very pleasant.

Only thing that lets this fragrance down for me is the performance, with moderate projection and longevity. All in all, this is a super reliable and affordable fragrance great for the colder months.

London for Men Burberry,"I smelled this once about 7 yrs ago before this week and at the time, I was getting too much of a strong smoky tobacco scent on my skin and that was my main thing about not re-visiting. Years later and with a varied palette for fragrances, I gave this one another try for about $22 for the 1oz. online.

This fragrance is not nearly as much of a situational/holiday time scent as often described imho. Yes it does have a brief ornamental tree like vibe in the first 30 mins on me but even then I don't think that is very noticeable in the air.

The mimosa soft candied like note is present throughout the fragrance and it's coupled with the sweeter side of lavender while not reminding one of a clean type of scent or even an overly sweet one. This smells to me like a cherry, cinnamon tinged Black N' Mild mixed with Stetson cologne's nephew who's 15 yrs younger an not nearly as intrusive and won't attach himself into your memory like uncle Stetson. It tips its hat to an old-school styled fragrance while not smelling like a dated fragrance. The leather in it is blended well. As far as ages who'd probably appreciate it, I'd say more of a 35+ scent.

The scent itself is not spectacular but it also is not a turn off. It's like it could be more interesting but neither is it dull. There's nothing strange or gross about it really when smelling from the atomizer which is the case with many fragrances. It doesn't smell cheaply made. The musk is present for sure but it's not necessarily musky and it carries the fragrance while also adding to that older vibe that it gives off. I like the opening and think it could be more interesting along the way but it's a pretty good scent overall and I think it's worth it for what I paid. I'm neither in a rush to get another bottle nor am I upset that I have this one and will probably be wearing it as my main scent for the rest of Winter and early Spring. Besides heat above 65 degrees, I think this can be worn anytime and no I don't think you'll smell like a Christmas tree, you'll smell like a grown man with just a slight nod to smelling mannish but not in an in your face way.

This sits pretty close to skin after an hour or so but it does last even if you're a bit nose blind to it. It's not something you refresh with, just let it do its thing for the life of the 2-5 spray (depending on situation) and wear it again the next time you get dressed.

A solid, moderately pleasant smelling, sweetish and warm tobacco, ambery, mature scent.

It was worth what I paid for what I got.",02/08/24 13:06,waymonbrown84
London for Men Burberry,"Still to this date this is the best fragrance for men from Burberry IMHO and Hero would be the worst.

London for Men Burberry,"This fragrance is such a unique scent, the opening has this unique pine tree smell that amazes me and the drydown becomes more sophisticated with the tobacco and lavender notes shining at it’s brightest.

“An aromatic, woody fragrance.
Top notes: bergamot, lavender, black pepper and cinnamon leaf.
Soft middle notes: mimosa, leather and port wine.
Base notes: tobacco leaves, guaiac wood, oak lichen and sweet myrrh.”

It’s a classical, sophisticated fragrance with a good price.
We have a 10 year old bottle and it lost almost all notes (now we can only sense lavender, cinnamon, myrrh, some sweetness reminiscent of the port wine, wood, a little oak lichen note and MINT). So, if you buy it, USE IT.",01/31/24 10:58,cstop777

From the first time i smelled 'Hawthorn Bloom' i feld taken far far away to a green pasture on a field full of wild flowers.

Hours later, after spraying it on my wrist, i stil can't make out the distinct notes. It's a lovely flowery fragrance with a certain unknown twist (at least for me).

I fell in love with it from the fist second and hours later i still feel the same.

Great parfume!",12/15/18 12:43,Aleccsei
Hawthorn Bloom Burberry,"Fragrance -Hawthorn Bloom Burberry
Bottle from - 2017

Hawthorn Bloom reminds me of a charming woman in love wearing light purple dress,waiting on the white bench in flower park for her man to join her.
It is a floral,sensual,romantic,moderatly sweet,powdery and enchanted by the master Francis Kurkdjian fragrance.I think it is more feminine than masculine scent.Hawthorn Bloom opens with rich,natural and romantic floral notes of orris and violet,followed by jasmine in the middle.Than as it lingers on the skin,it slowly moves to a little bit passionate,woody,musky,powdery floral scent,with a hint of patchouli,and a wisper of love.

Longevity - 7/10(7+hours)
Silage/Projection - 7,5/10(nice projection and silage for the first 2-3 hours)
Weather - autumn,winter and spring
Age - 20+
Compliments - 9/10
Scent - 9/10

Main notes according to me - orris(orris is the root of the iris flower),violet,jasmine,musk,patchouli.

The drydown is powdery and i get some -
floral notes,woodiness,patchouli and musk.

Emotions - sensual,natural,romantic flower garden,charming, passionate,woman in love.

Occasion -for more or less any ocasion.

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I had an opportunity to pick up an unopened mini bottle of this recently. I very much enjoy the 1995 Burberry for Men and thought I'd give this a shot. There's definitely some continuity between the two versions. I don't get the mint nearly as strongly in this 1981 version (hard to say whether it would have smelled differently 40-odd years ago), and the lavender, musk, and amber hit me much more heavily in this 1981 release than in the 1995, but the resemblance is there.

To me, this smells like a man in the 80s who spends his time wearing a suit (sans jacket, much of the time) sitting in a well broken-in oxblood leather executive chair at a solidly constructed, dark-stained black walnut or mahogany desk in an office with vertical wood paneling. He might be an executive type. He might be a crime boss. The office, chair, and desk may or may not be his - I won't ask questions, he smells like he probably belongs there, one way or another.

I find the 1995 release light, fresh, versatile, and well suited to daytime use in both casual and formal settings - very work appropriate, but just as easily worn with a t-shirt and nice jeans. This 1981 release is, by comparison, much darker, heavier, and, if you're not in the 1980s and the kind of person who sits in the office I describe above, probably best suited to nighttime use, or use in non-work contexts - perhaps a classy cigar lounge, or maybe a not-so-classy strip club (to give two extreme examples).

I like this a lot, but I can't really think of how or where I'd wear it in my life / with my lifestyle. I'll hold onto it anyway, just in case I happen to find myself headed somewhere this would make sense to wear.",10/01/24 21:48,kqfka
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"For nostalgia's sake and a rare treat of this sort: I recently scored a full bottle of this, which appeared to be in good shape - even including the box and insert that describes the whole line of products.

It smells almost like I remember, but not quite exactly. That's okay given how much time has passed.

It DOES however, smell like a close cousin of my bottle of Gres Homme (1996). The Gres is greener and being an EDT, is stronger. But the two could be flankers smelling them side by side, with some slight divergence in the later drydown.

About the strength. This is an EDC but it's an EDC like Aramis. It packs a wallop!

Burberrys is absolutely worth searching for if you're a fan of this kind of scent. If no success, Gres Homme (1996) would be a great alternative.",04/15/24 15:20,Br'eauDeCologne
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"Was it Keat's ""soft-dying day"" or Yeat's ""October twilight"" that was preferred by this man in his walks in the Autumn sunset? Did he wear an Ivy cap to really warm his head or to appear well-read? Is he always cultural and clean or secretly damaged and sometimes mean? So many questions, so few answers at the ""other end of the telescope"" as Elvis Costello sang.

He wore Burberrys for Men, redolent with marjoram, that one herb that is the question mark among exclamation points. Mild and sweet, much like his demeanor, like spearmint-scented oak wood, more intensified when the herb is dry, much like his sense of humor. Its smell reminds me of a walk in the Vermont woods, when you can almost smell the fauna among the flora, the smell of warm sheep's pelt, and then tang of juniper berries can be made out among the lash of mugwort bushes.

It simmers down to a soft round patchouli awash in musk, firmly planted in the twilight comfort of a leather base. It is a welcome relief from the strain of dialectics, as this man takes off his cap and undoes a couple buttons of his Oxford shirt to just feel comfortable in his own human vulnerability for a while.

This gem was only on the market for about ten years, subsequently replaced by an entirely different Burberrys for Men in 1991. Sadly, it's become quite scarce and is therefore a treasure in my collection. For those who may want to seek a similar sensibility, there is also the lovely original (not new) version of Perry Ellis for Men cologne, which lies in the same vicinity.",03/06/24 07:43,alphairone
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,An Executive´s scent of the early 80s. Sitting long office autumn days as a fairly succesful head of a top management organization in the construction business while dreaming of scenic golf rounds in Spain with fellow business collegues requires a scent that goes with a dynamic but mature international aspiring personality.

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I was fortunate to score a NIB mini bottle. This stuff is amazing. Old school 80s: rich, dark and mossy. Performance is excellent.

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"So I'm writing this review because I find myself gravitating towards vintage men's fragrance. I find the 70s and 80s men's fragrances to be the most well-blended and having a depth that has been missing in men's colognes for a long time now. Burberry the original 1981 version I was able to acquire and I must say the first thing that caught my attention was the true seamless, masterful blending and superior ingredients. This cologne starts off as one might expect with that dated Macho old man smell. I don't mean in a grandpa sort of way but definitely vintage. However within 30 minutes it settles in to a warm rich smooth sent that indeed is all man. I find it very sexy yet calming. I would think this performs best in cooler climate and vintage or gated or whatever you want to call it there is no mistaking that it is a masterpiece. If you've ever had the pleasure of smelling Perry Ellis signature from 1985 you might think these two were cut from the same cloth. The similarity between the two is really interchangeable between the apapa max in Perry Ellis and the murderer in Burberry. Make no mistake although it might be an investment to acquire a bottle of Burberry the original it is so worth it. Is it something I will wear everyday know. Is it something I will wear frequently? Absolutely! It's very hard to come across these days but even if you can only score a miniature version I say go for it because these vintage fragrances like this are we coming harder and harder if not impossible to find these days and it is well worth having in a collection and certainly a true pleasure to wear as well.",01/30/20 21:23,ismellfine
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I had been on a quest for this classic. Back in the 80s, someone gave me a gift pack that included stick deo; shower gel, and generous-sized bottle (probably after shave; I wasn't paying that much attention back then). But OMG, I never forgot the rustic, yet sophisticated/animal-magnetic sense from the original Burberrys. I just got my hands on 2 oz. of EDT from Ebay. It was in a plastic bottle, authentic to how this classic was packaged over 35 years ago. It is the fragrance that I remember, although there has probably been some ""shifting in transit"", given all the time that has past (not claiming an expert schnazzola). It did take my sense of scent back in time, nonetheless. I wonder if there is anything else really close to this fragrance, being that I'll tear through 2 oz. pretty fast, and I ponied up for what I have.

Impression: conifer, but not pine, fir, or spruce; dry and just a little sweet, with a peppery hint, and good staying power.",02/24/19 12:04,Jack2scents

Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"I remember when I was about 11 years old, walking in the department store with my folks after church on a Sunday afternoon in the winter. A pretty lady asked me if I wanted a sample of this new cologne. It was the best smelling men's cologne I had ever experienced up to that point and to this day I remember how good it was. I held on to that little towelette sample as long as I could, careful to fold the pouch it came in to tuck in all the fragrance. That thing lasted about a year or more, stashed away in the upper drawer of my dresser.

I never forgot it.

I have owned and smelled lots of amazing fragrances since then (including a couple from Burberry), but very few made an impression on me like Burberrys did. I am sure nostalgia and the pretty lady made an impact, as well ... but this was just a great symphony of notes, period. My young nose knew it then and my old-ish nose knows it now.",11/03/14 15:05,Br'eauDeCologne
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"Thankyou perfumecritic for making sense of this confusion. I knew the bottle in the main picture wasn't the one I was looking for. The Burberrys for Men that I wore and loved from the early 1980s was the vertical oblong bottle (as per the picture on the right). I haven't seen it for a long time. It was very popular and is yet another much lamented absentee (Ted Lapidus PH and Charles Jourdan un Homme).

And if all of this wasn't confusing enough, in 1995 after the apparent failure of Society for women and the 1981 & 1991 versions of Burberry's for men, the company launched another set of fragrances with the exact same name, ""Burberry's"", however this time the word London appeared underneath the company's moniker. Of the three versions from 1981, 1991 and 1995, the 1995 product is the only one still in production. This is now sometimes referred to as Burberry's London for men, which is even more crazily misleading because Burberry's did indeed launch a Burberry's London for men just a few years back. These two fragrances have totally different bottles and totally different compositions.

When fragrance licenses expire and change hands we consumers witness all of this confusing naming business. Both Versace and Dior have suffered from the same problem with numerous fragrances launched at different times with slightly different compositions, or even wildly different compositions, but quite similar or exactly the same names.",05/26/13 09:38,perfumecritic
Burberrys for Men (1981) Burberry,"This review is for the bottle pictured above. I can see the comparison to Tiffany for Men, though not as much to Chanel pour Homme Concentree. Here the myrrh/vanillic quality is obvious, as is the vanilla in the Tiffany, but the patchouli is much less obvious. Perhaps it is closest to Caron's Third Man, though (that one is a bit more cloying than the Burberry, which is more herbal than Third Man). What I think I like most about this one is how there is great contrast between the aromatic elements and the sweet, syrupy oriental one. Spice seems to connect the two and prevent an irritating clash from occurring. There is also a kind of woody background hum which supplies some ""structure."" This is the kind of scent that recent designer attempts seem to fail miserably at, and my guess is that lack of ingredient quality is the key problem (though in some cases there is another issue, such as being overly sweet). Of course some don't perceive the ""synthetic"" qualities of them, but that also means they probably can't appreciate the richness and depth of scents like this one. This is really well balanced and should be ranked very highly, IMO, even when compared against other vintage greats !

UPDATE: If you can't afford this one or just can't find it, I suggest trying Mesmerize for men by Avon. No, I don't think it's exactly the same or that the ingredient quality or blending is as good but it may be close enough for you, all things considered. Heritage is another in the same general range as this one.

UPDATE #2: I have now tried the ""original,"" from 1981. Apparently, the bottle (and formulation) pictured above is from around 1991/1992. In any case, the 1981 formulation smells a great deal like Vetiver de Puig, though perhaps just a bit smoother. I'll just copy and paste the notes for Vetiver de Puig below and that will give you an idea of what to expect (it's dry, with strong lavender, sandalwood, and vetiver):


TOP:
galbanum
bergamot
aldehydes
lemon

MIDDLE:

I have 1.5 ml of intense, elixir, and toilette and they all smell pretty similar but special in their own ways. Thank god for the jasmine or else I think I might dislike it a bit more. Easy to wear and versatile like all the others as well.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"By pure chance I was searching for this gem and found a bottle for sale, which I haven't been able to find for years! It was never super popular here in Australia, or maybe it just wasn't marketed for this area of the globe.
Either way, 6 years later and it's still a magical (and powerful) scent. I think this was one of my first fragrances that really pushed away from the ""juvenile"" feel a lot of sweet fragrances have. I dont mean quality of ingredients, I mean how it wears - yes, its red fruits drizzled in a fantasy resin jùs - but it's elegant, it's refined. It has class.",06/27/25 14:16,silent_hill_dylan

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Omg I seriously miss this one. It was a full-blown powerhouse … total beast mode in a bottle! The strongest in the Burberry Her line, and honestly, the closest thing I’ve ever smelled to Baccarat Rouge 540 without actually being BR 540. It had that same sugary, airy, skin-clinging vibe but with its own bold twist.

This was my boss babe fragrance. Savage yet undeniably gorgeous. It announced your presence and left a trail behind. Why do they always discontinue the best ones?!

First impressions: Lactonic, strawberry milk. Reminded me of powdered strawberry milk drink mix made by Nesquick. I thought it was safe enough and inoffensive. Girly yes, and easy enough to wear with a touch of powdery sweetness.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Honestly, I absolutely hate this perfume. I blind bought based off of a recommendation and it was a mistake. It is so sickly sweet in a fake fruity cough syrup kind of a way. A really really thick cough syrup. My husband loves it, unfortunately, but it actually nauseates me when I wear it. It’s not sexy or sophisticated at all in my opinion. It’s young, obnoxious, trying too hard.",09/27/24 05:02,haileytf

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I really like this perfume. It is sweet, but not overly so, spicy & sophisticated and I don't really get any ""medicinal"" vibes when I wear it myself. To me personally it is the definition of cozy. I feel like it is appropriate for both day and night, but definitely not a summer fragrance. As you put it on you get strong, sweet (but unfortunately not sour) berry notes, and as time passes the balsamic notes begin to shine through. Definitely a very feminine fragrance. I really dislike vanilla, so after my purchase I was glad to find out that this fragrance does not contain it - probably the reason I liked it so much.

The best quality of this perfume is that it's EXTRA long lasting! At the end of the day I still feel it even though I don't apply any lotion underneath. On clothing it is borderline eternal, so use with caution haha. In my opinion the silage is moderate, but definitely not overwhelming. I definitely recommend it and even though it is discontinued I will probably try to get my hands on another bottle x",06/07/24 04:28,pola.bear<3

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,This thing was a jumpscare for my nose I don't know what got lost in translation from Her EDP to here but the DNA in my opinion is entirely absent and this honestly just smells like something my doctor would present me with when I've got a bad cough.

When i first sprayed it on i couldn't understand why they discontinued it because it's truly one of the best perfumes i've ever tried. It's quite long lasting, it lasts on me for 8-9 hours without applying any type of lotion. I wasn't gonna talk about how good it smells because y'all already know but i can't help it, i have to. It smells heavenly, like you are in a field of strawberries.The sillage is also amazing, you don't have to spray much because it'll do the job itself. In my opinion, it's much better than Burberry Her in every way even though it's a flanker. Don't think twice about buying it if you can find it!",08/10/23 15:11,melisthefirebender
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"tested this a while back and I liked it! the mix of red fruits and blackberries was delicious and this flanker is definitely more complex and interesting than other versions of Her. almost as if original Her got a degree from a proper university and dyed her hair dark from blonde :)

the sillage and longevity were also great - put on a couple sprits and could still smell this on my clothes after 6+ hours. however, after a while benzoin and jasmine get very intense which almost gave me a headache. maybe this would work better during autumn or winter, but during summertime you won't miss this. maybe I'll still buy this if I spot this somewhere - it's hard to come across!",08/02/23 06:18,bringprivateaccordback

The sillage on Her Intense is 10/10 and I received compliments from everyone around me including store assistants, dentists and colleagues.

I used to carry the 15ml sample bottle around with me as a lift me up as the scent never failed to make me smile.

This is truly magical on my skin and it somehow works perfectly for every season. It does share a similar DNA to BR540 but it's not a dupe whatsoever.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"It's... nice. I guess. Not memorable. I literally forget how it smells if I'm not wearing it. I was disappointed after hearing that it's sweet. It really isn't, at least not in a way that is significant. The strawberry just doesn't do much for me. It smells like I'm wearing a perfume fit for... someone else.

Edit: I came back to this fragrance after some months now. And honestly, I don't know what I was saying. After having smelled other kinds of perfumes, I realize just how uniquely elegant and moody this perfume is. I am fortunate to still have it considering that it is probably discontinued. It also holds sentimental value for me because it was the first real perfume I have ever had, given to me by my dad. How stupid of me to have wanted something generic or obvious in it's DNA. At the time I had wanted a fruit smoothie kind of fragrance. But BHI literally smells like a sparkling gemstone. Like a garnet or ruby. I have worn this perfume to so many special events: Shen Yun, Riverdance, the Brigderton Ball Experience, etc. And I now realizethat it was the perfect scent for all of those moments. Now when I think of those moments, they all smell like Burberry Her Intense. It will forever have a special place in my heart!",04/10/23 18:44,onjelbercier

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Synthetic and sweet red berries with benzoin. On my skin it is actually not that syrupy sweet. Instead the notes of jasmine and benzoin comes through which gives it a more clean vibe. The notes of red berries are still there but goes softer with time. It definitely takes me to carefree and sunny days during spring.
I also get some nostalgia because of its synthetic berry notes. It reminds me of this soap bar from LUSH that is called Rockstar which I used to love around the early 00's. That has a similar synthetic scent of red berries.
But I also get the similarity of how some barbie dolls used to have that sort of synthetic and sweet berry scent.",03/03/23 23:22,Woodamber

I highly recommend you test this on your skin first or you may be disappointed!",12/19/22 04:55,nateya

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"If you ask me this is a fruitier version of Dior Hypnotic Poison EDT! At first spray it smells like some sort of fruity cocktail or a mixer; I can't really put my finger on what it is but it smells like an alcoholic drink (that probably has contreau in it, for some weird reason).

There's a lot of boozy red berries and, it takes a while but, cherry takes center stage. Once it completely dries down there's an almost plastic quality to it - it reminds me of the playdoh note in HP EDT but it's not quite the same. Some people say it's that of a plastic doll and I guess that's not totally wrong.

It's also as powdery, warm and cozy as HP EDT. It kind of makes me think of christmas evening after one has left church. Like there's still myrrh or some incense on your clothes and after you get inside from the cold, make a fire and sit down with a fruity alcoholic drink. The benzoin gives it this incense base, that turns sirupy together with the berries and gives a smoky feel. Boozy sirupy, still after a few hours on the skin.

I like this fragrance; I think it's much more complex than the notes would suggest and it has some sort of mysterious aura to it while also being approachable. When I first sprayed it it was a bit too harsh; too loud and boozy for me. In the drydown it is much more elegant and sophisticated, but, for me, way too powdery (same with HP EDT) and too heavy on the cherry. But, while I overall like it, it also gets reeeeaaally timid after only a few hours, at least on my skin. It doesn't project at all and is much more of a skin scent - which surprised me after it started out so loud. I just thought I'd like it way more than I do now after wearing it for half a day. It's a nice scent overall and there's definitely occasions where I'd still wear it, but personally I won't buy a bottle.

This is definitely not a safe blind buy (yes it's discontinued now but it's still available in many stores!) except if you know and like Dior's Hypnotic Poison EDT but want something less vanilla and more fruity.",12/12/22 11:39,fragrantkilljoy

Not worth it - At All 😐
It's not a bad fragance, maybe it was reformulated already, since mine says made in Spain ....
To my nose this is very different from the original, to my nose this is more ambery and Cherry chapstick like, whereas the original is bright 🔆, 'girly' and 'fruitier'.

The middle can be a bit too much, I would suggest spraying somewhere lower than the neck, that way you'll get wifs of the scent but won't be overwhelmed by it. I suspect the benzoin makes the middle quite heavy. Still, on me the Intense is less cloying than the original so I prefer the Intense.

Returns into freshness before fading away.

Lovely bottle; beautiful colours that are quite appropriate for a fall scent.

I own Coach Wildrose as well and these too are similar copying one another at different points as the scent developes. Intense is - as the name suggest - a more intense version with better longevity and depth. Wildrose is the more lighter version, more approrite for everyday use or to be used on a day off. Personally I like them both and think that is useful to have them both.

I have only tested Baccarat Rouge 540 once and being almost anosmic to it cannot really say anything of how Burberry Her Intense compares to it, except of course that I can actually smell the Intense and like what I smell.

Lucky to have found a bottle at a reasonable price, this scent seems to be disappearing fast. Also, quite content with my 30ml, I only need two sprays (on clothes) to be sweetly scented for a full day.",10/29/22 10:01,Gellert77
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Burberry Her EDP is a berry sweet juicy spray with some musk. It's extremely fruity. Did not like it enough to buy a bottle.
Burberry Her intense is berry and sticky sweet with a bit more warmth from the amber.
To compare the 2, I prefer the original EDP.

If it's any comparison at all, I have not smelled BR540 before so not sure of the similarities. But I LOVE Ariana Cloud scent profile and I have now concluded I don't like Burberry Her and the flankers.",10/22/22 00:24,kissabelle
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I love Burberry Her, but the intense version is not worth it.
A saleswoman recommend this version of Burberry her to me because she thought I would love it based on my taste in fragrances so I tried it on my skin for the rest of the day. From the first 15min and for the following 5 hours that I had it on it smelled like synthetics,plastic bag or cheap fresh fruity chewing gum. Plus , it gave me a headache. Please just go straight for the original Her , ignore this!

**** Based on my experience, but maybe in another's woman skin will smell nice. Just try it first.",10/19/22 07:38,angiemats133

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I really enjoy Her intense. The opening has a very sweet, almost medicinal, cherry. To me it's a very dark and juicy cherry. I also get quite a bit of blackberry on my skin. Then the jasmine shows up but it's definitely in the background. It gives it a slight creaminess. Once it dries down the benzoin really makes it beautiful! It becomes this warm, sweet and creamy cherry with a slight hint of juicy blackberry. I love this during fall and winter. The original Her is the one I reach for in spring and summer. It's a bright, fresh berry and is also very sweet.",09/18/22 14:21,Shaina87

I too struggle with wearing any of the Burberry Her lineup. I have Burberry Her edp and the edt, and I totally get what you mean about notes smelling artificial. Especially the strawberry note in Her. I just got the Burberry Her Elixir today, and it's just ""okay"", but I'm still getting that artificialness that is so off-putting. I know the Intense version has been discontinued, and I'm definitely too afraid to blind buy it. Your review made me realize it's not a safe blind buy feeling as I do about the rest of the Burberry Her lineup. Ironically, I enjoy Cloud by Arianna Grande.",09/10/22 12:10,b.a.denney
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"My love... I have returned to wax poetic about her because she's being discontinued. You bet I stockpiled two bottles I never want to be without it. I've always thought this was delicious, but in an ambivalent sort of way. My love for this perfume is INTENSE and has grown and grown over the time I've had it. When you catch it in the air it's like a trail of the most saccharine, fruity EXPENSIVE bubblegum. Sooo delicious, sweet and warm. If I've gone a little while without smelling it, and use it - I fall in love all over again!

I put it down and went trying other fragrances, but as it dried down a little on my skin it turned into something mesmerising and I fell in love with it. This perfume is like a good wine, the longer it sits the better it gets. On the very last drie down i did get that BR 540 vibe so I can understand why people find it similar, but to me this is completely different scent and not a dupe of it.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"wow, immediately, straight up candy. i already think that burberry’s her line is rather juvenile, not in a bad way but in a young teenager-y way so for me to wear them i would need to be in a certain mood. i get the juicy berries without losing the candy aspect. burberry her in the background but the main character is that extremely chewy candy with jam filling inside. if you’re into such scents this is a match! it stays longgg and has great projection, with every movement of my arm i got a whiff of sweet candy.",05/13/22 12:15,seliko
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"So far the only one out of the bunch that manages to find a balance between the sweetness and the aspects that in BR540 translate into wet band aids and industrial sanitizer. Don't be fooled by the notes listed here, as some of these notes are simply approximations (red fruits isn't an actual note), and the list is definitely incomplete. There's clearly a core idea that Kurkdjian has enjoyed working with and developing throughout the process of creating these fragrances as there's an obvious correlation between BR540, BR540 Extrait, Burberry Her and Her Intense. Her and Her Intense being reimaginations of the original idea into something with more mass appeal. Out of the four it's in my opinion Her Intense that manages to find a balance between the things that Kurkdjian set out ot express without going too far in one direction.

The perceived saltiness in Her Intense remains only strong enough without it becoming too metallic and wet-smelling. Similarly the sweetness is such that it can be perceived as salted caramel, rather than a thick sugary syrup. Smelling this, floral and fruity definitely aren't the first words that come to mind. Takes some getting used to, but I find that it can be oddly comforting. I'm beginning to really like and enjoy this. Longevity is extremely good, and on fabric lasts for several days. More of a cold weather fragrance definitely.",04/25/22 14:28,scentine
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This is a strawberry bubblegum version of Bacarrat 540.
Opens with a strong liquorice note (maybe the benzoin) then softens out to be more powdery.
It’s not my usual type of scent, but I bought a discounted damaged bottle and I do find myself reaching for it for certain occasions for something fun and girly.
I smell 540 and dupes everywhere I go recently, and I think this is a nice variation without the metallic vibe
Not great performance performs like a body mist",04/23/22 12:49,AnaMaria97

It opens very spicy and warm on me, it took some getting used to to be honest. I don’t get any fruit or berry notes until some time has passed, it gets much sweeter and a little powdery during the dry down (which I love). I don’t get much of the jasmine, just sugary spicy amber. The benzoin is very obvious so if that’s not your thing stay clear. I wanted something sweet but more adult and this is it!

To me, this is a feel good scent. More of a fall, winter type of scent but generally works well on days that aren't too hot and rather 'stay-at-home' days.
Personally, I love putting on two sprays of this after I shower at night and lay in a freshly covered bed.
Immediately gets me in a sleepy, wholesome mood. Feels like a hug in a bottle.
This is also office-friendly, and an absolute compliment getter. The longevity is insane, I smell this on my clothes for weeks.

But this evening, as I was washing dishes, he came up behind me, buried his nose in my neck, inhaled deeply and said, ""You smell nice."" Lol! It might not seem like much but trust me, it's huge.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Blind bought this when I heard it's getting discontinued. I sampled and liked the OG Burberry Her, but not enough to buy a full bottle. It felt too youthful and girly. There's too much of a strawberry shampoo vibe going on. I bought this in hopes that it's a warmer, deeper, more mature version of Her. I'd say it definitely is. But, all the criticisms in the reviews below also apply. It certainly has a strong berry cough syrup scent in the opening. I understand the Redbull comparisons too. That does fade away after awhile, and becomes something more powdery. Not ""baby's diaper"" powdery as one reviewer stated, but definitely powdery. The OG Her does not smell powdery to me. The smell of berries is still prominent in the midnotes of Her Intense, just more ""berries and cream"" and less cough syrup at this stage.

I'm not sure yet if I'm pleased with this as a blind buy, but I'm going to give it a chance. Waiting to see how I feel about the drydown, which was my favorite part of the OG Her. I sprayed this a few hours ago and the fragrance is still in the middle stage (berries and cream and powder). This smells nothing like Cloud or BR540 to my nose. This one does remind me a bit of D&G The Only One. Not that they smell entirely similar, but that they both have a very thick, syrupy-sweet opening and a powdery undercurrent in the midnotes.

Update: I do like the drydown. I get little whiffs of that BR540-ness in the air, like I do with the drydown of the OG Her. However, you have to wait a long time to get there. Like 6 hours. So, if you can stand smelling like a jagerbomb for the better part of your day in order to get to the delicious base, this perfume is for you!",03/14/22 14:07,mermaidylady
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I really like this perfume. Nothing groundbreaking but well done.
When first sprayed I get a bit of fruit notes but its fleeting. On dry down I get mainly a warm cashmere/vanilla with a bit of floral--similar to all the fragrances on the market right now. Its very well blended so its difficult to pick out the notes in this fragrance beyond vanilla/cashmere.
A good candidate for a blind buy. Reminded me of LVEB when I first sprayed but not as overpowering and not as sweet. On dry down it reminded of bare vanilla from Victoria's secret--warm cozy classy. As for performance it lives up to its name. Good but not overwhelming sillage and lasts at least 4 hours on my skin when applied normally.",03/10/22 20:33,saccitygrl01

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Bought this in 100ml because its being discontinued. I already have and love the original version of Her. Biggest difference is Her original has a strong strawberry smell upon spraying it, while Her Intense smells like the fruits in the 4 red fruits tea mixed with freezing cold air.
Her intense also has a stronger baccarat rouge vibe on immediate application than the original has. The original only smells like baccarat after you've worn it for 4-5 hours.

Her intense isn't as sweet as the original, but only by a little bit. So don't buy unless you like sweet and fruity fragrances. My mother and grandmother find these sickening, but I love them so it's all down to what you personally prefer.",02/23/22 15:44,finnlinn

It doesn't make me sick or give me migraines which I suffer from w/o fragrance. So that's a plus point if you would like to try. I love gourmand fragrances too, and sadly this one was neither here nor there for me. I'd add that to me this is a winter fragrance. Get a sample first, I know better.",02/10/22 13:03,Deppaholic

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This perfume promises so embotle London rainy days and it somewhat does. I wear it on rainy days, it's like a routine for me now. However I must say that once I finish it, I'm most likely not gonna re-buy it, it's sweet but the benzoin adds a weird ending that I personally find too strong and doesn't allow me to embrace the sweetness of this perfume completely. It's a good, strong, long-lasting perfume perfect for women who like to play the ''I'm sweet but at the same time hard to get so I become strong'' type of game. I'm not that kind of girl, therefore, this perfume ain't 100% for me.

Initially it smells pretty similar to the original, but the berry on the initial spray is much darker than the strawberry in the original. After the dry down though it was really warm and spicy to my nose which is just not something I’m looking for in a fragrance. I will say the projection and lasting power in a single spray is impressive, much better than the original.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I’m torn because I like the opening of Burberry Her, but the dry down of Intense better. In the end I purchased a bottle of Intense.

Like others have said it is reminiscent of a cherry cough syrup at first but that quickly goes away and you pick up on the berries. A boozy berry. In the eventual dry down, it becomes warm and caramely and addictive.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,Walked into sephora to smell this and WOW! out of all the fragrances I smelled today this one left a print. It's fruity amber. A little on the warmer side. Now that I've smelled this I definitely understand what red fruits means because I get that with a warmer jasmin. It reminds me of Christmas with the red fruitnote but also remindsme of a really nice vacationon an island in the evening. Not sure what benzoin is but I get all the top and middle notes. Its SO simple in terms of notes but its sooooooo good! Definitely evening wear but im sure you could pull it off in the morning too! I'm definitely purchasing this for Christmas.,11/26/21 14:53,Dreamdott
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"A bubblegum explosion a first then dries down to be quite musky with the berry smell accompanying

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I was initially supposed to buy the original one, Burberry Her, however I'm ecstatic that I bought this Intense flanker by mistake, since it's definitely my new favorite fragrance!

I straight up got the berry top notes at the very first spray. But about 5 -10 minutes or so in, it burned down to this combination with berries and a sweet, deep vanilla, which is most likely coming from the benzion. An hour later, the berry scent is somewhat gone and you're left with this beautiful and delicious vanilla fragrance.

I'd also say that the longevity is long lasting, as 3 sprays lasted about 6-7 hours on me. After that, I'd have to get closely to my wrist to smell it.

The only ""con"" I'd have to give this perfume, is that I wasn't able to smell the jasmin. Which really isn't an issue for me, considering my username ;), since it already smells soo good.

Overall I'd say Burberry Her Intense smells like a naturally deep and sweet vanilla, topped with some fruitiness and will therefore be given a 9.5/10 by me. :)",11/15/21 17:44,hannha_Banana
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Unfortunately not for me. Literally had to scrub it off as soon as I got the chance. Straight up smells like a candy store. Too much of the sweet syrupy smell that u get in the candy store of sugar in the air.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"For me this smells like powdery strawberry and bubblegum. It's really sweet. It lasts all day and projects moderately for me. The dry down smells very similar to Cloud by Ariana Grande. They both have this plastic or newspaper like quality that I can smell underneath all the goodness and it's slightly weird but it's perfectly tolerable for me. All in all I would say I like this one better than the original Burberry Her, as the oakmoss and masculine aspects of that one are stronger for me. Though I do think they smell almost the same.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This smells like syrup! I kept thinking it smelled familiar, like some kind of lollipop. But then it finally hit me, Luden’s cherry cough drops! I used to pop those like candy when I was a kid lol. The memories. The perfume has excellent longevity and projection though. It’s a much thicker, denser scent than the original Burberry her. The OG is an airy sugary sweet strawberry, this is syrupy sweet cherry/blackberry. They don’t smell alike to me at all. And not even close to br540 in my opinion.",10/19/21 19:02,loliirain
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This perfume is super syrupy! At the beginning till the end you can smell the red fruits and the benzoin. Those two notes are the dominant ones. Very very sweet.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"After reading comments about Burberry Her original version, I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought of Lush store scent when I smelled this. I guess the soapy aspect here reminds of the overall smell of soaps and baking-soda-based bath bombs. But because of the prominent sweet-fruity notes, I guess it's similar to... Snow Fairy scent from Lush? Maybe some other fruity product from there, I haven't visited it in a while.",10/03/21 14:51,blacksesame

On my skin it doesn't last long maybe 3 hours but on clothes it lasts a very long time, I would wear this in the autumn in the daytime in the UK but also on warm days In the summer.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Compared to Burberry her, this is more masculine. Her is a happier and sweeter scent at the opening, though they both dry down as beautifully. I prefer Her to Her Intense, but they layer very well together to get more dense and longevity. A sophisticatedly sweet treat.",09/26/21 02:57,Bow Nuttaa
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I do love the BR540/Cloud DNA, I'll be clear. And this has a bit of that going on in the drydown, but you need to wait a good amount of time.

A cherry cough syrup accord really envelops the opening experience until about an hour after application. It's very medicinal to me, and is thickly dense fruit, not a fleeting set of top notes. I really dislike artificial and super sweet cherry, and so I found that this isn't my taste. If you do like cherry though, this could be your bag of chips! :) I expected more of a berry scent, and so this disappointments me.

After an hour it does settle into the original Her/Cloud/BR540 thing that some of us enjoy, but I find that this is less so, and almost has a spiced vanilla thing happening as well (maybe that's the benzoin in here, but it doesn't smell like real benzoin to me). It's not annoying to at this point, but it still maintains a bit of the cherry note and I very much prefer it's cousin fragrances over this one, even including In The Stars, and that ""dupe"" is far, far more affordable.

I think this is fine if you're into cherry, and want some like the original Her, but less like BR540. The longevity and sillage is great. I just don't personally care for it.",09/25/21 00:35,ShadowsofLight

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Just amazing! It is sweet, but refreshing and dreamy at the same time. I was looking for ages for the scent like this, I tried D&G Pour Femme Intense, which opens with berries but after a while it's just sweet... With Burberry Her Intense even after 7-8 hours I could still smell those berries. Jasmin and benzoin, which develop over time, definitely give it more feminine character, so I wouldn't say it's girly. More like - charming.",08/16/21 04:13,Ivaz
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I tried it out of scientific curiosity, as Francis Kurkdijan has a very special place in my heart and although BR 540 is not my favourite fragrance, the comparisons intrigued me. So is Her Intense a more high end dupe than Cloud?

Not in my opinion.

Don’t get me wrong, they do have a similar vibe, I’m guessing it might be the jasmine that is present in both. However while BR 540 is very much unisex, Her Intense just reads extremely feminine. Or girly to be exact. The fruitiness makes it extremely young to me, the initial berry blast, though juicy and pleasant, reminds me of something I’ve worn as a child. Naturally we shouldn’t judge the scent by its opening so I let it sit.

After around half an hour I felt a strong urge to wash it off. It started smelling oddly familiar, not necessarily nice. I started getting stale redbull. I asked my coworkers and they all said the same thing. The berries turned into a cheap energy drink on my skin and I couldn’t wait for the fragrance to fade into oblivion.

As this one is the Intense version I expected quite a good performance, but the longevity was rather moderate, around 4 hours. The projection was very strong throughout those 4 hours though, I’ll give it that.

Baccarat Rouge gives me brown sugar and wood. The wood, vanilla, jasmine and amber harmonise beautifully and create the most perfect balance on your skin. Burberry Her Intense on the other hand just screams strawberry and to my nose, doesn’t even come close to the sophistication of BR 540 and is not a worthy dupe. Cloud smells very similar, a bit sweeter and less “expensive”, but a good replacement if you love the scent but not the price.

As a stand alone perfume, without comparing it to Baccarat Rouge it’s still not my favourite. I enjoy the original Her much better. The Redbull dry down was extremely weird, but I guess that’s on my ph levels.",08/13/21 13:03,vulgarsaint
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Intense is a little bit sweeter, less tart. Still very long lasting. To me this smells more like cherry chapstick or something artificial from childhood. The original smells like artificial strawberry/blueberry from childhood. I had a make up pallet when I was little with finger paint eyeshadows and they smelled like this. The original is still my favorite but this is really nice and different enough to keep. Intense is more powdery and yes there is something more mature in the dry down but I would still consider this a very playful fragrance. There are no fragrances that smell exactly like this. Maybe in the same family but still..it's really unique. Intense does not smell like Baccarat. Baccarat is more masculine leaning. Cloud smells like Baccarat.",08/09/21 07:11,MaxieF
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This smells delicious!

I bought this on a whim (blind buy) as Burberry fragrances never let me down and I was so glad I did. The fruity berry smell is prominent in the first 15 mins on my skin then they quickly dry down to jasmine and benzoin. On my skin, it smells more like a mix of creamy vanilla and some woodiness but I guess that can be attributed to the benzoin.

Luckily for me, the dry down is my favourite part of this fragrance. It's not a boring vanilla scent, it retains some of the floral freshness from the jasmine and has a faint woody scent which separates this from a lot of other vanilla based fragrances within my collection.

This lasts a good 8-9 hours on me but I spray on clothes as well as skin. It projects nicely for about 4 hours, I have had compliments passing by people at 9am though I sprayed it at 5am. Despite this, it is never overbearing. I occasionally ask people around me for feedback when wearing a new fragrance as I wouldn't want to offend anyone and there were no complaints regarding the strength of this perfume. Personally, I think it is best suited for autumn and spring. During these seasons, I seem to get the best performance.

This was a surprisingly great release from Burberry and is definitely worth trying for all ages.",08/07/21 02:56,20

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Sweet and airy and light and comforting, but at the same time I don’t think I would repurchase because it just doesn’t thrill me, it’s so inoffensive and innocent. This wouldn’t be amiss on a 10 year old girl. It really reminds me of something that I cannot put my finger on, feel like it was something from my childhood. Overall a pleasant scent, but I think there are better offerings from Burberry.",07/21/21 14:16,RSB28
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I was initially supposed to buy the original one, Burberry Her, however I'm ecstatic that I bought this Intense flanker by mistake, since it's definitely my new favorite fragrance!

I straight up got the berry top notes at the very first spray. But about 5 -10 minutes or so in, it burned down to this combination with berries and a sweet, deep vanilla, which is most likely coming from the benzion. An hour later, the berry scent is somewhat gone and you're left with this beautiful and delicious vanilla fragrance.

I'd also say that the longevity is long lasting, as 3 sprays lasted about 6-7 hours on me. After that, I'd have to get closely to my wrist to smell it.

The only ""con"" I'd have to give this perfume, is that I wasn't able to smell the jasmin. Which really isn't an issue for me, considering my username ;), since it already smells soo good.

Overall I'd say Burberry Her Intense smells like a naturally deep and sweet vanilla, topped with some fruitiness and will therefore be given a 9.5/10 by me. :)",07/21/21 09:01,FloralJasmine

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,I purchased this from Ulta yesterday and I am obsessed. I am not big on fruity scents but this is fruit with a hint of marshmallow. I think it sits pretty close to the skin but I love it. This will be my go to day time scent.,07/06/21 07:42,AshleyRaelyn
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Just like the original Her, it’s missing something. You will probably like it if you enjoy the ones it’s being compared to. Still on after exfoliating in the shower and left behind a woodsy scent. I’ll be passing on this, but that’s just personal. I would recommend this to someone just getting into fragrances, though.

I think it would be nice to layer Her with Her Intense.

Update: Can serve as, “I don’t want to scare him off” perfume.

Update 2: wore on a night out and had a guy friend smell my wrist. He said he smelled that on a few girls the night before. Which would probably mean he smelled a mix of BR540, Cloud and Her. There’s an uncanny familiarity between those to a untrained nose— that is nothing to deny.",06/27/21 14:52,spankyb
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"So far, this is my favorite fragrance. When shopping for my first perfume, I smelled this one and instantly fell in love with it, as well as my partner. It smells strongly of berries (mostly blackberries to me) with a nice hint of vanilla from the benzoin.

At first, the smell is strong enough to perfume the whole room. The first time wearing it, I got in a car right after and had to open the window a bit. It will smell strongly for quite a few hours, but I can still faintly smell it on my skin after 12 hours.

It's a solid 9.5/10 from me!",06/23/21 09:06,JessVanEgg
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This is way better than the OG Her, London Dream and the Blossom. Her is more fresh with the strawberry, more youthful than this, but I need something more syrupy, deeper and decadent. To my nose this escapes the Cloud/In the Stars/ Baccarat Rouge vibe in the opening. Yes it has that DNA, but I detect it later. Its very potent also, even after a shower I can smell it, but thats when I smell more of the Baccarat Rouge side of it. This is alot like a tanning oil scent, very beachy and deep. In my opinion its opening is very reminiscent of The One by D&G due to their balsamic, syrupy and deep sweet character. It is lighter than The One tho (which is heavier and with the vetiver it smells kinda like a greek church to me). Not dupes, just same genre.
Her Intense smells like there are more notes than the ones listed on here, as if theres mandarin orange here just like there is in Burberry Her, and in The One which also contains jasmine, and the ambery balsamic base is kinda similar to the benzoin here. After 1 hr on my skin its projection is fresher like Her and BR 540, but when I smell up close I still detect the beautiful resin sweet benzoin. Its opening is expensive, balsamic, syrupy and with intense red fruits, I absolutely love it, wish this was the essence of the entire perfume. Its benzoin (my fav base note) adds an oriental decadent touch to it in the opening and for the first one hour which I wish lasted longer.

I forgot to say that Her is already better than Cloud imo, more dimensional, more feminine, and its opening brings me images of a retro outdoor setting by the pool and tanning beds, so Her Intense amplifies this feeling and the ladies sunbathing wear big white elegant hats, gold earrings and their skin is shiny and tan like this bottle's colors. If I'm gonna have something like Baccarat Rouge 540 it better be this one! I have a tiny bottle of Cloud that I never wear anymore, and I own In the Stars which comes off more herbal with the borage so I like In the Stars more than Cloud. I wore Her Intense today in 93 degree weather while doing heavy yard work and it still smelled amazing. It actually made me buy the whole The One line (EDP, EDT and L'eau) cuz I realize how much I like intense sweet balsamic scents. Her Intense is",06/09/21 19:25,sassa7

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"To the poster Anastasia Ag from Swizterland. Unfortunately, under bright lights, body heat from being in so many peoples hands and finally so much oxygenation of the perfume from so many testers using can change a scent. Sometimes just a little, sometimes, like you've just experienced ~ a lot. If it's an expensive perfume that I'm going to invest $300-$500 or more in, I always ask for a new tester to be opened. It's about 50-50 as to who'll do it, but if they don't, I won't buy. A less expensive perfume, salespeople never will. Not that whatever you paid was insignificant, no amount of money spent on a nonessential item ever is, but some people don't think the way I do. Usually though, your scent will eventually match what you remember, if nothing else than with the introduction of oxygen when you spray each time. When I get a new frag home, I take it outside, spray a few times on my hand just out of curiosity and then put it up for a couple weeks. That usually does it for me. My son, a chemist, explained it all to me in very technical terms, but............I can't remember and the way I explained was the only way I could get it.🙃",05/16/21 17:12,ceeceelee
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This...is...incredible! 😍❤️I’m so glad I went with my gut that I needed something of this structure in my collection. I won’t disagree with the cough syrup consistency (though the scent is not medicinal to my nose) this is the definition of syrupy berry, thick, rich. Nothing getting in the way of it either. It’s straight to the point. It stands in such contrast with my natural smell I can identify it ALL DAY LONG! Hallelujah! As much as I love those “your scent but better- scents” they get lost in my natural smell of cupcakes and daydreams (kidding of course). But truly when I think of this scent- it’s the texture of a wax letter seal- its a liquified syrupy texture, then hardens and becomes sticky. This is a super sweet, warmed berry smell. I can see people saying it smells artificial.
But no human truly smells like cupcakes, or bubblegum, or honey, or grass. That’s the whole idea behind perfume, right?

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I was skeptical when I read it, but after testing this fragrance for a few days, the review below comparing it to the chaotic contents of a 20-year old's purse is actually spot on. Don't mind having experienced it; wouldn't purchase it now.

But maybe it's not quite as unattractive as that sounds...this scent is a young, fashionable Londoner after a night of clubbing and drinking at a high-end nightclub, where the surroundings and levels of inebriation gradually deteriorate over the course of a night. Or maybe a late teens / 20-something rich girl slumming it somewhere she wouldn't usually be. The scent seems too young to be properly chic, but it's an exact match for aspiring chic dabbling in a bit of early adulthood debauchery. The syrupy berries and benzoin remind me of a rite of passage: alcohol, make-up melting under the club lights and random hookups, with an inevitable nauseous hangover in the morning.",04/14/21 16:41,Lazarelle

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Burberry Her Intense is the grown up, more mature edition of the original EDP. The kind of synthetic 'strawberry'/cotton candy vibes become more of forest berries. The floral middle notes become less complex and the classic musky base is replaced by benzoin. For sure a more dressy perfume that is more medicinal as most of you mentioned, (sorry but I love medicinal smells as a medical doctor) more sirupy than airy without being something completelly different than the very first edition. Finally a perfume that is what it says it is! (You know the story of EDP & EDT with the same name but totally different composition). All in all, if I had to choose only one edition by a quick sniff, I am 99% sure this would be the Intense one, but as time goes on, I think that the silly-playful-fruity character of the original is unique.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Just in case this is of use to anyone.....

Having now smelled a majority of the ""Reminds Me Of"" scents, I will say that (to me) the similarities are to the original ""Burberry Her"" (except heightened benzoin + muted strawberry in BHI), and ""In the Stars"" (except tangelo + woody notes instead of berries in ITS).

It holds no resemblance to either the ""Baccarat Rouge"" EDP or Extrait, nor ""Cloud"". It's even further away from ""Lipstick Fever"".

I really enjoy this scent, but I also adore benzoin-heavy scents. If that's not a note you care for, you might want to step away from this perfume. :)

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Burberry Her Intense is one of the best, widely available designer fragrances marketed toward women. Yes, it smells like berry-scented chapstick mixed with perfume, but it somehow works as an everyday fragrance, possibly a signature scent. There have been some comparisons between this fragrance and the popular (yet pricey) BR540, also by Francis Kurkdjian, and I would say that these fragrances are in the same family, but Her Intense is not a dupe for BR540. BR540 is leans floral-aquatic and has a sense of space, while Her Intense is densely-packed. The burnt sugar note is turned down in Her Intense and I’m not picking up any woody notes.

Performance for Her Intense is excellent! I easily get 12+ hours out of one spray. The spray mechanism is one of the best I’ve tried with a fine mist and a wide distribution. Partial sprays are an option, so don’t worry about over spraying if you plan to wear it to work. Sillage is enormous, and I received compliments from one big spray.

If BR540 is a landmark fragrance that will continue to influence popular fragrances over the next decade, then Her Intense is one of the most accessible examples available. Excellent!

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"The first time I tested this perfume I thought it smelled warm and sweet but strong, over powering even, it stuck in my nose and smelled like medicine. I threw the test strip in my purse and thought that was that, until I opened my purse throughout the day, and the next day, and the next day. My entire purse, my wallet, mask all smelled like this perfume but the scent cooled down and smelled less like medicine and just like cherry, strawberry, vanilla with a hint of floral. I caved went back to the store on day three and bought it.

I highly recommend testing this in the store before buying, the red fruits will either be too much for you and remind you of medicine or you'll love it. It does smell different to me dried down, it holds on to skin and clothes, not something that stays in my face but if i put my sweater to my nose I remember it's there. I saw another comment about it being addicting like it kept calling I felt the same way. I will say I understand the comparisons to cloud but this is more mature and solid with dark red fruits, where as cloud smells fluffy like whip cream and juvenile (not in a bad way I have both and love them).

The bottle is simple, it also has a lengthy spray if you push the nozzle all the way down. Have you used those new Flairosol style spray bottles? Yeah just like that.",01/08/21 22:09,scentbae
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"On initial spray, I do get cherry cough syrup that fades into jasmine. It becomes strong jasmine for a while, then I'm guessing the benzoin comes in to kind of warm it and eventually it morphs into a cherry-vanilla sweetness. It does last on me for awhile.

I do like this one, even with the weird cough syrup thing. Definitely try it if you're interested in it. If you already have the original, I do not think it is worth also getting this one as they are kind of similar.
Update: I find my tastes to be changing and I do not like sweet or ""gourmand"" fragrances, therefore I don't really like this one or the original Her. They are too youthful, too sweet, too ""cheap body spray"" for me.",12/28/20 13:35,lavender_and_teal013
Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I absolutely love Burberry Her Intense and it is quickly becoming one of my most reached for perfumes. I have a 50ml bottle and I will definitely be repurchasing when it's finished. I've seen a few reviews mention it is like sickly cherry cough syrup, I personally don't get that at all - on me it is like mixed berries with a lightly spicy warm vanilla and I think it's absolutely beautiful. Great sillage and long lasting - it is one of my most complimented perfumes (particularly by men) and seems to be noticed hours after spraying. I find it very classy and whenever I wear it I feel good. I think it is most suited to autumn or winter as it carries very well in cold weather and has a warm vibe - I bought it in September though so am yet to try it in really warm weather. Highly recommend for anyone who likes a rich fruity gourmand!",12/21/20 01:45,JessLH27

Burberry always have this posh feeling - my sister said it smelled disdainful and pretentious 😭😭 - with their fragrance but this one is special. Playful, fun, it’s a scent for someone who enjoys each day to their fullest, knowing the world is theirs. Effortless and beautiful.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"I have been using this for a while and I have to say I prefer it over the original Her. The strawberry note was too much for me but this blend is more rounded to my nose, lighter but still very long lasting and easier to wear.

I also have to say that I hated it when I first sprayed it out of the bottle it smelled like what people mentioned it to be a cough syrup. But it was gone quickly and next time I used it it never smelled like it at all. It has little sourness to it as well and I really love the benzoin here. I hated Burberry Her’s dry down, it was very masculine and it didnt match the scent at all. How A strawberry candy scent could have a drydown so masculine. But Her Intense is smooth, the benzoin compliments the scent and gives a clean vanilla effect and it is a good soft blend with slightly sour berries.

It also feels like you dont wear a perfume so if you cant tolerate heavy scents and want something light, easy going but still long lasting and not headache inducing this could be your gem",12/02/20 04:02,Alinany

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"This is definitely one of the more interesting experiences I’ve had with any fragrance.

I blind bought this and hated it at first. It gave me a medicinal cough syrup vibe that made me nauseous and gave me headaches upon headaches. So screechy and synthetic it felt like my senses were being attacked.
But somehow that bottle kept calling my name, asking me to smell it. I hated it, but at the same time it was so addictive and I couldn’t stop smelling it.

And so in about 3 days time this went from being a hate to becoming a solid LOVE.

A musky, berry, benzoin BOMB.

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Ooh, this one is interesting! Delicious red berries, juicy and playful. I was worried at first, because berries usually turn foul on me, but this one doesn't.

I do think it's geared more towards younger audiences and I will probably only be able to enjoy this in the privacy of my home. I'm happy to use this sample up, but I don't think I'll ever purchase a full size, as cheerful berries aren't what I go for usually and I wouldn't feel in my skin wearing it out.

I find myself constantly sniffing my wrist with this on, though. A fun little guilty pleasure for sure! :)

edit: after wearing this for a couple of days, I can say I quite like it! It's unlike anything else in my collection currently, and I would say it's very modern and unexpected in current trends. Yes berries have been around forever, but something here stops it from going to that juvenile fruity zone and although playful, stays professional and even almost classy. It's the kind of fruity-floral that rich people would wear, it doesn't smell ordinary or mainstream to me. I might consider purchasing a full bottle when I run out of the decant I have, which is a first for me in fruity scents!",10/08/20 11:55,AlexandraTroush

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun: Burberry Her Intense is the perfect Gal Pal

This is a rather linear scent, and l think it is well blended. The fruity aspect is most prominent. This perfume reads as fun, youthful, but not frivolous. It has a level of sophistication to it, but it's not terribly complex either. She's uncomplicated, informal and easy to be around. Always a good time! Do you have someone like that in your life? I sense the the colours white and red when l smell it. A vision of Strawberries and cream.

Imagine a layered trifle pudding sans cake and macarons. Base layer is a small amount of creme brulee (with nutmeg and no yolk) with lots of fresly whipped cream, topped with powdered sugar and/or marshmallow. Next comes a thin layer of berry juice Gelee with many fresh Indian Jasmine petals (jam like concoction). To top off everything, fresh JUICY berries. I think strawberries is most obvious. What to do with this? Take your finger, poke it straight through and smear it on your skin. You might think this is very heavy, or thick sounding, but it's totally not.

There is an underlying Powdery, musky smell l find similar to Body Shop Libertine White Musk. There's a strange mentholated vibe to it as well, when merged with the berries it smells like black currant. I totally get the cough syrup analogy, but the scent is decidedly more powdery and resinous than syrupy.

All in all l enjoy it. I think this works as an everyday casual scent going into to semi-formal occasions (outdoor picnic, luncheon, dinner). Any season this technically works because this is neither too heavy or too light.
Though during the fall and winter l prefer something richer, decidedly more heavy, something in the Oriental family. I admit the fresh fruity aspect might be out of place in those months. I admit if you can get fresh fruit year round, why not just go with it?

I like that it still smells somewhat substantial, I'm definitely wearing a scent here. Approachable, friendly, kind of cute and girly. Has a sweetness to it that's not overbearing. The tartness of the fruits cuts through it.

I am reminded of the House of Givenchy, because a fruity berry accord is their signature in perfumes. However the effect they go for is more dark and smoky. This perfume is more fresh and subtle. Berry theme makes a lot of sense for the brand, BUR-BERRY. The perfume bottle is really quite pretty, like a drinking flask. There is a nice gradation of colour in the glass, from Rose to maroon. A pale beige pink cap and gold accents. This color scheme is quite chic. This perfume is a bit special because l received this as a gift when Corona virus was raging. I find it amusing that the packaging reminds of that time, because the health authority would cordon off communal areas and plaster caution tape over public amenities like chairs, swing sets and the like.

I glam this scent up by first dabbing what remains of this beautiful scented candle Yoshiwara Gardenia which has Gardenia and Tuberose in it. Who can resist a proper floral bouquet ?",08/29/20 06:37,arxsyn

Burberry Her Intense Burberry,"The fruity amber wood!
.
“Burberry Her, as a Gourmand fragrance, steps out of the traditional gourmand family as it is not sticky nor thick. On contrary, it’s airy and light in a unique way. Red and dark berries are at the heart of Burberry Her fragrance family. However, Burberry Her Intense is intensified with notes of blackberries and cedarwood for a subtly intense scent. The Intense version of Burberry Her fills the airy side of the scent without adding any thickness or heaviness” Francis Kurkdjian said.
.
Sweet & savory start by blackberries then burberry’s special floral sign as Jasmine in heart. Finally a woody, amber base. This part has some similarity to MFK BR 540. The image of burnt caramel inside a pan and the sensation of an overaly sweet dessert sliding down the throat, sharp but paradoxically salty. While he fails to charm us here, he is nonetheless innovative.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Burberry Weekend is the perfume that my childhood best friend’s mother wore for years. For me, that fragrance evokes the image of a mature, composed woman — someone serious, who gets things done, dresses “sexy” (as I used to call it back then), and always makes sure she’s well put-together.

I came across it again this year at an airport shop, and the moment I smelled it, I was instantly transported back to my teenage years — when, at 14 or 15, I’d secretly spray it in my friend’s bathroom. Later, her mother would chuckle when she met me in the hallway and ask, “Did you spray my perfume again?”

I bought it this time because I felt ready to embrace that sense of being a “mature, grounded” woman myself, as I near thirty. But on me, it simply feels flat — a little dull, lacking personality. I realize now that I probably bought it more to reconnect with a memory, to be transported back to my childhood, rather than to feel like a fully formed adult.",11/10/25 23:32,daemia

There’s a calm, effortless elegance in this scent — casual but refined. It’s especially lovely in mild to slightly cool weather, when the florals really come alive and seem to radiate warmth from within.

Initial spray still gets me a little bit, but after about 30 sec it calms down. Somehow plays well as both a vintage and modern vibe. I like it. It's a good everyday sent for women who dress bold or loudly. Hence the name weekend i'm guessing because that's the only time a office girl can get a little bold for with her outfits. last week i wore this with a lady gaga tshirt on that I customized and lots of silver and i felt like i was channeling her.

It’s sweet without being cloying, floral without being fussy. The peach blossom and blue hyacinth add a breezy charm, while the drydown of sandalwood and musk keeps it grounded.

If you grew up with this, I get it—this scent is memory in a bottle. If you’re new to it, it’s a gentle introduction to florals that wear effortlessly. One spray is enough for a clean, comforting presence that lingers all day.",03/25/25 06:25,c3c3y0

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I picked this up many years ago at a TJ Maxx or Marshalls as a blind buy, not knowing what to expect. The bottle I have is the 1.0 oz pictured, and I haven’t smelled the newest formulation currently on the market.

Although it is so different from most of my other perfumes, I absolutely love it. One spray is enough—too much and I can see this getting nauseating. On me, this smells mostly of fuzzy peaches and osmanthus, with some soft powdery iris/violet, greenness from hyacinth, and a touch of sandalwood. The impression it leaves is soft and relaxed, and I’m instantly transported to the English countryside to enjoy a quiet weekend.

As a huge fan of peach and osmanthus, it’s no surprise that I love this scent so much. When I want to lean into the fruity notes, I layer this with an osmanthus soliflore. When I want to play up the green, herbal quality, I might layer it with Miss Dior Originale to give it a chypre quality. Either way, this scent is well blended and plays well worth others.

I am such a big fan of this scent that I want to pick up another bottle of the same formulation. Unfortunately I haven’t tried the current one and am a little nervous it won’t be as good.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"The first spray reminds me of my mom since she is usually found wearing exactly this type of perfume. It’s not bad, but it’s not good either.

An old perfume blotter you find in your handbag of a perfume you didn’t really like. Definitely getting bathroom air freshener vibes as well - fake cloying floral notes, like you want to hide something. Maybe it just doesn’t work with my body chemistry. If my mom didn’t have so many similar fragrances, I would pass this onto her.
The drydown is definitely more powdery, but I can’t get rid of the deodorant/air freshener note. I do not get any nectarine juiciness, nor any green notes.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"In order to make sense, I would start by stating that I have the newer formula and bottle of Weekend. Not the bottle shown here on Fragrantica. Simple, similar to Le Labo style of bottles, produced in 2020, in Germany.
I have never had or tested the original Weekend version but like expected, that was the superior one apparently! Most likely, the 2020 reformulation has butchered the essence of Weekend, like it happens with most of perfume reformulations.

My Weekend is a powdery floral-fruity bomb type of scent. I say if you’re into peaches, nectarines, sweet mandarin oranges, Weekend is your scent. Very affordable as well. Slightly synthetic smelling, sugary sweet, like candy fruits would. Pleasant, sweet, fruity, feminine perfume.

Besides a ton of sweet, juicy fruits, I detect a nice, spring flower bouquet: peach blossoms, violet, hyacinth and iris. Rose hip and mignonette are two new notes to me, so I can’t comment on how prominent they are featured here. I would say that both have a honeyed, floral sweet smell after reading the description here, so I think they are well incorporated in the juice. Weekend it’s truly a a floral sweet scent! From the base notes, I think the sandalwood and cedar are much needed for some neutral, grounding notes because of the intensity of the fruits and florals.

It’s a nice, everyday, casual scent, better suited for younger people in my opinion. Season wise, definitely spring and summer appropriate.

If you can get it heavily reduced like I got my bottle, it’s not a bad scent. It has two noteworthy ingredients that I have not encountered ever in niche scents. But it’s nothing very unique in terms of how it smells. I know perfumes have to smell like perfumes, but this smells very ""perfumey"".",04/03/24 22:41,Maya lilac

Sadly on my skin this scent does smell very old fashioned, reminding me of perfumes worn by various aunts and teachers--all born in the 1940s. When I was teenager in the 80s perfumes started to change and target a younger audience, and these older ladies summarily disapproved. My friends and I got used to hearing that our perfume smelled tawdry, loud, loose, and cheap; the stuffy powder florals from the WW2 era were the only respectable thing.

It is a slightly unusual floral - fresh yet sweet, bright yet powdery - but is an easy reach for everyday.

BW opens with sweet, polleny floral notes. I'm not familiar with mignonette, but its description as a sweet floral note fits. There is a lovely fruity edge to this scent with sweet, juicy orange adding some freshness up top. It is clean and slightly soapy here.

As it develops, some soft herbal notes add aromatic greenness, complementing the florals nicely. The orange of the opening gives way to sweet, juicy peach. The hyacinth is heady here, with the peach adding a honeyed quality. It becomes incredibly powdery as it develops further, due in no small part to the iris-violet accord. I get something akin to mimosa, but this is perhaps simply due to the powdery texture and polleny sweetness.

It becomes softly woody and cleanly musky as it dries down, with the sweet floral lingering, powdery until final fade. Sillage and longevity are moderate. It is a feminine spring/summer daytime scent in my opinion.

A slightly unusual but very wearable floral scent made from good-quality ingredients, BW is a bargain gem. Fresh, sweet, powdery goodness. I wonder how the current version compares. 4/5.",03/16/24 07:44,Enrium

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I love Burberry because of Burberry London and Burberry Goddess, but Burberry Weekend was a bad experience for me. Oh my, I can't like this fragrance no matter how many times I try. It is an old, classic, and somewhat dated pollen scent on my skin. When I smelled it, I felt nauseous and uncomfortable, as if I were sick. Weekend reminds me of classic scenes in the English countryside, vintage floral curtains, and heel-length floral dresses. It's beautiful, but old as if covered in dust, no one has touched it for a long time. I've always liked country Vibes like Jane Austen's novels, but it's full of sunshine, flowers and life, not this old and rustic thing. Please forgive me because I only feel this way when I smell Burberry Weekend. If you like classic country style, sunny flower fields, like the girls in Jane Austen's romantic novels, try Versace Eros Pour Femme. In my opinion, it's much better than Burberry Weekend.",02/12/24 00:20,thaochipnd

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I normally don't go for florals, but this is beautiful!! It's fresh and clean and faintly sweet. It feels like the perfect spring fragrance. It is very well-blended, put-together, and easy to reach for. I can understand why it seems ""old-fashioned"" upon first spray -- there is some sort of note I don't agree with that lasts for the first few moments which reminds me of an older woman who smokes too much -- but I have to stress again that it does not last long. Once it dries down, it's a very classic, inoffensive, and easy scent to wear. It is pleasant like a beautiful bouquet of flowers.
It's not a gourmand and it's not exactly ""unique"" or ""it-girl"" material, but it is classy and reliable.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"This is a perfume you can't go wrong with. It is another safe choice alongside Lancome's La Vie Est Belle. It smells amazing and is definitely floral and sweet. It is perfect for daily activities, but I wouldn't use it as a scent for a special occasion or a date night. It is lightweight and doesn't feel overwhelming at all. Definitely recommend you give it a trial period for at least a week if you haven't worn it before.",01/21/24 00:49,szeon
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I have a small 2 ml decant from what I think was a tall, reformulated bottle. I get crisp apple, peach and honeyed flowers. I would say it is yellow flowers, just because it kinda resemble Poeme by Lancome a little, but I see no mimosa in the notes. So I guess it is hyacinths or cyclamen, or other not-yellow flower which I am not very familiar with in the wilderness. It smells so typical of 90s luxury fragrances, at least what this epoque has to offer now in era of reformulation. It is fruity in powdery way, not mouth-watering or fresh way.
I can see how it can be purchased for nostalgia reasons or as a gift for a mature friend. It is very very typical of 90s, as I said.",12/28/23 00:07,morphoevgenia

Creamy peach, tropical fruit pastel smell & blossom is what I get.
I will always have this in my collection. I wore it on holiday last year, my husband kept saying I smelt good and how it reminded him of when we first met. Ahhh the power of perfume, an example of how they evoke memories💖",12/19/23 03:13,NillaSugar

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Burberry's Weekend for Women embodies a floral office fragrance that exudes relaxation and powdery elegance. Crafted to capture the essence of a tranquil weekend, this scent mirrors a laid-back country style. Its well-balanced composition resonates as a smooth and harmonious olfactory experience, making it a fitting choice for daily wear on crisp spring and warm autumn days.

At its opening, you're greeted by a delightful blend of sweet mandarine, zesty Mignonette, and the aromatic grassy note of sage. The heart notes flourish with Nectarine, Blue Hyacinth, Peach Blossom, Rose Hip, Iris, Red Cyclamen, and Violet Root. As the scent evolves, it gracefully transitions into a soothing base of Musk, Sandalwood, and Cedar.

This intricate fragrance unfolds like a beautiful bouquet of lightly spiced florals. Despite being associated with a renowned brand, Weekend for Women remains reasonably priced and boasts above-average performance in terms of projection and longevity. Occasionally, after a period of non-use, a slight note reminiscent of nail polish remover might emerge, but this issue is easily resolved by a few spritzes into the air, restoring the fragrance to its pleasant and normal character.",10/25/23 05:46,AquaRegia

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I just think this one is so lovely. There seems to be a great deal of discourse about the old vs new formula and I can’t tell you which one I have… just that it was purchased recently at a discount store, but whichever it is, I love it. It is clean-smelling, bordering on soapy, like freshly washed hair, still wet and smelling of the heavily-scented shampoos of the 90s (I miss them!)
The orange and nectarine give it a lively brightness, and the florals are light and friendly rather than hot and overbearing. The musk rounds it out nicely, keeps it from being so light and airy that it simply floats away.
I think the name suits it perfectly because weekends are meant to be easy. I wear it on weekdays because of its friendly weekend personality. It’s pretty! It’s very girl next door. I don’t find it boring at all, personally (not to be all “back in my day….” but) I miss when perfume was meant to be appealing and not expected to be challenging.",08/08/23 19:00,ljsmith
Weekend for Women Burberry,"It didn't work well with my body/skin chemistry. Smelled like very strong indolic floral perfume. It did not smell fresh, I also smelled no fruit, not a clean scent on me just way too indolic.

Just turned out very horrible on me.",08/06/23 19:04,athomas

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I've got the older round bottle, pre reformulation. My friend gave me hers as she said she doesn't wear this any longer. I hadn't tried this before so I was intrigued, but my history with Burberry is not generally positive, I didn't love body, my Burberry, touch or her.

This one starts with a slightly dirty musky citrus and indolic floral blast, it's quite strong. It's at this point that it smells like a slice of 1997 or even earlier. It's certainly something you don't smell now. As this dries, it becomes peachy (assuming it's the nectarine) and the dirty musk and indolic florals calm down. Later this fragrance is sparkly nectarine scent with a background of very sweet florals and powdery musk.

I don't like the opening at all, if you hate what some people term ""vintage floral musk"" fragrances then stay well away from this one. The drydown is actually quite pleasant and this fragrance is truly nuclear and long lasting so overspray at your peril.",07/15/23 06:43,qofb
Weekend for Women Burberry,"Not a weekend spent in the mall with gourmands and fruity florals all around you. Not a weekend by the beach with aquatics, citruses and monoi drafting by.
No, no. It’s a laid back weekend in the countryside, long walks in flower fields with your hands brushing against loads of flora. You relax under a fruit orchard sitting on a hay stack reading a book.
The air is very powdery, very floral, somewhat sweet, a bit peachy (in a fresh rather than syrupy way thank God), with a hint of bitterness in the background.
A beautiful old school composition without being stuffy or old fashioned. BW is timeless for the irremediable romantic. A beautiful powdery floral with good performance.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"this is so delightful. the reviews forced my hand, and i also blind bought an 'older' bottle, just in case.

This is fresh, sweet but clean, just a few years too mature for me, but not garishly so.
This reminds me of my childhood visits to my Aunt Sharon and her farm in rural Pennsylvania.
The farm itself was surrounded by lush, dewy green fields, with woods and a reservoir just a short walk away. While one part of her farm was horses, cows goats, etc... she also had a vegetable garden and fruit trees. Apple trees, cherry trees, blueberries, black raspberries, wild flowers, daisies etc...

All that fresh country air combined with my actual Aunt Sharon; a really fun and warm lady. Always had a guest bedroom ready, always had a pitcher of wooly mint iced tea in the fridge. The bathroom had blossom-scented soaps that contribute to this nostalgia. My aunt's guest bedroom also had a vanity filled with her makeup, including powdery scented lipsticks and pressed powder foundations.

She was a farm lady, but she never smelled like one. She always smelled like a cool mom and a warm hug on a fresh spring day.
That's what this perfume is like.",04/26/23 05:53,VictoriaSmells

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I don’t own the one in the new bottle, but I tried it out recently. I had the older domed bottle with the flat bottom. Something I’ve noticed reading these reviews. People who say they bought the one in the new bottle are saying this, “ I don’t know about this, because that bottle is just so ugly I can’t wear this now.” As if the bottle has something to do with the actual scent. Things get reformulated all the time that doesn’t change the scent by much, I can attest to that myself. However, just because people see it’s now in another bottle, psychosomatically for some people, it’s thought that the scent has been reformulated and therefore it is now said, very melodramatically I may add, that it’s a “shadow of its former self and no longer has the glory that it once had. The shame, the shame!” [eyeroll]

I don’t see any difference. So for others, if there is a difference, consider these possible causes that affect your PH that can alter a scent on your skin.
1. Hormonal changes (particularly after a pregnancy or menopause)
2. Change in diet
3 Medication that is being taken or has been taken in the past (this can include birth control/hormone therapy)
4. Stress levels

For me, this always reminded me of Champs Élysée by Guerlain whether in the old bottle or new. Why some may not have thought this to be as spectacular as Burberry’s other scents may be because it was meant to be low-key, laid-back, and relaxing. It’s the weekend. Time for a little rest and relaxation from the week’s hectic work and activity. Not every scent has to be a 💥wham bam boom💥, knock ‘em dead, take no prisoners, kind of scent. This will talk you down off of a ledge and have you and others around you so that you’re not so uptight. If people are loving it on you, that may be the exact reason why. They feel comfortable and at ease, which to some, is quite beautiful and very alluring. Certain aromas can do that to people.

As for the bottle, yes, it is minimalistic, but the idea or aesthetic is to be relaxing and uncomplicated. As long as the juice is the same, which it appears it is on me, then the bottle is just fine. It’s not like it’s a plastic spray bottle that you find in a dollar store. So, just relax and enjoy the weekend!",03/04/23 12:19,ChelleBelle84
Weekend for Women Burberry,"My review is based on the old formula ( I think they reformulated in 2022? with a new bottle ). So I'm talking about the round flatter bottle, with the slightly yellow juice; the old formula.

I can't believe they have reformulated this scent. This fragrance was absolute perfection and I am hunting down the last ""vintage"" bottled I can find. This is a classic Burberry fragrance, it really embodies the Weekend and spare time.

The old formula is strong, lingers all day, awesome projection.

Bit sharp at first spray but that sharpness fades down to the background and all you're left with is amazing fresh, on the top of your game kind of scent. Perfect for private and work. Inoffensive, but yet special and noticed. Elegant and a bit posh even. It's strong, but not D&G vintage red cap pour Femme strong, it's the level just below that in terms of strength. But it will last all day long.

Burberry Weekend vintage smells like someone with money and someone who knows her value. It also smells like a high end professional and like someone who goes to the races and high tea in the weekends but not stuffy: modern and a young and feisty spirit. Can be worn by all ages though, it has a timeless elegance to it.

I haven't smelled the new version. but I read that it has gone weak toilet spray so I won't even try the new one. I'm sad to lose yet again one of my fave fragrances.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"The present-day version of Burberry Weekend for Women smells nothing like the 1990s original. It's not terrible, it's just... different. The scent has been stripped of all the facets that once made it so memorable, and we're now left with its bare skeleton. The house of Burberry should have simply discontinued Weekend and launched the new juice under a new moniker (here are some ideas for the new name: Oversimplified; Lazy; Chill; No Brainer; Easy Come Easy Go; Nothing Much; etc.)",02/04/23 12:22,LadyIva

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Look here, you - ""Burberry Weekend"" is delightful.

I procrastinated buying this...because...honestly...I loathe those new bottles. There. I said it.
The new bottles suck. They lack imagination, and I may just have judged this perfume by that particularly uninspiring cover. Thankfully, I found an old perfume bottle and eyed it for months. Eventually, I clawed this to me.

Hear this, hear this!
I wore this to work today and got *major* compliments. I'm talking, ""Walk over here, so I can smell you more!"" and ""Oh wow, that's beautiful"". Yes, my colleagues are both demanding and sweet.

This is wonderful. Straight-up floral. In fact, WILDLY floral. And I'm not even remotely mad at it. I was expecting juicier nectarine, but I think it just supports the sweetness of the florals. It's also Very Strong: 2-3 sprays will do you, but who really practices restraint in this day and age? Certainly not me. I spray what I want in volumes I want. Sillage is *enchanting* - I LOVE smelling this on myself and it actually is a perfume you continue to smell on yourself for ages. Longevity is about 4 hours on skin; an eternity on unwashed clothes.

This is such a romantic scent to me. I put it in the same sort of category of 'pretty, romantic, spring floral' as I do with ""Olene"" and ""Peony & Blush Suede"". If those kinds of scents are your jam - spread this condiment on your olfactory toast.
Some people might find it smells a bit dated. I think strong, heady florals like hyacinth and rose hip lean that way, but it's all in the composition, people! I honestly think any age could wear this. A little girl would delight in how pretty and adult she smells. This makes me think of a *nice* teenager. A young adult who is full of sunshine and rainbows wears this, and a geriatric will undoubtably rock it whilst wearing this.

A cool, fresh, sweet, pretty, romantic, wildly feminine juggernaut of a scent.
I'm falling more in love.

Repurchase-worthy!

Weekend for Women Burberry,"There's a soft, airy sweetness to Burberry Weekend, a kind of olfactory fluffiness that's not really to my taste. There's nothing wrong with the scent, it's quite pleasant, nothing I think is innately offensive in its own right, but it's just not me. I guess I like my perfumes more aromatic, or perhaps with sharper edges. As a perfume it feels very round.

It's very yellow- though the actual sensory perception I get is of the colour peach, not the fruit, but the colour. I can't smell any sage, or anything herbal, which is a pity. Also It's too sweet and syrupy, far too 90s in a bad flashbacks to my childhood kind of way, and I would say not floral enough- or at least not floral in a realistic way, like how actual flowers smell, more that abstract florality of perfume, which combines with a nectarine/peachiness that lacks the sharper scent of real fruit- I would call it a fruity floral and not a floral though, personally, which may be why I'm finding it so troubling. Fruity florals are really not my thing.

So, really, I think it's a try before you buy, but if you like sweet, yellow-peach, fluffy, syrupy, round, squishy, soft, airy, shampoo-ish, 90's fruity florals it may just be the perfume for you.

ETA: I can't stop wearing it. It's still not me, but apparently it *is* what I want to be smelling. All in all worth a try, especially if you want an unabashedly *cheerful* perfume.",01/01/23 19:38,r0r0

Weekend for Women Burberry,"i really love this one dearly. almost-blind bind and very successful. I've been wearing it nonstop for 5-6 weeks now and this doesn't happen very often to me. very autumnal, especially dry sunny autumn, September/ early October daytime of perfume. very cosy, very easy to wear. just like favourite underwear, like second skin. i would say it is Burberry Everyday, not Burberry Weekend. this isn't love from the first sniff, i remember testing it about 10 years ago and disliking, it gave me english flower garden/2000 airport/older woman vibes, which wasn't something i was looking for back then. i quess it was more popular back then which would explain my airport/duty free association but felt not for me. now i don't mind that garden feel, when it comes to airport vibe, i still kind of feel it, but i don't mind now, it just reminds me times back then when i had finances to travel which is not the case nowadays. when it comes to older woman vibe, well, i am that older woman now, and i dont mind it a bit to be older woman, i kind of enjoy it a lot. it just feels cozy and safe and a bit motherly. as for the notes, there are so many listed, i smell a blending but not individual notes, just a bit soapy and those flower garden notes. it kind of feels very suitable for dry sunny September days, but rainy days seem to fit that perfume very well as well. at the place i live at we have more rainy days than dry days, so this was really very successful purchase. the perfume is soft and subtle, not much silage, which i like a lot, i enjoy my perfumes subtle. this is newly bought, and the bottle is of the new type, not like the one in the picture here.

Edit: i ended up loving it. it is still a bitter powdery peach, but that bitterness calmed down a bit after some time. very good everyday scent for late autumn and possibly winter. i kind of surprised so many like it since it seems to me like a perfume that is hard to like.",10/12/22 08:02,Mirabele

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I first discovered this fragrance while in school back in the early 2000's from a friend. It was a beautiful floral fragrance that you could smell on yourself throughout the day. I don't know how to describe it but it was like fresh green sparkling iris but also nectarine/peach with a very inoffensive musky background. Back then, it garnered lots of compliments and left a nice light fragrance trail that not only others could smell but myself as well which is what I really like in a perfume. I couldn't wait to get my own bottle by saving up and when I did, I felt just as special as the first time I borrowed a few sprays from my friend. I loved wearing it and kept wearing it until other sparkling fragrances had captured my attention that contain notes I love such as lotus, magnolia, peony, green notes, or aquatic types captured my attention that I started to save for such as Curious by Britney Spears. I bought this in the recent past hoping for that same beautiful smell and somehow giving in to my fantasy that it would be the same as it was before only to have my hopes dashed. I should have known by seeing the color of the perfume because like J'adore going from a gold colored liquid to almost water colored this has as well. It is nothing like it used to be, and I can see how others don't like it now because I don't either but I promise it used to be full of beautiful notes with lasting power and gave all those little wisps of the fragrance as the day went by when you wore it. It would be a dream come true to have my favorites be as they were before. I am not a fragrance expert, just a lover of beautiful smells that turn my head and wear them for me so I want to smell them more than 30 minutes. I am coming to accept that those fragrances are gone forever and all we have now are shadows of what they used to be for various reasons. I am starting to lose hope in fragrances being anything like they were before unless they are powerhouses and beast mode perfumes that are just not my thing. The ""deepest"" or ""spiciest"" perfume I liked was Portrait of a Lady so not that deep for most people and even it is a shadow of what it used to be and was released recently and not decades ago. I have experimented with some Arabic perfumes due to lasting power but they are just not the same as the beloved ones from my past. I guess it just something that will be no matter how much customers complain because I know that they wouldn't ""fix"" something that isn't broke for the worst. Whether it is due to profit greed or regulations, I guess they are gone forever and all we have left are the memories.

Weekend doesn't smell all that much like a realistic hyacinth to me. It actually reminds me more of honeysuckle. The opening is very fresh and dewy, borderline soapy, with some unsweetened fruit notes to warm things up. The nectarine is really nice, it's subtle and underripe, but clearly there. To me, nectarine is the fresher, lighter, sometimes more appreciated version of peach. I also get something akin to a green banana peel, which can happen with white florals. It might not be everyone's taste, but I like it.
Later, when the scent has dried down, Weekend smells warmer on my skin, like honeyed flowers, but powdery in texture.

When I smell this I think of the 90s, but not necessarily of my own 90s childhood, but a very specific image. I imagine a young woman with bouncy hair and a floral spaghetti strap dress using some honeysuckle scented products and then spraying this one before heading out for a picnic with a wooden basket. Weekend indeed. But I also see no reason not to wear this for the workweek.

I like this for the experience, it's a lovely throwback, but it's not something I would wear myself.",08/18/22 04:49,SailorV
Weekend for Women Burberry,"the scent:
this is my most repeated purchases among all the perfumes i own. its citrusy, refreshing and bright scent suitable to causal daytime use and most important this scent reminds me of holiday and weekends! exactly the same as its been named ""weekend"".

the bottle:
ever since their reformulation and change in packaging, i stop buying it. i prefer to the older version of short frosted glass with thick heavy cap. the current design looks uninteresting and its easily been mistaken as weekend for men.",08/15/22 01:55,PaperInABook
Weekend for Women Burberry,"My mum wore this in the late 90s/early 00s, and she let me 'borrow' it everyday. I felt so sophisticated and mature wearing this as a pre-teen. Thank you, mum!

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I bought this a few years ago as i was trying to get into the Burberry perfume vibe...on me this just smells like green apples, i was actually surprised no one says apples but nectarines.

Weekend for Women Burberry,My favourite in the late 90’s. People asked me what I was wearing and wanted to buy it. Taxi drivers asked me too. Now I still love it but can’t see myself reaching for it so often. BUT! Today I discoverd a new way of wearing this to make it more modern / up to date. (And everybody seam to enjoy most TF Fragrances) so please try this: When you layer it with TF: Eau de Soleil Blanc edt it becomes so beautiful!,07/28/22 02:48,ImmiMathiassen

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I love 90's fragrances and I love most Burberry scents but there is something extremely offputting in this. A reviewer below mentioned indoles, and maybe that could be it. It's not a clean or fresh floral, there's an dirty edge to it. It smells like a ladies public bathroom, or scented panty liners. It could just be that this scent profile is old enough to have been copied by hygeine companies in their products but either way I wouldn't wear it.",07/22/22 22:25,rainme
Weekend for Women Burberry,"An underrated gem--nectarines and cream in a wooded spring garden, equal parts fruity, floral and woody, it shines in warmer weather. There is a green aquatic element, like an overgrown pond, in a nice way. I never knew anyone who wore this so I am coming at it with a fresh nose. If it is a mom perfume, so be it, I am a mom after all, but to me it just smells timeless and is an easy blind reach when temps rise above about 15 C.

ETA- also great for sunny autumn days!",07/17/22 19:00,mauvealert

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Had to sell this because it triggered my allergies, sadly. Top notes were sweet and fresh, a little bit ozonic (thought that's not listed) - I couldn't pick out any particular fruit or flower.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"-Opens nice and bright. Juicy, fruity scent with a watermelon-like note to it.
-This scent carries a toned-down brightness throughout.
-Although most female-marketed scents are loud, bubbly and almost shrill in their vibes (Think: Marc Jacobs' Perfect, Viva La Juicy) this manages to steer clear of said territory.
-Overall, Weekend is a fruity femme scent that appears to have withstood the test of time.

-Those prone to headaches might wanna avoid this though. It does turn a tad perfumey in the dry-down. I'd suggest going light on the trigger, and perhaps, to avoid wearing this on planes in consideration of fellow travellers. (-)",06/01/22 01:09,ingeneuxo
Weekend for Women Burberry,"This started my love for powdery and floral accords. I used to be a gourmand girl but now I'm always on the lookout for something powdery or floral/green.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"A casual mature floral scent. Its powdery base is great for a fresh feeling. Definitely a mature scent and has a lot of nostalgia. This is an older scent for me and if I smelled it now, I would not purchase.",04/20/22 09:17,laurenrebeccaroth
Weekend for Women Burberry,"Trying for the first time in 2022 with a dabber bottle that came to me in a traveling sampler box. Floral with a heavy floral sweetness. Cloying. Overwhelming. Base is a powdery musk. I get no woods. Excellent projection and staying power.

I get a weekend rental house or hotel room that's been doused in air freshener smell from it. It does take me back to beach runs in the late 90s when a group of us would stay at the cheapest place we could find, carefully treading the border between dump and somewhere that will mind that we're drinking heavily and getting sand everywhere. I'm glad for the experience and the nostalgia but this isn't a perfume I want to wear.",04/12/22 07:24,coffeefifofum

So, decided to reorder her again, though I'm not keen on the new bottle. Such a cheap price these days but, a lux smell. Allbeauty online shop 100ml £28. A steal.",04/11/22 06:36,Miss Dolittle
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I bought this perfume recently
I've smelt it before, and I didn't like it then (my teens), because of the white flowers(in my head)which I do enjoy now.
Now, I know there are no white flowers, but the hyacinth intrigued me, and in general, I like the scent but the nectarine note is so dominant, at least on my skin, this comes out extremely fruity like a nectarine EDT from body shop.

Edit: I don't know about this one 😕
The new bottle is so damn ugly
I've been trying to make it work but it's slowly becoming my least favorite 😖

Edit: June 2022
Horrible scent. I think I detest this fragance, it's not bad my any means but is just 🍑 🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑",04/05/22 03:03,Kuty22
Weekend for Women Burberry,"All I have to say is I came here out of nostalgia for my 20s and these comments do not disappoint!!!

This perfume was a blind buy from my mom when i was in my early 20s and I used to spray like 1-2 sprays to go to class, and someone had once commented it was strong enough to ""kill an old man"".

Weekend for Women Burberry,"***Review for the formula in the newer, more slender bottle ***
First off, people saying they can’t smell the new formulation because it’s weak… you may have sniffed so much perfume that you have damaged nasal cells? This version is a Bomb. In a great way…;)

I love the fruity flowery fresh thing Weekend for Her has going on. I started with a sample of this long ago and it shocked my nostrils right away. I thought it was too strong. But I kept going back for more as my comfort fragrance! I couldn’t get over it. Note:this is a mood/season fragrance for me! Not a signature because I don’t feel this mood very often!
But when I’m needing it, it is so happy and fresh. But very flower-full!! Combined with the assertive nectarine which adds a full, fleshy, sweetness.
Sometimes it makes me think of melon, sometimes it feels very floral, but I am a big fan and I like its bold character.
Almost a grassy meadow quality that makes me breathe a little deeper. Excellent longevity and I don’t go nose blind to it so I can enjoy it all day. In the winter I crave this the most because it reminds me of spring.
This could really challenge anyone who can’t handle florals like hyacinth… maybe don’t blind buy?",03/25/22 19:12,Sparkleball22
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I recall getting this perfume from Marshalls in the 90's, it smelled stronger & was in thicker glass.
I got a larger bottle, it still smells great but the projection & silage isn't as good.
I would buy again as this is perfect for summer errands.
It's not over powering & is nostalgia. Seems reformulated but that's the world in which we live, I still get most of the notes from the 90's bottle.",03/19/22 00:01,_NicoleNonya

Weekend for Women Burberry,"A review said ""Smells like linden tea with honey."" -- Hmmmmmm, perfect -- ok!

----------

The name ""weekend"" -
I originally had an aversion to this name - because I have been working round the clock on my writing projects for years and have not been able to take a weekend off in years. Even the thought that people take weekends off, was offensive to me, until recently - when I realized that I really DO need some time off - to stop and smell the roses on occasion. Even if this is just for a few hours to clear my head, taking a nice walk during the day really makes life so much more well balanced.

Enough about that --

Weekend perfume is one of those unexpected ""finds"" that I first sampled as a dupe of Burberry's ""Weekend"". Like I said before, I never would have been drawn to this simply by the name of it, but when I actually smelled this - I really loved the vibe of this. This is fresh, clean -- like a breath of fresh air... so yeah - I can definitely see why they would have named this perfume ""Weekend"".

Burberry's fragrances are more casual - and can be worn every day...this is part of their attraction.

I've seen a few if the reviews here - and people rattle on and on about the fact that these are not all that special, but yet - then why are they even sampling a perfume like this? Focus on Tom Ford, Bond, etc... if that's what you are really into --- but don't slam perfumes that serve purposes that a number of people are looking for.

Finding a great every day perfume that smells relaxed and enjoyable for the weekend may seem ridiculous to some people, but there are plenty of people who are looking for something along these lines just to fit their choices for a casual afternoon to walk the dog(s) - get out of the house - and smell the roses!

This is worth revisiting - I tried the dupe as a sample, but never purchased the bottle.
I love the yellow floral type composition. This is pleasant - great for the weekend. Floral and sunny.

No, this is not something that I would wear to a formal occasion.
But yes, this is a very pleasant perfume that would serve many purposes - even on ""The Weekend""!",02/20/22 23:42,correspondencepersonal
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I’ve been having a ton of 90s nostalgia. I do this thing where I obsess over older perfumes that have big cult followings or had significant mainstream success. Often I may not have ever knowingly even smelled them. I blind buy them (in this case it was only $25 at least) only to find massive disappointment. Weekend is definitely a fabric softener type scent. I was expecting peaches and hyacinth and something so cheerful and springy but it’s totally an unimpressive mainstream laundry detergent type. I’ve never liked a single Burberry so clearly something is wrong with me to have gotten my hopes up. I lean towards niche and better quality scents most of the time anyway. I remember so many gorgeous 90s fragrances (such as Byblos, Eternity, Sun Moon Stars & Pleasures) but Burberry Weekend falls short compared with those greats. It’s a simple clean yellowish fruity floral that is pleasant but doesn’t have huge longevity or trail. Definitely inoffensive, easy, fresh and casual. 4/10

I got the original squatty bottle not the new packaging. Also can’t understand the dated comments at all. This is a fruity floral just like all the current fruity florals. It doesn’t have that trademark 90s vibe at all.",02/14/22 19:14,perfumesniffer

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Not s safe blind buy. It is clean, classy, fresh but also very yellow and has a note (which one it’s hard to tell) that does not suit me at all. It lasts the whole day, almost 12h. It even survived overspraying with brit edp. Even though I sprayed it very generous, weekend with only one spray survived and still kept reminding me of how i don’t like it.
I have new, redesigned bottle, and this perfume really is a beast and great buy for those who like the smell. Pretty unique & longlasting for ridiculous price.",01/28/22 12:32,mirisfrik

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Weekend was a blind buy in a number of bottles I recently purchased and it has quickly become a new favorite (possibly signature?) fragrance. I never preferred the flagship fragrance (I think it was the peach - like syrup in my airways, I hate it in candles too) but don't judge a bottle by the company it keeps, right? I was not disappointed! It smells like a wet meadow you decide to take a shortcut through to get home after filling your basket with fresh fruit and flowers from the market on Saturday morning. There was a steady, soaking drizzle earlier, and although more rain is threatening, there's a window of gentle sunshine just now. I smell unripe nectarine, pond water, a breeze through the rain, flowers, sweet herbs, wet tree bark, and the light scent of ""me"" wafting off my damp dress and hair. Weekend hangs out close to my skin, pulsing at a soft and steady pace up to my nose for most of the day, on the condition that I'm freshly showered and my body oiled up before I spritz it on (otherwise it tends to wither away within a couple of hours). Today I put it on at 6am and it's still pedaling along merrily at 3pm. I'll still smell it on my shirt when I change into my bedclothes this evening. So IMHO, Weekend is just simply lovely - clean, refreshing, polite, good-humored, and easy to get along with. To me it has become a favorite aunt, a sweet friend, a secret spot in the forest where I love to play. All this to say that I will likely revisit it over and over again and never tire of it.",01/07/22 15:21,Rcates78
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I loved this from the first spray. I get the mandarines, peach and nectarine scent the most. It is very fruity, bright and super feminine. It reminds me of a bright, sunny, warm spring day sitting in a garden. I don’t find it to be old or outdated at all, personally - just an ultra feminine, girly, sweet perfume.",01/06/22 08:23,melissas94
Weekend for Women Burberry,"On first sniff I wasn't sure about this one. It reminded me of a Yardley fragrance, but I'm not sure which (so I get the 'dated' comments).
However, the dry down is a different story, a soft, sweet, musky floral I can't stop sniffing! It's very calming and comforting. Definitely not a 'sexy' fragrance, but soft and feminine.
This is a 'feel good' fragrance for sure 😊",12/31/21 05:51,Phoenixpink80
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I first smelled Burberry Weekend on a colleague I highly looked up to, because she was everything I aspired to be – amazingly well-dressed, always put together, and smelling great. She was the kind who would leave a trail of perfume wherever she went. She told me this was the perfume that wouldn’t budge, and was the only one that could take the rigours of an entire day of walking up and down the stairs, taking up to seven classes, and then coming back to complete preparations for the next day. Finding a tester bottle (100ml!) that very weekend in an atrium sale at the mall next to my sister’s condo, for a very reasonable price, felt like providence. From that day onwards, this became the bottle I reached out for every single morning. Right after I put on my red, red lipstick, and right before I slipped onto my kitten heels.

Burberry Weekend is probably one of the most unique perfumes I have in my collection. I don’t think I have seen these notes in any of my other perfumes, leave alone a combination of the above. This probably explains why it is so hard for me to describe this smell. The amazing thing about this is that it smells almost the same in the dry down as it does in the opening – a fresh, straight out of the shower smell, with just a tinge of the compact powder smell and maybe, just maybe, a hint of oil. So imagine you doing your make-up in your bathroom right after your shower, improbable as it sounds, and your hair is still wrapped in a towel and you can still smell the soap on your skin. A lot of reviewers have called it dated and old-fashioned, but to me it just smells classy. I bought a second bottle after I finished my first one, and have realised that I don’t reach out for it as much as I used to when I was working. Maybe because I have stopped teaching, and I don’t associate with the teacher in me anymore?

This is not a perfume that sits unannounced in a corner, nope. In a room full of pink flowers with dainty petals, this one is a flamboyant yellow, with voluptuous petals that immediately draw your attention. You’d want to go sit next to them. You’d want to bathe in their gorgeousness. Which is why I wouldn’t call this a safe blind buy. While not exactly a polarising smell, I still belief that you’d have to have a certain something to like this. But smell it once if you can, please, and then make up your mind. This is exactly what you would want for yourself if you don’t want to smell like everyone else in the room.",12/28/21 05:51,ssamhita
Weekend for Women Burberry,Not for me. Very unpleasant and too musky for my tastes. I got a headache after trying this a couple times.,12/27/21 07:11,Dancer_kr
Weekend for Women Burberry,"III'd really like to like this more. Hypothetically, the ingredients are all there for a ""wow"", but this seems to be a tad weak, pleasant, flowery and just ""there"". Yes, I like the mignonette, the nectarine & the touch of rose, but I find, in contradistinction to some, that I must apply it too heavily for my liking to register. This fragrance, in my opinion, could be perfect for a young blue-eyed, fair-skinned blonde in spring. It's perfect for someone who just wants to blend in, to remain inoffensive, yet mildly attractive. Now I'm layering it with something stronger: experimenting with a blend with Muse, (Guerlain), then I'll put some bergamot later, to see if it can strengthen this essentially good scent. In fact,I'm now imagining it with some incense to really punch it up to become something I could wear with more assurance and presence.",11/13/21 11:19,alanaronald

Weekend for Women Burberry,"This perfume was a blind buy and I still do not know how to feel. Its very mature for my age, not sexy or gourmand and quite musky and powdery.

I would describe it as a sweet woody scent with hints of nectarine with the bosy spray which I like better then the musky green citrus of the perfume alone",11/02/21 17:46,ilayda
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I love this perfume. The nectarine is most prominent at first, as a general peachy fruitiness. This is one of the few perfumes I’ve found so far where the nectarine/peach is so bright and fruity rather than immediately heavy and powdery. And it’s supported by an interesting group of notes that keeps it from being a nondescript fruity floral, the mignonette which I love, and beautiful subtle rose hip. The iris and violet poke through after a while but stay in the background and never overwhelm. It’s a well-rounded, complete scent, fairly linear in a good way, and suitable for casual and semi-formal occasions. It lasts from morning ‘til night and will project as much as you want it to (I split one spray between each wrist). To me it’s, simply, one of the best.",10/22/21 06:49,SalinasL

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Thank you for your great accurate reviews fragrantica friends!
I am developing a passion or the master perfumer Nathalie Lorson, I just love all her fragrances!!
It is the perfect floral daily spring perfume, with hyacinth and mignonette (cannot detect the peach). As someone said 'Spring in a bottle' is a perfect title for this perfume. Hyacinth is not common and easy to find. This perfume doesn't resemble anything that I know, so I consider it quite unique.
It is very complex and layered, strong longevity, definitely sophisticated and underrated lately. Great for flowers lovers and office scent.

It’s green of course, realistic floral. Perfume doesn’t really have an age to me, it’s all about taste.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Airy ,sweet and everyday perfume, ideal for spring season",11/12/20 04:51,marios2014
Weekend for Women Burberry,"The description of Weekend being a ""relaxing country style"" scent is, at least in my opinion, spot on.
Weekend smells like a warm, sunny morning walk through a wild flower meadow in which all the flowers and grass are still covered in the morning dew and are drying in the sun. It smells very familiar to me, I cant quite place where I've smelt it before, but to me it smells how that one favourite female relative smells, shes clean, kind, caring and warm, its quite comforting and calm smelling.

I always get compliments whenever I wear it, but not in the sense that I get asked what perfume it is, no, I get told my person smells good, Weekend becomes essentially a ""my skin but better"" scent on me, its an easy to wear scent and never feels out of place in a formal setting either, it feels very ""British"".

I get a lot of the nectarine and powder from the iris and the hyacinth, the base is grounded nicely with cedar and musk, on my skin, Weekend doesn't develop much, its linear but its also not boring either, but, I will say I do not like the newer bottles that Burberry have put this wonderful juice into :(

Longevity is great, it lasts for days on clothes and for a full 24hrs on my skin, silage is strong but not obnoxiously so and also doesn't give me any headaches or sinus pain, I would repurchase this once my dome shaped bottle runs out, this is such a pleasing, all round wonderful scent!",10/29/20 12:46,GinCatsBooks
Weekend for Women Burberry,"Im a 22 year old and this smells absolutely gorgeous! I dont understand the comments about this being for an older women as its really a hyper floral perfume, i imagine a rainforest enchanted with soaked flowers particularly wet rosehip, blue hyacinth and mignonette meshed alongside a juicy nectarine and sharp green notes. One of my number one at home fragrances after the shower or just sitting around wanting a little something to boost your mood!",09/23/20 15:07,Alyjah1234
Weekend for Women Burberry,"Absolute disappointment, compared with all other Burberry creations. This is the strangest, weakest and oddest fragrance I have had and tried from the brand, and luckily it was a gift from an ex so I didn't spend any money on it. He loved it, I couldn't stand it. It does dry down a bit better, however by the time the perfume has settled, I am already sick of it and want to wash it off/wear something else.

To me, the fragrance is simple, dominated by nectarine - it smells like fizzy nectarine lemonade + has the slightly 'colder', rougher note of the hyacinth. After the initial spray, whose opening aroma thankfully doesn't last that long, I also detect something akin to a rotten banana. The scent of the brown parts of a banana. Couple that with nectarine and a whiff of hyacinth, for normality I reckon, and it is just... unpleasant.

Smells surprisingly cheap, chalky sunscreen-like and diluted peach/nectarine, compared with everything Burberry makes. To me, all their perfumes have an elegance, a weight of aroma regardless of whichever fragrance we are talking about. This perfume completely lacks that elegance, relying on a rather cloying, 'exotic' stank. Maybe that's their poor take on something 'sweet', but to me it was a huge disappointment and I gave it away as soon as I could, never to even mention it again.

Unimpressive, just like the bottle - cheap looking, understated, nothing special, rather common, with the white writing and flattened shape. Total bore, total cheap peach lemonade vibe.

I would absolutely advise against blind buys.",08/30/20 13:22,JolieSucre
Weekend for Women Burberry,"Just received mine and it smells like it did over 10 years ago when I used to wear it. It’s nice and light but honestly smells too old for me for some reason! I don’t think it smells any weaker than it used to or watered-down like a reviewer said but I did purchase the parfum so maybe that’s it? Anyway, it’s very pretty but too powdery for me in my 30s!",08/27/20 00:20,Mynotaur

It lasts super long on me, like 8 hrs + and I enjoy its waft throughout the day. Sniffing it gives me comfort and happiness. I enjoy wearing it both day and night.

This is a fresh floral suited for summer or Philippine weather. It's not a favorite but i am so thankful that i like the scent, as this is a blind buy. This, though, is like a somewhat of a dated scent but this would fit perfectly on a feminine mature lady... I agree on the comment below that this is a 90's scent. But i still like it.",05/14/20 22:30,Carla Delloro

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I am trying this parfum today, what I have smelled on first spray and now after wearing for 4 hours is the most complex, beautiful, powdery, vintage dusty rose! Totally authentic smelling rose btw. But not strong or cloying in any respect, soft but enough to subtly remind you of it's presence as you move throughout your day. I wanted to try this fragrance because the genius behind it is Nathalie Lorson and I absolutely love every fragrance creation that I have smelled by her! I have several of her fragrances that I have bought blind and I have never been disappointed. Her fragrances are infinitely wearable and unique, they stand out from the commonplace fragrances out there.",04/26/20 15:00,Seaworthy

Smelled such a lovely rose hip scent.

This review is the smal chubby bottle.

Office safe.

Not sexy or seductive. Just really a pleasant scent in every way.

Will for sure be a big time sprin/summer favorite for me.

Reminds me a lot of forever and ever by Dior

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Right after spritzing, it was a citrus blast, then as it dries down, the herbal notes come out. For the first hour or so, I liked it.
But another hour passed and it became very powdery, still herbal but now sweet as well, and I realised what it reminds me of- mosquito repellent candles (the citronella ones). I don't know if it's the sage, the mignonette, or what but unfortunately this puts me off of this scent.",11/25/19 16:10,JustSimpleThings
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I can definately see why there are so many mixed reviews of this one. On first spray I thought oooo this is quite nice! Initial spray on my skin strangely smelt similar to paco rabanne ultraviolet only better..sorta how I was hoping ultraviolet would smell...And then it quickly turned into a NO not for me as it developed and dried down.

This perfume doesn't smell horrendous although it's bordering on it ..it smells more like those smelly things you hang in your car...it definately doesn't smell like detergent/softener to me which is what I was kinda hoping, I like scents like those..And this actually doesn't smell anywhere as nice as most softener smell..which is saying something!, this perfume isn't great in all honesty, not great atall and especially for Burberry and the price it's being sold for. It's a hard one to explain but it doesn't smell like a perfume, it smells like a car freshener crossed with those old potpourri flowers people used to have in bowls around their homes, I wouldn't want to smell like this. Not my sort of perfume atall but each to their own X",10/28/19 03:23,babyrose1985
Weekend for Women Burberry,"I tried it today in the chemist shop on my wrist.

It smells exactly like my laundry room, i.e. it is either same smell as my detergent or fabric softener.

It is hard for me to determine the notes, as the association with the laundry room is too strong. I would say it is ""white crispy shirt"" scent, perfect for office. Not sure about weekend.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I fell in love with this year's ago when a co-worker received it as a gift for Christmas and began to wear it every day. It would linger, faintly, after she'd pass by, with a warm, happy, soothing scent. There was nothing harsh, nothing abrasive and at the time I thought, ""I've got to have that scent.""
I changed jobs and forgot about it. Years went by and I happened to come across it on Amazon, discounted tremendously, so I bought it. It was as I remembered, but stronger, since I was spraying in myself. I received so many compliments from men.
One day I had a doctors appointment and had to fast for blood work. I had the beginning of a headache and made the mistake of spraying it prior to heading out for the drive, which was about an hour. I was sick by the time I arrived. It really wasn't the fragrances fault, but I haven't gotten past the association, yet.
Maybe later.",08/27/19 21:58,pennyligeia
Weekend for Women Burberry,"Clean, powdery and fresh with a vintage vibe. Reminded me of Chloé fragrances and Glow by JLo. It’s one of those scents that smell like sweet washing powder or handmade soap. It’s not the kind of perfume i normally wear, but i like it. It has its charm. It’s feminine and relaxing.
I recommend it to a modern virgo girl, who likes to spend time in nature and is a bit nostalgic.
Sillage is soft, but the scent is not weak. Longevity is 3 hours and counting.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I purchased this fragrance after listening to a review that suggested its happy qualities 'sunshine in a bottle'. When described like this how could I not buy it?

I agree that this is a happy sunny fragrance, reminiscent of the smell of fresh laundry hanging out in the midday sun. Flowers bask in the sun's warm rays. A nectarine tree is present and gives off its warm fruity aromas.

Burberry Weekend has moderate projection on me and lasts well. If I spray it on myself at bedtime I can still smell the fragrance next morning. I use 4-6 sprays. This would be a beautiful fragrance for a spring or summer picnic.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"And I got it. Totally blind buy. I thought I never smelled it in my life (which is surely not true, since i did, (it smells so familiar and warm and cozy to me), but never knew it was the Weekend). It's pretty cold outside here in Russia, around -2 Celsius. I just received the bottle, opened it right away. Sitting here, in a park, watching my child playing, the sun starts coming out, I sprayed it on my wrist, found that classical piano music like Chopin would suit it perfectly- put the headphones on, having my coffee and life seems soooo sweet right now. Yes, I can smell the honeyed nectarines, was really afraid of them, since i had couple of unpleasant experiences with peach notes in perfumes, those smelled very artificial, these nectarines are ripe and extremely delicious. Little powder and some honey it all makes me feel soo cozy and happy. Yes, I can also smell that lemonade note which gives it a spark. Gotta let the bottle rest a little and see how it opens up later. So far im in love again! Funny how this happens, as i never have that first-sniff-love. Never. It's always just later on, when i ""feel through"" the perfume and it ""penetrates"" into my whole being- then I feel the love.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"I don't know why some people say it ""relaxing"" in my opinion it is a pure business smell, it was created for professional woman for day perfume. I find this perfume absolutely strange, I smell it on a young Romanian businesswoman at a conference and I was damn sure it is Amarige first after 20 minutes I change my mind and I asked her: oh, you and your Trussardi again dear? ( we have absolutely the same taste in perfume and I absolutely adore her, she remember me of myself in the young age) She smile and say nope Amy it not, after one hour I was very determined to discover what this great smell is and she never tell me but 4 months later on my birthday she sent me a bouquet of garden flowers with this perfume in the middle and a written note who say: this is the smell, happy anniversary.

Someone has mentioned layering with Esterr Lauder Beautiful, so maybe I'll get a sample of that and give it a go, but I'm not convinced.

That is the feeling I get from this perfume.",10/13/18 19:57,LateBloomer
Weekend for Women Burberry,"Weekend is fresh and relaxing, floral but in a different way. It helps reset my nose and psyche when I have worn a lot of heavy or complex fragrances or when I have been under a lot of pressure. Kind of like taking a day to goof around outside. This is a low-stress scent that doesn't announce itself or demand your attention, like a really good old dog at your feet. I mean that in a flattering way.

Some reviews say it's not subtle and elegant, but I think there is a natural elegance in taking time to be outside on a clear day, and that's how this makes me feel. Perhaps it's the odd blooms you don't typically see: peach blossom, mignonette, hyacinth, rose hip (not a bloom, but still unusual). These oddments of floralcy create sort of an outdoors-when-things-are-blooming feel. Weekend reminds me of flat spaces where I run, flanked by wildflowers and weeds.

Weekend for Women Burberry,"Weekend by Burberry
First off my bottle isn’t Matt like the photo, mine I sent clear glass. The liquid isn’t as yellow either.
Second I must be getting s different perfume than what’s been reviewed here...
I agree with one comment that has this being of a soft woody base. I think that tempers the whole fragrance so well.

First impression
Fruit, watery, fresh (although I was in a bathroom post shower).
This isn’t juicy or tart, the fruit element was ‘yellow’ not sweet either. Perhaps a floral with that now I think about it.

Second, as it develops
Aldehydes... perhaps, I hate them normally, but something I smelled reminded me of fragrance si didn’t like, which are of aldehydes in some way, but this is nice and pleasant.
Very soft sunshine floral with a powdery (edge only, not a flowery sweet powder) floralness, which is when I seems to detect the blonde type woods.

Overall I think this is a very nice blend, great to feel clean but if you aren’t feeling like an aquatic or herby fresh mood coming on. Sunshine, watery (only at the first few mins, but then I was in bathroom), floral, woods, slight powder (not baby powder).
Softly fresh with a nice sillage, not leaning toward a specific group.

Ash Flower Burberry,"Ash Flower – A Hidden Signature Gem for the True Fragrance Connoisseur


I discovered Ash Flower completely by chance at Selfridges in London. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular, just browsing—but something about this scent called to me. The sales assistant mentioned it was being discontinued, and from the entire Signature line, it was the only one that truly captured me.

From the very first spray, Ash Flower draws you in with a ghostly floral softness—like petals drifting through smoke. It opens airy, delicate, and mysterious. Then slowly, it begins to evolve. A subtle ash note surfaces, grounding the floral heart and giving it an almost meditative quality. As it warms on the skin, it becomes creamy, rich, and unexpectedly deep—soft woods, perhaps a hint of musk, and a skin-like warmth that wraps around you.

What makes it so beautiful is how quietly powerful it is. No cloying sweetness, no loud projection—just a deeply elegant scent that wears close and lingers with intimacy. It’s the kind of fragrance that transforms as the hours pass, revealing layers you don’t catch at first. It lasted up to 8 hours on me, with the drydown becoming the most addictive part—creamy, cozy, and effortlessly luxe.

At £295, it’s definitely a luxury buy—but one that feels worth it for what you get. It’s not hyped, not common, and that adds to its allure. This is a scent only true frag heads seem to know about—a rare, under-the-radar masterpiece that’s quietly disappearing from shelves.

If you love finding gems before the world catches on—or before they’re gone—this one is for you.",05/10/25 07:40,Ddwamaitha
Ash Flower Burberry,"A contradiction in name, but not in nature. Ash should whisper of something charred, something brittle and undone, petals kissed by fire, fragile and smoke-stained. And yet here, there is no burn, no edge—only heat, unrelenting and syrup-thick, yet dehydrated and abrasive. It is dense, oppressive, it is the most sandpaper-like warmth that does not flicker but suffocates and scrapes, wrapping around itself in layers upon layers of sweetness that never break, never waver. There is no space for breath, no escape for air. The scent moves inwards, folding, smothering, cloaking... just unbearable.",03/07/25 23:18,luvoxlixir
Ash Flower Burberry,"This was a blind-buy. Burberry uses almond and peach in their fragrances so well, and this is the reason I wanted Ash Flower when I saw the notes.

Cool, aloof, introverted, powdery, it gives me orris root vibes from the start. It does smell ashy! Smells like both suede and leather too.

You're in for a treat if you like almond! There's an intense green almond that really isn't dessert-like. It reminds me of unsweetened almond milk, not almond cookies or pastries. It becomes creamier as it dries down. Probably tonka kicking in making it creamier, yet not vanilla. It's not lactonic like other perfumes with ""milk"" notes. The almond becomes a bit nuttier in the drydown and blends nicely with tonka.

Peach is barely there, just enough to uplift and balance the gloomy, ashy quality. Ash Flower isn't a fruity fragrance. It's mostly a gray, suede-like fragrance that is rather melancholy, kind of like La Pausa EDT (they are very different scents though--don't get me wrong!).

Ash Flower is truly unique and should get more attention. While I might not add it to the masterpiece category, there's nothing else like it, and that seems like quite an achievement for a perfumer nowadays!",11/10/24 17:12,AveParfum

Ash Flower Burberry,"Don't know why this one isn't getting much love but it is such a creamy sweet airy almond with a twang of peach . The peach smells truly sophisticated. It's not your everyday bath and body works / Victoria secret type of peach. I do get the juniper berries which lends to the aromatic side. The saffron is beautiful it doesn't come off as too rubbery or anything. It's a creamy , milky , lactonic scent.

The packaging is top tier. Love everything about this. Seriously it's beautiful and so under the radar.",06/28/24 18:44,MareaCamacho
Ash Flower Burberry,"Bought the perfume for the scent because notes looked fantastic.

The packaging is really amazing stationary invite quality for a leather tie event. Then there is a leather tie that harmonizes with the note profile, a slightly nude bisque color, wrapped around the neck. Magnetic cap metal is etched with some art deco geometrics for a bit of a textural edge.

The glass isn't quite baccarat like Celine bottles, though it's squared up and substantial. Won't bruise a toe if it slips out of a spray session handling. Not prone to break either.

So, the initial few wearings were fresh cherry tonka intensivo. Gave it a chance. Took the lid off for a day. Left it alone for a week. Revisited it and . . . perfecto.

Delicate almond, smooth and soft lactonic. A hint of sweet, wild grasses, and a sunset golden peach.

Longevity is 6 hours or more on skin and days on cloth.

Ash Flower Burberry,"Tried this flavor the other day. I didn't even know it was new. I thought it was just not represented here.
In general, the most beautiful almond, if to describe simply. If to go into the essence, there is a brand dnk, which I adore. The association - gray haze over the water, from the opened door of the pastry shop comes the aromas of pastries and spices. Only the price of 200 euros stopped me from buying it. The flavor is beautiful.",06/20/23 12:19,JuliyaB
Burberry Women Burberry,"Another Michel Almairac scent in my collection . The guy who brought us JOOP and Farenheit. I didn't know the perfumers until i got on this site and am always amazed how many of the ones I like are by the same people.

I shamelessly wear my wife's scents. Not all of them ofcourse but this one is just a nice classic vanilla that is conforting and a little boozy to me. It's enveloping and calming to me.

The bottle I'm reviewing is about 20 years old. It's pretty much full and the box says only Burberry. It's the same bottle as above but I get none of the fruitiness of the mentionned notes.

I get a vanilla powder that sits on a brandy like note ...to me. It's classic and not to sweet or cloying. I can see how this is a flagship scent although it's simple and uncomplicated. Burberry Brit is another Vanilla fave along with Burberry weekend that has a peach like note.

I don't wear weekend as it leans feminine but it's like catnip when the wife wears it.",11/07/25 06:48,My13ScentsWorth

Burberry Women Burberry,"Unfortunately, this fragrance is overwhelmingly sweet to the point of causing dizziness. The biggest drawback, however, is its extremely short longevity—lasting no more than half an hour on my skin. That said, it does carry a certain mature charm, evoking the image of a woman strolling through autumn streets as rain falls and leaves scatter around her.

Burberry Women Burberry,"This one is not for me. Although I have to admit I am smelling this for the first time, 30 years after its release, and I don’t recall smelling anything like it. Although it may be original, it’s just not interesting or pleasant to me. I would describe this as fresh, slightly powdery, warm citrus, somewhat indolic. There’s no actual citrus in the notes but there’s a sharp freshness here that gives me that kind of impression. This scent seems more appropriate for a laundry detergent, cleaning product, candle, or hotel lobby. I personally would not choose to smell like this, but no offense to those who do. Fragrance is very subjective and there are so many to choose from nowadays. I would say this is not a safe blind-buy (as I regretfully did on clearance at Marshalls), especially if you prefer more contemporary fragrances.",09/19/25 15:53,Shinobi Meow

Unfortunately, its longevity is short — it only lasts a few hours. It doesn’t smell like an apple pie or dessert; instead, it’s a fresh, juicy green apple with a hint of peach, sweetened gently by vanilla.

Burberry Women Burberry,"this is a really solid fragrance.

The opening is what really blew me away, however. It smells like a bubble bath almost? but like a REALLY bougee bubble bath. I definitely picked up the peaches in the dry down. the projection is quite decent imo. most of the comments say it doesn't perform as well, but maybe the composition is different (?). im not sure which make mine is as it was my mother's originally, but that 90's vintage flair is certainly notable.
the note of the peach, while not being sickly sweet, definitely gives this frag potential to be wearable all year round! So it's extremely versatile.
it can come off as too powdery to some (almost like a hotel ladies powder room with air freshener sprayed all over) so just be cautious of that. its not TOO strong to be picked up on by other people, but once you notice it yourself, it can become distracting.

however, if you want to smell like a nostalgic (yet slightly mature), vacation in the Caribbean, def pick this one up! xx",08/08/25 22:28,ilyanvxs

I love Burberry Brit, and have since bought Brit Rhythm which I dislike, Touch which I dislike, and now this absolute joke of a fragrance. Burberry, you suck.
ETA: might as well mention, the whisper of a scent I can detect when I bury my nose in my arm (after 6 sprays on that single spot, mind you) is that musty-dusty smell some fragrances leave behind after the dry-down has worn off.",06/14/25 09:29,B-Lynn77

Burberry Women Burberry,"This scent is magic in a bottle, feels very reminiscent of 90s atmosphere, it has a hint of vintage in the best possible way. I love the beauty created with the magnificent combination of the notes, the peach, apricot and pear are an absolute favotite whenever they are used in a scent. I do not believe in a gender specific scent, but let's call this a female leaning, but anyone who wants to feel cosy, smell unique and nice can wear this. I love to overspray my perfumes, so having that in mind I love scents that are not overbearing, just like this one. Sadly I have never smelled the old formula to make the comparison, but what I can say is that the scent is a 100% out of a 100% amazing, with one drawback that it is very light and almost immediately becomes a skin scent. I love a good skin scent, but I wish this perfume would project and linger little bit longer before becoming a skin scent.",05/15/25 06:20,Ivansky

Burberry Women Burberry,"To me this is a fruity, pear, vanilla, musky, mossy scent. It's slightly dank or stale? I owned a mini bottle of this as a tween and recently decided to buy a travel size to see if it would smell nostalgic. It is slightly nostalgic, but not as much as I was expecting. I love how it smells when you first spray: sweet, fruity, warm, a little creamy. I find the dry down to be oddly stale. I swear I can smell the moss throughout this, and it interacts with the fruit, vanilla, and musk in a way I'm not used to. I do kind of like it but will not wear it much.

My boyfriend smelled me spraying this and became obsessed with it. He has asked to borrow it several times. He even wears it just at home sometimes. I ended up giving him the travel size because he likes it better and I actually prefer the way it smells on him. Smells like cozy, sweet, worn clothes on him.

Burberry Women Burberry,"My beloved peaches and cream snuggly scent.
I received a sample of this fragrance many years ago and fell in love the moment I dabbed some on my wrist and instantly bought a bottle! It is such a beautiful comforting, creamy, slightly fruity, musky, woody hug in a bottle! It feels like a cuddle from someone you love.

I have a pre-reformulated bottle with the stubby ridged cap! And I shall seek out another one to purchase too!

This opens with the most lovely mellow, fruity peach and dried apricot. Peach can sometimes be an iffy note for me, but here it is perfection. I don't notice any blackcurrant, but sometimes, depending on my body temperature, I can get a slight hint of tartness from the green apple. Jasmine is also not detectable for me.

The base notes are where this fragrance sings it's beautiful comforting Sonnet! The natural, unsweetened vanilla is heavenly (I am not the biggest fan of vanilla when it is too heavy and sweet, as it so often is in modern fragrances) the cedar and oak moss give it such a lovely slant, making this fragrance suitable for a man that is confident enough to pull this off, and the soft musk is what radiates the longest in this fragrance....the musk is what I can smell on my clothing 24 hours later....with just a whisper of the peach and the cedar and oak moss.

I will always have a bottle of this in my collection as it is so versatile and the comfort aspect of it makes it perfect for any season or mood. A truly stunning classic that smells as beautiful in 2024 as it did in the 90's. Simply timeless.",08/31/24 00:47,Agent Provocateur101

It's like it gave me a strong sense of nostalgia for places I have never been and things I have never done; a past that I have never lived and memories I don't have.

This perfume spoke about love... and taught how to share the beauties of life!

Burberry Women Burberry,"On my skin the cedar is very predominant, very sweet, woody, loud vanilla and a little powdery, i do not smell any pear or peach,this feels elegant and mature to me, I like it, but i don't see myself reaching for it in a daily basis, it feels like a ''special moment'' fragrance for me.

On fabric it's a little lighter, a little more fruity.
to me it smells much better than on my skin.

edit: turns out im wearing this every day since i got it, delicious!",04/26/24 06:10,imacat88
Burberry Women Burberry,"OK people. After reading all the reviews, here is a quick tip to know if you're reviewing the old formula or the new one :

OLD SCHOOL ORIGINAL FORMULATION : the best Burberry women is the one in bottles with the low flat ridged caps like on the picture above, that comes in a pale, plain yellow box with a line of tartan/plaid at the bottom of the box only. The original says made in France on the box.

NEW REFORMULATION : the new reformulated version came out in 2020; it's the one with the tall and thin cap and the plaid covered box. That one says made in Germany on the box.

REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL RIDGED CAP VERSION :
After years of wearing Burberry women, I still love it as much as I did the first day. The peach-vanilla-cedar-oakmoss combination is just beautiful, rich and juicy. The oakmoss is present and grounds the fullness of the perfume. It is stunning! It has a nice sweetness that comes from the fruits and vanilla but nothing caramel or cakey or anything baked goods, just a natural sweetness that doesn't overpower anything but plays nicely with the other notes.

Now because one person's ""lightly sweet"" is another person's overdose of sugar, I'll use my personnal Sweetness scale from 1 to 10 to put things in perspective, with Ralph Lauren Safari being bone dry and not sweet at all at a 1 and Lancôme La vie est belle being a gag inducing diabetes in a bottle level of sugar at a 10. Burberry women gets a 3.5-4 on my scale.

Longevity of the original is stellar, I get 8-12 hours without issue and the scent lingers on clothes for a long time with 4-7 sprays. I think anyone of any age could wear that one. Burberry women is sexy in a subtle and classy grown up way, like a woman with a messy bun wearing an oversized cream cashmere sweater that drops on one of her shoulders and showcases her clavicle. That woman knows that sexiness is about being comfortable in her own skin.

REVIEW OF THE NEW REFORMULATION : the richness, fullness and the juiciness of the peach is almost gone and the oakmoss is toned down to almost nothing, leaving the cedar note to be very present, making it a bit scratchy down the throat when you smell it. It's now more of a fruity green cedar perfume. People who have never smelled the original could actually like this a lot for what it now is. Lovely and wearable, very office safe fruity-woody perfume. Longevity of the reformulation is abysmal. I was lucky to get 3-4 hours out of this one on my skin.

FINAL THOUGHTS : original ridged cap bottle of Burberry women is stunning and very much worth hunting down on ebay for a reasonnable price (under 100$).",03/31/24 14:08,Gypsy French
Burberry Women Burberry,"I don’t know if I got a reformulated version. But I hardly smell the fruity or vanilla. It’s very much a fresh, mossy and green scent. Well...maybe a bit of green apple.
Inoffensive, but nothing outstanding or unique. Perfect for the office.",03/31/24 08:25,deadxxxmoon
Burberry Women Burberry,I don't know why people are saying it's discontinued - it isn't! It is on Burberry's own website! £96 for 101ml though i cannot see the box pattern to see if they changed that packaging - if they have then the one i bought on Amazon is legit but literally has zero staying power. I sprayed it twice on the back of my hand and within an hour no smell at all!,03/25/24 06:03,MaceyJoy
Burberry Women Burberry,"Absolutely gutted they reformulated this and removed the oak moss so it has no staying power at all now! WHY do they have to make such changes?! Burberry still sell it on their website at £96 for 100ml! with the new longer lid but i bought one from Amazon and the box was also different (checkered) so i returned it as there are so many knock off's everywhere.

That’s what this remind me of, but in a good way. Very nostalgic for me because I would always rub my wrists on any sample I could find in any magazine. This is very crisp and refreshing with all those fruits in the opening combined with the jasmine. As it dries down, it warms up a bit once the vanilla and woods start to peek through. It’s a very classic, simple fragrance that can be worn year ‘round. Nothing special, but easy to reach for when you’re just running errands or when you don’t know what to wear.",10/27/23 14:39,elleayjay

I was concerned when I saw the comparison to Fancy Love -- that one just doesn't work for me (I know lots of people are partial to it, but on me it's kind of flat with a salty undertone). But the Burberry has a lot more lift and so far no salt.
I do understand the idea this is somewhat shampoolike. I'm thinking pleasant and appropriate for any occasion, though more of a day fragrance than something for a night out.

It's just barely enough to notice and an easy reach after a shower to keep feeling fresh. But that's it. It's shower fresh and nothing else. It's cute and clean and feminine. Nothing memorable in the least.",09/02/23 23:48,BrownRoux
Burberry Women Burberry,"This was my first love, my first fragrance, back in 97. I don't get why some say this is mature, I wore this at 15-16, it was my signature scent for nearly 10 years. It was warm, fresh, fruity, and deep, an amazing scent. Very hard to describe, just delicious. It used to last up to 20 h on my skin, and forever on clothes and scarfs. Now, its a skin scent. Not sure if its my skin chemistry.
I went through many bottles, but my last one is not performing so well. I have moved on since 2006, I still miss this, but not sure I would buy it again, since its been reformulated.",08/28/23 18:37,Gourmandwoman41
Burberry Women Burberry,"Autumn in a bottle!

Thankfully no one I've ever known wore it and I'm able to form a clear understanding of it without my judgement being clouded by past memories as often is the case with perfumes from the past century. I have an interest in vintage perfumery as well and after smelling many simple and straightforward modern fruity-florals, it takes a bit to adjust to vintagies.

This is like nothing I've smelled before to be honest. I wouldn't necessarily call it mature, but it's heavy for sure. First time I tried wearing it I was a tad disappointed and washed it off after a couple hours but something made me want to go back to it anyway. There's just something tempting about it apart from the retro feeling.
It's very heavy on moss and cedar (or maybe musk, or both), so much so that at times it smells almost medicinal to me. Usually one of my pet peeves, here it's quite bearable. Peach and apricot are there, too, but they're bitter peaches and dried apricots, which is not to say that those notes smell bad - just not the way one would expect perhaps. I smell something akin to dry autumn leaves as well. Subtle vanilla note doesn't get to truly shine, although it barely evolves on my skin at all. I would say it's a woody fragrance with a touch of bitter fruit, yet it remains very feminine despite all that.

My personal feelings change from ""I like it"" to ""it'll do"" all the time as I wear it, I'll see how it goes from here on. Nevertheless even as a gourmand lover with a fragrant sweet tooth I can appreciate it. If I were to attach it to an image of a woman it would be a posh woman with a mean streak working in fashion industry.",08/23/23 14:33,kittenpawz

Burberry Women Burberry,"There's a common consensus that this is supposed to be similar to KVD Saint, one of my favorite discontinued perfumes, so I blind bought this yesterday to try. Unfortunately, I have to report the two are not at all similar. If you're looking for a Saint replacement, this is definitely not it.

This perfume reminds me a lot of my grandmother, someone who loves peach scents (my D&G The One was hers) and Burberry. Unfortunately, this is a little too mature for my tastes. I agree that this smells like a sophisticated older woman. Dry sweet peach and apricot with jasmine and some musky woods. This fragrance is extremely powdery to my nose and feels very unchanging with little variation. I feel like this is something I'd like to wear in 20 years, but for now I'm either going to return it or give it to my grandmother.",08/14/23 13:55,neogio

No offense taken. To the Brits, Burberry has been a bit of a joke since the 90's. Used to be a well revered heritage brand, now something naff we flog to tourists ( see also Penhaligon's, Jo Malone and the Cotswolds).

Also, made in France and Germany.",07/09/23 16:08,Scent_Insensibility

Best scent from Burberry!",07/01/23 01:28,anitasaastamoinen
Burberry Women Burberry,"New bottle/packaging bought for a steal on FragranceNet. Wow!! First impression (<2 minutes) is a lovely one. This is very similar to Taylor by Taylor Swift (thank you to the astute reviewers and board members). Goodness, this is a great sweet peach with a kiss of florals. Candied in a way similar to Love Spell without being ""too much."" No weird crayon notes (sorry, Demeter Peach) in sight. We'll see how the drydown goes. Edited to add: I was genuinely having a hard time distinguishing this from Taylor on the drydown, aside from it being peach instead of apricot. I think it's lovely, and enjoy that it is lighter and a possible year-round scent.

I've noticed how Burberry is quite elegant but features a competitive array of juicy, youthful, sweet fruit notes. Examples: Sweet lime and candied almonds in Brit, MFK's Her featuring bubblegum strawberry, Blueberry and BR 540 type notes, strawberry milkshake vibes of Her Elixir, and the fruit-snack opening of Her EDT (green bottle-- sadly the drydown is not for me).",06/13/23 08:38,KylieBooFace

The old formula was delicious and long lasting. All the lovely notes were strong and sustained. If you can imagine, this fragrance had a slight warmth and coziness that paired perfectly with the apple and peach. I got a bottle recently and it smelled crisp and watery without any of the depth and warmth. Not much like the version I bought in 2008 that lasted all day.",05/08/23 16:40,Cmlake89
Burberry Women Burberry,"GOLDEN NECTAR in the FOREST...

Like jar peaches in a light syrup on a wooden serving board framed with wisps of forest. I've loved this scent since it came out, and I agree with MihelaN below that it's still lovely even after reformulation, only the performance is more moderate from what I remember. Signed by perfumer Michel Almairac, this beauty opens with a peachy-apricot burst that dries down into a sheer golden veil of soft woods and vanilla. With time, it's gotten a lot stronger. The woods are coming more forward now with that sweet peach-apricot on top. I love this a lot for some reason, although there's a simplicity here. Leaves an oily sheen on the skin that takes a few minutes for the sillage to wake up. It's the woods that make this a winner imo. Overall: Beautiful golden peach syrup & woods scent profile, and the moderate performance makes it versatile enough to wear any season. It's a longtime love for me, Enjoy!

Contrast to Fancy Love Jessica Simpson:
My first impression was that I'm smelling Burberry Women, and there are striking similarities, but these are different. Fancy Love has a faint sparkling quality and better performance. As with Burberry Women, overall I get a syrup-y apricot/peach, like jarred apricots & peaches in light syrup.

Update 02/08/25: Funny thing, when I sprayed this yesterday, after awhile I started to notice the oakmoss much more than I had before. I'm tempted to say this is the fly in the ointment as I have a love/hate relationship with oakmoss. Some people go crazy for it, but for me it's usually a challenge. Here I think oakmoss helps makes the scent what it is, fruity nectar with wisps of forest, but if I over-spray the oakmoss bothers me. Still love it, but next time I won't put as much on. Performance is gotten really good; it's still here on my hoodie the next day.

I find it has a very poor projection, it feels like a perfume that's just for me and only me, no one else is going to get a whiff because of how close it sits. Personally, I don't really find it that fruity, to me it just smells musty, dusty and dated. I could probably imagine my grandma wearing this, it doesn't feel fresh at all.
To be honest, if it actually had a good projection it would probably be toxic and would choke you out.

Burberry Women Burberry,Loved it at first. Now I feel like the fruity tones are gone and the powder and vanilla tones remain. Not quite right for me,03/04/23 23:13,Hope7
Burberry Women Burberry,"I blind bought this perfume about a year ago, wore it a couple times to test it but I was disappointed. First, it wasn't fruity like I expected from the notes. Rather, it smelled boozy and bitter right from the opening. It's not a bad scent by any means, but it's not what I imagined after reading reviews raving about how it smells like peaches and cream.

After seeing my bottle gather dust for so long, I decided to give it another try, since my tastes have changed a lot over time. At first sniff I get a very sharp alcoholic blast, and what feels like the different notes in the perfume fighting for dominance. When it settles, everything becomes thankfully a lot more cohesive and enjoyable. Whoever said this gives academia vibes is completely spot on. It has a musty old book note from the musk and the cedar wood, which is more pleasant than it sounds. I still don't get any of the fruity top notes from this, but I get bourbon. (Probably what the other reviewers refer to as caramel)

While I do like BfW, wearing it gave me a massive headache around the 1 hour mark and I had to scrub it off, which is why I bumped it down to ""dislike"".

I'm still not sure how some of y'all think this is a light, crisp or fresh perfume? To me it's closer to the ""cloying and heavy"" side. I agree that it smells classy, but to me it smells like a warm boozy, musky, not-too-sweet woody-vanilla, which is enjoyable in it's own right but IMO too mature for me to wear (I'm 24). Not to mention, I don't want to risk a headache every time I wear it. It's also the first time I was anosmic to fruity notes, bummer.",03/04/23 08:43,sai_98

Burberry Women Burberry,"I just tried & excitedly purchased this 1995 Burberry Women (BW) perfume release fragrance now, in Feb.2023, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this scent. It is well blended - smooth and gorgeous - nothing sour ever, no bitterness or harshness ever, no fake fruity smells, no alcohol blast; it is a sweet perfume but definitely not sickeningly or juvenile-y sweet - it is softly sweet. Never loud or in anyone else's face (nose), so, very suitable for a work situation.

I have no clue what ""sweet black currents"" smell like in real life, so can't identify that as a stated top note, and also can't identify any of the other stated notes except nicely ripe peaches mixed with something divine (Sandalwood? Sweet Jasmine? Both together?) Then BW moves into a soft peachy & warm vanilla, with a soft creamy peachy vanilla powdery finish. Sometimes I think that I catch a whiff of caramel in the mix after worn for an hour or so - just beautiful. Gorgeous, in fact.
BUT very sadly, on me, Burberry Women has ZERO sillage & ZERO projection - to smell it on myself I have to continuously sniff my wrist, which I have been doing continuously every 5 minutes b/c I love this scent so much. This really disappoints me b/c I like perfumes that have at least some! projection & have at least some! sillage - both NADA for me. :(
On me this is strictly a skin scent, and surprisingly has decent longevity as a skin scent - 8-10 hours, but it needs to have much better projection for me to give it a 10 out of 10.",02/19/23 03:50,Ms.MN
Burberry Women Burberry,"Given that i was a teenager in 2000' I always thought of 90' perfumes as mature, too serious, not my cup of tea. I never bothered to try one. I went to the store to try out something else, didn't find it that day, so I ended up randomly spraying stuff and sniffing. And then, BAM! The most divine smell ever! I couldn't believe it was Burberry. It's so different than today's generic designers. And just the right amount of sweet for me. I tried it one more time in store and bought a 100ml bottle straight away.
This could totally be my signature scent!
Can't believe the years I wasted not knowing about this beauty.
Can't really pick out the notes... It's fruity, sweet and fresh in the same time. I imagine the best time for it would be spring, but I will use it all year round.
Can't say about projection, but longevity is pretty good on me.

Sour on me, maybe the moss? I don’t smell the vanilla, usually you get that a bit more on dry down. Perhaps it’s because it’s blended well? I don't smell musk either which is good because I don’t like strong musk scents.

Burberry Women Burberry,"I don’t think I will ever get sick of this perfume. It is a fruity fragrance but it’s not a typical one, it’s quite unusual. I could pick this on anyone at any time it’s a distinct scent. It sweet in a juicy kind of way. Performance is EXCELLENT and you will be able to smell yourself all day

I prefer the old cap (the one in the pic), not sure why they changed it.

One of the best scents on the market.",12/31/22 07:23,peachygal
Burberry Women Burberry,"I really don't get British perfume brands, among all those perfumes I've tried and owned, my least favorites are all British. (No offense). This perfume is said to have a vanilla and sweet note, but when you don't get the warmth in these two scents, it doesn't do the job. That's why I can only wear this in winter. If I wear this in summer, it has a noticeable disconnect with the warm/hot feeling of summer.",12/29/22 01:08,LizLi
Burberry Women Burberry,"This smells like a slightly bitter peach with fresh cream. Is sweet and powdery but is very soft. I personally love this, for all its elements i think this is free spirited and elegant. I can picture Rachel Weisz in The Mummy wearing this. Smells grown and from the past, yet modern and cool. This is a historian, a librarian, a museum curator, an archeologist or somebody repairing a piece of art. The adult version of wanting to go on an adventure, but the only place you are going is the office. Probably best for day and any season which isn’t summer… but all in all one of those perfumes which will be there for you through thick and thin.

Burberry Women Burberry,"unexpectedly sad vanilla, bordering on somber. a warm, honeyed hollowness.

i ordinarily don't like amber-yellow fragrances, but this hits many of the right buttons: comforting, linear, remote... burberry is 25% mall scent, 35% academia (this is a woody vanilla intensely proximal to lignin, an efflorescence of old paper and senile professors), and 40% miss havisham–– a forlorn maiden in denial. stuffy, british elegance with a hint of gothic fiction.

the ""yellow"" in this is a sluggish, fossilizing amber with an appetite for crystalizing time itself. a bruise-yellow adjacent to putrefactive purple, rather than sunlight. comforting and surprisingly deep, befitting an old fashion house, indeed.",12/17/22 16:13,Ontolome
Burberry Women Burberry,"This wax my signature scent for over two decades, but alas the OG version made in France is next to impossible to find, and when you do, the chances that it’s not turned rancid are slim. I find the new version made in Germany with the slim cap is just meh. Very similar scent, but much more alcohol and way less depth. Performance is crap. It smells just similar enough to make me miss my favourite. If anyone can recommend a great comparable fragrance with the same depth and performance, I’d appreciate it. I’ve been searching for years.",12/14/22 06:30,Marmacita

As the years go by I came to the realization that a lot of random perfumes in my collection are made by Almairac. This is a feminine, evergreen, office-friendly, gentle, warm, cozy, classy scent.

Burberry Women Burberry,"It's a full circle and I came back to this one. This was one of my first few designer fragrances - the others used to be Hypnotic Poison and Poeme. Yes, the 2000s in urban India. I travelled, wandered and meandered - through many others . Happy to discover some , especially Baccarat Rouge, Roses Vanille, Gentle fluidity Gold, Angel's Share ,Sacred Wood ,Kenzo Amour , Lost Cherry..the list goes that way and from Lattafa like Oud Mood and Royal Blends. Treasure every one of them. But for some unknown reason I started getting drawn to pure florals , of late . Pure Poison and Gucci Bloom. And then the craving began for this classic. Rediscovered my past self.Light, breezy, soft , happy !!

Burberry Women Burberry,"Forgot had this and found it in my closet today. Brings back so many memories. At first it smelled harsh, screechy and I thought it had turned rancid.

Burberry Women Burberry,"i just got it after i bought it blindly but i am not sure if i like it. i will update later after more wearings. i thought i have never tested it before, but now i remember i did and i didn't like it and i can see why. i smell lots of bitterness and i am not able to understand where it is coming from. why is it so bitter? it is almost like i smell cypress or wormwood here. similar kind of bitterness i remember from Burberry Body series, they are all so bitter to me, From this one i expected very sweet and fruity scent because of pear and peach, these are usually sweet smelling to me, but i mostly get powder and bitterness and just a very small layer of vanilla. not to say it is bad, it is not, it is kind of interesting, i just expected something else. i will try it more times to see how i fee about it. autumn/winter scent definitely, but so not what i have imagined from the notes and from the reviews. this is newly bought but the bottle is old type like the one here so maybe it is the older one and maybe it is the oakmoss that gives that bitterness to me. the bottle looks very cute really in real life. i just really wanted to love, i thought about it for months and i was so sue i will love it, i just hope it will happen any time soon.",10/12/22 07:49,Mirabele

After about 1 hour the scent settles down to a strong, uninteresting vanilla note. It is excessively sweet for me and I almost feel like being surrounded by candy + vanilla cream cakes in a not well ventilated dessert bar... I think this perfume will be more refreshing if the jasmine and fruity notes such as green apple stand out more.",09/25/22 15:13,langrensha22
Burberry Women Burberry,Very clean every day smell. I like it but i dont love it. On my skin it smell like the smell of an iceberg. Clean fresh air on the top of an iceberg.. Nice smell for a modern woman. As soon as i smelled it i thought that scent is the scent of a city girl.Very very elegant! Not really my taste . I bought it blind buy. A very put together young woman in her thirties can easily pull this off. Very nice clean smell for every day use.Everyone says is an autumn scent but i say is a spring type of perfume. If i could say a perfume for autumn season definately i would go for Halston classic not for burberry. Office friendly but according to me not smth special.

Burberry Women Burberry,"This perfume is like taking a big bite out of a fat, juicy peach. I also get some kind of spice in the middle notes, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe a mixture of the moss and sandalwood. I do definitely get moss from this, which balances super well with the fruits.

I blind bought this on a whim and I'm so glad I did, especially after my disappointment in London. Gives me the desire to try other Burberry scents. This is perfect for day time.

Edit: ok wow so after wearing it for a whole day, I find this is a perfect everyday scent, not overpowering at all, it kind of fizzles out into a soft, powdery scent, musky and mossy. Unfortunately it doesn't last very long, like 2-3 hours until it becomes a very light skin scent. To me this fragrance would fit any woman 30+ perfectly. But I would also consider it to be a unisex fragrance, there isn't anything too feminine about it, it just is. I wish it lasted longer and was a bit stronger, then it would be perfect!",09/20/22 17:12,kittywhiskers

It is more warm and calming and powdery sweet with a woodsy note to it. Upon first spray yes you do smell the apricot and peach but it is definitely mixed in with the warmer notes. It is a delightful calming comforting scent all together and very classy and memorable. It's actually just how I remembered it smelling like when I first discovered this in 2000.

I haven't owned a bottle since 2004. This scent takes me back and brings back memories. When I had this perfume, I had just met my husband. I sprayed it on right before he got home and he walked in the room and said, ""Mmm something smells so good"". I told him it was the perfume I wore back when we met and he said that was why he liked it so much. But anyway, it smells the way I remember. Only it seems like it's not quite as strong from what I remember either. But it also changed manufacturers so that might be why.

I love the way this fragrance softly wafts around me as I go about my day. Can't wait to see how this sweetheart performs in other seasons.
Update December 2022: I own a fullsize bottle of this now. And recently
had some Christmas shopping to do. It was a mild winter day here in Canada -6°Celsius. I wore this...sprayed it liberally on me. On my way to my car a woman walking behind me asked me what perfume I was wearing because I smelled really good. That made my day!",08/14/22 17:58,MiniMena

Burberry Women Burberry,"I would be curious as to whether any of you ladies out there who tend to dislike florals in general make an exception for this one as I do.

I was one of the first in my set to ditch things like Anais Anais and jump on the unisex frag bandwagon of the early 90s... although I did Dior's Eau Sauvage as I found CK One too soapy. Eau Sauvage ushered in for me a lifelong devotion to the unisex citrus; it's my winter frag in that vein, while Goutal's Eau D'Hadrien is my summer. I also have a few other eaux, a chypre or two, and a bottle of Arpege that I keep so I can occasionally smell like my Nana. No matter how much I might enjoy florals on other folks or how much fun I have trying them on at Bloomingdale's, I always come to the conclusion that they are not for me and end up regretting purchases and giving them away. Other florals would enter my life courtesy of a beloved uncle who would purchase bottles for the ladies in the family every Christmas. We would pass them around and sample and trade. I must have sampled at least fifty bottles of florals that way over the years! Generally speaking, I would let them go to someone else, though, knowing that I'd eventually find them too sweet, too overpowering, or too allergenic (I am allergic to about 80 percent of scents I sample as well as to fragrances in many household cleaning and personal care products).

One Christmas in the mid aughts, I claimed a bottle of Burberry Woman in the annual Christmas smell and swap. I figured eventually I would pitch it or give it away, but there was something in the initial spray that captivated me sufficiently to make it my own. I've gone through five bottles since!

Why does my olfactory apparatus make an exception for this one? I've no idea. I smell fresh peach and vanilla immediately upon initial spray, then the cedar and sandalwood emerge for a warm woody accord. Vanilla persists into the drydown after the ""papery"" smell dissipates and blends with an emerging musk. I don't quite get the green apple, and I do smell a hint of the jasmine, but fortunately not enough to trigger a major allergy attack. This fragrance gives me the overall impression of taking a luxury day off in the fall to visit a reasonably empty art museum, or perhaps arriving at work to find that everyone else took a sick day and I can get paperwork done while sipping a nice peach-vanilla herbal tea. It's quiet, feminine, non-allergenic, peace!

I'd welcome any recommendations from the board for other florals I might like, given that I generally don't like them on me and make an exception for this one.",07/16/22 08:44,heatherjofo

There’s a fuzziness to the powder or the peach that my nose keeps trying to overcome.
It’s like when you go to a farm stand and you see all these beautiful peaches- picked warm and waiting in baskets in the sun- the winds’ just right and it’s been a lovely day-
You choose your peach & pay- you can’t wait-
You rub it on your jeans- take a seat in the golden 4:30 sunlight- you take a bite….
And it’s chalky.
And that’s where it kinda sits for me right now
Like a frost in a peach’s youth rendered it deceptively chalky
It’s funny because it almost feels like a prankster little wood nymph laughing after making me choose the wrong peach-
And that makes me curious

Burberry Women Burberry,"I have Burberry For Women EDP 100ML

This was a blind purchase a gift from my mum. I do love everything Burberry so I expected class from this one.

The box is still on display in my bedroom as well as the perfume itself, because I really do like the classic Burberry box.

The perfume bottle itself is straight to the point. It's very simple looking with its dark colour and basic design.

As soon as the perfume is applied to the skin it becomes apparent that it's quite a complicated scent with a lot to think about. The most dominant tones are peachy, fruity, with pear notes. It has a dark undertone to it which I feel may be the sandalwood. The notes compliment eachother beautifully. It is a very autumnal vibe.

When first applied it is quite strong but quickly settles close to the skin. It is not a scent that could be picked up a few feet away but someone close to you would pick this up. I feel that it's subtle and classy.

This for me personally would be something I'd wear in the daytime in autumn. The longevity is not the best, completely dissipating after about 4 hours of wear for me. However the scent is so beautiful that I would take the time to reapply throughout the day for this one.

Burberry for Women opens with apples. Fresh, juicy, raw apple, with the bit of astringency from the unpeeled fruit. This isn't what would be considered a gourmand in 2022 though. This apple is green and tart, and is as nature made it, with no added sugar. It's green, woody and earthy like the orchard where it grew. It's humid and mossy like a cloudy day. It's fresh like the wind announcing rain. And yet at the same time it's warm and cozy. Peaceful like a Fall day at home.",05/11/22 07:06,Rose du soir

There's not much to say except it smells exactly as I expected it to with a hair of smokiness in the dry down that I didn't anticipate (I imagine that's coming from the cedar note?) I almost want to say there's oak moss in the dry down as well.

Burberry Women Burberry,"Loud overripe peach, dirty diaper jasmine (to respond to herculano, I do not mean poop, more like an impolite funky indolic floral, maybe the smell of a sweaty toddler that just woke up from a nap, but not poop, maybe I can't really explain what I mean, I don't have an expert nose-) vanilla + cedar giving a weird plasticky doll-head note, pissy cassis, green lilac, and a smidge of musk & earthy moss to add depth to the sweet notes. Basically all my favorite stuff. Loved this since 2008 & gone through multiple bottles. New formulation not as mossy as the original, which is disappointing, but to be expected. Still a great frag. Likely no one in your circle is wearing this; to me this is important.

Update: I understand the comparison to Ghost Deep Night after seeing it in the 'reminds me of' section here; they open very similarly. But in 👻 (new formula) the rich fruity amber/musk opening quickly fades, and it leaves behind a forgettable floral scent, something like the reformulated Chloé.

Lancôme Poême was a first beloved perfume for me, and while different, it's in the same family with its peach, vanilla, and cedar. Also check out Guerlain Mitsouko and Rochas Femme if you're into scents such as this.",03/11/22 09:28,swedishmilk15

Burberry Women Burberry,"I’ve got a bottle that is at least 10 years old so it’s probably the old formulation and the scent may have changed over time but anyways some thoughts.

This is a warm, inoffensive and very cozy fragrance. Fruit and vanilla give it some (almost gourmand) sweetness, a little flowers some delicacy and femininity. Still all of it is blended with wood so well that I really can’t distinguish many individual notes and an overall impression is of a sweet wooden fragrance of an inside of an old wooden cabinet warm with the autumn sun. Very natural and calming. Projection and longevity are not huge but they get me through the day until I apply something heavier for the evening.

Somehow I missed out on this fragrance during my youth while it had been popular. Perhaps it lacked edginess, sexiness and loudness for my young self, lol, but 25 years later I rather like it. I haven’t smelled the recent formula and judging by reviews it had changed quite a bit. If true, it’s rather sad, but I will be very much enjoying my old bottle while it lasts.

PS: I know many do not believe in layering (I used to be one of those) but if you do layer - to my taste this fragrance is great for playing with and complimenting by a little of other sandal and woody fragrances. For e.g. a little of Santal de Mysore gives Burberry some spicy oriental vibe and Wonderoud a sharper and a little masculine woody vibe.

Husband’s (knows-nothing-about-perfume intellectual introvert, favours Terre & Vetiver Tonka by Hermes) verdict: pleasant, warm and cosy.",01/23/22 01:28,Comrade Zagoryanskaya
Burberry Women Burberry,This was gifted to me.I use this as my everyday running errands perfume as it’s so boring! There’s nothing nice abt it or unique. It’s just a basic vanilla ish with some floral perfume.,01/11/22 10:01,Star_Alien
Burberry Women Burberry,"I just bought a small tester of this. I had a bottle maybe in the late 90s. Not exactly the scent I remember, but still Burberry. I’ve been exploring perfumes a lot recently, my first impression was: it’s uncomplicated, easy to smell, seems like a good perfume for someone new to trying perfume. Scent remains consistent, not a lot of notes and is affordable.",01/10/22 06:00,ringponies
Burberry Women Burberry,"This was my go to and one of my first scents as a teenager up untill age 16, I used to pair it with my burberry scarf back then too.
Back then I was what you may have heard of on tiktok refered too as ""an English chav""

Gold jewellery only & lots of it, huge twisty hoop earrings with pink diamanté balls on with the latest Nike tns on & drenched in this stuff.
This brings back good memories of my first boyfriend and for me this is a scent I wear for lounging in or when wearing a lounge tracksuit it is only a shadow of what it used to be in terms of strength and scent the reformulated version is basically a body spray compared to its former glory.

I still like it but only from a nostalgic point of view it is probably worn a max of 5 times per year so it will probably never be replaced in my collection unless I find a vintage bottle at a good price.
I love the sweetness and jasmine but dislike the green aspect in the background.",01/09/22 23:56,Controlledbyscent31

Burberry Women Burberry,"This goes way back in the 2000s as a blind buy. Was in my early days career, and had the opportunity to grab as blind buy in those sales clearance.
Excited, and when i got home with the great buy, its really love at 1st whiff! Lol!
Little that I know, the concoction of vanilla, peach and warmth of musk got me into whimsy state of wonderland 🤭
I must say, growing up with 2 elder sisters that's so into aromatics, i thought I know about my scent world ...That, till i had my senses enlighten by this simple bottle with its rigged cap.
Something about this scent that just mixed well with my skin, and almost every time i wear it, compliments frm both man and women is aplenty. That is, till then, i discovered that its something that suits well with me, anytime of the day or.. even date nights. *Frankly, most dates finds me yummy with this scent ;)
I had repeated bottles after bottles....
Its my must haves signature in fragrance collection ever since.",01/02/22 05:50,alexis_alpw
Burberry Women Burberry,"We gifted this to my mother in law from Winners so without smelling it. I was pleasantly surprised by it. It smells really good and warm and has good enough longevity considering the price. For some reason, i don't get citrusy vibes from it. Mostly a mixture of jasmine and vanilla. Would not buy it for myself, only because I think there are better perfumes out there.",01/01/22 05:15,beforesunset_mj
Burberry Women Burberry,"I like this perfume (I have reformulated)
Without looking at the notes I'd say it smells like a warm, solar citrus with vanilla and yellow musk. It also has kind of a green-ness which makes it smell outdoorsy to me. I feel like every 90's fragrance I've tried is kinda green must just be the trend back then idk 😂

I doesn't last too long on the skin but it sticks to clothes well. It's a skin scent in the way that it smells like hot skin after going outside. I like it for everyday casual wear/ work. I can see this easily being a signature scent but only to the people who hug you and stuff.",12/18/21 13:00,jas000n
Burberry Women Burberry,"Really don't enjoy this, there is some note in it (weirdly in Coco Mademoiselle too) thar hits the back of my throat, producing a dry scratchy uncomfortable sensation. The mossy element is strong, yet it results in not a pleasant chypre like original Miss Dior or Chanel No.5, but just a dry dusty strong perfume smell with a suggestion of fuzzy (rather than fresh and/or fruity peach)

In the interests of balance, my mother and sister both love it, its tenacious on my perfume-eating skin (why is it always the ones I don't like that last?!) as well as clothes, and there is an admirable noticeable cohesion in all Burberry perfumes that I've tried (this, The Beat and Body) that - utterly barmy as it sounds - is evocative of the odour of the lining of a classic Burberry trenchcoat.

I wish I liked it, but two attempts twenty years apart indicate it as a ""no"" for me.",12/14/21 15:22,pickletastic
Burberry Women Burberry,i'm assuming my juice is the reformulated one because on me it smells like a very faint peach and jasmine with a hint of booziness? which i don't 100% dislike but it's so washed out i gotta stick my nose right on my arm to even sniff it and longevity is low.,12/11/21 05:28,vanilie

I just saw a 100ml on sale for $30, so I snatched it. New version, but still wonderful. I can't compare side by side with original and pinpoint the differences and I am sure it was reformulated, but it still gives off the same warm, comforting vibe and I still love it. I am so glad I got it.",12/06/21 12:21,LaLuNaveed

Burberry Women Burberry,This is one of my favs first of all I love it . It opens with a zesty blackcurrant and a creamy peach and then settles down to just the peaches n cream very yummy! The opening is very similar to smelling a whole currant bush which I loove it reminds me of sitting in the garden as a kid I always loved the smell of the currant bush . And then it turns very gourmand and the black currant goes away Which I also love ! This definitely got me on wanting more lactonic fragrances even tho that's not a listed accord it's very creamy to me 🤤,11/06/21 15:13,Rhiannandb
Burberry Women Burberry,"I had a bottle of this over 15 years ago and recently started looking into some Burberry Classics - before they are all gone. Unfortunately I've not been able to get my hands (online) on one of the old bottles with the ""rigged"" cap. So yesterday I sprayed a new bottle (says made in Germany) and to my surprise this is still very very nice - however a bit lighter and airy. In my memory it was denser and maybe even a tad warmer with more vanilla but honestly - could be a trick of my mind. The new formulation opens up very fruity, something I hoped to get from Taylor by Taylor Swift btw but that one jumps directly to the dry-down of Burberry Women (Taylor is still a very nice fragrance though, also discontinued unfortunately). The dry-down, as said, is maybe not as punchy as before but the DNA is still there - musky, woody peaches covered in vanilla sprinkles. I think I will actually buy a bottle of the new formulation/bottle. My jacket still smells of this and it's been a day, so longevity and sillage on clothes is fine :)",10/27/21 05:37,nitschevo
Burberry Women Burberry,"I absolutely love this perfume! I was fortunate enough to find 3 1oz bottle of the original formula/bottle and it's the best fall scent.

Burberry Women Burberry,I've had several bottles of this over the years but it has obviously been reformulated and ruined. I came here to see if anyone else had the issue and after reading Blue Bouquets review I see I am not the only one thinking this has changed. This used to be be very nice peach and vanilla with woodiness rounding it out. It is like water now. I cant smell much of anything and I sprayed myself and my clothes. I think this is another that has been ruined and is no longer worth keeping around. My shelf of perfumes has shrunk quite a bit in the last year with many perfumes so weak now that they are ruined. It is very disappointing.,10/14/21 08:25,Mbrock
Burberry Women Burberry,"I would love to leave an actual review, however I think it may have been reformulated because I smell nothing except a very faint cedar note. It’s almost non existent as I have to jam my nose into my wrist. I also tried to spritz it onto a sweater and got nothing but a screechy alcohol smell. Could be an older bottle but, with the new lid. Just not sure. So disappointed, was really looking forward to wearing.",10/06/21 11:53,Blue Bouquet
Burberry Women Burberry,"I just got this fragrance simply by reading the reviews. It had got a lot of positive reviews of a comforting peachy scent. To me this smells a lot like Burberry Her and BR450... Basically Her is a milder version of 450 and Women is a milder more comfy version of Her... That´s what i smell, maybe I´m crazy.. lol. I got the original version with the ""barrel"" cap instead of the smooth cap (after reformulation). I wish the smell stayed the same as it does in the first 5 mins after spraying on the skin: fruity and soft. But on me it turnes perfumey and super sweet like burned sugar (just like those perfumes that i just mentioned). My husband hated the smell now that i let him smell it on my skin after about 1h from spraying it on my skin. If you don´t like 450 or Burberry Her, you will not like this one either.

Update: the second day i sprayed it on my shirt and not on my skin in an effort to sustain the initial 5 min scent.. and it worked! I can´t stop smelling my shirt, it is such a nice fruity and comfy cuddly inoffensive scent. Now my husband said i smell good and asked what it is! And last night he hated the same smell on my skin! So all in all, if a perfume turns to turd on your skin, only spray it on your clothes!",09/13/21 12:12,Cloelles
Burberry Women Burberry,"So I had this perfume again like a year ago. It is very peachy and woody with a way too strong musk note in my opinion, I do like how is super fruity the first hour, but then I feel like the musk overpower the wood note and it really just settle down with a salty almost bitter scent, do not get me wrong I do like this perfume, specially for fall and winter time, but I feel is one of those fragrances that are just okay and would make you feel cozy and warm in a cold winter day, other than that I feel is a regular perfume.",09/03/21 00:17,AndraLau
Burberry Women Burberry,"Nice sweeting smelling fragrance. I don't get any fruit notes though. It doesn't project much and it fades pretty quickly on my skin. However, it has lasted 10+ hours on my clothes. I paid $25 for this so I consider it a win. I'd repurchase",09/01/21 22:31,Perfumelady88
Burberry Women Burberry,"My old school love. Nostalgic, and still stands the test of time. I’ve smelled hundreds of frags (designer and niche) yet there’s nothing that I’ve come across quite like this. It’s so well blended so I wouldn’t say its a peach, apple or vanilla etc scent. It’s classy, smooth, and at the same time reminiscent of Fun Dip candy! It’s sweet but yet grounded by the sandalwood, moss and cedar.
Happy I was able to find the old formulation (ridge cap, made in France- not smooth cap from Germany).",08/19/21 23:48,carmenandmonkey
My Burberry Limited Edition Burberry,"Well, I'll be the first.:-))))

Now the sale is on and only two boxes of this perfume are left waiting for their owners at the stand. After flying with ""Body"" and ""The Beat"" I just realized that perfumery of this house is not for me. There is something in their base that I'm sorry to say makes me nauseous. Their fragrances are characterized by some kind of not naturalness and give off some smell of plastic. I think it's not the perfume's fault, it may be due to the English climate. The same fragrance plays differently depending on what climate you wear it in. So, I decided to test this fragrance solely on the recommendation of a highly respected beauty blogger. I was curious whether my impression would coincide with her opinion. Having gingerly smelled the cap and making sure that I am not ""tar"" watered I put it on my wrist.
I won't lay out the notes, as the pyramid of this perfume is strange for me. I will share only impressions.:-)

The beginning: the sweetness is floral, but without sweetness. Here I thought: ""Oh! What an unexpected charm!"". Very feminine and beautiful - this is NOT Burberry at all!!!Middle: the sweetness gradually went away and some strange ""nutty"" perfume started to appear. I can't call it any other way. It's like a slight foreign accent that you're bound to notice. The faster the sweetness of flowers went away, the more and more it appeared in the plume. I will not say that it is not pleasant, it is interesting and something different. And at this point I suddenly realized where I had heard this ""accent"" - it is the ubiquitous, so strange and incomprehensible base, which is inherent in all Burberry fragrances. The thought: ""Aha! And yet you can't be confused with anything!"" And the end: ""nuttiness"" gradually disappeared together with the plume leaving a slight, very close to the skin hint of some ""grandmother's cream"" from an expensive and respectable brand. Soon this pink (from the word rose) cream began to dust and was already like a powder with the same rather easily recognizable smell of rose..... and went quiet. That's it. The whole action of this fragrance took 4 hours. If you count the rather impressive volume poured on my wrist - I expected more in terms of persistence. Perhaps it is for the best. :-))
Verdict: of all the fragrances of this brand - this one is the most wearable. I liked it in all three opening phases and even its ""berberness"" didn't bother me. I enjoyed a beautiful trail, even if not for a long time. Perhaps, if you put it on your hair and scarf, it will show itself more persistently and will stay with you longer. Yes, the opinion is basically the same and would I buy it? - Probably yes. I wish I had gotten it before my failed Burberry purchases, which I had to pass on.

And the last thing: seeing the author of this perfume I am not surprised by my sympathy for him, as I am a fan of M. F. Kurkdjan and his ""red Baccarat"". But this is another story...",02/06/17 12:09,Delphine
Body Tender Burberry,"I am not the biggest fan of chypre fragrances. I inherited a bottle of Burberry Body and a sample of Body tender and thought, maybe I could expand on my fragrance preferences. Unfortunately I don’t really like the wormwood/absinthe in the opening. I find it herbal and bitter but it goes away quickly. In the mid I pick up on the peach, apple, tea, florals, and some musk. I do not smell amber or vanilla. It dries down to a sugary sweet skin scent. I thought the dry down smelled like Clean Reserve's Sparking Sugar. I wore them on different arms to compare, and I was surprised how strong Sparking Sugar was. Body tender is very soft, much softer than what I prefer. This is a “you smell good” instead of a “your perfume smells good” scent. I can appreciate it and understand why someone might love or prefer this type of scent profile but it’s not for me. 5/10.",06/09/25 16:40,Rachael0304

Body Tender Burberry,"My luggage was delayed, so I bought a flacon of this at a special offers counter at duty-free, without even testing it - just as something cheap and easy to wear until my good stuff arrived. Anyway, this is not the type of fragrance I would normally wear, because it is too sweet and fruity for my liking. Somehow my skin always amplifies those synthetic fruity notes, and instead of rose as the dominant note, I end up smelling apple juice or whatever. It's not bad, it's just not for me. I guess it is aimed at younger girls. Projection and longevity are great, making this scent good value for money.",04/28/24 04:39,LadyIva
Body Tender Burberry,"Contemporary Chypre Tea-Rose...

This Chypre Fruity beauty signed by Michel Almairac opens with wormwood, citrus & fruits but already the tea rose is swelling through. Wormwood here is helping to strike the chypre accord. This is a modern take on the tea-rose, and there are some similarities to modern roses like Chloe EDP Chloe, Tabu Rose Dana & Delina Parfums de Marly (although this doesn't have the tropical & rhubarb facets). As it's drying down it gets sweeter with tea & sandalwood that read like tea with honey. There's also a shampoo vibe in the background. This is similar to Body EDP & Body EDT, but a bit more pink with rose slightly more forward than the EDT, and less peach than the EDP. Michel Almairac also composed Chloe EDP Chloe and you can catch the similarities. I just have a sample miniature, but this is full bottle worthy although it can be hard to find. It's a love for me.

Body Tender Burberry,"It’s a mid-morning walk in an English garden in London, it’s sunny and fresh, you grabbed a Granny Smith before leaving in case you get hungry before lunch, and while you bit into it, the juice is running through your arm…
Suddenly a little wind is blowing and the garden-fresh smell of wormwood envelops you.

You lick your arm and keep walking. You notice a stand with fresh fruits for sale, you seemed hungry anyways so grabbed a few peaches and lemons for tea time later.
As you keep strolling around the park, you turn into an alley with dewy roses and jasmines…

Later that night, you remove your cashmere sweater after noticing some apple’s juice stains ruined it a little, and give it a sniff and smell hints of the dewy wormwood and flowers on it…

Body Tender Burberry,"This reminds me a lot of Loveswept. It’s kinda breezy sweet like that but there’s a kick to it from the wormwood that keeps your interest. Where Loveswept is a more tropical wind this one carries more of a tart apple/young rose air. It’s a bit “berry shampoo-ish” for my liking and I kinda almost put it in the same category as SP’s Lovely: but I don’t think it gets anywhere near as screechy as I find Lovely.
It’s really nice- just not for me. But everything about the way it is done is really beautiful.
It’s definitely a high soprano= a very tight pink rose, the apple is tart and sweet.
Definitely great if you like shampoo scents; that’s not entirely my favorite genre & I didn’t catch enough of the base notes for it to be one I’d consider keeping- but if you’re into shampoo scents this one does it really well!",06/18/22 12:45,ShaLion
Body Tender Burberry,"Too sour for my liking :(. I really wanted to love this as I like the original Burberry Body but that is too much for everyday use. I was hoping this flanker to be a lighter/rosy version of the original but sadly it is loud/sour and stays that way for a long time.

The only saving grace is its dry down, lovely vanilla/musk smell but after a long time (6-8 hours at least) and that too is a faint skin scent. Unusable, at-least for me, I am afraid",06/10/22 05:51,hanimani

Body Tender Burberry,"Just for the sake of comparing Burberry Body to Burberry Body Tender, I think it is important to look at the differences in the two because they are similar in some ways, but different in other ways.

Burberry Body has the bright, sharp green bubble gum type notes which have a super upbeat type vibe. This is great when you are needing your perfume to project energy and enthusiasm -- this is almost like a jolt of caffeine, something to give you a jump start to your day, refreshing, vibrant, up-lifting. As Burberry Body wears on the skin, it moves into a really nice relaxing type dry down.

The ingredients are slightly different in Burberry Body - and Burberry Body Tender...
Here are their shared ingredients which give the perfumes a common DNA smell:
Wormwood
Peach
Rose
Sandalwood
Musk
Cashmere Wood
Amber
Vanilla

Burberry Body has the two notes Freezia and Iris added.
Burberry Body Tender has the notes of Apple, Lemon, Tea, Jasmine added.

Burberry Body Tender goes on very similar to how Burberry Body smells during its dry-down phase... when it relaxes more. Before realizing that they really do have different ingredients that make them smell unique, I would have assumed that they both carry the same basic Burberry Body DNA - and only differ slightly. But trying them on side by side, they both have unique smells which make them their own.

There are times when you want a more calm, relaxing, low-key type perfume which is more of a sensual perfume. Burberry Body Tender is like Burberry Body with a glass of merlot wine, something that just takes the edge off. This is more romantic -- and yes, I think they chose the right word to express this... this is More TENDER. The only differences in the two bottles is the lettering of ""Tender"" to identify that beyond the original.

Burberry Body and Burberry Body Tender share the same chord with similar notes, but the expression of mood is different. If you like one, most probably - you'll like the other. Burberry Body's silage and projection are about double of that of Tender, it has brighter notes that make up the chord. If Burberry Body calls attention to itself, Burberry Body Tender is a bit more shy, reserved, soft spoken - and whispers rather than shouts.

Burberry Body Tender is like the soft focus watercolor or Monet painting type perfume, no harsh edges... Burberry Body Tender would be a good perfume to wear for nights watching Netflix on the couch with your significant other, a date night, or even to spritz before going to bed... you will probably even have more romantic dreams with this.

Actually Burberry Body Tender would be a great signature perfume for the right woman.
Both Burberry Body and Burberry Body Tender could be a signature perfume - using each perfume to reflect the mood that you are in at the time you spritz them.

Burberry Body Tender is in the same type perfume genre as Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely (the original) and Avon's Prima.",03/25/22 09:38,correspondencepersonal
Body Tender Burberry,"For any Canadians interested in this I just purchased it from Shoppers Drug Mart for $19.99 on their discounted perfume endcap display!
I have the original which I used to enjoy as it reminded me of a vacation in a bottle minus the bad sunscreen smell. My original bottle is maybe 10 years old and smelling less than fresh so I thought I would give this version a go. The beginning few minutes smelled similar but maybe more wormwood? I am no expert but in the notes that is one of the first listed that I don’t know the smell of. It’s now been 30 minutes and it is reminding me more of the original. I only sprayed my wrists that usually devour perfume as I was already wearing Poison Girl and had no desire to mix the two! Overall I’m very pleased with my bargain and may update my review once I have worn it for a day.

Doesn't make me think of the original Body except for the shared artemisia note, but here it is lighter. This reminds me more of Karl Lagerfeld for her than the original Body. Unlike either KL or Body, this has a generic smell, maybe because this fruity floral genre has been so overdone already, or cheaper quality ingredients used?

Body Tender Burberry,"I have never come across Burberry Body Tendre until today and it was a good price and its such a pretty bottle, I decided to take a chance on a blind buy.

I was already wearing Pleats Please L'eau and Tendre seemed to be very similar and since Im interested in a nice rose atm, it seemed to be a good choice.

I've since doused myself in BB Tendre and its a very very earthy rose -(compared to my much loved Pleats Please which is airy and watery).

Im enjoying the difference very much. Tendre smells like walking in a real garden with the aroma of rose flower, stem, leaves and earth mixed together after a light rain. Quite heavy but the actual edt strength stops it from being heavy.

I like it. Glad to have it but my 65ml will be my only bottle. Out of the 2 mentioned fragrances the Pleats has quickly become a staple so I'll focus on purchasing more of this one as the airey rose is more uplifting for me.

I'll look forward though to wearing Tendre in different seasons as Ive got a feeling weather will bring out the rose or the earthy element differently ♡♡♡",11/02/21 03:49,Eternity Girl

But if you are looking for something inoffensive, work appropriate, modest, this will work nicely. Works for any age and would probably make a nice gift. As others have mentioned, it suffers from very poor projection and lasting power. I do like the scent quite a bit, but I'll be trying some other rose fragrances before committing to a bottle of this.",07/22/21 06:24,clairesque
Body Tender Burberry,"Although I like the original Body, I find that it can be overwhelming at times, a problem that I never encounter with this one as it’s less floral and a lot more green and sparkly. A squeaky clean and uplifting scent that becomes sweeter with time, I know I’ll be wearing it daily as the weather gets warmer.",04/26/21 16:05,Volatile
Body Tender Burberry,"this is very nice scent for spring. fresh, light, not sweet and just with a little frop of bitterness. i have tried all other from Burbery Body series and sandly no other worked for me, but this one is just right. i do smell the original dnr, but it is only slightly here and this one is different enough from others, which is a good thing for me. others were too bitter from wormwood and had to much rose for my taste, they were also too strong and too long lasting. i like my perfumes light and subtle and this one is just perfect. i like that bitterness which is just enough to balance the pink freshness and it makes it interesting for me.
this is the scent for light scent lovers.",04/17/21 11:58,Mirabele
Body Tender Burberry,"Up to all the fragrances i have ever known to this day, this one is the best shampoo-ish scent ever. It is the clean hair scent that fleets around you all day.

Body Tender Burberry,"Very fruity yet fleeting. The opening is a lovely fresh apple and peach. The drydown becomes slightly more spicy and warm with a little bit of amber and vanilla coming through (but not much). I love the apple-y opening but the drydown is somewhat generic and not particularly engaging or interesting to me.

It is however a very light fragrance and I have to put two spritzes on the same spot for the scent to actually be there. The sillage is very low to almost zero. It becomes a skin scent almost immediately for me. However, after having done my double spritz on each place where I spray my perfume, it does stay on my skin for a very long time. I put it on my wrists at 5 pm and could still smell it if I put my nose on my wrist the next morning.

Won't be purchasing because of the low sillage and because the scent doesn't interest me that much. But could be a good perfume for in a work environment if you're looking for something light and a little bit sweet that is inoffensive, that'll be pretty universally liked and that won't invade other people's noses with its' sillage",01/01/21 05:11,Mystery Elixir
Body Tender Burberry,"Just wanted to let people here know that there are fakes of this out there.

The review I left was for a good little decant I had, which made me go out and search for a full bottle as soon as I ran out. I found a really good deal from a private seller who claimed that it was an ""unfitting gift"" from her husband and she was selling a full, unopened, packaged bottle of this for a third of the usual price. I went ahead and bought it.

The packaging seemed good enough, but when I actually got the bottle out of it it immediately looked suspicious. The cap doesn't fit nicely on the bottle, and the sprayer itself is very cheap looking. The sprayer is actually very different to the real sprayer that's supposed to be there (like it's not even the same kind of sprayer), and when you spray it leaks everywhere and sprays big drops of perfume instead of a nice fine mist. The print on the bottle looks off and peeling. All in all the bottle totally looks like some cheap alternative.

The weird thing is that it actually smells identical to the original scent, so I'm not sure what's going on, but the longevity and projection seem to be much worse. I don't know what to make of this, but I'm probably going to use up the huge fake I got, since it at least smells the same, even if it's much weaker. Next time I'll be more careful.",09/04/20 09:40,AlexandraTroush
Body Tender Burberry,"The 3 fellow reviewers below have well summarized the clean and fresh nature of this fragrance.

I was looking desperately for a clean, rose and citrus based scent for office use and hot summer commuting. Nothing over the top, or decadent. Something that will not be distracting. This was definately it! Its slightly sharp and cold at first, so beware, but it develops into a lovely fresh green tea, rose and a crisp green apple. The lemon is cool and inviting.

Perfect for spring/summer weather. I particulalry enjoy that it doesnt have crazy projection and can stay discreet as the day wears on. I can choose to reapply with a second round of spritizing middday to waken up the senses or just let it hang out as a skin scent until end of day.",07/28/20 15:20,Dr.Myles
Body Tender Burberry,"This is very, very pleasant!

I liked Body but felt that it was a bit too heavy for me, slightly suffocating. This, instead, is light and cheerful. This will be my go-to this summer.

Creamy, syrupy, but also fresh and light. An unchallenging day scent that will fit any occasion. Very versatile and classy. ""Gets the job done"".",07/25/20 11:22,AlexandraTroush
Body Tender Burberry,"I fell in love with this treasure some years ago, decided to buy it ""one day"" and then it disappeared from the shelves. I think it's discontinued. it took me awhile to find it, but I did, even with very reasonable price.
Now I have it! Body tender is such a perfect combination of heavenly notes that play in harmony together, producing a crispy fresh, feminine scent. So beautiful.
It's very versatile, fits every situation, time, and place.
I am so happy to finally have a 60 ml bottle of this.

Body Tender Burberry,"To me this is a lightweight, clean, floral and very `lady-like` scent. It is not unpleasent at all, but not my style. My mother will love it, I am sure.

I much prefer Body Intense, but this is quite different. It is a `private`, deeper and a little `darker` peach scent. Much more to my taste.

Maybe not the most practical bottle, but heavy, special and classy.",06/15/20 09:55,Duft Liebe
Body Tender Burberry,"This is really beautiful in the first 10 minutes. Very fresh, very spring-time, very youthful and vibrant. Then after that dissipates it really soaks into the skin, the rose comes out and it's essentially a light, powdery ""skin scent"" for me. Low projection, short longevity on my skin which I am assuming just simply devoured this poor fragrance. Overall forgettable. But the first 10 minutes... something really special about that. 5/10",05/26/20 06:50,bintTapputi

Body Tender Burberry,"A fresh dewy morning rose.
Light pink, tender, green and refreshing. Think of a countryside, the rising sun, think about water drops from the rain of the night. You are walking barefoot, the water is a little cold, but it doesn't bother you. You are going to the garden of luscious red roses. There they are! Look at those thick crimson petals, and what a delicate aroma! Burberry Body Tender.",04/09/20 15:41,bel.gravia
Body Tender Burberry,"This is really lovely, and I didn't believe it would be.

At first the topnotes are a little Light Blue-ish...which isn't bad necessarily, but a little common. They do settle after about a minute though, and it's like 'Ahhh...I could sit with this on, and some sparkling water."" I like the crisp apple with lemon and the wood. It's very, very refreshing.

It doesn't have nuclear sillage or longevity, but it's a bit beyond a skin scent, more of a hugging scent. It lingers for around 7 or 8 hours. It rises off your shirt and skin and makes for a very pleasant scent for personal enjoyment. It's uplifting.

""Feminine"" is right! Sometimes green notes leap out of frags and seem masculine or unisex, but the green tea with rose is so beautifully lady like, and it hangs around in a pretty musky way. It has NO vanilla (thank God, I'm so bored with vanilla everywhere), and no real amber? It just settles into a gardeny musk.

I rated this as spring, but it could be worn easily in summer as well. It's the dead of winter here and I'm enjoying it, and it does actually perform in cold air; although I suspect it'll be much better in semi-warmth.",01/15/20 19:50,ShadowsofLight

Body Tender Burberry,"Pleasant, clean and fresh daily-wear scent. I get rose more than apple. It's light and inoffensive. Sillage and longevity are okay but you do have to reapply to wear it all day. Very nice though. Not the same as the original Body which I now have as well, but an immediate family member. If you like one, you'll like the other.",08/30/19 06:51,mevans
Body Tender Burberry,"I feel like a fairy frolicking in the countryside whenever I wear this.
I mostly used to smell the apple in it last summer, not sure what happened but I get more of the bitter greenness and rose now.
Makes me think of that weird meadow scene in Twilight.... uh.
Anyway, it's ethereal.
Very light and fresh and... raindrops on rose petals kind of juice.
I like it very much, it does smell quite ""girly"" but it's not too sweet at all.
You know any of those lesbians with pastel pink hair who love hiking with their girlfriend? That's who this reminds me of.
I can imagine some overlap in people who love D&G L'Imperatrice and this one.
You know what else this makes me think of? Silk paper.
The original Body isn't my thing, I've come to think I can't hold my peach very well, but this is a very nice, fresh break from my heavier favourites.",08/10/19 02:55,hexed
Body Tender Burberry,"Thanks to a special fragrance pal sending me a little spray decant of this, I have been able to test it. What a lovely scent! It's a fresh and fruity musky scent. Very clean, but it's a bit more playful than a typical musky or soapy clean scent. The apple and lemon along with the rose, really make this one for me.

I'd say it's first a musky scent, meaning that the musk really is the center of the scent, holding everything else together. The rose is there for a bit of depth and refinement. But the lemon burst tells you it's meant for warm days, and once the lemon fades, the apple keeps it fresh and fruity, with some added sweetness.

As it develops, it sits just on the edge of ""sour"" with the apple+lemon+rose combo. Perhaps we shall call it ""tart."" That is what will make it last in hot weather, but it might also cause it to be a bit overwhelming if sprayed more than a couple of times . . . An easy thing to do since it's fresh and light at the start.

Very very charming. I shall keep this in mind as I seek my ideal summery musk.",07/03/19 06:48,ptilda

I think this fragrance has the perfect balance of fruit, floral, and wood tied together with greenness from the tea. I like rose, and it really shines in Tender. Simply lovely. The Body line by Burberry altogether hasn't disappointed me as of yet, from the beautiful solid crystal-like body of their bottles, to the sweet feminine juices inside. Longevity can be better, but Burberry also makes Body Milk for layering, which aids in silage as well. It comes in that same tall, slender bottle too, which BTW is the perfect shape to hold & spritz easily. Love, and will be buying again.",01/04/19 16:20,pamelalasalle110
Body Tender Burberry,"This is so pretty! I like the whole Burberry body range but this is my favourite of the line. It's got a little extra floral component to it whereas the others are a Little more musky. This lasts so well on me considering it's an edt... I have perfume eating skin, and even the original does not last as long as this on me so I'm pretty impressed with the quality. Lovely perfume and will definitely keep it in my collection.

Body Tender Burberry,"I have been looking for a spring/summer fragrance for this year and in my imagination I was wearing something fresh, slightly green with a touch of floral something that conjures up images of floaty dress and picnic in the meadows.... And I found Burberry body tender...
Whilst it is fresh with the lemon and apple combo in the opening, the green and woody wormwood totally takes over with barely any roses at least on my skin. Yes it has an element of freshness but it is also aromatic and therefore for me it lacks the romance that I was expecting with a name like tender because to me it's not tender but more like smart-casual day time events. However I still bought it because it is a fragrance that is useful to have for all my semi formal events",04/23/18 12:04,Ladybedwell

Body Tender Burberry,"The original Body is in my signature spot because it is so versatile and I wear it to work almost every day. And, also, I really like it. Body Tender is...okay. I agree with all the “fresh, clean” reviews and I can certainly smell the apple. I think, if the original was not your cup of tea, you would really like this. It’s not bad, at all, just not really my style.

UPDATE: So, now that I’ve been wearing it for a while, the nuances of this scent are becoming clear. I still prefer the original but I like this one quite a bit now. I think it is certainly appropriate for the hotter days of the year and office friendly. Also, it does smell nice.",11/09/17 10:32,Nuitdenoel
Body Tender Burberry,"Horrible. I couldn't quite put my finger on the familiarity of it at first. It was smelling spicy green grass. But the more I smelled it the more it reminded me of something. Then AH-HA...WORMWOOD! That's what that peppery bitterness was!!!

Let me say, I actually don't mind the grass smells usually. There have been several through the years, and it just smelled like awesome summer to me. But the wormwood just yucks it up. It didn't smell good on anyone who tried it when it came in....",11/01/17 20:39,Floffles

There is an irresistible blend of rose, apple and lemon that creates a crisp, yet rosy and elegant scent. I am impressed by the rich nuances of many notes that play beautifully together.
This is like the spring/summer sister of Body, which I don't like nearly as much as Body Tender.
Opening notes and dry down both lovely, and in harmony with each other.",08/13/17 03:55,sarage

Body Tender Burberry,"This one I choose to wear when I fancy lifting my mood on darker days (weather-wise as well as mood-wise).
I adore the cool, fresh rose and wormwood as well as the modest amount of green apple that thankfully does not overpower; they are immediate mood-lifters for me. I also get pleasant tea. The jasmine is very smooth and realistic nestled in creamy sandalwood. At the drydown, smooth amber emerges with soft, sweet, discreet vanilla and slightly sharp musk.
I thought it would be good for spring-summer, but actually I feel it performs much better in cool weather.
It also lasts all day for me and its sillage is quite heavy, but in a good sense - its span scents the whole area where I sit in my office but everyone loves it and comments on how wonderful it smells.
For all the love I have for Body Tender, I think its uniqueness calls for a test first.",03/10/17 01:02,artemis16

Body Tender Burberry,"Not sophisticated, it's like a mash of synthetic notes. And yet, they form an agreeable scent, warm yet subtle. Enticing and demure.
This is not a fragrance that slowly unravels, opening layer by layer. No. Body Tender presents itself all at once, what you get at first is basically how it ends, with less fruits and more woods.
As I said before, it doesn't scream sophistication, but it's a comfortable perfume to wear, slightly sexy and playful.
Even though it's not a memorable scent, I like it.",11/25/16 21:08,esteban747
Body Tender Burberry,"This isn't the type of fragrance I typically wear, but it has really grown on me. It was a blind buy for about $30 at Marshall's back in the Spring. It's very tart, I get a lot of apple and lemon, with rose, light musk, and I guess wormwood (not overly familiar with that note) rounding it out. This scent strikes me as young, feminine, casual, and carefree. I like it for the office in warm weather or just a casual daytime scent. I sprayed it on 8 hours ago and it's still on my skin, although wearing very close now.",10/19/16 13:16,molly44
Body Tender Burberry,"A big NO for me. The fragrance is dominated by three notes: rose, lemon and warmwood. As a result you get a bitter citrusy rosy scent, which is neither sexy nor elegant. Could be good for summer for those who like fresh and sharp rosy fragrances. But what's tender about it?",09/29/16 20:02,dyaver
Body Tender Burberry,"While I enjoy this one, I agree with others regarding the screeeechy notes. I think it's the rose. I am a fan of rose fragrances but you also have to consider the folks in the audience when wearing a fragrance. This is two steps above Bath & Body W sprays but I'd lightly apply this one. And it also wouldn't wear well in a conservative environment. Enjoy it on casual days at work. Great for Church and other weekend outings during the spring and summer. B.B.T is perfect for a summer wedding because it has very clean floral and lighter fruit top notes (not too sweet). It is well blended so ladies of all ages can wear it well...IF LIGHTLY APPLIED. I prefer Burberry Body over this one because it's more flexible and classic (work/church). Other fragrance suggestions for a more subdued sweet/foral include: Omnia Crystalline, Play for her (Givenchy), Nude (Rhianna), Chance Eau Tendre (Chanel).",09/07/16 11:18,AngelEuphoria

Tender is refreshing and feels like a woodland walk after a long cold winter. Bottle is so beautiful and very affordable.",08/04/16 01:22,HillTop
Body Tender Burberry,"A floral twist to burberry body. However they project differently and the tender one is very floral and body is very woody and musky. My friend said body tender smells like scented tampon at a distance which makes me feel bad. But up close it has more character.

Body Tender Burberry,"This fragrance is so simple and yet captivating!

To me it smells like a summer meadow scent with bitter herbs growing there and tons of small creamy roses. In the drydown it gets warmer due to cashmere accord and white musk.
It's fresh, crisp and floral so it's perfect for hot summer days. Such a happy fragrance!

There is a curtain resemblance with the original Body but on my skin the original dries down into a baking sweet vanilla, whereas the Tender version in the base is a cashmere accord with some transparent rose scent.
Burberry Body Tender is my favorite from the Body range",06/25/16 23:48,Kolchan
Body Tender Burberry,"I blind bought this one despite of having Burberry Body for a really long time. If I have sniffed it before buying, I wouldn't buy this. It is not a bad fragrant, BUT its too similar to Burberry Body on my skin. It does have a slight floral scent to it, but just a touch. If I want to go that road I could just spray the Burberry Body and wait for it to dry and layer it with some sheer floral scent. It'd practically be Body Tender lol
I'd keep using this one, of course. Its already here anyway. But just a heads up for anyone who want to blind buy this when you already have the original Body, you don't really need to. But if you have neither and you wanna get one, I'd suggest going with Body Tender because it has a slight of different scent to it and makes it cuter than the original Body.",06/21/16 22:25,zuleikarega

Body Tender Burberry,"I agree with the reviewer who said this smells like Éclat d'Arpège by Lanvin. I did a side by side comparison. Aside from smelling a little bit more rose in the beginning with Body Tendre (Éclat d'Arpège has peony) and Éclat d'Arpège is stronger (edp) while Body Tendre is an edt, there isn't much difference except for maybe the price. Even then, if you know how to shop for them, you can get them at good prices. Both are rather soapy fresh smelling that is great for a hot sunny day.

Edit: I put Éclat d'Arpège in the perfumes this reminds me of above but it keeps being removed. The notes may not look the same between this and Éclat d'Arpége, but perfumers can mix notes to create an olfactory illusion of another note that may be expensive and out of budget. It's like mixing paints to create a certain color. Just FYI.",04/10/16 11:43,ChelleBelle84
Body Tender Burberry,"I normally don't really enjoy rose perfumes, but I made a blind buy based on the reviews here. This is absolutely beautiful!

It's true it's a bit a sharp (and sweet), and can cause headaches especially if overdone. However as I grow older, I actually find this scent progressing drier and more powdery on my skin.

Burberry Body Tender is the epitome of a fresh scent for the working, neat, serious business women. Despite I combine it with my pants, I believe it's a very polished kind of scent reflecting a modern classic style. Actually most recent releases from Burberry (since the last 5 years or so) reflect the same attitude. It's true they are a bit boring, but I like it just as I like nude nail polish.

Body Tender Burberry,"A blind buy success! I have been on the hunt for a fresh, clean, classy and different fragrance for summer and I think my search is over! I can see myself wearing this daily, it's so beautiful. I have tried the original Body and liked it but there was something in the middle notes or drydown that didn't sit quite right on my skin. When I bought this unsniffed, I hoped that it would similar to Body but fresher and indeed it is. It starts with a tart and zingy opening of citrus, apples and green tea leaves then comes a slightly warmer mingling of soft rose, creamy peach and musk. Reminds me of expensive smelling soap in the best possible way. It is exactly what I was after for summer. I get lovely clouds of this goodness floating up to greet me every now and then.

I could say that Body Tender is like daily version of Rose gold.
I like them both very much and really enjoy wearing them.",10/18/15 09:48,mirisfrik

Body Tender Burberry,"I don't know what happened, but I went from absolutely loving this to completely hating it! It actually makes me nauseous at this point. It must be the rose note that overpowers this fragrance and has turned me off to it because anytime I read that rose is in a scent I usually run in the opposite direction. Until about 2 weeks into it, I was wearing this scent daily. It's really such a crazy thing because there was nothing going on that would have caused me to associate anything negative to it, but for some reason I just came to hate it.",10/04/15 15:17,softwater
Body Tender Burberry,"This is such a subtle, beautiful floral fragrance. I could wear this perfume every single day. It's aroma is so light and feminine. It smells so sophisticated and classy- you could wear it any day of the year and smell simply beautiful. When I'm wearing it I keep wanting to go back and smell my wrists...it is that lovely. To me this fragrance is what subtle-sexy is... I just purchased it and I'm already planning the days of the week that I'm going to be wearing this. This is very easily one of the best fragrances in my collection.",09/11/15 18:12,TLight
Body Tender Burberry,"I first thought, ""This smells like a million other florals"". I like florals so I didn't mind. I wore it again and it was magic. The only other non-family scent I can compare this with is Infusion d'Iris. It has no iris. Still, it's so very similar and light but, persistent! I'm loving Burberry everything so far! To me, their scents are remarkably unique. Often I try the offspring of a scent and it seems to be no more related than any other scent out there. Burberry Body and this are definitely from the same family. Tender is so lovely. This is just a sheer veil of fragrance. It's so frail...just the finest mist of delightful air. A more beautiful wedding scent can't be found as far as I'm concerned. Way to go Burberry!",09/04/15 05:42,Fragaria

Body Tender Burberry,"I kind of like this scent, but I'm not very crazy about it... The notes sound like they will smell great, but this just reminds me a high school. If I were 14 again, this would probably smell a lot better... It's a bit too strong and harsh at first, and after the rose and fruit die down it just ends up smelling like fresh, sweet nothing...
I only wear this perfume around the house.",05/01/15 23:39,Emzarie
Body Tender Burberry,"Anytime I see ""rose"" listed in the notes, I turn the other way! I typically wouldn't even bother with testing! This came in a fragrance sampler so I thought, I should at least try it! Knowing full well I would hate it, or at least that's what I THOUGHT! To my surprise it's actually really nice! It's fresh, soft, inviting and sexy! It wasn't the perfume I chose out of the samples for the full size redemption certificate, but if I found it for a good price I would buy it!",02/13/15 17:03,Dort0625
Body Tender Burberry,"I prefer the original Body as this one is too fresh and crispy to me. And after an hour it turns a little bitter on my skin. It's not a bad frag at all, but I think other flankers from Body line are much more intriguing. But if you're looking for something fresh, then go ahead with Body Tender.",02/08/15 09:38,lirael00
Body Tender Burberry,"Oh my love! I hate you but I want you so much BBT. I am a medical student and my brother compliment me with: "" You smell like hospital. "" Then, I said inside me that this perfume is a big NO. I gave it a lot of chances while visiting Malls. Again and again because it's so different and I hate classic perfumes. It's fresh with citrus and chypre notes, then it becomes a bit woody/lightly musky with a really good natural rose hint. Finally, (that's what I love) it becomes bitter like a cup of jasmine-tea. It's bitter-fresh, shy but it hits you when you don't wait and your nose want it! Some will hate it and I don't agree with those said it's similar to BB EDP. I want to try it in summery days to be 100% sure that this is a love.
9/10 because it's unique! Clap-clap Burberry.",01/30/15 17:22,Kon-nos91

Body Tender Burberry,"The absinthe note is overpowering. I know it's supposed to be fresher than the others, but I don't think it is. I agree with someone who said it is green, but not fresh. It's cold,sharp and unpleasant. I tried it twice and in both times I had to scrub it off because it gave me a headache. Funny, considering that I have and love both the edt and intense versions.",01/01/15 06:04,epg
Body Tender Burberry,"This is really nice. I get a lot of orange out of this, but it's a well balanced fruit smell that isn't too tart. The deeper elements of musk, sandalwood and amber are just right to give a nice sensuality to it. I detest strong sandalwood and musk, but in this perfume I think they've done this so well to keep it fruity and fresh but still have that depth, which makes it more mature than most fruity fragrances, and less sickly sweet, which is a definite bonus for a perfume that lingers for more than hour.",12/12/14 01:47,Allary
Body Tender Burberry,"I got a mini of this from Sephora, and the little rubber stopper piece came unglued from the cap, so I've been trying to use it up in fear that the packaging might leak. I'm about halfway through, and my conclusion is that Body Tender is a pleasant fruity rose. It's light, fresh, and inoffensive. It's a good choice for the office, if you don't mind reapplying throughout the day. It only lasts 2-3 hours on me.

What keeps it from smelling like a hundred other light, fresh, and clean fragrances out there is the wormwood/absinthe note. The bitterness together with the rose is what keeps bringing my nose to my wrist.

It's a like, but it could be a love with better packaging and some longevity.",08/05/14 18:50,dorseyhorsey
Body Tender Burberry,"Almost identical to the original edp, just lighter and a little bit soapier at the dry-down. My favorite from the Body family/flankers.",07/14/14 14:46,dina
Body Tender Burberry,"This one is a fresh, cool rose with powdered petals.
Super feminine, yet it has some bitter bite to it that gives this scent a character.
It is clean and lasting, very versatile occasion wise, although almost too feminine for me (I like more 'ambiguous' perfumes).
I'm debating with myself whether I need to own it.",06/04/14 07:32,PastelMoon
Body Tender Burberry,"For the first time in the history of the Universe, I appreciate a perfume with rose in it. Well played, Burberry.
I find the smell of roses usually artificial, but here it feels like fresh roses in bloom straight from the garden squeezed in a bottle, pretty amazing. The first time I sprayed on me, I hated the bitterness, didn't even wait to settle down and scrubbed it off, like, ew!!
After months I decided to give it another try coz I remember it was musky after washing and I wanted to wake up to that, I'm a sucker for musk, so sprayed and went to bed with a book. The bitterness became less bitter, the rose softer, I got wafts of tea and lemon, which I love and started feeling cozy and happy, that's right, happy. And it was all about the fragrance coz I don't have any memory attached to it (and the book wasn't happy, quite the opposite).
Next day I went to work wearing the perfume again and spent all day trying to catch wafts and playing 'guess the notes'. After 6 hours, I got vanilla, something sweet that wasn't vanilla, maybe amber, and the musk started to show his delicious smile. All that without losing the bitterness completely, but it was quite pleasant, all the first notes softly playing hide & seek.
Now I'm in love and I call it my grown-up-but-not-very-mature fragrance.

Update:

""Day 7. I'm still wearing it. 2 days ago I finally got the apple note, it was like the actual fruit chopped, with a hint of jasmine, that's why it was so hard to spot. Not apple candy or tart as I expected. This journey doesn't cease to amaze me. Is it safe? Yes. Is it boring? Never! I wonder if I'll ever come back.
If I don't...
Tell my bank account... tell it... to forgive me.""",05/23/14 18:14,HCMS
Body Tender Burberry,"The first impression I got was that it smelled like something from Clinique. It started out cool, with the freshness of the apple. Two minutes later it died into a mix of rose and wormwood that sat close to my skin and yet at the same time had an unpleasant sharpness--if it were any stronger I'd probably get a headache. Not tender at all.",04/14/14 23:07,kokiri64
Body Tender Burberry,"This is more citrusy and juicy than the original Body, Intense version and gold version. Also it's powdery, but not that much as the others are. It's the most suitable ""Body"" for people who like fresh fragrances.
It's nice and wearable, but I would choose other ""Bodies"" over this one.",03/28/14 06:35,ScarlettX
Body Tender Burberry,"This has truly surprised me !
Left the idea of finding the right burberry long ago and the first edition of burberry Body was no exception. Didn't make a statement of something new and I gave up the idea of finding a skin scent for casuel wear that wasn't to sweet , too fresh , too weak or strong.
Then I gave this a chance when I saw there was a pink body by burberry ?
After some paper spraying I today tried it on my body for the first time.
A little bit of everything without beeing boring - how come ?
Maybe it's the bitterness from the absinthe/wormwood that keeps it from ending up in the too casual waste basket.
At least to me...
The rose in this blend is creamy slightly sweet and has a little buttery tone.
The wooden , musky drydown is gorgeous !
Probably discontinued soon - just because I recently found it...
Happends all the time - sigh !

Update- while wearing this shy beauty I sensed a kind of cinnamon whif around me and was surprised it was me - wearing body tender. It was after about two hours wear and in fact it was the very true rose deep warm rose smell I picked up !! Very nice scent !",03/11/14 08:53,evacecilias
Body Tender Burberry,"On my skin it is bitter citrus. Not surprising, cause I know for a long time that my skin chemistry does not work well with scents including any bitter notes.
I can smell only lemon & tea...",02/16/14 07:27,Arlene-Beatrix
Body Tender Burberry,"Despite what people are saying about how boring this is, I personally always have room for a ""safe"" scent on my vanity. Work, family gatherings, first-time meet ups, whatever the occasion.

Not only do I have an appreciation for this as a safe scent, but I do find it to be quite beautiful. Warm, but clean.. soft and textured. Not linear, in my opinion.. stays crisp throughout the dry down on my skin, and pretty decent longevity for an edt.

Update: Just bought this after scraping by on the generous sample I was given, could not go without it! Was also watching an interesting review of the Burberry 'Body' and its noted similarity to Lancome's 'Tresor' and ah-ha! There it is, the peachy rose reason I immediately just fell in love with this fragrance.

My aunts wore Tresor for majority of my formative years, and it was just cozy, sweet, and endearing to me. What I find in BT is a bit of an added edge with the wormwood and tea.. updated and fresh nostalgia to my nose! Feels sophisticated but still naive.. I can definitely see myself purchasing this for years to come. Yay!",01/30/14 23:39,lesgalaxies

Body Tender Burberry,"This is a very pretty fragrance. I did not care for the original Burberry Body or the rose gold edition, but this one is different.

Never had such a drastic change in scent from paper to skin before.",09/16/13 12:19,castellot

Body Tender Burberry,"Until today I thought that I had smelled all the perfumes in the Body collection. I've considered the collection too mature for me but that I would buy a bottle one day, I think it's because of the rose-notes. Weird thought though, that I would like the smell of roses better when I get older...

Anyhow at the airport I smelled all of them including Body tender and thought ""Hey why not give it a try, it doesn't smell that bad"". You feel the absinth (I couldn't come up with what it smelled like there and then)in the beginning and it feels fresh (I'm a citrus-person)and sweet but not to much. It still feels mature but not too mature. It really suited my skin well like it was made for me (it didn't smell that good on a paper), that rarely happens. I didn't find any note that annoyed me through the day, I barely noticed the rose note which is a good thing.

I might buy this but I want to try this on my skin 2-3 times just to be sure :)",07/21/13 16:25,sarahdelicious

you are struck and hypnotised by her beauty and tenderness.
Body tender,
apple and lemon well-blended with rose,

it is tender and soft,
less fruitier than the original,
fresher but not in a shampoo-ey way,

Body Tender Burberry,"This perfume has been my new must have !!!! The best I could find in this style of cool refreshing, awakens the senses!!!!!! I like most of the other body because it is the most fresh citrus !!!!! The reason is the perfect combination of peach fruit Apple, fortunately the tea and thank God lemon which is what l ask desperately for summer!!! All of these have the PERFECT combination with jasmine and rose ...rose is very dominant at last!!!!! Wood notes not soo dominant ,give a perfect touch to have a good longlasting power !!!! The best note for the end ....the Absinthe ...that's what makes it special!!!! I have been looking for fragrances with Absinthe but this one to my nose is very good !!!! this fresh summer combination of notes comes to create a bomb of freshness ... creates pleasant illusions, makes me travelling in a flower garden in the morning after it has stopped raining .Love ...Love .....Love ....",05/28/13 00:48,elda white petals

Body Tender Burberry,"Young girl who;s walking on a pedestrian precinct towards evening. All around are cafés with people who;re talking, the music is playing. The girl goes through and leaves a trail of this scent and all men and even women stop talking and start looking at her. The spring wind blows in her hair and every man here wants to get in her nearness but she isn;t any cheap girl, she has a personality. She continues with her graceful walk and in the end of the pedestrian she turns around and send a kiss in the air and blink with her eye to all around. And than disappers in the dark. She;s independent, confident, everyone wants to get closer to her but she can resist, she;s still ""clean"" like this scent. She can be playful but she knows the limits. She knows what she wants and know what does it mean to be classy and elegant yet still young. She;s the ONE.
Haha that was my imagination but honestly this is such an amazing scent (after a long time). I sprayed it and immediately thought on a luxury soap. It;s very very nice, light, clean, slightly creamy but not that warm, more like some rose creaminess and the rose is kind of icy. I can smell the apple and some herbal touch which is probably the wormwood. It;s young but sophisticated and classy, no cheap water. Like a girl in a trenchcoat. It;s like a rosy soap with hints of apple and unripe peach, slightly bitter too. It leaves the trail behind you so it;s not extremely light. It stays very long on a skin and I appreciate it. The bottle is pretty also. Worth every penny. My new love. Thank you Burberry! :-)",04/17/13 14:26,mils
Body Tender Burberry,"This is a fresher and more delicate version of the original. It is fruity and fresh, but not sharp as other citrus scents can be. The heart consists of gentle floral scents, delicate and very pretty. English rose, tea leaves and jasmine combination is powdery soft and very feminine. This is really a soft scent, it makes me think of crisp sheets, babies, puppies, cashmere sweaters and silk dresses. The apple makes the scent clean and crisp while allowing the other ingredients for the softness, a fantastic combination. Honestly, this is a delicious and sensual fragrance and I can consider it as an ultimate comfort scent. It is extremely good, enjoyable and pleasant to wear! Fans of Burberry Body should definitely have to try this, you'll be hooked like me!",04/10/13 06:37,mjb28
Body Tender Burberry,"This is very nice, I got to sample it and I must say it smells nice, a bit complex, refined also, and it changes fast from one note to the next, I admit I was pleasantly surprised, I can say that Almairac put some talent in that one contrary to the other versions which just didnt do much for me. There is a note that smells so good, I wonder maybe the tea mixed with the absinthe, whatever it is, the notes blend together nicely,creating an attractive scent.
Unfortunately I turns into a rose scent in the drydown.",04/04/13 20:30,genny17

Body Tender Burberry,"Absolutley like!!!!! I want this for spring and even for summer. Crispy, fresh but not an aquatic way. Sparkingly cool, modern sophistication, still creates a luxurious atmosphere. Suitable for youngsters and elderly women too.

Very interesting fragrance. It's best worn in spring/summer, for daytime.

There needs to be an overhaul in the fragrance industry. I've lost my passion for most mass designer fragrances because of these flankers. New concepts are needed.

They have such potential, but always lose it by investing in such flankers. I'm so disappointed.",01/04/13 07:13,jovejove
Golden Haze Burberry,A faint vetiver and marigold which I don’t fancy opened the scent up. Then an even fainter tea note appeared before the entire scent disappeared from my skin completely. Then an even scent didn’t last ten minutes on my skin but remained faintly woody on clothing after twenty four hours. The vetiver was nice as a note but anything beyond marigold was just gone before any feeling could be felt. This coming from two sprays which is the norm I set for testing was just pathetic. A real shame coming from a luxury line from the house that created my favorite amber scent.,09/25/25 19:12,ckorp8

It's classy sexy, you know like a cashmere jumper with jeans, but jeans with a rip in showing just enough leg, I wear this when I want to give of 'the vibe' in a subtle way, if you know what I mean!",09/13/14 10:36,Englishrose4
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"Very nice perfume for a daily or evening use, it is not unique, but it's classy and sophisticated. Rose seem to dominate over the rest of ingredients, but thankfully not too much. It is also long lasting. I think that it is very similar to the first Body, but I can not be sure because I've only tested it(Body edp). Finally, it's really well balanced fragrance, suitable for almost any occasion.",09/10/14 01:05,cityangel

Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"Sexy, clean, smells like money smells like my bank account is full of many figures hahaha. Luxurious..bottle is supersonic and great :) lasts long, affordable and generous scent. I likey :)

My very first Burberry scent, high hopes for the rest now... It is creamy and very tricky to describe ... I stayed in St, Tropez once... If I went there again I would wear this on the yacht and drink a ......ribena hahahahahah No more Champagne for me..

I would suggest getting the accompaniments, the body milk , the mist very generous amounts and long lasting. Sophistication in a bottle. Difficult to dislike.",05/26/14 11:32,ismellsogood
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"Elegance and sophistication in a bottle! In my opinion, this is not an everyday perfume but something to set aside for special occasions. The lasting power is amazing on my skin. I could still smell it on my wrists after showering. I am not usually a fan of Burberry fragrances but this one is amazing.",04/25/14 18:13,marylu
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"I have smelled the original and this version is almost if not the same scent. I can't detect any difference. This rosy scent is quite sophisticated and feminine because it's not sugary sweet but it's slightly sweet, woody scent that can appeal to different age groups. It's along the style of YSL Paris with a twist. The originaL BB is a silage monster bordering on annoying if oversprayed. This one I've worn but a few times but silage and longevity were not an issue. I could smell it on myself for many hours. Nobody complimented or complained about the scent. The name of the perfume and the color go hand in hand. For some reason I think of copper when I smell this definitely a good scent worth trying but don't expect something unique or different. This perfume might be a good option to wear with your rose gold watch or jewelry.",02/27/14 05:16,ojosverdes
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"This perfume is really true to its name since you can really smell the rose petals.
Besides that it also has a woody scent.

It's quite heavy and you can still smell the rosiness after 6 hours.
I really like this perfume and I have the 60ml bottle, it lasts really long so it's really worth the money.

Love this version more than the original!",01/14/14 15:54,Maey
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"I tested this today. Shock horror, if you like Heidi Klums Surprise perfume to me they are slightly similar. As soon as I sprayed the Burberry it reminded me of Heidi's perfume. They are slightly different but I think the same style of perfume. The Burberry perfume has more complexity and not quite as one dimensional as Heidi's tends to dry to a powdery musk. If you used Heidi's perfume but wanted something more refined and more complex or can't get Heidi's Surprise then try the Burberry Body Rose Gold.",10/29/13 23:00,takeasniff
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"A sophisticated woody, musky scent with subtle rose nuances. Very feminine, comforting and clean. Dries down to something soft and powdery. Very true to its name, smells like a warm hug on a wintery day. The bottle is pretty but not at all practical.",07/11/13 11:07,vanillary29
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"I got it for my mom as a present for her
name day and I've noticed that whenever
I visit her from then on, I never forget to
spritz myself with it before I leave!! Truly
optimistic notes that transmit the happiness
of life!! It's definitely more long lasting than
the original and kind of ""deeper""..",06/04/13 14:26,expialidocious

Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"I must be honest, there are very little differences between this fragrance and the original Burberry Body EDP. In fact, I suspect they are the same fragrance. A few people have been misinformed, and believe that this is a new flanker, rather than a re-packaged version of the original.

This special edition hasn't reached the department stores in my area yet, however I managed to find it in a Burberry boutique near the scarf section. I applied a few sprays to my wrists, and continued shopping. By the time I got home, I could still smell it, nearly five hours later.

To quote my review on Burberry Body EDP, ""you may be initially turned off by Burberry Body Rose Gold's opening, which to my nose was a little chemical, like the scent of insect repellent or hairspray. I was admittedly annoyed by these top notes, and had grave fears for what would follow.

Thankfully Burberry Body improves throughout its development. It's not an extremely loud fragrance, yet it does have good projection. Cashmere wood and sandalwood are the most dominant accords to my nose, followed by musk and creamy vanilla. The rose is very subtle, tending to be more sweet and fresh rather than tart-like"".

I detected more peach and rose in the composition while wearing Burberry Body Rose Gold, and I suspect that the warm, sunny weather may have had something to do with that. The only unfortunate thing about Burberry Body Rose Gold is its rather expensive price tag. The salesperson in the Burberry boutique quoted this fragrance as $180 AUD for the 85ml bottle.",01/14/13 00:11,missk
Burberry Body Rose Gold Burberry,"I really like this. It is a warm rosy iris mix in the beginning. The dry down is very different, it is like the peach and freesia decide they want to be the stars. I will admit that it is rather synthetic at first. I sprayed and walked away with no problem. About 30 minutes later I needed to have it. It has long lasting power, medium projection and is a scent that works for any age. I am not a big Burberry fan but this one just captured me, surprise, surprise.",12/26/12 09:54,paiged98@gmail.com
