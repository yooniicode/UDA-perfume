L'Eau par Kenzo Love L'Eau Kenzo,"Opens exactly like the original, which I love, but it lacks the depth, complexity and the longevity. Its lovely while it lasts. Perplexing as to why Kenzo even bothered ""creating"" this.",02/08/15 05:29,40plus&fab

Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"Once upon a time by Kenzo,is one of my favorite perfume. A beautiful fresh rose, romantic and deep, that become woody and aromatic.She last long and the projection is pretty good as well. Unfortunately this fragrance was a limited edition, for the 40th anniversary of the brand.",01/02/24 23:10,Titti Claren
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"This opens with a lot of smoky woods - especially sandalwood - on my skin. Like a wood fired sauna. It’s definitely unisex - leaning masculine - and it’s a lot heavier than I expected. The rose is smoky - not fresh, sweet or dewy. As it dries down it feels gentler and creamier, the smoky notes reside and the rose comes out more.
Smoke doesn’t work very well on me - it tends to dominate - and for that reason I think this will end up finding a new home. It’s not a bad scent but it doesn’t work for me. Not a safe blind buy I think.",03/20/21 12:26,Agnes81
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"Blossoming rose in musky cloud - rich, sweet, yet gentle. The rose is dominant but you can smell other flower notes too. When the scent develops, more sweet wood (and especially sandalwood) follows. Beautiful and original fragrance for spring.",07/08/17 08:58,Lubaska

Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"I am surprized, that it's from 2010. I thought it's something much more older.
In my opinion, it doesn't smell very good. It's overly woody and spicy.
I am not a fan of this chemical-woody composition, it's a little sharp.
It's not the worst scent, but I don't think it smells like a perfume.",01/05/15 07:56,ScarlettX
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,This is the one of the nicest scents that Ive ever smelled. This rings true to woody and sweet to my nose. I really love this scent so much. Just a warm woody and sweet beautiful scent!!!!,03/31/14 09:34,soniamcalear

Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"i tested this few times, i let two different friends of mine smell it. they both said it smells like coke. i can't say i disagree with them but i really liked it anyway :))",06/13/12 09:48,nowheregal
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,This is a rather warm and maybe spicy scent. Good for winter and autumn time. I found it yesterday in a clearance sale (has it been discontinued?) and bought it for 50% off for this winter's season. On me it stays on long and my bf likes it much too.,08/30/11 22:18,Habanita
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"I found the opening fresh, floral, and a little zesty, with magnolia as the dominant note. The fragrance dried down quickly and became very spicy on me, like a very sheer note of cardamom, although I don't see cardamom listed. It must be something in the 'woodsy notes' interacting with my skin chemistry.

I would recommend it to those who like slightly spicy florals.",07/20/11 10:23,Jillzilla
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"First off I'd just like to mention how beautiful this bottle is. The intense teal colour along with the fascinating, wallpaper designs are really eye-catching. I have a feeling this fragrance will sell well based on the bottle itself.

The fragrance is equally as fascinating to me as the bottle. It opens with a clean and powdery rose and magnolia blend, being rather refreshing and Summery.

Further through its development, Kenzo Once Upon A Time shows a slightly spicier side, making it a touch oriental. Despite the spices being present, please don't think that this fragrance is anything like YSL's Opium or CK's Obsession, they are in two different leagues. This is a pleasant, refreshing and subtle hint of spice only there to compliment the delicate floral accords.

After this initial flowery and spicy burst, the scent merges into a musky and ambery base, a little conventional, but still pleasant nonetheless. With the mass of Summer fragrances being released this time of year, it's nice to discover one, like Once Upon A Time that doesn't rely too heavily on citrus to make a refreshing statement.",11/05/10 20:19,missk
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"At first it wasn't bad, but after some hours it becomes just too spicy. It almost make me want to sneeze.",11/04/10 19:29,Amethyste
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"I tried this new Kenzo a few days ago and also got a sample so that I could wear it for a few days. On initial spray from tester I was well impressed. It's a lively floral fresh scent, then it becomes warmer and a little spicy powder. Magnolia and peony are the notes that come out more individually but honestly this is a typical Kenzo's mishmash. It smells pleasant and attractive, joyful and easy but not cheap. It's quite soft but with a vanillic plasticky edge that nearly takes it into the cloying world of scent, in spite of being a light fragrance.
It was the vanillic edge that slowly took me to point out where I already smelled that typical vibe: Kenzo!
Amour and Indian Holi above all smell like this and for the ones who remember the long gone Kashaya. They are all beautiful scents that became impossible to wear for me because of that fake vanillic note that initially conforted me than brought me to nausea and headache.
Kenzo Flower is the worst in that sense, one of the most horrid fragrances I ever smelled and unfortunately a widespread one.
Once upon a time takes that vanillic note to a lower degree, not so suffocating and less plasticky.
I could wear this one for daytime, feeling conforted and soothed. It stays close to the skin with poor sillage and lasting power is not great.
The bottle is lovely, colourful and elegant in a modern sense.",11/02/10 12:18,Mellyhelly
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"A very flowery scent in the beginning, I realy can smell the peony and magnolia very good.In the drydown it gets a woodsy note that I like.

a nice and warm flower scent.",10/17/10 07:25,delphine67
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"To be honest ... I don't think this smell like anything new, nor really pleasant. It's not bad, but I would not use it on somebody's skin. It is a mix-max of anything I could have smelled before in a wrongly-balanced concentration, all Kenzo's together (which are great separetely, but not here) + some toilett spray ... unfortunately, it leaves me with the impression of smelly product that ""would have liked to be a special fragrance, ... but it's not"". So much for the anniversary ... it deserved MUCH better.",10/15/10 09:16,Pepa
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"This EDT has a floral aroma and sweet time, too loaded. I think it works well for women 30 and older. In teens only for an evening out.",09/25/10 00:18,andrevarx
Once Upon a Time pour Femme Kenzo,"Once Upon a Time smells more like a spicy oriental than a floral woody musk. It's very powdery, aromatic, dry but also deep and mysterious.

The scent is a hybrid of Flower and Jungle L'Elephant, with a touch of Amour - it's like the synthesis of the most popular Kenzo perfumes.

I personally find it quite likeable, and if you enjoy any of the three above mentioned fragrances, there are good chances that you'll also like this one.",09/10/10 13:50,ineverwas

Air Intense Kenzo,"Possibly the lightest fragrance I've ever tested. In the same vain as Gucci envy. Actually quite disappointed overall, but not a bad smell. I would caution those who have not smelled this before blind buying. Like I said - not bad - shockingly light (unable to smell). I did purchase mine from eBay, so I suppose it could have been altered.

Air Intense Kenzo,"This was such a nice smelling juice; it's a real shame it's been discontinued. However, even this 'intense' version had little in the way of projection. That said, I remember it had a distinctive tendency to 'reappear' every so often for a few hours after it seemed to have vanished.

Anyway, the scent itself had a sweet, breezy, watery liquorice note which was frankly fantastic. Garnered plenty of compliments while it lasted. Could have been unisex but was nonetheless very comfortable as a masculine scent.",07/22/16 09:05,Leekenn

Air Intense Kenzo,Sorry to all the fans of this gem. It was now the second time that I had the chance to buy an bottle of this stuff and I didn´t. For me it´s just another ordinary fresh / sport toilet water. It smells like Kenzo Tokyo.,04/19/15 06:45,Rerik
Air Intense Kenzo,A master piece of Kenzo !! I miss it as it is no more sold since years...a compliment getter too !!,05/10/14 09:45,toto453
Air Intense Kenzo,"In 2003, Kenzo Air achieved the market, a scent that was very successful at the time, containing balanced notes of bergamot, vetiver, amber, fennel and licorice, basically. In 2005, the same perfumer – Maurice Roucel – released a more intense version, which was a limited edition and that still causes furor among the lovers of the original version.

This time, the licorice has not entered in the composition, which has notes of bergamot, anise and fennel, in the output; Angelica and Tahitian vetiver, in the heart; Amber, vetiver and Woods, in the base.

Definitely, is not one of my favorites, but I like it a lot. Why? Because is different from all the rest!
This is the kind of scent made for those who want to forget the worries, feel free of the heavy chains of everyday’s life, remember the freedom of being a child, etc.

Its scent is composed, basically, by nuances of anise and vetiver, with a touch of flowers and amber.
In this version, the aroma of anise is more poignant. Then, the vetiver predominates. Many people feel resemblance with the fragrance of Encre Noire, although I find the latter more dry.

Air Intense stays close to the skin, but lasts for hours and hours. And the bottle is a nice piece of cloud that fits in the palm of your hand.
A beautiful creation that was unfortunately discontinued and is rare to be found.",06/05/13 10:50,Cassiano

Air Intense Kenzo,"This is IT! The buck stops here!
I'd trade all the other scents I have away and keep only this one if I had to!

And to clarify, this is an EDT, and to my nose, it's remarkably similar to KenzoAIR original. I've worn original on one arm and Intense on the other arm and I cannot tell a difference! I had other smell too, and they most would actually say that the original was the more ""strong"" smelling of the two.

SOOOOOoooooo... Yeah. Don't sweat the small stuff, and don't break the bank trying to find This INTENSE version, no one will ever be able to tell if you are wearing INTENSE or not, thats a promise! But if you do run across it, the bottle is really REALLY cool!

Air Intense Kenzo,I can't understand why Kenzo discontinued their best fragrances - unforgivable Air (regular and intense versions) and Time For Peace - and continue reissue such a crap like L'Eau par(((,08/20/11 02:48,too young
Air Intense Kenzo,"An underrated gem.

It happened by accident that I layered two fragrances. I was testing Encre Noir to write my final review and instead of spraying it on an unscented smelling strip, I sprayed it on a piece of paper on which I previously tested Etro's Anice.
What a suprise to smell the anisic aspect of vetiver amphasized by the real anise note. Especially in the drydown when the two perfumes blended perfectly together.

Well, I found Kenzo Air Intense / Kenzo Air to have a very similar vibe to the above scenario and despites probably not being as praised as Encre Noir, it still has a great charme. Peppery, anisic, funny. Chemical? Yes, most definitely, but very well blended. Does great in warm weather.

If you're wondering about the differencies between the ""intense"" version and the original, well, I haven't found a substantial one. The ""intense"" is exactly like the original version but a little bit stronger, that's it.

Air Intense Kenzo,"Kenzo Air Intense is peaceful and delightful fragrance. It can take you to a far away environment, a place you have never been before. Amazing.

Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,"I don't use to like cherry blossom, but trust me, the replacement for this is Cerisier by Yves Rocher.",08/14/21 10:09,Amethyste
Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,"I agree with the previous reviewers, Eau de soie is a delicate and soft fragrance, feminine and light, very suitable for spring/summer or even now in February, when you get tired of winter bombs :)

I get clearly rose and violet from first spray which reminds me of Bvlgari Rose Essentielle, only lighter and greener and I get also a peppery note that reminds me of another beautiful underrated creation: Eau de Dupont.

Sillage and longevity are rather moderate...

The bottle is quite original but don't like the paper glued at the backside; I find the packaging very interesting though, opening with the flip on the side.
The more I wear Kenzo(s), the more I fall in love with the brand.",02/19/16 09:34,dina
Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,"My great-grandmother had several silk flower trees, or ""Mimosa"" trees as southerners mistakenly call them, that I would climb and pick flowers from as a child. The opening of this perfume really does smell a bit like the pink fluffy sweetness from the trees, but sadly doesn't last long at all. The drydown scent is still realy nice and pretty. It sticks to clothes and hair fairly well, but on skin it doesn't last long.

I really love this perfume and I always reach for it if I'm in a hurry or am not sure what social situation I'm headed into because it's so inoffensive. I have it as a backup signature scent because it suits me so well - sweet and non-invasive!

EDIT: This smells so much like the ""Wind Song"" line from CVS. They layer really well, and they seem to make the Kenzo last a bit longer on me.",08/28/15 22:03,QueenieBee

Dries down to a and gets very powdery but at this stage cant say I smell any of the notes.

So nice, delicate and flowery. Smells of spring blossoms and it brings back memories of me being a little girl and having fun on the meadow near my grandparents summer house...hmmmmmmm what more can I say ? i really like it and it makes a nice get away from all my other sweet and spicy fragrances.

Will be happily using it in spring and summer time.",03/21/12 06:47,Takhaet
Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,"I have a sample and it brings Bvlgari Omnia Amethyste to my mind because there is a connection of violet colour and green plant juices between them two. Eau de Fleur... is fresher, it may be good for spring and summer. I've tried better scents by Kenzo, so I sniff the scent with no ""wow""s but it's a a nice scent, lacking something that would make it brilliant.

OMG! i cannot put my finger on the flowers itself but! it's just PERFECT MIX if you love sensual delicate lightly fruity & absolutely ROSE scent.. this is for you.. i'm wearing it right now & i want to smell this for ever... the staying power on me is really really good..

Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,"This is quite a pleasant flowers combination, Rose is prominent. I like the purity of rose in this perfume, which is exactly the same as Stella's floral part (just the floral part I mean).

Stella has an obvious undertone of amber, which doesn't comply with my imagination on a natural, relaxing flower scent.

Kenzo has successfully avoided all the heavy undertones and just focus on the beauty of rose itself.

I'm a rose lover. I wish I could meet this fragrance more earlier!!! Very nice, I want a bottle.",06/04/11 00:36,LydiaLiu
Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,"i love the powdery untertone from kenzo perfumes. this one is really nice creamy-powdery-sweet, lingers very close to the skin, the flower and fruit accents are very nice mellowed, wrapped in silk feeling, but you have to layer it twice or even three times, if you want to have a better staying power.
all in all it's a nicely done subtle comfy day scent, very feminine.
a shame the staying power is so weak.",12/21/10 02:41,miZZpuRRfect
Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,a very nice comforting floral smell. It has this recognizable smell which a lot of floral (fruity) scents don't have. It smells like a woman you would like to hug :) (i would like to smell like that!) though it fades away sóó quickly! too bad.,11/12/10 11:25,melia

Eau De Fleur de Soie Kenzo,"The Silk Tree, Albizia julibrissin, is also called ""Acacia de Constantinopla"". The smell of this Eau has something basic in common with the smell of mimosa, a true Acacia, but modified(damaged, in my opinion) by the fruity notes, which make it less dry and coarser. The smell of mimosa less bright, less yellow, more pink... and refreshened.",04/01/10 10:00,selinum28

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Tuberose? I must have gotten the one bottle that missed out on its dose of Tuberose - I happen to like it as a note in perfumery, and recognise it in its many forms, but Jeu d'Amour leaves me more than slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong - she's pretty enough, but lacks substance. She starts with an alcohol-laced Citrus burst courtesy of the Mandarin Orange and ends with a thin trail of Freesia for the remainder of her stay - inoffensive, but unremarkable.

As mentioned by a few reviewers before me - I tried to enjoy this. Reminder why blind buys aren't always a good idea.",07/11/22 05:30,Snowflake_007
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"I just can’t truly enjoy this, and I’ve tried. With a 5ml mini, you can bet that I’ve tried. It’s just okay.

A little citrus at the top, and pomegranate (not my favourite note), and then pretty tuberose for the rest. I don’t detect even a hint of sandalwood here. It’s safe, inoffensive and lasts well enough, but there isn’t a wow factor for me.",07/05/22 03:34,chlorodream
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Takes a while for the initial blast of alcohol to dissipate.
Sharp citrus followed quickly by tuberose which makes it a sweet and creamy heady floral, no fruit left.

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"a pretty spring/summer floral but nothing spectacular, a bit acquatic and full of tuberose with some sharp freesia and musk and maybe a hint of pomegranate if someone tells you and you stretch your nose; the tuberose is in the top but it is sharp, powdery freesia in the base with some musk. I actually like the top, tolerate the mediocre middle, and love the base.",12/20/21 18:40,gtabasso

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"On my skin, pomegranate tames the tuberose completely. Usually tuberose strangles me, but in this scent it's polite and powdery. If I didn't know what the notes were, I'd say this smells like dried apricots - must be the sour juicy fruits on white florals that give that impression.",09/28/20 16:35,tatigo

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Clean fragrance, without too many frills, passe-partout, I could not place Jeu d'Amour properly in a specific or more suitable season than another.
My skin radiates a scent that reminds me a bit of Pure Poison Dior, but I can be misled by the mandarin I perceive as the dominant note, a note of sunlight and positivity.
It clearly falls between the fragrances I adore.",06/17/19 14:17,masako_30
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Lovely fragrance! Fresh, feminine, calm. A good choice for people looking for a sensual and minimalist spring scent. I am glad to have it in my collection. This perfume is a people pleaser with personality.
I imagine a young woman drinking tea in Japan in the early morning hours when i smell it. She is serene, joyful, grateful, self-loving and confident.
My nose detected tuberose (creamy and fresh), musk (gives the scent a subtle powdery touch) and pomegranate (soft fruity and a bit aquatic).
If you want a scent that smell like peace and freshly cuted flowers, try Jeu d‘Amour.
Final note: 8/10
Sillage: soft
Longevity: moderate",05/11/19 09:35,raiza1990
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"This was a surprise. I've had a sample vial of Jeu d'Amour for some time now, but haven't really been drawn to try it until today, which I only did because it was in my bag and I didn't like the other vial I tried on this morning (Marc Jacobs Honey).

The notes on the list on this page are not my usual thing. I'm not a big fan of florals, especially white florals, and I tend to be cautious with tuberose in particular. That said, I also am not very good at identifying individual floral notes (except rose, iris and violet, which it turns out I love in certain perfumes), so I couldn't imagine what this might smell like.

Well, as it turns out, I am enjoying this perfume very much. The opening is fresh and juicy, which must be the fruit and tea notes. While quite pleasant, it was the drydown that really hooked me in.

The early transition between opening and drydown was not particularly impressive, but the fragrance grew increasingly lovelier, until I later caught a lightly sweet and powdery, slightly musky scent that strongly reminded me of something. It took a while before I realized it reminded me of L'Occitane Iris Bleu & Iris Blanc, but even more beautiful. Comparing the notes, they only have musk in common, but reading up I learned that freesia is from the iris family, so I'm not sure if that is why they smell similar to me. Whatever it is, I am enjoying Jeu d'Amour even more than I do the L'Occitane fragrance, because while I like the latter's drydown, I get a waxy opening from it, which I could almost taste. The Kenzo fragrance only shares the delicately powdery drydown, except it is fuller and milkier, more delightful.

Since I already have Iris Bleu & Iris Blanc, I'm not sure if a full bottle of Jeu d'Amour is worth seeking for me, despite my liking it more. It's not normally the kind of scent I reach for (indeed, I don't use Iris Bleu & Iris Blanc much), but it's nice to have for when the mood strikes or just to smell occasionally. I will at least use up this vial if I couldn't get a small decant.",03/28/19 02:31,cherelune

I first thought it was the most generic ""smelled it before"" perfume out there but found myself wearing it everyday and enjoying it. I feel that I am wearing something pink and warm. A bubbly woman´s scent. Also a cover up your real emotions scent. Good for work.

Update: It grows on you so much you end up buying it again and love smelling it. Compliment getter. Reminds me often of my beloved Michael from Michael Kors. Ultra feminine, lipsticky and charming.",08/14/18 08:28,Rinio

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"In my opinion this stunning perfume doesn't get all the attention and recognition it deserves as a very particular composition that offers something new in a world of an ocean of scents. Jeu d'Amour is overshadowed by the popular line of Flower and its infinite flankers and isn't on the spotlight like the other Kenzos. However this perfume smells heavenly to me. I've been looking for a long time for a perfume that was fresh, woody, breezy, green and floral and this is the best example that suits the decription. It smells like springtime, like a wave of fresh, dewy flowers. The fragrance is very well balanced between the ""bodiness"" of tuberose, the freshness of freesia, the juicy pomegranate, and the sandalwood that contributes with the spicyness. Yes, it's a perfect scent for when you need to smell good but don't feel like wearing anything too heavy. Jeu d'Amour has an incontestable presence, is clean and is also a fragrance that makes you feel good and happy. Enjoy it.",03/28/18 06:16,lulami
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"I consider this fragrance very beautiful and feminine and not ordinary...it is sweet but not in a heavy way...my partner doesn´t like heavy fragrances on me, but this one he can stand...he even says it would fit me during spring or summer, even though I bought it as a winter/ fall fragrance...I am very curious about summer, I think it will change a bit its character.
If you like sweeter and romantic fragrances, this is a good choice...not too heavy...it´s romantic, princessy, warm...

Sillage is quite good, but not too owerwhelming...it lasts 5 - 6 hours on my skin...on my sweater even on the other day:)
p.s. EDT is loud and a bit soury, I don´t like at all...",03/01/18 02:08,Stella Bu

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"This is nice but somewhat generic.

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"I have to agree with dissapointing drydown here.
After I sprayed it, it smelled wonderful - juicy, not too sweet, slightly powdery, very interesting and sensual.

After the drydown all I can get are white floral notes. I'm not saying it doesn't smell nice. It surely does, but somehow boring to me.",01/16/18 08:36,Midnight Lady
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Dissapointing. At first application this is divine. Juicy, moreish, not too sweet, and elegant. I found it enchanting. However whatever it is that makes it interesting wears off within 20 mins and leaves a generic soapy white floral. Shame",11/21/17 16:57,Cmed
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"I received a sample of this fragrance along with a couple of purchases and never really gave it much thought. At New Year however, I left the family party early and went to my college city to celebrate with my friends and boyfriend.
When I woke up the next morning I smelled of tobacco, spilled beer and had bags for days under my eyes, everything you don't want your family to see at family dinner. After a quick shower I realized I moved all my perfumes home for the holiday except this little one. it was light, flowery, sweet and velvety smooth and it seemed to go along perfect with the pancakes I made that morning before returning home to go to the family dinner. My boyfriend had a hangover and is very sensitive to smells but he even cuddled and I felt clean and elegant despite the serious lack of sleep. It's a great light fragrance and I will forever link it to me walking in flat boots and a black dress through the snow with a cold winter sun peeking through the clouds after a wonderful night.",09/04/17 03:11,IgnitingFlares
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"This is my favorite perfume for the warmer months. I think it's ladylike and youthful at the same time and suitable for all occasions.
Very feminine with a hint of flirtyness.

The main note is tuberose, which is my favorite floral. It's a fresh and clean one with a hint of creaminess, supported by freesia. A hint of bubblegum-sweetness is there, but not too much. The pomegranate is also quite prominent and gives a sparkling fruity twist. I wouldn't have thought of a blood mandarin note (I never even saw a blood mandarin in my life), but now that I know it's there, I think I can smell a bit of a blood orange note, too.

I love that Jeu d'Amour stays fresh the whole time in a soft, non-screechy way. The base is musky and very soft, I find it perfect here. I usually like sweet and warm basenotes, but sometimes a cleaner, less sweet base is even better, and this is the case here. I'm glad they didn't use vanilla for this one.

Sillage and lasting power are average and that's fine with me.

I love it!",06/26/17 01:43,SailorV
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Very nice opening I mean wow.

Ince I get past that and let the other notes come through, it's a white floral.

Proud know the type, the Jasmine, gardenia ..... etc. well, these go bitter in me sadly, this one hasn't yet but we'll see.
It's very pretty, don't wear it with anything sweet or the sweetness will bring out the bitter, let it be, soft and floral.

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Amo esse perfume! Para mim é o cheiro de um romance. Chega a ser quase indescritível de tanto que gosto. Certamente percebo as notas florais por bastante tempo e na abertura me chama a atenção o toque de chá e uma nota cítrica bem leve. De uma forma ou de outra, a fragrância consegue ser reconfortante e ao mesmo tempo sensual, mas de forma calma. Gostaria apenas que durasse mais pois 4 a 5 horas não é ruim, mas eu adoraria que durasse umas horinhas a mais.

I love this perfume! For me, it smells of romance. It's almost indescribable since I like it so much. I can certainly notice the floral notes for quite a while and in the opening the tea notes and blood orange do appear. One way or another, the fragrance manages to be both comforting and sensual, but in a calm way. I just wish it would last longer. Four or five hours isn't bad, but I would love it if it could last a couple of hours longer.",03/28/17 08:52,e_lizardbeth
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"First when sprayed this perfume is quite sharp and strong, I feel mostly blood orange but I feel it mixed with some alcohol note, not the usual fresh citrus smell. I barely detect pomegranate and tea notes which is so disappointing because I really like them in a perfume. Freesia appears shortly after spraying and it stays till the end as well as the tuberose. Sandalwood appears in the base and it makes the scent a bit warmer and musk is barely noticeable too and it gives Jeu D'Amour kind of a soapy note. Freesia is the note I feel most intensely and if you're not into freesia skip this perfume. Jeu D'Amour is categorized as floral gourmet type of scent and I was curious to try it, but this is definitely not my type of scent. I would describe it as completely floral perfume that has a lot of freesia in, a bit tuberose and a tiny bit of sandalwood and blood orange, but it's not gourmet at all. I would definitely like this more if pomegranate and tea notes appear stronger but Jeu D'Amour for me is completely white floralish-floral type of scent. I don't like freesia and it irritates me in a perfume and here makes no exception – it's fresh but it's so sharp and it makes every perfume too retro smelling. I have to admit that Jeu D'Amour is nicely composed and creamy, fine and feminine scent but it's not for me. I think it would suit young women as well as mature women, basically every women that like white florals. As I said this perfume smells too retro for me. Longevity is high – it has strong sillage and projection and it stays on the hair & clothes. Pomegranate and tea notes are so rare to find in a perfume and I think it's a miss that instead of making them appear stronger Kenzo went for the boring combination of white florals and pretend this is a “floral-gourmet” which is funny because the only gourmet thing here is a tiny bit of blood orange right after spraying. If you're into freesia and white florals you'll probably like Jeu D'Amour.",03/11/17 08:28,preslavapopova

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"I often like what Daphne Bugey creates. This one likeable too even if created by two people.
The fragrance reminds me about Amarige by Givenchy, in its heart notes mostly. It's something like an updated and changed Amarige, more modern. The base notes are sweet, almost caramel-like though, and Givenchy has definitely much better sillage on me. In fact, the fragrance has a good sillage in the first half an hour and then it decreases and decreases, to stay almost undetectable in the end.
I'd expect more sillage, it's KENZO! Actually my favourite brand, I guess.
The fragrance would suit a young woman, a woman in her middle age and elderly one too, not a very young teenager. It's sexy!",09/11/16 10:37,SheShe
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Quite a strong and harsh opening but thankfully it quickly settles into a light and inoffensive scent. I am able to detect all the beautiful top notes before the warm tuberose makes its entrance and steals center stage.

Feminine, a little playful, but in no way a silage monster. This perfume sits quite close to the skin. I don't see this as a fruity floral but rather a spicy (oriental) floral. I think its the tea note that adds the spicy feel. Overall a lovely scent for everyday wear and definitely office safe.",08/31/16 03:41,Kai'elle
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"When I first tried Kenzo - Jeu d'Amour after receiving a sample, I really couldn't decide if I liked it or not - It almost seemed a little annoying. But as I used up the sample it grew on me and I bought a 30ml flacon feeling I would miss it once it was gone. Now just like onimoka, I think I should have bought a larger one!
It is a smell I feel I ""have"" as well as ""have not"" smelled before. Familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.
As it has grown on me I find it is predominantly a soft, warm and beautiful powdery tuberose scent which makes me feel beautiful, loved and desired, not blatantly sexy, rather a quiet sexual confidence. My husband likes it a lot which enhances my feelings towards Jeu d'Amour. To me it feels like ""I love you - let's play"" more than ""game of love"" It is not a statement perfume. In my opinion it seems appropriate for both the office and an intimate evening out. I wouldn't wear it to a rock concert or club though.
I find the silage is good. If I leave my office I can smell the fragrance as I walk back in (we have an open door policy so the fragrance isn't trapped inside, it seems to be absorbed by the air around you). I think closetlikeboots' comment of it having a faint waft that follows you is spot on as I have noticed it in the passageway outside my office if I have only been away for a short while. Longevity is good, I can still smell it around me after getting home from work 12+ hours later.
I haven't got any experience with Avon's perfumes so I can't compare the bottle design, to me it seems an elegant understated bottle, just like the perfume inside.",02/05/16 04:18,MindyMe

i would say the middle notes here are the strongest.. i don't smell too much pomegranate on me!

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"An interesting fragrance, relying mostly on florals and musk to my nose. It opens with tuberose and musk, both coming on quite strong in the opening. Then the mandarin, pomegranate and freesia come in to lighten and brighten the scent. The tea note grounds it. The drydown is nice with a musky and powdery slightly sweet tuberose and fruity lasting scent with good sillage.

I do not understand why Kenzo linked this scent to its Amour line. There is no real similarity to my mind, except that they are both rather powdery in the drydown and a bit sweet. Jeu d'Amour is missing the lovely vanilla and rice notes that give the original Amour its distinctive scent.",01/04/15 11:50,rickyrebarco

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"I've only tried it once. It's not terribly original and I could see why some would say it's synthetic. However, it has some presence and it is a very pleasant fragrance, very happy feel-good, but also feminine and flirty. The tuberose is the main note, but it is not heady, old-smelling tuberose, just a more soft white floral smell, made playful by the fruity notes (with the benefit of not being sticky or cloying). The sandalwood becomes more prominent in the drydown, but I think I prefer the opening.",10/06/14 14:19,moreorlessa
Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"Kenzo Jeu d'Amour opens with juicy pomegranate and a hint of mandarin. The pomegranate wears off into a vague fruity nuance after about 30 minutes, and the whole stage is left to the tuberose to shine.

The tuberose here has a slight buttery and milky texture. Along with a freshness lent from freesia, the tuberose feels relatively real, and doesn't get lost in a abstract fruity floral sweetness like some fragrances do. Granted, it smells mainstream, and far from being original or striking, but it's very nice and shows enough textures for me perceive it as a relatively true tuberose. The drydown after about 6 hours is a lily-vanilla base, with a slight suntan lotion vibe and a sort of powdered sugar mixed in, not uncommon to a few other fragrances in the same genre such as Lys Soleia and Baiser Volé Essence de Parfum, but it's just as lovely.

The sillage is moderate and the longevity is around 10 hours. Jeu d'Amour is a bright, relatively authentic tuberose, with a sensuous white floral and vanilla drydown. If you're interested in a big tuberose, but at the same time not too difficult to wear, Jeu d'Amour could be a lovely option.",10/04/14 14:23,StellaDiverFlynn

Jeu d'Amour Kenzo,"I like this Jeu d'Amour. When I saw the bottle I thought: ok, here is yet another flanker, can't designers make anything new?
Anyway I tried it and didn't regret.
It's a lively floral with a zesty fruity opening and a long drydown in the vanillic musky modern way.
Nothing new, good news.
The opening is zesty but sweet, maybe because of the blood mandarine. It has an uplifting vibe and it reminds me of a very old fruity way: the '80s fruity scents. It's a slight different take compared to the endless fake fruit basket with only the berries variation of the last years.
This put me in a good disposition for the rest. Not that this scent is the epithome of creativity and originality, but in the messy sea of mainstream it stands quite bright.
The heart is floral or at least synthetical floral. I don't get the tuberose at all. Not in the way of the classic somptuous, carnal, warm and thick tuberose scents. It seems to me that many new perfumes features tuberose or gardenia, then they smell nothing like them and they are probably replacers. Like for strawberries, sandalwood and other materials. I guess few people get to smell real tuberose in a garden (and many would run away especially from some species!) so here it is the ""new"" tuberose. A fresher fake. Not too bad, at least it is nicely blended.
Then comes the inevitable sweet musky base of our days, nice enough for about 2 hours, then it falls flat with that edge of bath products and bodysprays.
This is a scent I could wear very easily and feel pretty, feminine, young and into the crowd, but with some distinction.",09/03/14 13:57,Mellyhelly

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"I do like this fragrance it's like a sweet coconut fragrance. When I smelled this for the first time It brought me back to middle school because it smells like a higher quality version of my main fragrance from that time, AXE Excite bodyspray.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Kenzo Night is warm and peppery woods with some faint sweetness. As well versed in fragrances as I am, no particular note stands out. The mango doesn't stand out, nor does the tonka note. It is not as sweet that everyone else is making it out to be. It's rather a spicy, mature sweetness.

I definitely get a warm, mentholated vibe.

Unfortunately, I do not get any coconut or tanning lotion or candy/ice cream, and that was my sole reason for blind buying this fragrance. There is absolutely nothing fruity or tropical about this fragrance. Even if Kenzo Night gave off an ""ice cream"" accord, I would have at least been satisfied.

The overall feel of Kenzo Night is rather peppery and there is fleeting fruity-sweet note. It's actually on the mature side of things, I really can't see a teenager enjoying this or wearing it.",10/19/21 17:10,LolitoLempicko

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"To my nose this smells like a mix of the best attributes from Obsession Night for Men by Calvin Klein + Only The Brave Wild Diesel for men with a nice Tonka bean final note/dry down. I've only smelt Le Male Jean Paul Gaultier for men but I can see how it must share some similarities with Le Beau Jean Paul Gaultier for men which many compare it to. Kenzo Night has some very interesting middle notes, it's not dross.
I find the sillage becomes pretty close to the skin after an hour or so and likewise long lasting but just a skin scent. I wouldn't categorise this as the beast the ratings make it out to be, but that may just be olfactory fatigue on my nose's part.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"It’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. I really like it though! It’s very much a ‘fun’ (or easygoing) fragrance - I’d say you either enjoy sweet tropical/holiday fragrances or you don’t, I guess. All I can really pick out from it is sweet coconut. It’s just really pleasant, not remotely ‘serious’ at all. It doesn’t smell in anyway the same but something about the linear sweet (and synthetic) scent made me think of Black XS Potion. Not a criticism. I had to check the box to see if Kenzo Night was an EDP, it isn’t, it’s just that it seems really long lasting but isn’t loud.

I’m having a blast with exploring Kenzo, after KPH eventually really grew on me after initial indifference and putting aside. Now I have discovered Tokyo, which is truly outstanding and a personal favourite now. Got Kenzo Aqua Kenzo on the way too.",12/10/20 16:56,BlackPhillip
Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"I really hope I got a fake, because the fragrance that I got is just too sweet and generic. I get no coconut or tropical vibe at all. Also, it's too masculine in my opinion – I gravitate towards unisex frags.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Kenzo Homme Night was quite a ninja challenge. I got a fresh bottle and the fragrance was incredibly tenacious, possessing headache inducing vapor pressure, and a heady linear gourmand body that's like some kind of synthetic mutation between tonka bean and mango constitutes. It shares a strong reminiscence with the base from Ferragamo Uomo.

I couldn't bear to wear it out—even once. That's how unenjoyable it was for me. After two years, I checked to see if the fragrance matured, and the tenacity mellowed out. Not this one though. Nothing changed about it at all. So I left a small amount in a dram to macerate, and see if I could level off the tenacity by more advanced methods and get some hidden qualities to open up.

It wasn't long, and from the sealed dram, the fragrance opened up and transformed into something much less ungodly. There were sweet hints off the tonka and fruit constitutes, a touch of enjoyable musk, and a bit of an ambery or resinoid accent providing a massaging stimulation.

It was enjoyable even. If you had a virgin nose—possibly amazing. But to me, it still comes off more than a bit adolescent. Something you'd be wearing through your teens. Not really worth all the trouble that went into it.

Sadly, this is probably just another shameless solicitation for a privateer formula, available only to the very wealthy Nihonjin.",10/01/20 22:01,Grasshoppaaa
Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,Honestly I was a little disappointed with this one. I was expecting a fresh mango based fragrance with a creamy tonka dry down. But from the start I get a very creamy and pretty synthetic coconut smell. It’s a pleasant smell and it gets a little woodier and more floral as it dries down but I was honestly expecting a bit of a tropical fruit vibe. Still a great fragrance with good performance for the 38$ I paid,07/29/20 17:47,PushaHndrxx
Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"probably the worst performing fragrance I have ever bought and obviously, it's an instant dislike because of that.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"A mango and tonka bomb with a hint of spice.

I get a sort of coconut/tropical vibe from this and agree with others in the comments below that this is similar to Le Beau by JPG.

For me, projection is moderate to low and longevity is at the lower end of average at about 3 hours. This would be the only downfall to the fragrance.

Overall a nice smelling fragrance that could be made even better with improved performance and longevity.

Last year I was in Germany and having read a bit about this I took a wrist sample and strolled around a train station.

I loved it instantly and it definitely has the youthful, summer feeling of someone going out for a good time.

There are hardly any reviews or information about this despite it smelling good and having the sought-after longevity that everyone wants.

I love tropical scents, but there are not a lot that are really good. There are a lot of OKAY ones like CK Summer, CK Reveal, A&F First instinct and Dreamer.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"A slightly sweeter, better projection, better longevity than recent La Nuit de l'Homme. Same perfumer I reckon!",11/08/17 10:29,yukitanonton
Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"★★★★

It definitely took me some time to appreciate Kenzo Homme Night. For me, it was always one spray on a paper strip without focusing on the scent, basically thinking about the original Kenzo Pour Homme as a far superior fragrance.

I have tried Virgin Island Water by Creed, Diptyque Philosykos, Heeley's Coccobello and South Water by Lili Bermuda while I was looking for a tropical fragrance. All of those fragrances smell wonderful (with a preference to Coccobello) but I always felt they are too unisex and suitable for daytime.

I decided to try Kenzo Homme Night in the end, but actually give it a full wearing, and I did the same with Davidoff Cool Water Night, only because I wanted to use a tropical fragrance only for night time and specifically for clubbing.

Kenzo Homme Night on my skin opens with a wonderful lush mango note that is uplifting and energetic, almost sporty I dare to say, but without making it a sport fragrance. I guess it feels sporty due to the coriander and grapefruit combo as top notes. After a few minutes, the magic happens. It turns really woody and even smoky, I can't smell the vetiver but I can definitely smell the guaiac wood and tonka bean that gives the composition the depth it needs for being a masculine night fragrance. What's fantastic about it is that the mango is always there, even when the base notes start to dominate and turn it slightly dirty and deep. Some people say it smells of coconut but don't be fooled, it's just when the tonka bean kicks in correlation with the mango.

The tropical character stays there for the fragrance's whole lifespan, which is a total of 9 hours or more with great projection for at least the first 4 hours. In my book, that's success in today's standards when everything fleets in the first hour (yes, I'm looking at you Creed)

Is it original? Well, tropical fragrances smell similar most of the time, but I have never encountered the depth of Kenzo Homme Night in any other tropical fragrance, and that is why I give it a gold medal as the ultimate masculine tropical fragrance.

The longevity, the projection and the good price beats it all, a fragrance that's aloof, lazy in a summer way but utterly seductive and masculine.

Wear it with sexy flip flops or total white trainers, your summer t-shirt and aloof shorts and you are that guy in the club that people sniff secretely, the guy that is hard to resist.

Thank you Kenzo, please wake up and go back to your creativity because -in the masculine spectrum- it has already been a while since Kenzo Pour Homme, Kenzo Air and Kenzo Homme Night.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Kenzo Homme Night is an original take on coconut for men that is never too beachy or excessively summery.It smells fairly sweet though quite well-balanced as well, ends up being very long-lasting with satisfactory sillage, and remains quite unfairly off the radar.

At the same time it stays healthily distant from other Kenzo pour Homme offerings, and more than a flanker should be a perfume on its own merit. I am a bit biased here because I like Kenzo Homme Night quite a lot.

I wear it sometimes in the spring, at daytime, and fits many different occasions without being inappropriate. If you are looking for something ""coconutty"" that does not remind you of women's coconut perfumes, I believe this fits the bill. Apart from that, I can smell a little bit of pepper probably, and a fleeting undertone of mango,oh wait, or is it fig?

Be careful if you like your coconut to smell fresh, like with Virgin Island Water or ""cocktail-smelling"" like with Tommy Bahama Set Sail St Barts or Calvin Klein One Summer 2014. Those lean towards a fresher interpretation of notes, in my opinion. The Kenzo is more like raw coconut flesh, for better or worse.

In a way, KPH could be a distant, masculine cousin of Bronze Goddess (by Estée Lauder) maybe.

I would give it a 9/10, but you must like coconut (conspicuous by its absence in the notes description) to enjoy it.",04/12/17 11:29,Vaporwave

The longevity is about 6 hours and the sillage is really heavy. The most distinguished notes are coconut, mango, grapefruit, cardamon, coriander and tonka bean.

It is a warm weather scent but I do not reccomend it for the very warm summer days. It is perfect for summer evenings, spring and warm autumn days.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"WEATHER / SEASON : all-year around (just go easy on the sprayer during warmer days)

TIME / : night and day

WHICH MAN ? : Mainly youngsters (teenagers + young adults). I'd develop that part below...

SCENT / FEEL : 16/20. I know many male 'fragranticians"" are bored with the current trend of fruity scents. But if you want TROPICAL fruity scent, not the usual citrus/red fruits/apple, etc. this is a fair candidate. Not groundbreaking (I do get the sun tan lotion comparison) BUT well made.

I got mainly mango (top and middle) and tonka beans (drydown).. AND some coconut-y smell, all throughout, which is strange because it's not listed ! Must be the result of woods and spices being mix with mango? i don't know, but I know I love it.
It's not a linear scent at all, it does evolve. You go mango > coconut (?) > tonka and spices. It's quite well blended in my opinion, it evolves quite naturally, and the drydown is creamy with the tropical vibe remaining.

LONGEVITY : 8/10 - Very good longevity as usual with kenzo. I get a 8h+ from this one, and I love the fact that the top notes (mainly mango and that coconut-y smell) linger on for a fairly long time as main notes (~2h) and you still can detect them in the drydown. It even lasts longer on clothes.

PROJECTION / SILLAGE : 7/10 . Quite powerful for the first hour, then becomes a skin scent, but with fair projection (I'd say 1-foot projection for ~4h) and the sillage is rather weak. Which is weird, because, if oversprayed, it goes on the cloying side.

OVERALL : 15,50 /20

NOTES / ADD INFO :
Many were disappointed with this one because of the deja-vu ""teenage"" smell it has. I do understand the disappointment. It seems Kenzo tried to go mainstream with this one, they wanted their Le male or 1-Million it's quite a letdown compared to the other Kenzo offerings if you expect the Kenzo ""originality"" when it comes to their fragrances. I guess they need more money and wanted to launch something more accessible, likeable by the majority (I do like Kenzo pour Homme, but I detect a slight nail polish remover in it that kept me from buying it).
BUT this one wins as a candidate regarding TROPICAL scents available to men... When requesting a tropical scent for men its always the same 4/5 bottles : Virgin Island Water, l'Artisan Timbuktu, Tommy Bahama St Barts Sail, Jennifer Lopez Deseo... You know what? I prefer this ONE over those others. Looks like the only 'tropical' note available to men is coconut, this one at least has mango, which is a rather rare and interesting note. And It does the job very well as a tropical.
Nice to wear for all seasons as well, just make sure to use it sparingly during summer (though not sure a more mature man, says, in his 50 would pull it off. Maybe still too fruity to some)",04/04/15 11:20,Moonchild1985

Kenzo Homme Night is sweet and fruity heavy on mango and tonka. It does remind me of OTB wild but I have to say that I find it as the winter version of wild as it is thicker, heavier and warmer. People say that it's a summer fragrance but I have to disagree. It's not bad in summer but to me it's more suited to be worn in fall, winter and early spring. That is how I find it.

It's fresh, sweet, fruity-synthetic and ""happy"" kind of fragrance, though if smelled obsesively can be compared in some way to the original Kenzo Homme. Overall, it's quite nice, but not as unique as 1991's Homme. Not sure if I like it in complete.",11/27/14 14:25,misbehavin
Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"How can some people compare Kenzo Night with Virgin Island Water? Kenzo Night and VIW are like oil and water. Although they have similar notes the coco-lime combo in Kenzo is too synthetic, while VIW notes are decidedly natural. On the other hand I don't get the mango note mentioned in several reviews. IMO Kenzo Night has a woodsmoke-leathery accord (maybe rosewood) which is similar to that found in Carolina Herrera's CH men and 212 VIP, Calvin Klein's Obsession Night, and other gourmand scents. Kenzo Night is not bad at all but differs greatly in quality and originality from Virgin Island Water.",10/21/14 22:22,jotalopez

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"All Summer bottled by Kenzo
A fragrance I've been looking for ever since Obsession Night was discontinued.
Off course nothing could equal Obsession Night still Kenzo Night takes the upper hand for its longevity for Obsession Night disappears in 5 minutes.
I was asking myself why they shoved the ""night"" label for these two perfumes as they're typical day perfumes a day at the beach.
Back to the Fragrance it's fruity with coconut in the notes.It's a positive,sexy and fun fragrance.Great longevity and sillage though not cloying at all.
I was stopped many times to be asked about it and everybody around me loves it.",07/04/14 22:50,AngelRock77
Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"I really don't get the comments about it being synthetic: all fragrances are, that's how the manage to make them last long. A different thing is that smells like something you picture in your mind and you don't like the quality of it because you expected some other ""smell image"".

Anyway, I think this is fantastic: there is a coconut vibe as others have stated, and this note is above the mango to my nose. It's like smelling a refined tan lotion, a beachy smell if you will.

The name ""night"" suits it well, as I don't see it being used on the early day (cloying alert). It's meant for the cold to me, so I'll be using this a lot this winter. Nevertheless, this is NOTHING like original Kenzo Homme (which I love but haven't owned).

If you like sweet different fragrances, try this.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Terribly synthetic, unfortunately. I agree it's not Kenzo'ish. They used to do good stuff, not flops like this.

It's too sweet for me. Guaiac wood+tonka+mango=I'm done. I don't detect straight coconut, but I agree it has kinda' oriental vibe to it.

Unfortunately, synthetic notes are here. I immediately thought: ""It reminds me of Paco Rabanne's Invictus"". They share the synthetic aspect. And Kenzo Homme Night also gives me headache.

Longevity is around 10 hours, sillage is good.

I'm dissapointed. It's nowhere similar to good old Kenzo Homme and should get different name. Actually, I couldn't believe the fact that Dominique Ropion made such a disaster!",06/10/14 10:25,Marciu

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Kenzo Night almost surpasses Creed Virgin Island Water regarding the coconut note; however, longevity is only slightly better and the coconut is more artificial/synthetic.

Initial blast of Kenzo pour Homme Night features a strong alcohol vibe.

Then the top notes of Amber-Baby Powder-Suntan Lotion-Vanilla-and COCONUT quickly develop and take over. Very creamy and definitely unique! No one else has it.

The mild and fruity mango also develops. I think the description on Fragrantica is very accurate.

I have tried ALL the coconut scents out there. Trust me when I tell you that I am a COCONUT feind.

If you're like me and wish the coconut in Creed Virgin Island Water had a stronger coconut note, with more sillage and longevity, then you have almost found the right fragrance (although less quality and less well-defined notes).

Kenzo Night is very sweet and not masculine. It flirts with being unisex and is similar in sweetness to Paco Rabanne Black XS and Givenchy Pi, but it never crosses the gender line over to the feminine side.

Kenzo Night is certainly a linear fragrance and much more artificial/synthetic, especially when compared to Virgin Island Water. At times it feels blurry, as if all the notes were thrown together and they're bluntly not mixing well; however, it's the only other coconut scent on the market that I enjoy and find pleasant for my weird tastes. I purchased my 3.4 ounce bottle at Strawberrynet for 80 USD and free shipping. It might hit the online discount retailers for half-price in the future.",05/18/14 14:00,gregmech26
Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Tested today in Barcelona.

It reminds me the mango and coconut yoghurt that I ate when I was a child.

The mango note at the top is very natural although the coconut is very synthetic, but hey, coconut isn't listed. After 20 I get the tonka with some spicies.

Not very masculine until the guaiac note appears (40 min).",05/16/14 10:36,sawyer82

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"It begins with a strong coconut vibe that fades in about two hours and then it smells kind of synthetic. I can sense also some spices and wood accords.
I didn't like it in the first minutes (too much alcohol), then it seemed ok, but after the coconut faded, I didn't like it at all.

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Coconut invasion - that's how I could describe the 2014 trend in masculine perfumery. At first I tried ambery-coconuty Maison Martin Margiela, today had an opportunity to wear the new Kenzo. It starts off very sweet with a smell of coconut aroma stick. After that juicy, unripe, a bit sour mango appears. These two things are all the fragrance is composed of, reminding of mango ice cream with a coconut addition. Absolutely unisex and not Kenzo-ish.

FYI: Dominique Ropion is the perfumer.",03/17/14 12:55,antonpan

Kenzo Homme Night Kenzo,"Tried and bought it today as I fell in love with the mango accord which makes this new perfume unique for sure. It has a remarkable, tropical soul. ""Kenzo homme night"" is linear and the main note is a coconutish mango accord surrounded by some splashes of sour grapefruit, mild spices and soft vetiver under a sweet note of tonka. It has a great potential to be an interesting spring/summer perfume suitable for middle age gentleman. It has a nice, long lasting but moderate sillage. To my nose is more tropical and fruity than seductive and intriging. A great, fun fragrance for fruity coconut, tropical perfume lovers.",02/21/14 17:14,batabidd

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I have what I believe is the current formulation of this (purchased 2 years ago). It's obviously been reformulated as I don't pick up most of the notes that are listed or that others say they smell in vintage versions. Despite that, I do like it and feel that it's a wonderful clean scent for hot summer days. To my nose it's a water lily/bamboo fragrance that somehow manages to smell watery but not aquatic. Nothing ground-breaking but I also can't imagine it being offensive in any way--it smells like you just got out of the shower using a clean shower gel. Soft sillage, and not long-lasting, but it was inexpensive so I don't mind reapplying.",08/08/25 07:43,Gemini12
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"With all the Kenzo's I've sampled I've come to realize all women's fragrances of this brand have a very distinct DNA that I'd describe as oriental poise. Given how delicate they generally are, this DNA often stands out the most, and each new one I try instantly seems familiar. But regarding L'Eau: it is good. Olivier Cresp knows his craft, especially if we talk his earlier works. Kenzo (and perhaps only Kenzo) knows how to deliver this kind of scent, the meaningful minimalism. It smells like water; not the tap kind but the element itself and our mental image of it - the stillness of it, not the calamity. L'Eau feels like a beautiful blend of nature's breath and coolness of urban futurism, what with the impeccable humanly cleanness it emanates alongside the gentle herbal freshness. In the 90s people still dreamt of progress and nature coexisting in harmony, and that harmony manifests itself in this fragrance. It might be popular because it is simple, but it is in fact very special, being the perfect olfactory interpretation of water as a part of nature, the bridge between scent and vision. A delicate timeless fougere that is linear but not in the way that gives you a migraine with its monotone presence. Reed is appropriately sweet for a distinctively herbal note, mint and pepper aren't overdone, the base is soft and perfectly womanly. No fruits for me - maybe the newer formula has been tweaked - but frankly I prefer it that way, a strong fruity accord would only simplify it, not refine. As for performance, in my experience Kenzo fragrances get stronger with time.

Melody it reminds me of: Air - J'ai dormi sous l'eau.",08/07/25 08:33,kittenpawz
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Classic for a reason. My third bottle and an easy reach in summertime.
This was one of my first designer perfumes, and I still remember the awe I felt when I first smelled it in the early 2000s. It’s the perfect everyday fragrance for summer—not suffocating, not loud, not attention-seeking. Just effortlessly clean and aquatic, like a splash of cold water on a hot summer day.
If you find the equation “summer = citrus scent” a bit tiresome, you might enjoy this one. The mandarin orange note is incredibly subtle and supports the top notes rather than overpowering them.",08/05/25 04:11,Berezina
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Nose Note #467

We first had a flanker of this - Kenzo Ice Pour Femme (that review became my first on Fragrantica!). I must say, they are quite similar. Kenzo Ice is about watermelon, this one is about water lily and something like a bamboo note. I think it's really lacking something, because it's withering away as I write these words. It's almost not there even when you spray it. I mean it's there, but I'm finding it difficult to say WHAT is left there. It's immediately a skin scent. Feels like a perfume with no base.
It's very light, also reminds me of the famous mens version of this. Something citrusy and bamboo-like is the main show.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I have vintage (oval shaped bottle) and rectangle shaped L'eau PAR-version of this. Vintage formula is softer. Opening is sweet herbal, like anise or fennel with hint of dry hay. After few hours it turns less sweet and waterlily comes out, dry hay note is still there, but less noticeable. After four hours I smell cedar and dry hay with hint of watery notes. This reminds me of Honore des Pres- Nu Green, very similar dry hay note. Longevity is better in vintage one, imo.
Newer L'eau Par Kenzo: Opening is sharp, very aquatic and herbal at the same time. Strong mint leaf note (sweet and minty) I think mint leaf scent was the strange note that bothered me always. It's very noticeable if you overspray this. After an hour this turns out very nice aquatic fresh, I smell waterlily, lilac and hint of peach. And then it's gone. Weak hay scent with musk. So sad.
I would like to try the newest L'eau Kenzo-version of this. I prefer vintage formula because it has good longevity and scent is close enough to newer formula.",06/16/25 03:08,Moukka

Either I can't remember how it originally was, or my skin chemistry or the weather weren't quite right the last time I wore it more than 5 years ago, which seems more likely.

It's a delightful, powerful water scent best suited for summer days. Super long lasting for its type - 7 hours and a shower after I can still smell it. It's quite linear, not much of a transformation. It's lovely, just don't overspray!",08/10/24 09:21,androidi

I was a child in the 90's but I still remember that decade. Anyway. I assume it's a great aquatic non-beachy fragrance for everyday Summer wear.

My senses have changed though, and the memory of this fragrance smells better to me than it is now. After revisiting, I smell something very synthetic and a bit screechy somewhere in the middle of the dry down. Maybe it was there before and I handn't noticed. It also lacks the depth I remember. It could be because I don't smoke anymore. Nonetheless, it is the freshest aquatic ever, I still wear it from time to time. It suits all kinds of weather and doesn't need overspraying in the winter.

It definitely is straight-up unisex in my opinion and could easily be worn by someone of any gender. Light enough for an office or for someone who doesn't want to overwhelm, but if you're used to big, loud scents or even scents with some amp to them, this one is not for you.",02/01/23 13:49,silverlocusts

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This is what a fresh and clean perfume should smell like in my opinion. I have never found another scent that has such a lightly sweet, aquatic sillage. Spraying this on after a shower makes you feel clean all day.
The opening smells a bit more interesting than a generic aquatic fresh scent, but the magic is in the middle notes. The sillage suddenly becomes much larger. You will be smelling the middle notes like a cloud around you for about three hours. The dry down still smells very clean, just a bit warmer. On skin it retains the aquatic notes a bit more, on clothes the vanilla is more noticeable.

I feel like you can quickly overspray this EDT though, as the middle notes are so strong.
It might be my skin chemistry, but one spray on my wrist is enough for me to notice it for a couple of hours.",12/08/22 02:50,Flared Maple
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I didn´t know L'eau pour Femme before but I got it as a birthday gift this year. Composed of pepper and peach, my top favorite notes, and created in 1996. The best and the most nostalgic gift for my 30's that instantly takes me to the times of Spice Girls, Friends and latin telenovelas of that era.❤️🙏🏻
Unfortunately, the silage and longevity are very, very weak. Tommy Girl by Tommy Hilfiger, also created in 1996, is one of my signature scents since very early on. However, if I had discovered L'eau by Kenzo instead of Tommy Girl, definitely it would have been my signature.",10/18/22 01:28,LadyM

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I am interested in this perfume since it’s someone’s favorite. I tested it at a department store.
From the beginning, it’s fresh, but something weird stuck my nose. I have no idea what it was, however it has gone after 10 minutes. It was very beautiful smell like a woman who slightly makes up with flowerly lotion. I could smell some peach and flowers. It sounds strange, but I could catch watermelon scent.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t last at all. After 40 minutes, the scent has almost gone.",08/14/22 10:54,Tarine

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Just tested the Vintage (Oval bottle with blue ring on cap) AND the New Release (clear, rectangular, wavy bottle)

VINTAGE: Smells appealing in the bottle. Upon application, the top notes are non-existent I smell a bitter Pepper & Violet. (my face is scrunched up) as the alcohol burns off it mellows to a beautiful scent reminding me of a dry floral. The beauty is short lived as the base notes appear within 20 minutes. Cedar dominates. I really wish I could wash this off.

NEW RELEASE: Ah! The promise of the Reed and a whiff of Mandarin, but it's not a main player. I even smell the lilac! The middle stage is lengthy, fresh and clean. 20 minutes in and the base notes are behaving themselves anchoring the Water Lily. This is lovely.

Both bottles were full, so oxygen degradation did not factor in much. Final thoughts....my chemistry hated the Vintage, I would purchase a bottle of the new",07/14/21 16:33,FiaM

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"What is the difference between L'eau par Kenzo and the newer L'eau Kenzo? Because I don't see a page on Fragrantica for regular ""L'eau Kenzo,"" and I have no idea which one people are writing reviews for here.

I recently tried L'eau Par Kenzo. I thought it would be better/stronger/longer lasting than the new version, assuming ""L'eau Kenzo"" is a reformulation. I'm glad I didn't blind buy a vintage full bottle for over $100 because I sadly don't like it that much. I don’t know which note is throwing me off, but it just smells ""old."" Maybe one of the florals just doesn't agree with me, or maybe it's turned, I don't know. I like fresh perfumes and some aquatics/ozonics/marines, so after reading the reviews here I truly thought I'd love it.

Maybe I should try the newer L'eau Kenzo. I just wish I knew what the difference was. Maybe I'll email Kenzo co. on their site. If anyone who's tried both versions has any insight to add, that would be helpful to people reading up on this (/these) perfumes!",04/24/21 06:52,lucidvisi0n
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"On first spray I thought I’d found another favourite. The lilac was immediately noticeable but gentle, as was the elusive suggestion of dew drops with none of the chemical harshness of so many aquatics. And just the right amount of fresh, ambiguous green-ness for my personal taste. For all of fifteen seconds I was mentally crossing off all the perfumes I could do away with now that I found this one. Eclat d’Arpege, Jardin Sur La Toit, all the Isseys... until it started to smell familiar. Then I realized it was morphing into a carbon copy of Green Tea Lavender on my skin, which is not terrible, but I already have a giant bottle of that and never reach for it. All I can smell now is coarse green tea and citrus. After its beautiful start, I’m just left feeling deprived.",04/23/21 17:44,SalinasL

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This is not a just a fragrance, but a space defining, ethereal openness. The scent is absolutely transparent; a dazzling, free-flowing, intangible air opens the lungs. That is not to say it doesn't possess substance; it is to say the composition transcends the confines of its space. This perfume becomes the breath around you, and feels thoughtfully unimposing. Green and aquatic notes are in total balance and lift vertical space. Fresh and musky elements create horizontal blithe and longevity. I guard myself against saying its perfection. At times, it comes across as a bit synthetic and sharp, and one can over spray, thinking more will be better. However, as a whole, it is truly beautiful. Even the pepper notes are calmly assertive, and rest peacefully with flirty touches of peach and mandarin. This seems to be another Kenzo perfume forgotten, and thankfully so, because prices are reasonable and supply is obtainable. What a lovely surprise to find such a spiritually clean scent after a long, oppressively hot summer.",09/19/20 23:50,echurch1979

I say this because in the 90s when this was released there were dozens of other aquatics that were released but unfortunately a lot of them are too heavy on the lotus!/melon for my taste. This is something else. This is incredibly well balanced and calming. It has a definitive top, middle and dry down. It starts off quite green with a tea vibe, then the lilacs come out and in the end you can smell the water lily and vanilla. Such a genius creation.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This is just beautiful, the most natural smelling aquatic that I've come across to date!

L'eau par isn't widely available in the UK, actually other than Kenzo World and Flower, we don't get many of Kenzo's other offerings (at least, to my knowledge) so when I saw this circulating around on Fragrantica, read the notes list and fell in love with the really cool bottle, I went on a mission online to try and get a bottle.

So, firstly I thought this was discontinued but its still on Kenzo parfums' website, and there are new flankers of it about on there too. Notino stock L'eau Par on their website and Allbeauty also stock the 50ml and 100ml bottles, so I'm glad I can repurchase this one when my currently 30ml runs out.

If anyone looks at my wardrobe, I have a lot of summery, citrussy and aquatic fragrances, but I really wanted something that was different from L'eau D'issey (cold, wet flowers) and Davidoff Cool water (salty melon, juicy fruit gum) that was more grassy, fresh and maybe a little bit sporty, L'eau Par is all of those things!

So, L'eau Par is fresh, its cold, super clean and very modern/city-like, the first spritz is a really strong citrussy hit which sort of veers into bathroom cleaner territory but it settles into an icy, slightly floral and grassy scent, but theres something in this which gives it a vodka/gin like nuance as well, not quite sure what note or combination of notes does that, but it really makes this feel like you're drinking either a fresh, iced gin and tonic or an iced glass of water.

Silage is very good, being on lockdown, I'm around my parents a lot and they have noticed the refreshing breeze coming from me and have positively commented on it, the longevity is very good, I can get about 7 hours worth of wear from this with 5 sprays.

I think this may actually become my signature scent, its so effortless and fresh, I'll be ordering a bigger bottle soon because I don't think my 30ml bottle will be full for very long!",04/15/20 07:26,GinCatsBooks

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This is so not for me. Too fresh, nothing there to keep me interested. Kind of a cheap vibe to it too. The drydown is a bit better than sprayed on fresh, but still..No, not for me. I like Parfum d`Ete though, it`s proper crisp fresh, a bit more interesting.

EDIT: 2021 AUGUST - I came across a small bottle recently and tried it again. It's summer, scorching heat, so I'd only touch certain scents with aqua-ozonic notes now. I've used this a few days in a row now and it's growing on me. I get waterlily and pepper mostly with a bit of synthetic musk, synthetic citrus and something fresh, probably mint.. I still don't think this would make it anywhere near my top 20, but nice to have it now anyway, to try something different. Other than that I'd put it in the same ballpark as Elizabet Arden's Green Tea flankers.. It works great especially after shower or in the morning when you start the day.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I think of this as my favorite and signature scent. When you wear this, you will feel calm , pure, loving and intelligent. Slightly gives the feminine tone, but generally feels like unisex scent to me. Suits every season; especially in summer. I wear it often in daily basis.
This has so much meaning to me, because this is my first perfume I ever bought for myself. I fell in love instantly while shopping. Until then, when I was a teenager, didn't wear any perfume. When I became 20s, I started to wear some of my sister's perfume. However, those were generally too floral and sweet to be comfortable for me. In my world then, I thought every perfume for female smelled like flower, citrus and sugar...so, Kenzo was a pleasantly surprising scent.
First impression of this perfume would be 'scent of fresh water'. It feels a lot like swimming. Or, feels like moist fog at dawn. I can't really pin down the scent.",05/23/19 23:59,peppertoki

It was a beautiful summer scent, with the waterlily being the most prominent on me. Even though it was a fresh scent, it did not feel 'cold' on me. The vanilla gave it a lovely soft warm vibe while allowing it to retain its water-like refreshing character. I could not pick up any other specific notes, very well blended. the staying power was not great and neither was sillage, touch ups throughout the day were required.

So, after testing, it is indeed a very pleasant and wearable scent but I am not at all in love.
The lilac and the water lily are overwhelming on my skin, meaning that this fragrance reads as quite sweet, almost like honey. I do get some mint and some pepper but they are gone way before the fragrance has begun to dry down. On the whole, the fragrance on my skin is warm when I was anticipating and hoping for something cooler.
I am also disappointed in the longevity.

Wearing it makes me feel like I've just came out of the cold shower. There's something very special and significant about Kenzo's L'eau fragrances (both the female and male version), it's not like any other fresh summer scent, this one gives you not just a refreshment, but the complete scent with idea and character. All the notes work great together.

One person said it smells like grass, the other friend said it's delightful cucumber.

Its very aquatic, ozonic scent. Its not fresh like Cool Water, not flowery like fresh like Halloween(J Del Pozo), its just smells like fresh air, with a touch of sweetness.

$20.00 for a one ounce bottle that looks like a melted ice cube.

I knew Kenzo was a ""quality"" house-- so at worst I'd have something I could re-sell at my local flea market !

LILAC! I did not expect that as the box pictures a white flower with a blue background.
Lilac then watery grass....greens....sweet...lazy.....pretty....giddy...
My favorite Lilac is from Pacifica and this one is good too--and develops more. The ingredients are natural smelling and high quality!

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"An early review - 16/12/16

I just recently acquired this perfume. I have had my eye on it for a long time though! The reviews and information seem to project it as a green perfume. I don't think it is very green, although it IS watery. It is a fresh, ozone-y smell with some strange sweetness (it doesnt translate to vanilla for me). I like it, and I definitely think it is very unisex. I could smell it on me for a while but I am not sure how people around me received it.

I will update this review as i discover more about the perfume.",12/16/16 05:43,Stararmour

There is one thing I want to add: it smells like rain in the bottle to me, but not while walking on the beach or in the wild; more like refreshing rain after busy, hot day in the urban jungle. The air is colder, reviving, relieving...

I am going to comment on it's silage - I used to think it was a very soft perfume and that most people couldn't smell it unless they were quite close, however, one of the ladies at work who also likes perfume and has asked what it is I'm wearing on a number of occasions, has commented that she can smell it walking past my office. Yesterday when she commented again on how I'm wearing her favourite perfume of mine as she walked past, she later told me (about 7 hours after applying it) that she now needed to put her head into my office before she could smell it. I sit about 10 feet from the office door, never knew it's silage was so good.",04/14/16 00:10,MindyMe
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This fragrance appealed to me when I was eighteen. The very first scents I liked were light, fresh, citrusy, aquatic, clean, and unisex; kind of like youth, I guess.",04/06/16 15:34,TexBex
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I read the rave reviews about this one being an amazing refreshing scent, and blind ordered this with a few other refreshing perfumes like Lalique Fleur de Cristal. This was by far the most expensive and have the weakest projection. This smells exactly like a scent called Peace Love and Daisies, with even less projection with absolutely no longevity, lasting no longer than 30 minutes. This one is also not unique to me. Very disappointed.

Scent: 2/10 (I mean 2 is being generous because I can't even smell it!)
Longevity: 1/10, (I can barely smell it after initial scent, nevermind an hour after)
Sillage: lol",03/27/16 13:59,MarnaL
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Hello With Love from Paris,
As a man I enjoy Kenzo and i think this perfume is unisex with a curve of sensuality for men and women.
I wear it with confidence and it is unique in a world of Pour Homme.
In spring and specially summer it's a good horse to bet. cool/fresh/floral,
Mr. Olivier Cresp is an Artist due to creating a floral perfume that is fresh and cold. Bravo and Bingo for me.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I love to feel this perfume when I am working out, its freshness is energizing and stimulating. I am not the one to be too crazy about fresh scents but this one I do enjoy quite a lot, probably because the lilac and water lily feel so natural.
L'Eau par Kenzo has a lovely sweetness to it too, probably the vanilla (which remains subtle at all times).
When I apply it it makes me feel like I am being caressed by the rays of sun during spring-time.
The lasting power is medium, but even that is more than most aquatics.",02/28/16 17:05,Akarui_hana
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"The lightest and freshest fragrance i've ever used. This was my favorite when i was 17/18 yo. It is indeed a smell that makes you feel comfortable and is very nice for the summer. Water lily game is strong on my skin, fresh floral scent even after hours.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This water smells like early spring days...
You know this time of the year when the first grass appears but still are patches of snow here and there...
When sun is shining but air is chilly and you are still wearing a coat even though it's springtime...
That contradiction is captured in most delicate way. Scent is cold/warm and fresh/sweet. It changes all the time from chilly wind to warm sunshine. From water lily to vanilla, from smashed grass/fresh cucumber to juicy peach.
It was my signature for few years and I could wear even for night time because of unusual chameleon character. Like 2 nature substances would be fighting in one bottle and you never know which will be winner today.
Nothing compares to this.",01/17/16 07:59,mona1

Like a fresh white snow sparkling in the sun. Citrucy, fresh, crisp, light, and i loved it! The perfect cold-wintery smell which is amazing all year around.
Unfortunately, Kenzo seemed to change the formula a bit, because now it is much sweeter than it was back then. IDK, may be different manufacturers?
Even though, the smell is still amazing- one downside only- sillage and longevity are very weak. (at least on me :( )",12/08/15 13:20,Missisjoker

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I'm still new here at fragrantica, but I simply HAVE TO review this one. It was my first perfume (at the age of 12-13) and I have probably gone through 20 of the 100 ml bottles in all of the 15~ years that I have worn it; it was my signature scent. I have identified with it for so long it's insane, and the search for other perfumes only started this year (2015). When I wear this, I picture taking a walk by a lake an early morning during spring. I live in Sweden, so perhaps you should bear that in mind. Green scenery. A very light breeze. Calm. Timeless. A new day; new beginnings and new opportunities. Unobtrusive. I don't know half of what I'm saying really, but I still adore this scent and I will always have a bottle of it in my collection that is now steadily growing larger! Now the things about it that makes my heart break: both the longevity and the sillage is weak on me. Hence why I needed 20 of the 100 ml bottles... Though maybe that's what you are to expect from fresh/aquatic fragrances? Either way. Love love LOVE it!",09/08/15 03:31,Feeya
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"It's hot today...in Texas we are baking under 103F...of course, I am not going outside but I am lounging around and thinking about an event I will be going to next weekend where there will be 2000(?) people kind of crammed in an auditorium. I have picked out the shoes, the dress, the jewelry...all the girl stuff and I am at a loss for my perfume!!! I cannot wear my favorites...just can't, but can I muddle through the day with a fragrance like this? I have tried SEVERAL floral aquatics including the iconic Issey Miyake. I like it but there is no love...it seems to be missing (for me) a strong grounded base. What I am finding with the L'Eau the peppers, the cedar, the musk and the reed keep the floral fruitiness from becoming unenjoyable to wear. L'Eau is not cloying (first spray may knock you out but it fades fast) it's warm, huggable, non offensive and ladylike with a punch of spice. I would say the longevity is moderate and the sillage is very minimal so I might put mine in a rollerball to touch up. So far it's a go...but you know it is a woman's prerogative to change her mind...",08/07/15 15:58,AngieGCarp
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This fragrance is superb! The opening notes start with a smell that will immediately transport you to a rainforest with the smell of greenery and water (waterfalls to be specific). The drydown (still fresh smelling) is a completely different smell altogether where you can smell a bit of the peach, pepper, mint and lilacs which indeed smells divine! I just love it!

This is one of the very few scents from the 90s that has survived to this day (in the midst of horrible sickly sweet gourmand/fruitchoulli scents) and I hope the house of Kenzo NEVER discontinues this gem of a fragrance as it is very original/unique, high in quality and fairly long lasting.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Also, regarding sillage and longevity, this beautiful scent is one you may not smell on you, but others still do. If you smell a perfume on yourself strongly, it is usually too much.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"This fragrance is my favorite of all time (tied with Issey Miyake original EDT). It is a well kept secret. I own them all (literally). When I wear this, the balance of fresh, sweet, fruity and warm dry down to perfection - a perfect balance. I do wear it more in the Spring/Summer, but I would say that when people guess it is Chanel or Bylgari, I just smile because it is unique.

I would say you need to wear this all day before you make a judgment, and wear it on a warmer day....and around both men and women. Even without their opinion, when you smell your wrist, it will be beautiful and surprising. Not too much...not too little...not too spicy....not too watery, not too innocent, and yes, very natural and comfortable.

What seems like a fragrance of innocence is a colorful blend of emotion with nuances of real life.",05/24/15 10:22,Adjames
L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"I got it today after at least 10 years of pure hatred to this scent, followed by a period of ignorance towards it and summarized by raising curiosity and... well, my high school memories came alive! I thought of my schoolmate who used it and loved it, I suddently recalled my holidays in the Baleares during which I used a body mist by Coty that smelled almost the same as L'Eau Par Kenzo... But most of all - I rediscovered a great, forgotten and underappreciated perfume that still poses some kind of a challenge for me, but I know it will bring me a lot of comfort when the temperatures get high! Now, when the weather is just perfect - that is around 20 Centigrade with some rain, sun and wind, this perfume is a bit irritating as the mint and salty notes are too strong. But it's simply not the right time for it. If I were to go to the Carribean or anywhere else hot, this would be a must in my suitcase!!! It's amazingly refreshing and cool, I
think I bought it a bit sooner than I bacame ready for it but I really, really want to try and love it!!!:)
EDIT: Today it was hot, 33 Centigrade plus a really strong and dry Eastern wind blew until the long awaited storm came in the late afternoon. In these arrid conditions, hours before the storm, L'eau passed the test in flying colors! So refreshing, exotic, slightly salty but in a non-disturbing way - like the perfect sea breeze!

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Perfectly transferred to the smell of clean freshwater lakes. There, on the water surface, serenely lie head of water lilies and recorded flying birds. Near the shore the wind softly swaying strings of reeds. As if the nose inhale countryside.

However, there is one ""but"" - this summer idyll turns into a steamy, hot, stale, stagnant water with Tina, duckweed and the frog ""songs"". Out of nowhere appears in the water tumbled down the old tree, and the song begins to give bitter soaked wood...

Fall and spring this fragrance again serene and pure again you can feel the freshness of the water surface and steppe wind.
Winter fragrance starts tinkling crystal, reminiscent of the rapid mountain river, and in extreme cold, he really icy. Unusual metamorphosis.

Sadly (so sadly) it doesn't last long :( I mean I am not expecting the perfume to last 12 hours, but you have to spray on your clothes, arms, hair to feel it during the day. I think it is so light fragrance that if you are on an enviroment or room with other strong fragrances/smells, it just... let's say it just blends in...

I went on a quest today to examine some fresh and clean fragrances I had previously selected in order to satisfy my crave for ""watery"" and ""weightless"". I sniffed and tested and analysed and when I was on my way out of the perfumery shop, disappointed of the ""I've seen it all before"" feeling, I took a glance at L'Eau. An old time classic, back from the days I couldn't afford a real perfume, only sniffed from a distance on those smiling and flawless young ladies on their way to a summer night randez-vous. Never mind...

So on my way out I sprayed L'Eau on my forearm and sighed in relief I hand't just passed it by. It was so beautiful, so grassy, I felt the freshness of the mint, it was so light and sparkly. I instantly loved this creation! My happiness was so honest and oh, so short. In 10 minutes all was gone, it was all lost to a blunt soapy mess. It was this swamp that had somehow swallowed and digested the green grass meadow from before.

Once I decided to try it despite that I am not really into aquatics.
It starts on me with a strange mix actually made me remember eternity...no !
Well thats only first seconds, then turns into a quite pleasant lilac and honey smell...nice. have not yet got the mint wich is too bad , probably hidden somewhere.. the heart is really lovely with pepper lotus and a large doze of violet wich together with the cedar vanilla and musk creates a lovely SOFT woody trail wherever I go. Very nice to wear even though it might be softer than the perfumes I normally wear. But I was searching for an aquatic , not too sweet for those hot summer days , and I found one that will work.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"After reading a lot of reviews of this perfume here, I finally made an online purchase of Kenzo L'eau Par EDT. This was a blind-buy and I received it yesterday. I love water perfumes and I was very excited to smell this as this is my first Kenzo perfume.
Today, the first day of wearing it, I am actually confused as to my feelings towards this smell. It starts off great as many other people have noted but after few minutes, it smelled like watermelons to me! It is probably because it is summer, 38-40 degrees where I am but I thought this was summer perfume.
About the longevity- As I said, it is hot where I am right now so I put on like 5-8 sprays and some on my clothes for it to stay all day long. The good part is that no matter how much you spray, it won't be much to give you a headache. It is very light and fresh. But I stopped smelling it after a while and at the end of the day, I could smell a bit of it. So, I didn't find the longevity to be good. I didn't carry this perfume as it is 100ml and too heavy to be put in my handbag.
To sum up- I do like this perfume but it is not special to me. This can be used everyday and you can use lots of I would use it up soon but won't buy it again.

It's the same crisp, clean scent that I remembered. It's inoffensive yet complicated. I prefer using it in the winter time, somehow it reminds me of snow. I think this is a perfume that either you love or hate. It's definately not for everybody.",05/16/13 15:10,Viridis

I doubt if it's suitable for a really hot summer day. I think it's better for spring and autumn. The longevity is moderate, about 4 or 5 hours.

But on my skin it opens up into something sour, almost urine-like for the first 10-15minutes. The dry down is sweet like icing sugar and strong undertones of lotus and bamboo(?) alongside some sort of pepper+musk combination.

This is an aquatic scent, but instead of being a marine/ocean-y scent, this is the scent of lakes, of rivers, of ponds. If it had a colour, it would be a greenish blue colour.

It is very zen-like, cold and calming. Perfect when the heat is searing hot.

I do like it, but maybe I wouldn't buy a 100ml bottle. Doesn't seem to suit my personality because it gives a feminine, delicate aura which I am surely not known for. Maybe I may grab a small bottle. Hmmm...

Longevity is pretty good, 3 hours and it's still going strong. After several uses, i conclude it lasts around 6-8 hours on my skin, way better than the homme version. Sillage is soft/moderate.

EDIT: Got meself a 30ml widdle bottle.
Plus it seems to complement my Crabtree&Evelyn's aloe Vera moisturiser as they are both herbaceous smelling.
And, it goes great with Elizabeth Arden's green tea!! It tones down the floral notes and amps up the fresh, sweet icyness of the scent.",04/13/13 21:36,IsaIsabella

this perfume is wonderful. it reminds me of clear lemonade, for some reason. a wonderful, sickly sweet scent on entry, it then calms down. but it's far too brief and fleeting. sometimes lasts less than an hour with multiple sprays. i want to remove this from 'my circulation' but it smells too nice to leave it behind.

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Vanilla1975 got it right. This must be tested on the skin (and waited out) to be truly be appreciated. Upon inital spray I was ready to run to scrub it off. It opens very strong, piercing and sharp. After a few minutes, while distracted doing something else, I kept getting this waft of loveliness, fresh, vibrant and crisp. It is definately aquatic but not in the usual marine way. I must admit, occassionaly something off-putting(proably the cedar) rears its head but almost immediately the other lovelies push it back down into obscurity and I'm happy again. It is exotic, like an amazonian waterfall with beautiful flowers floating in the calm at the bottom.",12/14/12 00:39,40plus&fab

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"Oh woah. L'eau Par Kenzo is one big, bold, crisp aquatic.

A wave of flowery freshness greets your nostrils when you first smell L'eau. This is just a sheer, white, elegant and a very pretty floral. This is very very very beautiful and therefore it is not overbearing.

The middle is a little bit of a warmed-up version of these water-like flowers. I recently noticed how the word ""flowers"" can be split into two - ""flow"" and ""ers"". That means flowers are etymologically things that flow with the water. This is very appreciable for this sort of a scent.

The base is like a watery cucumber-cedar combination with a little bit of stony amber. Pleasant and sophisticated and requires a woman who is not dirty at all - just very neat and clean. Very simple and has a low understanding curve.

I simply have no words for this stellar combination. Very beautiful, simple and also very elegant and feminine. I love L'eau Par Kenzo forever. Kudos.",10/31/12 02:14,EauSensuelle

I found it a very light scent that's a little sweet as well. I'm not very good at picking up notes, but I definitely get the floral aquatic concept and find it really interesting how this can be so subtle and fresh without being citrus.

As much as I like it, I find it *very* light and rather a common scent - somewhat of a shower gel/body splash smell. I still want to try Moschino Funny! and I hope they differ a bit in that aspect.

I recommend L'eau par Kenzo for women who like light and fresh fragrances that are still feminine and a bit sweet. And for people that are sensitive to perfumes, etc. as this is a so subtle and pleasant.",09/16/12 13:01,lbean

L'Eau par Kenzo Kenzo,"One of the most interesting aquatic perfumes I have ever found. Compared with other aquatics (which I feel as the sea in storm, swift river, ocean in winter) it is just a different type of water - some forest lake with ripples in summer, dewdrops in its shady bank, light breeze and busy little animals all around.

It is surprisingly soft and subtle yet playful. Reed, lotus, pink pepper and cedar are the notes I can detect the best; and the last nicely blends in relatively warm finish. It feels much warmer sniffed directly on the skin, while sillage is quite airy and fresh even after several hours. That is what makes me like this perfume so much, as well as reed note which I just love. Strangely, at times in the drydown I can even feel musk and among top notes something from black currants.",04/15/12 16:45,Liene

Time for Peace Kenzo,"I lived in Florida between 1998 and 2000. On my few shopping trips, I have discovered a Sephora branch in a mall that would sell this creation for a limited time only.
Sucked into the sales pitch of the assistant, I bought a bottle that had a hole in the thick base. A paper was rolled up and stuck in there.
Just like a message roll you'd stick into a bottle to be thrown into a stream.

The message was the word ""peace"" translated into the world's most important languages.

I thought it was a nice marketing ploy. Okay, the scent was not bad but halfway into the 100ml bottle I somehow got bored of it.

It was somewhat woody and sweet. I think there was patchouli and vetiver as the base and this sweet fruity top. That is all I can remember.

Not exactly ground-breaking but not a disaster either. If you have missed it, don't worry for we have so many more better products today.",03/22/14 17:41,originaldeftom
Time for Peace Kenzo,"Having recently become the proud owner of bottle no. 16,693 from a total run apparently of 200,000 bottles worldwide, I can tell you this scent is one of Kenzo's very best for men. Any of its top notes are fleeting and insignificant, before it moves into a beautifully smooth, rich and elegant nutty accord which is highly reminiscent of the smell of a premium quality rice wine. At this point it smells very close to the cool and spicy L’eau de ST Dupont Pour Homme but with much higher quality ingredients. It eventually dries down to a wonderful and long lasting vetiver base that is quite similar to that of Kenzoair. Beautiful, calming and elegant are the three words that I think best summarize this amazing fragrance. This and Kenzoair (unsurprisingly) are my favourite use of vetiver in the entire fragrance world. Strangely, I always find myself being pulled towards it in my fragrance wardrobe but usually resist the temptation with great difficulty as I want to treasure this hard-to-find gem for a long long time :))

In my humble opinion the carton is too plain. However, I love the simple elegance of the bottle which also holds a scroll of paper in its base with an uplifting message inscribed in multiple languages.",05/18/12 10:40,iconoclast
Time for Peace Kenzo,"Was one of the lucky few who received a bottle upon its release. I love the little roll of paper containing some text, slipped into the circular space at the base of the bottle. The fragrance is clean and refined, the way I would expect a man in his 40s with a small but significant art collection and an air of quiet authority to smell. The first crisp notes are quite unisex, but the scent develops into something warm and unmistakeably masculine, especially in hot weather. I'm a woman but I wear this at home, and to sleep. The name suits it perfectly.",01/29/12 11:53,Lakambini

Anyway, I don’t love this but I also don’t hate it. It is very sweet and it doesn’t have much in the way of grounding notes. I thought marmalade was going to make for an interesting note, but this is a super sweet linear black currant perfume. If you’re in the camp that likes La Vie Est Belle and the like, you’ll probably like this.

It’s pretty fleeting. Longevity is like 2 hours before I am either anosmic or it has simply evaporated. Projection is close. That’s to be expected or something with such a small note pyramid, though.",05/12/21 01:02,vetiverberry

Couleur Kenzo Violet Kenzo,I like little weird fruity/sweet fragrances like this. When I first spray it is kind of intense. Black Current or Red Current is the first thing I get hit with along with violet and something kind of jammy. I do not smell blueberry but I want to. I don't get too much powder. This is better in summer but I have not tried in the winter so I can't be sure. I see people complaining about longevity but it lasts a couple of hours on me.

The reviews you see here are spot on - Kenzo Violet is sweet, light, fresh and has a strong blackcurrant note. When first applied it's sweet and strong but in 30 minutes it's barely there on my skin anymore. But it's alright, I don't always want to make a statement with my perfume.

I love black currant. This perfume reminds me taking a shower. Probably because black currant is a common ingredient for bath products here.

Violet is innocent and sweet and blackcurranty and too shy to stay in your precence for too long. But it cheers me up and I enjoy the short happyness it gives.

I also adore the bottle. It's a simple styled beauty.",06/21/15 11:56,venomkisses

On the other hand, this perfume is very light and inoffensive, after a few minutes you can barely smell it... Maybe it will depend on people but the smell is so light here !

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I registered here just to write my review on this particular perfume, as I myself am overjoyed that I got it and want to share this joy.
I received a sample size some 15 years ago and fell in love with it, asking my dad to bring it from the trip he was going to. He brought Kenzo Flower instead of Summer saying that this fragrance is no longer in stores and I tried hard to hide my dissapointment. Years and years I was desperately looking for something clean, soapy and chic at the same time and none of the bottles in my shelf made it to become my very favourite signature scent. Until not sure what made me remember about this perfume. I was determined to find it and I did. I ordered one and as soon I received it, I just fell into a time capsule of such a nostalgy and joy! The way the scent plays on my skin and clothes is just incredible and even though many reviewers do not like the soapiness it gives, I absolutelly love it in the combination of other notes of fresh flowers and powder. It is not just another fresh scent, it has a soul and I trully think that if you want to charm someone, this is it.
Another story is really the pain of it being discontinued… If you are able to find it, the price will be high. I bought 3 bottles and consider it as an investment in my overall image and my great mood when I wear it.",03/10/23 08:43,Sandrazhe
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"This is unique and I'm dying to get a bottle of it.
I only have a mini and I treasure it .
I didn't know I could love mimosa until I tried summer by kenzo.
The mimosa here is fluffy creamy sunshine
It's a chameleon that changes according to the season .
It's clean soapy fresh floral with hints of green in summer
It's a cloud of creamy lotiony powdery almondy mimosa in winter
It's perfect all year round.
It's natural ,smooth and feminine.
The notes blends together seemlessly the bright uplifting citrus and dewy green fresh white flowers with a hint of indole from jasmine softened by subtle musk and creamy milky almonds and there's a little sweetness and a subtle woodiness adorned by this beautiful powdery veil from violet and all of these notes supports the stunning fluffy sophisticated warm mimosa.
There's hints of baby powder or baby lotion and a buttery feel to it.
It's divine
You wear this and the world became peaceful,safe and calm and you feel relaxed ,adored and carefree in the embrace of your beloved one while sitting in a beautiful summer meadow.
It may seem simple but it's complex and well made .
It's light ,airy , delicate, uplifting,warm, clean,fresh,sophisticated and feminine .",03/06/23 14:58,5hinee

It's a little almondy and creamy and warm and delicious and it reminds me of how much I miss summer and I can't wait for it to get here!!! Until then...this baby will have to do!

Update: it's summer and this is pure magic in the sun. The hot weather does something amazing where it takes this and makes it soapy clean and sweet on my skin. Not really fresh tho, just clean.

I would describe it as the most expensive mimosa soap you ever smelled, with a hint of citruses in the opening, creamy almond and woody base. It makes people wanna come closer to you and smell you again and again. My best friend used to give me a hug and take a very deep breath every time I wore Summer by Kenzo.

I cant believe that someone came to the conclusion to `discontinue this and released something like Flower by Kenzo, which I absolutely cant stand.",08/08/20 06:54,krasinka_stst
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"Just tried the Kenzo Summer splash. I am getting a vibe of the yellow pump bottle of Vaseline lotion circa 1980s, which my mother kept stocked. Kenzo Summer smells powdery, floral and clean, with a splash of citrus.

Edit: Late summer day, the drydown reveals the “summer” aspect. It smells of a crisp ozonic floral you might get out of a nice sunscreen.",06/01/20 20:12,—}—@ darlingbud
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"My absolute favorite for about 10 years now, I also found this one on ebay. Yay. The closest perfume I found to this one was shewood golden light from Dsquared, but omg the real thing is so much better. I keep falling into the trap of buying and trying so many other perfumes with mimosa in it. but I really don't smell that in any of them.Love this one, it needs to come back.",05/27/20 16:27,meemee00
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"Thanks to Ebay I was able to repurchase this gem. As soon as this pandemic is gone I will purchase whatever bottles I can find. Why? Coz this is a masterpiece.
This is the creamiest yellow flower green perfume ever. All day it sits around you like a cloud of creamy goodness. It has a powerful body, character, longevity and siage.
There's nothing like it in the spring, on your scarf, maybe Poeme by Lancome, which is not as creamy. If it wasn't discontinued I would make it my signature. Why do all good things come to an end?
This should have never left the shelves. I guess people are not into green sexy florals anymore. They just want sugar bombs.
It's much more complex and beautiful then other niche fragrances I have smelled.
It's my greatest wish that Kenzo would bring it back.",03/22/20 05:34,crisjoy
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I found myself another bottle of Summer by Kenzo, still a beauty and in perfect condition, 1 spray goes a long way and Summer dances around you for many, many hours. One of a kind. I tried other Mimosa- heavy scents- no one compares to Summer.",01/17/20 01:17,Mooniq
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I know that sense of smell is most tightly linked to memory.
Kenzo Summer really brings that home for me.
My father, who I have always adored, smelled faintly of dial soap.
Every time I wear this, I get soapy notes that remind me of him and of my childhood.
It’s a surprisingly visceral connection.",11/26/18 12:40,Pacurtis1
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"Kenzo Summer is truely a mimosa perfume.I can pickup mimosa from the first minute,but there's also citrus freshness and light and clean florals.It's lovely,gentle and feminine.it reminds me Guerlain Champs Elysees",09/16/18 15:09,Soofiya
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I don't know how I happened upon Kenzo Summer. Must've been through browsing the list of Kenzo fragrances and wondering why I'd never heard of this one. I read reviews, checked out the notes and found a brand new 2.7 oz bottle on Ebay, for which the seller accepted my lower (not low ball) offer because she said she needed to sell. A lucky day!

Summer is undoubtedly the most interesting, while not too much of anything, Kenzo fragrance I've ever smelled. Flower is twisted violets, baby powder and nausea in a bottle. Amour had potential, but I couldn't handle the thickness of that vanilla rice pudding. L'Elephant is everything spicy; a good fragrance I can appreciate from a distance. But Summer!? Finally a Kenzo I am utterly drawn to that I don't have to make special plans to wear!

Summer is the most warm, buttery yellow floral I've ever smelled. It starts off seemingly a mimosa overload, but within minutes the almond, violet, amber and woods take position. When I smell this, I think of talcum powder turned into a paste that's mixed into crushed almonds. I can't pick apart the other notes except the ones mentioned. The white flowers and citrus notes makes Summer feel bright and happy - they don't stand strong or alone. I'm impressed that there is no screechiness or harsh edges. It just smooooothes over itself. It smells like a luxurious body cream on the skin and has good-great longevity. Sillage is average. It doesn't wear me, which I like. It melds in with my skin and wafts gently, leaving soft trails of something soft, fluffy, and warm, but yes still manages to be bright and upbeat. I agree with other reviewers here.... It is totally unique while being easy to wear, which is not always an easy feat where fragrance is concerned.

I'm so very happy with this in the summer, but I see myself wearing it a lot in the fall too. It isn't an obvious summer scent imo. It's more of a year-rounder, happy but still somewhat mysterious. It's grown up, not the usual juicy, fruity, tart, sweet, tropical summer scent we see today.

As a lovely reviewer named Super Dacob said, it seems niche perfumes are the new mainstream and discontinued designers are the new niche. Summer by Kenzo blows Eau De Noho and Mimosa Pour Moi out of the water if that tells you anything.",08/07/18 20:03,Swedelish
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I hope KENZO will make something very similar soon. This is very unique.
I keep about 30ml. in a bottle and just stare at it ... :))
Smells like expensive mimosa perfume and sunkissed skin ! Fresh and warm : citrus , mimosa, musk, woods +almonds. All you need. Very unique blend, not a simple one !",06/25/18 00:23,Matheya
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I echo the praise for Kenzo's Summer as I just found the best representation of mimosa in a perfume. This is a warm, natural scent starring mimosa and her well blended cast of citrus, creamy almond and sparkling violets. I pick up a little salt too, feels like a sunny day at the beach.

Easy to wear and unique don't often go together, and Summer accomplishes that task by avoiding the cliche warm weather labels: it's neither overtly citrus or aquatic.

I bought a new tester of the original formula off eBay and it's in perfect condition. I'm happy to add it to my summer scent collection. Better than average longevity with soft projection. The only thing I don't like is falling in love with a discontinued scent.",03/28/18 15:23,Bubbles1964

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"So gentle, soft yet unique. WHY would they discontinue this one? every woman who smelled this one on me (some 10 years ago, when I had it) would ask, what this lovely perfume was called and then buy it for themselves.

Such a beautiful scent, that really smells of all the good things about summer-flowers, sunshine, suncreme, relaxed life, falling in love, dancing in your summerdress, warm, sunkissed skin.

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"Once it fully develops it's sensual.

To me this seems as mimosa throughout and throughout, BUT, on different minutes I sniff the other notes too. It's like they are dancing on my skin; other seconds I feel intense lily of the valley, on other I feel the cedar, sometimes the citruses are refreshing,so odd yet so beautiful! Unique indeed! Can be layered in my opinion, for i will layer some patchouli underneath it just to intensify sillage and projection. Mimosa is always present. Happy to have met such an interpretation of mimosa.
This is sunshine in a bottle!

Top notes of bergamot and lemon: well honestly the opening is like I'm entering a grocery store. Doesn't really feel as citrusy but it rather reminds me of green leaves and vegetables. But all the citrusy notes do emerge later.

Mimosa and violet: right after leaving the grocery store I enter the florist's fridge. I kid you not, for the next two or three minutes Summer feels exactly like the inside of a florist's fridge, where all flowers are kept, BUT, it quickly gets so so warm! Lily of the valley is prevalent and then mimosa really shows up and starts settling. Clean, it has white musk as well, white musk is clean. Violet is powdery, not always in the front.

it's a little tart.
Musk: undetectable to me for the most part
Amber: not an intense though, enough to give warmth,not smokey
Woods: also not intense at all. Yes I smell them here and there, but I just think the base in Summer Kenzo is only to provide longevity, not really stand out.

Overall a yes from me. Can be layered and worn on it's own. Longevity is up to six hours; a fair amount of time. Sillage is soft, it stays close to the skin
Suitable for all ages, especially the younger ones, teens. Casual clothing will pair nicely. Also summer dresses. Well obviously summer dresses...",12/30/16 09:28,iamoir
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I just found an original 2005 bottle of this one at a local store in my place which used to sell perfumes, and I'm in love, its unique.

I'm gonna treasure it for special beautiful sunny days, when you have no worries, time flies between mornings and warm lazy afternoons, you can indulge yourself with this powdery fresh floral.. it takes me to quiet summer days, countryside.. meadows of flowers and the sun is setting down..",12/10/16 23:03,arzacu
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I liked this immediately. Mainly it's mimosa. Its a soft sweet smell that could be your natural smell, like warm tanned skin that's been sun bathing. It's sexy at first, then becomes more like clean babies! I like to wear it in summer, it's such a summery smell, like sun tan lotion. I don't wear it in winter much, it feels unseasonal.
Thus summer I have slightly gone off it. I think it's a young persons smell and I'm growing older! It smelled too bright, yellow and unsubtle. Strange as I had always thought of it as sophisticated. Ones nose changes as one ages!?",09/19/16 12:30,sarahvigne

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I've been on the hunt for a fragrance with lots of mimosa, and I definitely got it with this one! This is a lovely scent for spring and summer, with powdery florals and citruses to keep things fresh. At first the mimosa is the loudest note, with citruses playing a secondary role. In the drydown phase, they switch positions: as mimosa gets relegated to the background, citrus takes center stage. Summer by Kenzo is unlike most mainstream summer fragrances; it isn't aquatic or too sweet, and I love it for being a different kind of perfume for warmer weather. It sits close to the skin and isn't particularly long-lasting, but I still find it worth having because of its uniqueness.",06/08/16 20:53,rosewithorns
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"The scent of skin warmed by a blazing summer Sun sums up this beauty for me. I love, LOVE anything mimosa and my Lancôme Poeme captures it elegantly in cooler weather. I wanted a lovely mimosa for summer and I have found it in this discontinued jewel.

It is rich yet somehow light; musky and salty on me, like I rubbed mimosa blossoms on myself after sunbathing. Just the natural smell of my skin enhanced by mimosa. I've not smelled anything like it. It at first comes off smelling hmmmm...not sure about it...no, not another boring aquatic! But 10 minutes in it reveals its true character: a gentle wind coming in from the coast and sweeping across a field of mimosas. No minor player on the fragrance stage, this.

It has been discontinued, yes, but I found some minis on ebay as well as full bottles. I bought one mini which I received in the mail yesterday and just ordered two more. It is a strong and long-lasting fragrance so I fully expect 3 minis to take me through the summer and into autumn as I think it will perform nicely in cooler weather as well.",04/23/16 06:22,MoonSparrow

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"@badgerbruno, im afraid you wont be able to ever replace this unique scent from Kenzo...i have had this and its truly a masterpiece.
There are a few lovely ones you could try though, ive had them before and if you like powdery and yellow florals, along the lines of Summer, then give these a go:

-Bvlgari's famous Femme - magnificent,
-Lancome, Poême - one of my top 5.
-Versace femme - sultry, creamy, i have reviewed it previously,
-Armani Idole - super unique, rare and different, no one could guess what youre wearing with this one :)
-Issey Miyake A Drop on a Cloud, or was it A Drop on a Petal...it was a limited edition i had years ago, dont think its on Fragrantica. Was a beautiful, soft, flowery fragrance with something unique in it.
-Also i suggest maybe test Lolita Lempicka's Si, the one shaped like a clover...its gorgeously spicy and soft, one of the best 'yellow' frags out there.
-maybe also give Burberry Body a shot? (One of my top scents).

But yes, nothing quite like Kenzo...all their scents are very special, from Flower, Jungle, to Amour.
And Summer is the only frag i love with Mimosa in it, others that have used Mimosa, like Paris Hilton for instance, smell horrid to me, very dusty as if the juice has expired.

Ah yes, before i forget, Cacharel Eden is another winner. Flowers, powdery, velvety, intimate...very sensual, strong and powerful, and theres nothing like it out there.

So see, there are a few options i guess :) to take away the sad fact that sometimes one cant find a favorite frag anymore :( i also feel the same about a lot of scents that are impossible to find nowdays. Upsetting what designers can do to loyal followers, just to keep the perfume cycle going in the name of business :(

It's yellow floral and powdery but also slightly herbal - but not in the pharmaceutical meaning. It smells like grass and herbs growing wild in the field.
And this is one of really few mimosa-based scents that are not overwhelming.

Citrus and powdery at the same time, you could smell the perfect mix of bergamot, mimosa, almond milk and the musk. It was bright, energizing and suprisingly sensual. I could be honestly turned on by this scent. Everyone were always telling me I smelled great.

The leaf-shaped bottle is so pretty (although my husband says it is impossible to handle and very prone to be dropped), and the fragrance... oh, how delicious!
I do not think it suits summer very much; I think it is more a spring scent, redolent of soft mimosa, dewy lily of the valley and blossom, with soothing almond milk and lemon custard and woods in the background.
It does not smell sparkly and fizzy, it is quiet, sweet and cozy; it has a soothing effect on me, and it makes me think of looking out of the window on a rainy day, and seeing a beautiful mimosa tree in full bloom.

Really lovely for anytime of year. I love the original kenzo but this one suits me so much more. Warm light and ahhh.,09/16/12 15:00,rubydoll
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"what a relaxing experience ! I would describe it as walking on a garden at the sun mixed with a hint of baby powder. when you first spray it smells like baby shampoo , but then the mimosa notes bloom and the other flowers mixed with musk I just love it ! It's soft, calm, great quality-sweet, flower-powdery. Even when the sillage and lasting power are not great Iam still buying a big bottle Iam gonna enjoy the magic softness of this fragrance until it last !",08/30/12 13:03,Eneroangel
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"What a surprise I got this fragrance mini as a gift and really like it. Thanks RckChk. The initial notes are just stunning very soft almost like baby powder. Soft delicate, refreshing for the summer months. Smells like body lotion to me, clean out of the shower smell. The color of the bottle is just spot on. It a warm yellow fragrance the hugs you and holds you. As it dried down I could not help to see some similarities to BLV Notte. Sure enough they were created by the same nose Alberto Morillas only a year apart. Kenzo Summer is green in the opening, I really like the top notes on this one,much better than in BLV notte. So if you like Kenzo Summer you might want to give BLV Notte a try. They are not identical but share the same vibe.",05/21/12 12:27,ojosverdes
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I usually like heavier scents but this one got a hold on me. I've been familiar with it for quite some time, sniffing it whenever i got the chance but it wasn't until recently that finally got my hands on it. It's really soft,creamy and comfortable.It actually evokes memories of my childhood, playing at a sunny beach. At some point on my skin it almost smells a bit like plastic;not an artificial note of plastic rather a 'salty' smell of arm floats, sunscreen and swimsuit hungt out to dry. This scent is anything but boring or common.May be discreet but also playful,joyful and optimistic. It has personality but in a layback and quite relaxed way.It is memorable but not for those who want to make a statement. Sexy and appealing in it's own way the smell of sunny mimose will only make you feel better.",04/25/12 17:44,Razzamatazz
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I used to adore this one and I'd finished a 40ml bottle in a very short time.
Tender, creamy and romantic, 'airy' and joyful.
I was searching it and intending to buy it again but I stopped searching after I got Champes Elysse.
Champes Elysee is on the same vain and bears strong similarities with Summer Kenzo (not the same perfume though), they both have a distinctive Mimosa note.
So, for those who want a little more affordable and easy to find alternative, Champes Elysee Guerlain would be fine (it's of outstanding quality anyway, maybe even better than Summer Kenzo).",01/20/12 13:41,I.I
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"If I could think of one emotion that this perfume evokes, it's undoubtedly HAPPINESS, with a capital H! This scent just makes you smile. I'm not sure if it's because of its simplicity or just thanks to its soapy/baby powdery goodness, either way, this is an endearing scent that makes you smell deliciously fresh, happy and content! Yep, this one is good all year round, for ALMOST every occasion [I personally wouldn't wear it on a very romantic date, only because it screams innocent, which doesn't always fit the mood ;-p]. Still, I love it and it's definitely a fave in my collection, that surprisingly doesn't smell like anything else I own, so in that sense, it's unique as well [which I love, 'cause who wants to double up on scents, right?].
I did want to add that on my skin this particular fragrance is much heavier than Clinique Happy and the staying power is a lot better, too! :-)",01/19/12 05:58,babydoll77
Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I initially bought this by mistake. I remembered my sister having a leaf-shaped Kenzo perfume and after asking her what colour it was, purchased ths one. I have now realised it was the green Kenzo Parfum d'Ete I should have got.

That aside, I thought I would like this anyway as I like Kenzo. However upon trying it, it smells very strongly of what I assume is the mimosa and possibly almond milk. It's also very powdery on my skin. I can't smell any citrus freshness at all or really any florals. After wearing it for an hour, I'm hoping it will die down later on. Not sure I could wear this for a full day!

I'm slightly disappointed after wanting the freshness of Parfum d'Ete.",01/11/12 15:23,rpalmer11

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"got a sample from mara_g, thank you so much and i really like it. the start is a bit skewiff to me...it's like a chameleon for the first 30 mins, the notes fighting for dominance between citrus, lily of the valley and jasmine. fortunately for me the jasmine didn't win on my skin :) it settled down first to lily of the valley, gorgeous and then the citrus, equally lovely. the overall feel to it though was grass...cut grass on a summers morning when there has been a really heavy dew. i don't get the freesia, almond milk or mimosa. fresh and lively but sadly quite short lived...about 4-5 hrs on me. and having looked around, it's impossible to get hold of. what a shame.",07/04/11 08:39,treenhe

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"This is incredibly soapy on me, although it's a mild fragrance. It reminds me of the pink, creamy liquid hand soap in our office restrooms.

This is incredibly soapy, I would even go so far as to say...bubble bath?? It is so beautiful and clean and fresh.

Personally it reminds me more of an early spring morning with pale sunlight, lounging on the lawn in jeans & a T-shirt, face bare of makeup, just being.

Summer by Kenzo Kenzo,"I've tested quite a few Kenzo scents and found many of them to be just lovely. Some of them don't seem to suit my personality or my taste, but they always seem well-constructed and at least pleasant.

This one is an exception, in my opinion. I found its powdery florals to combine very oddly with something else - I don't know what exactly - that smells faintly of butter. Perhaps that is the almond milk, or the musk, or the combination. Whatever it is - and I am aware that the difficulty may be my own skin - it made Summer seem rancid and unpleasant.

I liked the green-and-fresh Kenzo Kenzo Parfum d'ete in the similar reclining green leaf bottle very much, and still more I liked the earlier 1993 Kenzo Parfum d'Ete in the upright frosted leaf bottle, with its lovely spring flowers. This one I'd be happy to forget.",09/09/09 12:50,Mals86

it starts with really artificial,offensive notes that have nothing in common with ""summer"" or at least the later summer perfume.
after some minutes it smells like cream,something like Nivea or other hand and face cream.it's kinda warm and golden smelling.I mean if you don't know about the bottle you may think it's a gold perfume for cold weather.
at the base notes I get strongly cedar mixed with bitter almond and something sweet and spicy.

The powdery note here is very prominent and the responsible one is mimosa - if you shake a cluster of flowers, the bright yellow dust falls, and that`s exactly how mimosa is weaved in this scent.

The fragrance really smelled as I would imagine. I expected (and wanted) a soapy/""lotiony"" smell with a hint of sunshine and happy non-sharp sweet, yellow flowers. This one is for bedtime, summertime, miss summertime-in-wintertime moments.
The ONLY negative about this, is that late in the drydown I THINK I can smell something that reminds me of a house that I had to visit sometimes in my childhood that smelled really bad. Strange.",11/20/08 15:36,Boggi

Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"Ikebana Indigo has straight up shocked me, I really wasn't expecting to love it so much.
It starts off clean, reminding me of a boutique, just to turn into the most lipstick-y iris I've ever smelled lately. It's a bit overwhelming at first, but then a more acidic almost salty note of ink finds its way too, very simple and balanced.

I was hoping for a cool, dark, emo scent reminiscent of a dark fairy in a rainy cold forrest - something like the vibe I get from Lolita Lempicka Le parfum but more modern and less sweet.

u do get the iris but its subtle - nice & sweet...........and the vanilla dry down is very light - almost like theres no vanilla (almost) but the iris does shine here just in a shy way :)

Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"I really wanted to like this. As someone who’s neck-deep in perfumery and constantly chasing the weird, the daring, the unexpected—Kenzo Ikebana Indigo just didn’t cut it. It’s marketed with an intriguing promise: an ink note. But spoiler alert—it’s nowhere to be found. Not even a whisper. You could’ve told me this was just “floral,” and I wouldn’t question it.

The problem isn’t that it smells bad. It doesn’t. In fact, it’s perfectly pleasant. The performance is adequate—lasts a few hours, doesn’t offend, doesn’t cling too stubbornly either. But it’s so blended, so inoffensive, so safe, that it’s completely stripped of personality. Even the iris, which could’ve added depth or powder or coolness, is barely distinguishable. Just “floral,” with no character to pin it down.

Compared to Kenzo Homme Indigo—which, let’s be honest, is a showstopper with that sharp, inky marine punch and a mysterious abyssal drydown—this is a massive letdown. That scent feels like a journey through deep waters at night. This one feels like you sprayed on something from a duty-free shelf and forgot about it five minutes later.

To be fair, Ikebana Indigo might work for certain occasions. Running errands in spring? Office days when you don’t want your perfume to enter the room before you do? Sure. But if you’re someone who loves twisty, atmospheric, or unconventional scents, this will leave you cold.

Disappointing from a house that gave us something so bold and memorable with the men's version. This one just plays it way too safe.",05/29/25 01:50,Veronica Nicoleta
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"The first kick is interesting. To me, it smells like a bouquet of dried flowers. And like a spilled ink. It quickly fades into a warm iris. A bit retro. The scent sits close and sadly disappears fast. A beautiful idea, shame it doesn’t quite hold.",05/24/25 03:10,Ea1113

Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"As a lifelong Flower fan, and as a lover of iris, I simply had to try this. Does anybody know why it has such a limited availability? I had to resort to buying a tiny official sample on ebay. Is it simply because it's relatively new? I would love to have a small decant of this, as Indigo is quite beautiful. This ain't Iris Pallida or anything, but I do enjoy it. It opens with a mineral blast that quickly evolves into bitter iris mixed with sweet vanilla. And there is slightly sharp, curious inky note present from start deep into the drydown. For its entire lifetime it remains primarily iris, and only then vanilla. Longevity is so-so, which I'm ok with, silage is minimal, which makes it an acceptable work fragrance. Overall, quite an interesting creation.",05/17/25 23:04,makinmagic1
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"This perfume is definitely not unique, but sure is charming and modest. It reminds me of a sunny spring or summer afternoon, a time for daydreaming and taking a nap. There is something truly peaceful, fresh, and comforting about it. The combination of iris and ink adds an expensive, classy feeling without being too heavy. This perfume is light, it feels as if you're not even wearing a fragrance; the scent simply floats around you.",05/09/25 03:25,elle8833
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"This smells like an iris for the nighttime. It is inky for sure, it's a great combination.
There is a slight reminiscence of ELDO La Fin du Monde, but it is barely there - I would not put them in the Reminds me of category.
I'm wearing my sample and I really, really like it. It is FB-worthy for me.",05/05/25 08:28,ava96
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"Great iris interpretation, way different than the usual one.
If you struggle with iris scents, like myself, give this one a try, it feels very different than the norm.

I'd say that it feels clean, yet dark. More of a winter daytime scent for my standards. I also loved the mineral feel from the ink note.

Overall very pleasant.",04/28/25 04:37,Frantheone
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,Not for me. It smells stale to me.,04/25/25 10:15,loves2read
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"The iris here is nothing like the powdery, creamy, or refined kind I love. It digs into the earth and releases a scent of… parsnip. A raw, rooty iris - exactly the kind I instinctively avoid. It speaks of torn-up roots, damp garden soil, when I prefer my iris dressed in silk, dusted with violet, or gently wrapped in musk.

In the background, a soft vanilla tries to sneak in, sweet, almost comforting. But it's too timid, too distant to balance out the aggressive vegetal note.

Such a pity, because the bottle deserved better. A composition as elegant as its case, that’s what I had hoped for.

For me, it’s a no.",04/24/25 06:31,Saveria
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"To me the smell of this perfume is very mineral and soapy type. A clean girl perfume, after the shower. I don't know which notes give this clean athmosphere but I kinda like it!

Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"The opening is EXACTLY like Dyptique's Fleur de Peu... It got me soooo excited because I'd love a more accesible version of FdP. It's magical!

That said, while still beautiful, the drydown of this one is kind of generic, not that different from other designer floral fragrances with a vanilla base, in my opinion. Compared to FdP, this is less musky / powdery and more fresh, like shampoo.

I like it but I hoped for something else.",04/15/25 09:20,SinSemilla

Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"Just received a sample today. I want to love it - the notes looked promising and the text sounds intriguing. The ""inky"" smokiness lasts seconds in the opening and immediately fizzles out followed by an unremarkable sweetness that all sub par designer fragrances seem to have these days. The ""iris"" is again very thin and sweet smelling nothing buttery, nothing carroty, nothing powdery - nothing to indicate that it is iris, it could be any generic flower. Vanilla here is unremarkable - not even sure it is vanilla - more that it is just sweet. I get absolutely no sense of the color indigo from this. It's thin and has no backbone - nothing in the dry down that makes it unique - no leather, no smokiness no depth. Who wrote this drivel? The original Flower by Kenzo was such a delicate, yet intricately layered creation, this flanker is an insult to the original.",03/04/25 08:12,2lipsinHolland

Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"I love the entire Flower Ikebana line (Sakura and Mimosa were both so beautiful) and was highly intrigued by this latest flanker. Ink and iris? I’m not even usually a huge iris fan but I was intrigued.

This opens with a clean yet also earthy “orris root”-type iris that reminded me a lot of L’Iris by Santa Maria Novella. After a few seconds, the vanilla comes in to add a sweet background note but the iris does stay front and center. I can detect the slightest hint of that mineral “ink” note that gives this fragrance a warm, ambery quality, but it doesn’t play a huge role in the overall composition. To my nose, this is mainly an iris and vanilla fragrance.

It is definitely sweet, or at least sweeter than a “traditional” iris perfume due to the vanilla, but I wouldn’t consider this overly sweet as a previous reviewer indicated and it’s definitely nowhere near as sweet as Lancôme’s La Vie Est Belle to me. It’s interesting how we all interpret fragrances differently!",02/10/25 09:56,booksandcats457
Flower Ikebana Indigo Kenzo,"I smelled this perfume quickly.
If i can feel an interesting mineral aspect (représenting the ink) , it’s really too bad this « Iris Pallida » is very very sweet, almost sugary. It make me think at the iris in « la vie est belle », especially the « Iris absolu » one, even that i prefer this flanker over Ikebana a indigo.
I feel this perfume is a new try of the brand to touch an always larger audience, and it’s sad.

Amour My Love Kenzo,"This is cute and nothing more...I find it quite generic. It's a true floral fruity composition. I see it more targeted to teenagers and girls in their early 20's, although older women can easily find it appealing as well.

There is a sharp acidic note that I can't exactly tell what it is, this note is present from the first blast and cling the whole time. It gave me a slight headache. My guess it's Lilac, as I'm not fan of this note. I had to run to wash it off...Not for me.",03/25/13 01:04,shanghaifleur

Poudre Matcha Kenzo,"This is so good! I randomly sprayed it on test strip and at home I was keep smelling something really clean, slightly sweet (like a body lotion or luxury soap). It was this perfume. Next day I went again to test it on my skin. In the beginning it indeed smells bitter and powdery, like roasted matcha powder (or mate, I do not know how mate smells like). But in 10 minutes it slowly fades away and I can probably smell the rose, and musk. But they are very subtle. You can barely say it is rose or musk. Smells really clean! Usually me and my bf are very sensitive to perfumes, they are too strong for me most of the times, and it sickens me to keep smelling them all day on me. But this one, I could not stop smelling it, specially the dry down! I want a bottle :(

About longevity and sillage, not so great, around 3 hours on my skin, maybe more on clothing. Sillage is within arm length, inoffensive. But this is what I like in a perfume anyway.",05/28/24 08:21,perfumum
Poudre Matcha Kenzo,I love this and feel fortunate I was able to get a bottle. What it smells like to me- powdery green tea that morphs into a white chocolate coated orange.

Poudre Matcha Kenzo,"In the Seoul airport and trying this on. The opening is pure rice, specifically the rice powder coating on the outside of a mochi….. as it develops the powdery rice settles down a bit and it becomes a lovely lightly sweet green tea mochi. It’s a kind of powdery that isn’t a baby powder or a vintage cosmetic powder— so interesting and unexpectedly nice. I just wish projection was just a little stronger; will have to wait to see irt longevity",01/31/24 14:16,PERFUMEPILLED
Poudre Matcha Kenzo,"So many surprises in this bottle! First of all, it's the first time I've tested a musky perfume that's NOT floral! I must admit I was pleasantly surprised... I thought I didn't appreciate musk, but it's when it's overdosed with white flowers that it becomes heady. This blend of musk - green tea - mate... It's the most beautiful musk I've ever smelled! Being a great lover of green tea, I didn't know what mate smelled like... now I do, and I've fallen for it. And that lovely vanilla sweetness combined with the musky green accord: a real treat. The whole thing is perfectly balanced, the result exceptional. I've never smelled anything like it! Hats off to Kenzo for this beautiful creation.

8.5/10",01/28/24 08:29,Elfin Will
Poudre Matcha Kenzo,"To me it smells not that much necessarily of matcha, but of green tea flavored mochi - a Japanese rice cake. There is that soft rice flour powdery feeling about it. I wouldn't compare it with other matcha perfumes, it seems a bit different. This line of Kenzo perfumes is lovely, very calming, relaxing, like a spa ritual, but I wish they were just a tad better on longevity and projection.",08/31/23 03:27,violeteme
Poudre Matcha Kenzo,"I so much wanted to like this - what can go wrong with a quality fragrance that smells of matcha-tea?

As I live in a small town with no opportunity to test fragrances that are not exactly ""high-street"", I took the plunge and bought the perfume blindly.

What can I say - all the listed notes are clearly discernible, but the very strong, very bitter powder note makes me sick to my stomach in an instant.
Pity!",07/16/23 00:52,HeiLi
Poudre Matcha Kenzo,"This is quite a pretty fragrance. It has very low sillage, as stated by the users down below. However, I feel like if you're looking for a discreet floral tea fragrance that will feel refreshing in warmer weather, this will do.

I'm only at the 5-hour wear mark but Poudre Matcha is still easily perceptible. It's also going stronger than Hypnotic Poison EDT, which I had sprayed on my other wrist at the exact same time.

Green tea remains at the center of the fragrance during the majority of the wear, but as time goes by, it feels like it's getting more and more intertwined with the delicate, youthful rose. You can actually smell the roasted accord underneath it all, it's quite delicate.

As said earlier, I've been wearing this for 5 hours as of now--- I feel like the gentle & clean white musk is now peeping through, along with a reaaaally quiet yet naturally sweet vanilla. It's closer to the sweetness level of vanilla pods than of a gourmand vanilla (as in, vanilla extract for baking).

As pretty as this fragrance is, it's also quite simple and straight-forward. If you've tried & been wearing a myriad of green tea fragrances before, you may not be impressed by this. I love tea notes and as much as I love this fragrance, I would pick MM's Matcha Meditation anytime over Poudre Matcha. However, if I would be gifted PM, I would still enjoy it very much & appreciate the story it tells.

Edit: I'll backtrack a little bit... As much as I still prefer Matcha Meditation's more gourmand and uplifting approach, I feel like PM feels more and more special as the mate notes get quieter and leave room for the base notes to shine. They never completely disappear, the overall scent feels like more than a one-dimensional green tea fragrance. Still straight-forward, but not devoid of personality.",01/16/23 10:47,ChocoLei
Poudre Matcha Kenzo,"This one smelled really interesting from the cap, when I tried it on it was a nice scent, starting with a fresh opening that quickly mellowed into a creamy, soft herbal scent that on me smells like I had put on some expensive body lotion(with a hint of baby powder at times) . It doesn't seem to have a great sillage (will have to see about longevity since I'm writing this within the first 20 min or so after trying it on) it's a nice fragrance, I think it will make a great gift, inoffensive, not cloying, gives you that clean and well cared scent but I also think you can have the same effect with a scented body lotion or perhaps some other perfumes out there will smell similar for a more affordable price.",01/08/23 00:27,nelluzza.alali
Poudre Matcha Kenzo,cosy yet artisinal perfume. opens with a lot more of the green/toasted facets before transitioning to a smooth vanilla-musk. this nutty green aspect lingers and prevents it from getting particularly sweet while the rose keeps things light & airy. does a great job at conjuring up the delicacy of japanese tea over a creamy base. performance is on the soft side so best to spray generously & use as more of a skin-scent. thanks to Mr Herault for another original yet wearable perfume!,12/28/22 12:51,wilfred3

Wild Kenzo,"I purchased this fragrance at Glasgow Int. Airport for £37, I've also seen it at Wrocław Airport (Poland).

It comes in a very nice box (tropical leaves print in fuchsia and indigo) but the bottle itself is a disappointment (plain and cheap-looking), so is the perfume itself. It opens with a fresh note that I identify as green tea and citruses (reminds me of The Vert by Yves Rocher that was released in the early 2000s) and dries down to a soft vanilla-musk combination. It has rather moderate staying power and minimal sillage.

Kenzo Wild will be a nice refreshing scent for hot summer days, however please bear in mind there is nothing 'wild' about it! Hence I believe you can find similar fragrances for a lower price or spend £37 on a better product.",04/09/15 03:36,myszalke

I think I will purchase the whole bottle. It's simple and so memorable at the same time. Additionally there is no similarities with Crystal Noir as some people state. I ended up selling my bottle of Crystal Noir.",02/26/24 12:50,Oladin
Cèdre Secret Kenzo,"It smells like Magnolia and I like it even though I usually dislike orange blossom which becomes more detectable here after an hour or so. I bit powdery like the entire collection. Even Tonka is powdery at the drydown. I can't draw any parallels with BDK or Versace.

Banana? yes a lot, but you notice this note only if you already know that is inside. You wont smell like a banana candy. Banana has many facet yellow flowery, fruity, rubbery.
Oakmoss? a lot wich make this perfume more chypre than oriental.
It is elegant. Sensual. African. Wierd. Fantasy. Magic.
Well, a bit vintage but... magnetic.
Yes make me think to a Princess mulatta of another planet into a Moebius comic.
I feel more carnation than clove. But can be, it has that pepper balsamic aura. And a bit leather/suede presence. It seems to have also a tiare ylang aldeydes shadow, and a patchouli tear, a pinch of metal powder..
King Kong is a deprecable name. But the scent can remind a remote jurassik island. A carnivorous flower. Bitter sweet.",09/04/16 18:16,kl99
King Kong Kenzo,"an amazing fragrance, I've never smelled banana in it though. I wore it when it first came out and still have some unopened bottles which I want to sell. please message me if you're interested.",09/28/15 09:41,monicaxyz
King Kong Kenzo,"King Kong is a surprise in a sense of being much more conventional and classical-smelling than expected; instead of being pleasantly surprised with exotic elements (banana, cloves), for the first 10 minutes it is mostly showing its' powerful 80s chypre character to the point of becoming almost exactly bitter/green like marigold (if my sample wasn't labeled, I would have sworn I'm smelling vintage Montana Parfum de Peau). On the other hand, I did picked up some rubbery nuances in the background, even a delicate minty breeze... I suppose my sample came from an EdT splash bottle and some notes simply disappeared with time, or maybe King Kong and I are simply not a good match (I got more bananas of D&G Sicily, more exotics of Guy Laroche Clandestine). Still, this is a fine spicy-green chypre that won't disappoint fans of this genre.",03/28/15 01:50,emily7
King Kong Kenzo,"I am very curious about this perfume, specially because of the banana note. I am not a big fan of bananas, but I love banana pie...

Maybe it will be better to wear this fragrance at Brazilian Carnival firstly.

Anyway, I think that it would be very funny to answer people in the streets who use to ask us a certain famous question: ""What perfume are you wearing now?""...

I wonder if will they believe me when I say: ""It´s King Kong!!""... lol...

Yes, I would buy a bottle.

Very good!",04/09/14 18:13,ginadantas

It is vintage but very usable today, is shareable, men and women can use it.
Exotic, delicious!

I'll still remember with what perfume it looks and I come here to tell. At the exit we feel something like burnt rubber but this feature disappears quickly and then can feel cloves, roses and a pleasant tangle of spices. What perfume well done!

I have not read many bananas as I felt people referring to this note.

King Kong Kenzo,"As soon as I sprayed it on, I was shocked; this is a very strong perfume! It was as if I'd ordered whiskey straight up. After a while it changed into a gentler scent. It's clear it's an old perfume; the scent is old-fashioned. I smelled the banana. The strong scent and the banana could be the reason why it's called King-Kong :-) It's not a wow-scent for me, but it's not bad either. It's different from anything I know, that's for sure.",10/12/11 03:45,etmpewo

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"""Indigo is connected with anxiety (tension and inner unrest) in psychology.""

No. It's not. It's a healing phenomenon.

This is a very simple perfume. I think the name doesn't fit this perfume. Indigo as a phenomenon could have different components. Forest rainwater, green wheat, amber, soil scent, coal from burned wood, poppy and delicate fields flowers, aldehydes... Because indigo doesn't occur everywhere. It needs conditions.

No matter how much I love Kenzo Jungle, I love Indigo also but it's not a serious perfume. It's a simple, light, powdery scent suitable for daily wear, stays close to the skin and doesn't intrude. It's feminine and as I know hard to get. Which is a shame.",05/26/24 16:15,arnela
L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I received the bottle of Indigo as a gift when a friend was moving to another country, she gave me what she had left. There was very little left in the bottle! I always kept it so it would never end. It's probably the cleanest, most ethereal scent, I almost feel the sound of whales when I smell it... mixed with elegant powders. Extremely inspiring, calming and to use all the time, both in summer and winter. It has some eternity in it. It is without a doubt, one of my favorite perfumes. It makes me feel elegant, clean, impeccable, infinite, and free. It inspires me to explore the unknown, and at the same time makes me feel enveloped in airs of delicacy and femininity.",12/08/23 08:27,Áurea.Irise

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I blind bought that perfume (again) because it was cheap and I liked the color. Indigo ! I was not expecting much but it has grown on me. Indigo as a name really does fit that perfume. It's rather abstract. I can't really smell any of the notes listed above but really just a mix of everything. It has a powdery smell but not baby powder, not at all, more like expensive makeup powder. Dark and top quality natural makeup, if that makes sense. On first spray it has a reed smell just like the original L'eau Kenzo but that fades quickly. I don't really know how someone could dislike this on a woman. It's not invasive and rather soft. It's a really safe perfume and all year long worthy. I've worn it during under the burning sun and I'm sure it will be great during winter as well. It becomes a skin scent after 1-2 hour on me but the scent stayed on my clothes all day long. Overall another great perfume from years ago that feels different.",07/06/22 16:22,annema

On my skin, it opened up with mostly bergamot splash

Two minutes later, powdery ylang ylang scent emerged, almost like baby lotion and spa scent having a hybrid baby.. but the baby kinda feel like an old lady, a clean freshly showered classy old grandma

Two hours later, still powdery... But sweeter with a hint of fruit waaaaay back, like in the tiniest corner of space.. hmm... I don't know how to explain it... The base notes kinda bring the whole hybrid experiment into something 'decent'

I think I like the dry down.. but, hmm..

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"On me, Indigo is a powdery ylang-ylang and tonka concoction. It's not all that sweet, instead it's a bit bitter and has a strong incensey quality to it. After a few hours, I start to get an aquatic note that breaks up the powderiness a little. It's a soft but dark scent, absolutely deserving of its name. Good sillage and lasting power as well.

Indigo is rather warm, comforting and quite sensual perfume for fall/winter. It's like covering yourselt with your favourite and coziest sweater that also looks good on you.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"The first L'Eau Par Kenzo appeared in 1996 for the female audience. The male version only came on the market in 1999. Currently, twenty years later, the line already has more than 20 different versions on the same theme. Eau Indigo versions hit the market in 2009.
The inspiration came from psychology, since Indigo was linked to anxiety and the intention was to create fragrances that could help in the process of relaxation, bringing peace and balance.

L'Eau Par Kenzo Eau Indigo Pour Femme usually deceives anyone who thinks that just because it has the name L'Eau, it will be another ""boring water"". Jokes aside, this perfume has nothing to do with a simple L’Eau. It is an exotic floral, which could have been launched as Noir, Nuit or any other type of nomenclature that reinforces nocturnal aspects.
Its composition includes notes of bergamot, mandarin and a touch of magnolia, in the head. In the body of the fragrance, a rich floral accord of Sambac jasmine, ylang-ylang essence and orange blossom (Azahar flower), on an almondy base with notes of tonka bean, ambergris and plum.

On the skin, the output is strong and weird, since the citrus nuances do not merge to the floral nuances in a perfect fit. It seems they made a layering of different perfumes and something went out of harmony. This initial phase makes the fragrance behave as unisex and, in a way, often scare many women.
On the other hand, this distinctive scent encourages us to find out what comes next. And the magic happens when the fragrance begins to gain a sweet and creamy side, rich in jasmine and, especially, in ylang-ylang, with small facets that are powdery and indolic, causing a contradictory feeling of repugnance and comfort.

With the passing of the hours, the projection diminishes a little and the perfume appears more comfortable and soft, thanks to the tonka bean. In this final phase, the plum note is divine and reminded me of the same nuance of plum that exists in a masculine scent of which I like very much: Lacoste Pour Homme.
L'Eau Par Kenzo Eau Indigo Pour Femme plays with the limits of gender and differs of the male version, which is much more refreshing. In fact, I do not think it is the ideal fragrance for hot days and I still risk saying that, perhaps, it has been little publicized in its concept, precisely for not delivering what it promises.

As I have never read reviews or comments on it, as I see about more powerful and sensual fragrances, it seems to me that there is a lack of knowledge and, especially, of interest from the female audience, maybe for thinking that it is another fresh fragrance from the house. But make no mistake! It is a fragrance with quality and behavior worthy of an Eau de Parfum, which fits well with autumn afternoons or cooler nights.",03/10/17 12:12,Cassiano

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I do not feel any floral or citrus notes. I do feel notes of blue ink, plastic and Xerox. Very synthetic. Complete disappointment after Flower, Flower parfume and Kenzo by Kenzo, that i loved.",01/08/16 16:31,Olka
L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"Oh wow. I generous swap partner snuck this into the box she mailed me; I'd never heard of it before, but looking at the notes made me joyfully anticipate wearing. I like plum and tonka, and ylang ylang is growing on me as it seems to be a common note in some of my favorites.

Actually wearing this has been extremely enjoyable. But, I feel like what I smell is *not* what is listed! If I had to guess the notes without reading them, I'd say I smelled cumin--lightly sweaty and earthy--for the first 2 minutes and then this became a powdery heliotrope fragrance, quite comparable to White Soul or even to Kenzo's own Amour (which I adore).

This is definitely lightly powdery, and I find that ylang ylang can often bring the powder. If the plum is there, it is not what I normally smell as plum (eg, Rogue or Natori). As I write, it occurs to me that this is somewhat like Natori, but brighter. It also seems to have a light, powdery amber note.

I think my nose is reading the ambergris as cumin, as ambergris is an organic note that comes across like warm skin. I think the plum + ylang ylang must be crossing my wires and giving me the heliotrope I swear I smell. I also think it's possible I'm anosmic to some of this fragrance, as it really seems to ebb and flow on my skin; the initial application--after the cumin--seemed to disapear, until I smelled heliotrope, so it's entirely possible I'm smelling this in a single dimension vs the multi dimensions it was meant to convey.

All that said, it's lovely. It's sweet and soft, powdery and feminine, gentle and calming. I enjoy smelling it, and am so pleased to have been given it. Longevity (my quirky nose aside) seems to be about 3 hours, which is sadly short. Sillage was modest; no compliments, but I felt it was radiating nicely. I have a tiny, purse sized spray bottle, so I cannot comment on the bottle. I recommend this for fans of .... well, I'd say, for fans of Amour, White Soul, Natori and other powdery sweet fragrances.",10/23/15 16:16,HeidiLynn

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"Indigo is a soft, modern, powdery, vanilla-musky type of scent in the same family as (but not identical to) Jaipur Saphir and Armani Lei. I've seen a few reviews comparing it to DK Cashmere Mist and although I can see why people make that comparison, that wouldn't be the first thing I'd compare it to. Indigo starts off with sort of a spicy citrus blast that seems like it might be veering into ""masculine"" territory, but after a few minutes it settles, and as it dries down it turns into a comforting powdery (but not baby-powdery), smooth, musky, vaguely vanillic (but not foody) skin scent. It's hard to detect individual notes, but I would swear this fragrance contains heliotrope, because there's almost a ""fluffy"" feeling to it. It's the fragrance equivalent of wearing your favorite silky underwear. It's easy to wear and it does not have strong sillage, so it would be suitable for situations where you can't wear a fragrance that makes a strong statement or projects. This would be perfect for wearing to the office, out to dinner, to the theater, etc. It's kind of a background noise sort of fragrance. It's not boring by any means, but it doesn't shout or demand attention.",09/12/15 17:52,Maenad1

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"This is my first Kenzo. I blind bought it online and was super excited to try it. The notes looked delectable, however, I was completely underwhelmed when I tried it. It's very pleasant..don't get me wrong..but what's most dissapointing is it's lack of projection. Not an exaggeration, I have to put my nose about an inch from my skin to smell it..and that's within ten mintues of spraying it. I've had it since last fall, so I've tried in two different seasons. I'm hoping the hot, summer air will do some kind of wonder for me so I'll hang onto it a bit longer. The other dissapointment for me is that I smell absolutely NO PLUM.Nada. I mostly smell ambergris ( which I LOVE) NOT AMBER......and Johnson's baby powder and something slightly almondy (like heliotrope which is not listed). NO fruit and maybe the tiniest hint of Jasmine and Ylang Ylang. The way this smells on me, I don't associate it with the color Indigo in any way,shape or form. If I had to rename it a different color, I'd go with: Perrywinkle.",03/14/15 13:22,Hollie
L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I'm puzzled. The listed notes outline a warm, balsamic, soft spicy perfume, yet my nose smells it completely different. Soft spicy yes, but I'd say this is a heavy musk fragrance, musk being the main note. I don't know what gives that unmistakably musky feeling to me as it's not listed here at all. I get zero sweetness from Indigo> no amber, no jasmine, and definitely no tonka. What I do get is bergamot, and the spiciness of plum and ylang-ylang. It's a nice fresh scent, but not outstanding unfortunately, even though it looks so promising going by the description. It's nice enough to wear.",03/01/15 02:14,labradorite

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"The first time when I saw the pyramid of L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo, I too thought that it was a heavy composition and was skeptical how it would fit as a flanker of L'Eau par Kenzo. However, after wearing it a few times, all the previous reviews make perfect sense.

Eau Indigo is powdery tonka bean all the way through, yet it has a crisp freshness keeping it transparent and clean. This particular texture reminds me of Kenzo Flower and Bvlgari Blv Notte, as all three seem to rely on a similar trick to bring out a discreet dynamisme.

The opening notes of bergamot gradually transitions into ylang-ylang, which adds a sensual feminine sweetness to the powdery tonka. Amber brings more warmth with time, but the whole scent always keeps its clean powdery nature.

I don't find it 'indigo' per se, probably because I don't detect much plum on me. But the dusky aura that Eau Indigo exudes, makes perfect match with the twilight. Eau Indigo, being primarily powdery, also smells quite different from the aquatic original L'Eau par Kenzo. However, both share a contemplative and calm quality, which makes them spiritually in the same family.

The sillage is moderate to soft, the longevity is at least 9 hours. Eau Indigo is introspective, yet its clean powderiness feels very cozy as well. I think it worths a sniff, especially to those who enjoy powdery fragrances.",10/31/14 14:20,StellaDiverFlynn
L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"Thanks to 2746cstreet for my lovely decant. Also, amen on the ""ambergris, as opposed to amber"" sentiment. Ain't no amber up in here!

Indigo opens with the brisk saltiness of Eau des Merveilles on the front edge, quickly followed by the billowy, yet musky-powdery finish of tonka. What a sexy, yet understated combination of accords! I really don't find it sweet at all. Indigo is a true skin scent in every sense. It wears close to the skin, and it smells like clean skin that has been exposed to the open ocean and to the sand and dust of the dunes, and then to the clean white linens of a quaint beach house on the coast.

It's amazing how evocative Indigo is. It doesn't smell natural as in, ""occurring in nature"", but it does smell natural as in, after awhile I couldn't tell whether I was detecting Indigo, or just the natural scent of my own arm. I think I am going to have to buy this at some point. It's very comforting and pure. Longevity is average, wears as a skin scent.",09/13/14 10:37,raw umber
L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"First let me say that this is an ambergris and not amber fragrance. Big difference, Fragrantica. Psh.
Because of this, I was afraid to try Indigo for a long time. I saw amber + plum and thought: SYRUP.
However, because I'm just crazy like that I went ahead and blind bought it when I came across an irresistible price on eBay.. and I'm glad I did.
This is powdery as hell. I love it. The opening has a strong, bitter bergamot that I rather like. It's assertive as bergamot should be. However, the dry down is a musky, dusky tonka scent with just a bit of plum and jasmine.
Definitely a ""skin scent"" in the sense that it's not uh, ""perfumey"" as they say. However, sillage is moderate and Indigo is quite long lasting.
I'm a big fan of musky/powdery/creamy scents and this is a major ""like"". Not quite a love yet.. it hasn't necessarily grabbed me, but I can see myself wearing this often.",06/12/14 01:15,2746cstreet

It started off smelling very much like vintage fountain pen ink. Not a bad smell, but not anything I would want to wear. Then it developed into a generic grocery store 'clean' soap scent. I think there is also a clothes washing liquid that smells similar to this. This fragrance and my skin did not like one another.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"This is for the unconventional, cool, calm, no-frills woman with a bit of mystery and who does things her own way. It’s a lovely, luminous scent. Fresh, floral, and slightly powdery but it’s the clean, lighter kind of powder, not the rich, heavy, exotic kind of powder. This was an impulse buy for me; one of the store assistants sprayed the perfume on my wrist, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it smelled and so ended up buying a bottle. But precisely because it isn’t a heavy scent, it lasts only about 5-6 hours (morning to early afternoon), so you’ll have to bring a small refresher amount if you plan to stay out until evening or night.",06/18/13 11:12,AthenaSmith
L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"This to me is the ultimate fresh out of the shower scent. Its clean and soapy and reminds me a lot of an old-school Nivea cream from my childhood. Even though this is pour femme and they also have a pour homme in the same line, I feel men could easily get away with wearing this one also. This scent reminds me so much of my late grandfather who used to use a shaving cream from Nivea and the smell of it is very fresh in my memory still. Also, now that I think of it, reminds me of my Dove deodorant in the scent ""powder"". So to sum up Kenzo indigo is indeed first and foremost powdery but also clean and fresh. I can't really detect any plum or any of the individual notes for that matter and the sweetness of the scent also seems to escape me somehow. Despite that I find Kenzo indigo to be an overall pleasant scent that lingers and gives you a my skin but better feeling...or should I say my skin but cleaner :) For me personally though, will probably not be renewed once finished.",05/29/13 03:28,SillySue

I started to sniff it at stores after buying Kenzo Amour which just may be my all time favourite perfume. This is a tricky perfume, does not smell very feminine in the bottle, nor at the first spray on skin. As it evolves it grows just sweet enough!!!<

The juice is very complex. It starts out as a floral, then develops into a spicy-herby smell, and finally settles down into a powdery-soapy smell( i think that bergamot is responsible for musky soapiness I felt..) with a hint of both spice and flowers(think shower gel with spicy accords and florals)..

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I love Flower by Kenzo and was wandering in a perfumery shop to discover something ""similar"" (which cannot be as Flower is unique for me). Well, L'Eau Indigo is a balmy, light amber scent. I think that the plum makes it lighter. After some minutes, you can feel the discreet jasmine. I would not compare it to Flower at all, but this Indigo caught my attention. I find it to be very discreet but noticeable perfume. The kind of scent that ""stays in the air"". For spring and summer, night or day... I think this will be one of my next purchase ;)

I only get a lot of tonkabean here, a powdery tonka combined with ylang ylang and a little bit plum. Put violets in this one and you'v got LouLou in your hands. I dont see any complexity in this scent, its just extreamly powdery, or powdery might not be the right word actually. Strong soap would fit better. Not in a bad way, I must say that I do like this perfume, but its not something very speciall to me since I just get A LOT of strong soap.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I bought this for my wife and we love it! You get very fleeting, almost insignificant citrusy top notes on first spray that last no more than 30 seconds, before they are overpowered by the most powdery smelling heart and basenotes I've ever smelt in a perfume. The powdery notes are very clean, flowery and mildly sweet - and also surprisingly potent and long lasting (it's an EDP), smelling almost exactly like Johnson's Baby Powder! I reckon the colour 'baby pink' matches the smell of the perfume far better than 'indigo'. Anyway, its overall character is indeed very soft, tranquil and ultra-feminine, and probably exclusively for daytime use. Great-looking bottle too, especially as I have the matching Indigo male fragrance:) Delightfully charming!!",03/23/12 04:57,iconoclast

On my skin, it starts of fresh with a strong burst of mandarines and bergamot, then for a while, the tonka beans are almost overpowering and then it settles into a gorgeous mix of smoke, vanilla and amber. I imagine a beach after sunset, with the sky colored purple and the sea a blueish tone, mixing into one at the horizon, creating a burst of indigo. I can see a bonfire, a couple with their toes in the sand, appearing as an interwined shadow from a distance.

I cannot detect any citrus here at all, just the amber and plum, followed short time later by the floral and tonka bean, which should be the other way around, but no matter, its lovely the way it is.
Its early autumn here, still sunny but getting chilly and Indigo really suits this climate, or spring, but it would be overpowering in summer heat I think.
I'm not sure it has the power, or projection to be a sexy night time scent, I'll keep it for daytime.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"L'EAU PAR KENZO INDIGO POUR FEMME is a sultry oriental to my nose, especially in the early stages, when I'd swear there was incense or something along those lines here. I agree that the general atmosphere is indigo: the sky at midnight.

Upon initial application I was wondering why this was called ""L'eau"", and it didn't seem very Kenzoid to me either. However, INDIGO becomes more and more powdery as it dries down, eventually leaving behind a layer not unlike the famous FLOWER powder. I also find some overlaps here to BLV NOTTE.

I like INDIGO, and if I didn't already own BLV NOTTE, which covers some of the same olfactory territory, I might acquire a bottle. Definitely worth sniffing for those who appreciate oriental perfumes.",12/15/10 14:33,sherapop

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"Indigo is silent, sleeping beauty. And indeed, reminiscent on indigo color.

I couldn’t guess the notes, and from those listed here, I can assure you no bergamot came to my nose.

Indigo is, as someone mentioned, abstract perfume. It includes smooth white linen, dusty facial powder, silky body oil, resins of peace and comfort.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"It reminds ""Kenzo"", but I much prefer this one, although I don't like any of them. However, it is very femenine, that is, it expresses some very intimate aspects usually found in women, even mature ones, and not in men. I associate it with women's taste for little things; it is difficult to express, nothing specially atractive to men or related with them, but with most women's hability of being touching. The blend also reminds me the smell of some flowers produced by very primitive plants, like magnolia or paeonia; and makes me think of internal fluids, deep water beings...

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"It is always exciting when a random fragrance catches my eye, because immediately I believe that it is fate, something beyond my control, that draws me in and urges me to love a new and unique scent.

Perhaps it was the beautiful purple coloured bottle that attracted me or the name of this fragrance that made me anxious to test this.

What hit me was a deep, sensual and unique scent which had been composed beautifully. The fruity top notes were subtle yet rich and sweet, with the slight presence of the plum note lingering underneath the fruits and the flowers. This scent is odd, but in a way that it makes you love this fragrance even more.

Eau Indigo transports me to some far off land, a tropical and fertile rainforest filled with luscious and rare fruits with clear, luminous starry skies.

When the tropical fruitiness passes, Eau Indigo softens into a powdery ylang ylang and jasmine blend. Strangely enough, as a child I owned a doll called 'Baby Born' which smelt exactly like this fragrance's drydown.

When I smell this fragrance, I can imagine wearing this at night and during colder months because it is so warm and mysterious. I dare to admit that I find this fragrance incredibly sexy.

Like Vertigo mentioned earlier, the colour indigo certainly matches this fragrance with its depth, mystery and darkness. I am eager to add this fragrance to my growing collection as it would add a different aspect and variety to what I already wear.",05/04/09 23:35,missk
L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I definitely like this one. Actually, it has all chances to become my favourite from Kenzo.

I find it difficult to detect the notes except for the base ones – amber and tonka bean, they give some certain depth. So, the perfume doesn’t resemble L'eau par Kenzo, neither cold nor so refreshing. In metaphorical sense I can compare it with “Green tea” ice-cream in the Japanese restaurant, it is not the most yummy but still an unusual and very attractive one (at least for me).

Besides, the main thing I bought into is its sensuality. Eau Indigo seems sensual to the extent Japanese perfumes could reach. (Let’s specify that Agent Provocateur and Narciso Rodriguez are from another planet).

To sum up my general definition for the perfume would be: Still waters run deep. It obviously leaves space to imagination: a flash of hidden sensuality during a day and elusive mystery at night. An air of detachment is getting along with a desire of giving vent to one's feelings. And the drydown whispers, whispers… Actually, I would not be surprised to find a new “Intense” version released soon. The volume of sound here seems to me like in Mark Jacobs Daisy or Armani Diamonds.

P.S. By the way, Indigo for men on my skin makes me think more of inner peace than the sensual aspect.

P.P.S. Today I tried it again in hot windless weather. Seems like it is loosing half of its charm under megapolis heat and revives only in the cool wind.",05/02/09 07:39,loveperfumes

Smells on my skin just like Avon's Pur Blanca Blush! Only there's no lilac here.
The similarity is very disappointing me :D
At first it starts nice citrusy (only difference between those in Avon's I get lilac too) then jasmine with ylang-ylang that is creamy and reminds me of heart notes of Pur Blanca Blush. Dry-down is softer a bit sweet and close to skin. I find this fragrance very suitable for everyday and it has great lasting power. Only I think that I would be bored with this one.

L'Eau par Kenzo Eau Indigo pour Femme Kenzo,"I just tried this one - I find it nice, deep, the fruity sweetness being dominant and it's not a citrus scent at all. It's the Tonka bean and Amber in the base notes which give the scent certain profoundity and mystery, I suppose.

What is more important - it has nothing to do with the original L'eau par Kenzo which I can't stand! Actually, eau Indigo consists of entirely different notes from the former.

However, objectively, I would recommend L'eau par Kenzo for day wear (if it is YOUR fragrance), and this one might be complementary to it by being used at night. :-)",04/11/09 14:01,Nicky_PL

Flower by Kenzo La Cologne Kenzo,"As a Flower big fan, I couldn't resist to get the cologne version. But I was very surprised, because this and the original one are quite different.

First, I got an explosion of bergamot. Then, it turns into a green scent few seconds after. VERY green, and I feel like I'm smelling grass and plants in somewhere rural. I really didn't expected this, and I'm not a fan of green notes, but in the drydown, this cologne finally turns into something that remids of Flower.

If you dislike Flower, you don't need to worry. There are nothing powdery, no baby powder and no plastic feeling. In the drydown of La Cologne, I still getting a little bit of green notes, but there is a light sweetness of Flower, which is represented by vanilla.

So light, so refreshing, perfect for hot days, for sure. This is a cologne, so obviously it doesn't last long and the sillage is poor, but it is a good option to refresh you.

There are fewer notes, and the components are more modern, such as calypson and synthetic sandalwood. The fragrance has become an absolute unisex, even more feminine.

While I must give this OG its props it is my least favorite in the line. It took a while for my nose to open up to it. It has its place among its peers but not as unique as its flankers.

KH EDT opens up with this slightly sweet sea breeze that almost comes across like baby wipes, and unfortunately, that smell lingers quite a while. Though salt and calypsone are mentioned it's not the notes that are detected. This smells in my opinion like Johnson’s Baby Lotion (Pink Bottle)

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I luckily recieved a legit bottle from Jomoshop; so I smell no cat piss whatsoever. It's unique, a little weird, fresh, and pleasant.

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Oh man, this is indeed pretty awful! I have a couple of fragrances that give of hints of urine on an urinal cake, like the classics Boss No.1 and Giorgio for Men. With both fragrances it is the honey that is responsible for this association and with Boss No.1 that realisation is enough to mute the urinal cake association for the biggest part. With the Giorgio it is not enough (my bottle have had its final purpose as a toilet freshener). This Kenzo is worse than the Giorgio. The smell is very different, but the association with bodily fluid and urinal blocks is even stronger. No, I cannot recommend this fragrance. A pretty bottle though.",04/09/25 14:52,nout72

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I really wanted to say that Id enjoy Kenzo EDT as much as I had loved Quinton Bisches Masterpiece in Kenzo EDP but after 2 months of owning the EDT I can confidently say this is a solid ""No"" for me

Unfortunately the Floralzone musk used here has been used in dozens of cleaning and bathroom products, and on my very first spray I wasn't pleased over the fact that I smelt like a straight up urinal cake

I understand that this is the remake of the original but I'm willing to guess that most cleaning projects didn't smell like Kenzo homme when it first released.

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,I didn’t get this fragrance at first and I was just going to sum it up to a bad purchase but guess what it smells better in the air than up close.

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"If you grew up in the 90’s you probably remember that scent , it used to be very popular back then.
This one, is an excellent upgrade to the smell and the bottle, the ‘sea water’ element in this been emphasized , and it’s got a very unique ocean like smell , it’s not something usual and not for every nose, but for those who can rock it, you’ll draw a lot of attention and compliments. Good performance for an EDT especially when sprayed on the clothes . Wear it on a summer evening to bring the ocean breeze with you",12/29/24 08:42,TheVman

If there’s one thing I smell the most with it, it’s flowers, specifically frangipani or plumeria, and I’m not sure if that specifically is what’s getting people hooked on this frag. It smells so much like a walk through a resort to me. The wood is a lovely backdrop to the brightness of the fragrance, and I can’t help but feel… relaxed with it on. It dries down much more ostensibly masculine and a little bit old fashioned, and the longevity is better than I expected. Quite nice!",10/25/24 04:11,linjiashi
Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,Is this one made by Bisch?,10/20/24 05:15,SammyyyZEEEEEEE
Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"While I generally like this one as a complex green aquatic fragrance, that Calypsone note makes it kind of weird. That might be causing all the hate in the comments. If only this didn't have that, and instead had something else more uplifting like a ginger note or even a note of gin. I'm guessing the EDT Intense and Marine versions are superior to this, but haven't tried them yet. The EDP is in another category, as it's a leathery aquatic.

Update: Came back to this after a few months, and now feel that this does harken back to an earlier time. It does feel more vintage to my nose and memory than the initial testing I did. However, it's nowhere near as complex and masterful as the original from 1991. This is an attempt to do that, but falls short.

I don't understand the comments here saying this smells like urine? Like Kenzo, or any designer, would approve and release something that smells like piss? That's just the notes which Bisch is trying to get this to smell like the 1991 original, with a modern twist. People who know the original can see that. People who are comparing this to Invictus cannot. Unless your piss smells like pine-scented calypsone.",10/16/24 06:33,Eau De Treasure
Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I think this fragrance is truly underrated. It offers a well-blended mix of woody, green, aquatic, and floral notes (but not in a feminine way). There are plenty of ""blue"" and ""green"" fragrances on the market, but the combination of woody, green, and sea-like scents is very unique. While some might call it ""old,"" I prefer the term ""vintage."" Its performance is impressive, especially compared to many summer fragrances, which often lack sillage and longevity. It has a cool vibe, making it perfect for high heat. My girlfriend even commented, saying, ""You smell so clean, like you just took a shower!""

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Floral, ""Oriental,"" and aquatic.

Opens with aldehydes, very floral and green.
Airy, slightly marine like and earthy.
Quite musty from the off.
Waxy, soapy with a faint honeyed note.
Maybe some grassy notes, faint tobacco?
Then becomes ""papery,"" possibly some iris?
Gets more soapy.
Has a note in the drydown that off my skin smells a bit like smoky bacon? (I don't mind it though.)
Smells a lot better in the air than directly off the skin.
Overall smells very natural and like a cross between a green house in a botanical garden and beach pebbles at low tide.

I feel this is unisex. Would work all year but more of a day scent.
Maybe slightly mature, ages 25+.

Performance is great; very powerful projection which lasts for hours. As a soapy, floral skin scent, it lasts 8hrs+

Would definitely try before you purchase, it's unique and has a throwback feel. It's also a little dour at times. Overall I like it though, smells like a Japanese spa, or Onsen.",04/07/24 06:28,Fortyfree
Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Nostalgia in a bottle.

Kenzo Homme, the re-issue of the classic fragrance, immediately transports me back to the 1990s – a nostalgic journey for those who, like myself, experienced the original. It's a scent that invokes a strong sense of déjà vu, capturing the essence of its predecessor while introducing subtle yet noticeable differences.

Upon first encounter with the re-issued Kenzo Homme, I was pleasantly reminded of the original fragrance I cherished back in the day. There's a familiarity in its composition that echoes the past, yet it's not entirely the same. The current iteration seems to diverge slightly from the original's signature freshness and lightness. This newer version feels a bit softer, which could be a nod to modern fragrance trends or simply a reinterpretation of the classic scent.

Comparing scents separated by a span of 30 years is challenging, as memories of aromas tend to evolve over time. However, the re-issued Kenzo Homme still manages to evoke good feelings and memories. Stripping away the layers of nostalgia, the fragrance stands on its own merits. It skillfully blends marine notes with woody undertones, adding a hint of freshness that makes it particularly well-suited for warmer weather.

The scent is delicate and subtle, but has a noticeable presence, making it a fitting choice for someone who appreciates a balance between subtlety and character. It's especially appealing to those who enjoy a hint of retro vibes in their fragrance, as it skillfully bridges the past and present.

In summary, the re-issued Kenzo Homme is more than a mere replica of the original; it's a thoughtful reinterpretation that pays homage to its roots while adapting to contemporary sensibilities. It offers a delightful olfactory experience that appeals to both longtime fans of the original and newcomers seeking a scent with a blend of marine freshness, woody depth, and a touch of nostalgia. Furthermore, as Kenzo Homme won't be my daily go-to fragrance, it holds a special place in my collection. Its nostalgic charm and unique blend of scents make it a delightful addition for occasional wear. Therefore availability of a smaller 40 ml bottle is a thoughtful touch and just right for me.",03/28/24 11:04,Arctic Archer

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"This is very much like the OG 90s KENZO Pour Homme. I’d say like 90-95% the same….?!

I was hoping a more interesting version of that 90s KENZO Pour Homme with the Calypsone note, especially because I bought the ‘22 KENZO Homme EDT Intense first that I love. Kind of let me down because I don’t get the calypsone or any sweet fruity nuance that is listed.

So this is just almost 100% the same with that 90s KENZO Pour Homme. To make it sure, I even ordered a decant sample of 90s KENZO Pour Homme, and yes they smell identical.

That can be good for you guys who love that DNA, but for me, I’m not a big fan of that 90s KENZO Pour Homme. I tried and tried many times to like it but I just can’t.

So still, the EDT Intense is way better. Blue aquatic without being generic. Pleasant, without being boring.
Or, get the EDP version if you want a similar nuance with EDT Intense but much deeper, stronger, and denser to wear in the night.

Been keeping my eyes on the Marine version, but it’s still unavailable yet in where I live. Hopefully it won’t let me down like the EDT version did.

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I will forever love this one soooo much. This smells exactly like my dad (whom I lost 10 years ago), but it surely couldn’t be the one he wore. Then Kenzo Pour Homme crossed my mind, but I unfortunately couldn’t find it anywhere in store to smell. Later I found out, that this is in fact the original version, in a new bottle.

Since I'm fairly new to the perfume game, i can't really pinpoint notes and such, but i would describe it as a fresh, clean, and maybe aquatic scent, but with a unique twist towards the drydown. The twist being a sort of sour/citrus ish note, that i can't quite put my finger on.

Of course my review is biased, since it holds such a massive sentimental value for me, but i tried to keep my votes reasonable.

Longevity is okay, but i did wear it in the winter months with very cold weather, and now (8 hours in) it's a VERY subtle skinscent.

Sillage is also okay. You will not get noticed from across the room, but you'll get a compliment when hugged.

It's a more masculine than feminine fragrance.

FOR ME the price value is great! I got the 40Ml for like 45 EUR / 50 USD. If you can find it discounted, I'd def recommend but I can't promise that it fits everybody’s taste.

For me a 10/10

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"New version still has the same DNA as previous versions, but maybe a little bit modernized? I remember when few years ago I have been testing this fragrance and I remember that it was much more woody. Of course this new version is still very salty, marine, oceanic scent to the point it leaves a taste of salt in my mouth when I smell it. Deep blue waves are sill in my imagination, cold breeze is blowing on my face. I want to also mention three others from the series by Quentin Bisch. I think they are great, beautiful perfumes, but akigalawood is making me sick. I can’t stand personally DNA of his perfumes: Bois Imperial, new Kenzo Homme EDP, Intense, Marine, Ganymede etc. I don’t know how he created this accord, but for me it’s waaay too peppery and harsh.

If I never saw the notes and genre of this fragrance prior to blind buying this and somebody asked me to describe it I would say that's gotta be Floral (Aldehyde) dead set ! And its pretty obvious they've added synthtic floral and aldehyde notes in here. So to those considering blind buying this I wouldn't go by what the notes and genre are here, I definetely don't get Woody (Aquatic) or the notes listed for the matter, perhaps that was the intention or could even be the case the notes simply got lost and drowned out by all the other synthetics added in.

Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"So, I have not smelled the original.

But it's very interesting symphony of notes. Unfortunately, my grandma that is now long gone, had almost exactly the same smell as toilette freshner, so that is what came to my mind.

I have not read the notes before smelling, I just expected something oceanic. After 20 minutes of smelling I could start identifying notes. None of these are obvious or sticking out, but I first noticed that Ylang-Ylang is quite prominent after you identify it and faint Calypsone gives the perfume a hint of melon bubble-gum smell. After reading the notes, Yes the nutmeg is noticable in the notes and also woody notes that combine with the ylang ylang into very creamy woods.

The drydown is different. Fruity warm and inviting, featuring cozy and comforting peach-mango combination.

Now... I don't think I would actually wear it since it reminds me of what toilette freshner in the middle. However if you are interested in the notes I mentioned, definitely check this out, it's very interesting and unique among today's sea of blue fragrances.

Review context: Spring 19:00, 19°C, 86% humidity. (Amber Oud Bleu Edition on my other hand, might affect the character of the smell, but I didn't percieve it)",06/06/23 11:20,Monke go brr
Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"This one was very confusing. The ‘original’ and this one should be combined on Fragrantica, as I got in an argument with an EBay seller insisting they had sold me the wrong fragrance. For those wondering, It IS the original frag, but in a new bottle. This is according to Kenzo’s website. I had to do research to figure things out and BOY OH BOY did I eat crow with that EBay seller.
On to the fragrance.
It’s gorgeous! Fits in with Cool Water and Preferred Stock and Drakkar. Not that it smells like any of those, it smells like its own thing. But it has that 90’s aromatic/fougere vibe to it. I didn’t care for it at first spray, but that’s normal for me with older frags. It also doesn’t smell great when you smell directly from the skin. Smells best in wafts. Up close it VERY aftershave, which I still love. But in wafts, all of the harsh aftershave scent disappears and you just get a beautiful, fairly simple aquatic. I’m actually fascinated how it can smell like an entirely different fragrance when smelled at a distance. This, along with L’Eau Super Majeur D’Issey, is going to be one of my evening fragrances this summer! Concerts, bars, water parks, this is what I’ll be wearing! Already got a couple of compliments and I’ve only worn it twice! Not a safe blind buy, unless you like aftershave/barbershop styles! But I love it!

Flower by Kenzo L'Absolue Kenzo,"I wanted to like this one too but sadly I don't! Yes, you can make out the rose and the saffron, but mix it all in with the powdery old school kenzo vibes. That sounds good on paper but in reality the rose and the saffron notes aren't the plush notes you find in niche or arabic perfumery - the saffron is medicinal, the rose vegetal. It creates a medicinal, powdery, watery mess, not the arabic rose gourmand you might be used to based on seeing these notes.

It’s nothing beyond a lot of fruity florals but it’s nicely done, well composed.
Safe for everything. To me it’s a little boring but pleasant.
Nice scent bubble. It’s very respectable if you want a work perfume and you want it traditionally feminine. It lasts a good 6 hrs on skin so longevity is very sound.
There are zillions of these types of fragrances because they are popular. It’s a decent one of those.

It's like Angel Nova but AN is a lot more woody as the oud is discernable there. Flower by Kenzo absolu is, however, just sweet and cheerful. It may relate to My Way or Sublime Epoque a bit more.

L´Absolue starts with slightly spicy opening, I guess that´s the shaffron talking. I can´t smell any roses nor flowers. Immediately after the opening I get clean, soft musk, which I keep smelling for the rest of the day from my skin and my clothes.

Flower by Kenzo L'Absolue Kenzo,"I got this as a free sample when I ordered other samples and based on the notes I thought I might enjoy it. When I first sprayed it on, I actually really like the scent. It was sort of tropical and fruity almost? I couldn’t really discern any specific note but it definitely didn’t read very floral to me. My hopes were high at this point, and I wasn’t worried about a powdery dry down bc as a general rule I tend to enjoy powdery scents as long as they aren’t straight up baby powder. But within five minutes this had turned into an absolutely nauseating almost medicinal powdery scent. I tried to give it a chance but it was truly making me feel sick so I had to scrub it off. Based on what I smelled, the notes for the original Flower make more sense, but I double checked and I definitely had this version. Not too disappointed since I didn’t pick this out myself, but it is pretty rare that I scrub a scent off me or feel ill from it, and I think this will make me much more wary of scents labelled as powdery from now on.",01/14/24 00:51,socho

This one 'comes and goes' on me.
Everything I've be picking up seems to be names amber floral in category lately...

Well, l'absolu fits into the warm, sweet, floral category for sure.
Its nothing to do with the original dry floral Flower.

Rounded, warm, spiced - but not like in food - light florals, though no literal flowery feel.
No fruit like in Kenzo amore .. there's a couple of tall bottles, black one and maybe a red one, they're something like Elixir etc...

So lately there's alien goddess, v&r fortune Elixir, Prada intense - though that's far more aromatic - anyway.. warm feeling.",11/10/23 22:14,dglightblue

Flower by Kenzo L'Absolue Kenzo,"I received a sample of this with another purchase. I double checked now to make sure it's not the original Flower by Kenzo because it smells very old fashioned, most teachers in my school went for this scent profile in mid-late 2000s. My aunt also had a fragrance so similar to this that it takes me all the way back.
I have this thing with Alberto Morillas' works where I am repelled slash puzzled by the opening and as it settles I find the scent to be nice but they never really wow me. Flower L'Absolue doesn't evolve much on my skin, time passes but it stays the same as it was upon the initial spray, just a tad less spicy and citrusy, but still very sharp and screechy. In my opinion Morillas does more classic/mainstream types of frags like Daisy or Bright Crystal very well but something feels off with his bolder creations.
I'd move leather and metallic higher up in the accords since they stand out the most, making the scent really bitter and unpleasant. I suppose if it evolved more then those accords would degrade and be balanced out by the sweetness of vanilla but whatever it is that causes it to smell this way (saffron + musk?) is so abrasive from the beginning til the end that other notes don't get to shine at all. It has the same heaviness I pick up in L'Interdit but unlike that one, this scent doesn't come off as vulgar.

Very mature fragrance for a mature lady (although a mature lady that is my mom said it's awful and that I better wash it off, sigh) but a man could pull it off too, it's so very leather-y and leaves a cologne-like aroma in the trail.",08/28/23 13:27,kittenpawz

I’m currently exploring saffron perfumes as I’ve recently noticed how hooked they get me (YSL’s Libre Le Parfum) so I decided to revisit the new Absolue flanker.

Once again, it smells really pretty but I’m not thinking about it day and night. I don’t know why, but I feel like it lacks a little bit more contrast. Its evolution feels expected, there is no surprise--- it remains almost linear on my skin.

Also, I feel like it may smell a bit mature for some people so if you expect it to be on a fresher and more youthful side, you might be disappointed.",03/11/23 13:26,ChocoLei

I have heard from many that Kenzo fragrances are very popular in France so I would avoid wear this while traveling there. Just don't want to smell like everyone else.

It tested the longevity & it lasted a few days on fabric.

I would group this with the same sweet Floral category of Giorgio Armani My Way (Floral, Intense), Si Passione (Intense), Givenchy Irresistible EDP......

Although I have to admit that this one is somewhat pleasant, the rose and orange flower notes are well combined, and the vanilla notes are not candy-like (fortunately).The musky vanilla drydown reminds me of Dior's Hypnotic Poison.

Jeu d'Amour Félin Kenzo,"I love Jeu d'Amour as a fresh floral daytime scent, I like Kenzo in general so I was very curious for the Jeu d'Amour flankers.

Félin is not what I expected. I don't think this belongs in a black bottle. It's not too similar to the original, but not a dark and sexy version either in my opinion.
I don't smell strawberry, more blueberry or maybe blackberry. There is the typical ""dark fruity"" accord mixed with some shampoo scent. In the beginning I can also sense the tuberose note from the original Jeu.
The base reveals a light, warm, nice patchouli and a clean musk component.
It's okay but to me the most boring of the Jeu d'Amour line.",07/31/17 08:54,SailorV
Jeu d'Amour Félin Kenzo,"I have Kenzo jeu d'amour elixir and like it a lot so I couldn't wait to try new member of the family
When first sprayed,I was immediately reminded of jeu d'amour elixir.similarity was so much that first I thought I'm trying that one instead of new felin flanker but it's black bottle ensured me
Their scents are as different as their bottles to my nose,same shape but different colors(not too different,both bottles have dark colors)
Kenzo jeu d'amour felin opens with caramelized berries,fruits aren't fresh or bright and seemed more like blackberry not strawberry.it even has the same creamy white floral heart but instead of vanilla,there's amber and patchouli here to give it heavier,warmer,more serious,deeper,darker and more grown up facets.a fall,winter/night scent.sexy and mature at the same time has a modern gourmand vibe.the first phase is almost syrupy sweet and heavy fruitchouli.nothing new but this type of perfumes are the trendy sexy scents of these days and I have to confess that I like it sometimes however I know that If I wear it on regular basis,I'm going to find it cloying.
As it dries down,syrupy sweetness of blackberry jam mellows and clean musk shows up.it's drydown reminds me the drydown of miss dior 2012, the same clean musk, tamed patchouli and gentle amber blend with different types of flowers here which still have a hint of berryish undertone. finally in drydown I can sense a hint of strawberry instead of sweet dark berries of the opening
It was my first test and I will edit as soon as I can give it a better try but even right now,I know that I like it
I sprayed it once on my hand five hours ago and I can't smell it anymore but it's not a weak and faint scent and projects well while it lasts

It immediately sends the powerful Flower by Kenzo and that's good, because until today its predecessor has held the shuttlecock up there among countless launches that break through the market! Alberto Morilas is behind, that's enough! [laughs]...

Citric and very aquatic opening that shows luminosity, it also has a very calm Ginger water that joins with an aroma of new Pepper, freshly manipulated! I love its freshness with each movement, as it begins to announce a perfume from later on.

The perfume grows in such a way that it becomes the center of attention around! Here, in the drying process, there is a semi-cold Rose water, and more tropical fruits, highlighting the Green Apple with its reverberant bittersweet tone and another peony of Peony (I love this flower, this note so much), which denotes a rosy appearance, ventilated, punctuated in the fine and decided floral. There's a smell of flowers on the stalk here, too delicious all of it!

In the end, the bomb explodes, with a lot of Violet that gives a general powdery feel, but with the support of a bed of Musk that sensualizes and makes the fragrance hyper feminine! It fixes a lot and projects about 3 strokes perfectly; in small environments he dominates and does very well. Small and short sprays are the secret of its power!",01/10/23 13:17,Jernê Knowles

Flower by Kenzo L'Eau Originelle Kenzo,"Disclaimer: Aquatic and watery perfumes are not my cup of tea, so, please keep that in mind while reading this review.
I have tested this perfume from a sample in the form of a sachet.
The first thing that hit my nose was this unpleasant watery note, which is very prominent mixed with some spice and citrus. I hoped it might settle down to powdery florals and musk but that didn't happen the watery notes were strong even after 3 hours of wearing
I had to scrub it down with a vanilla soap to neutralize the sour notes.
I guess it's quite strong because I can still smell it on my arm, but after washing my arm it's mostly sharp musk with some flowers.
In general, it smells quite harsh and chemical that's why its a pass for me.

Flower by Kenzo L'Eau Originelle Kenzo,"A good everyday, aquatic/floral scent for ASIAN ladies, because Kenzo was originally made for the Asian audience due to it's roots. Some people might blend well with it, but should be the types who actually traveled through Asia and love the scents of it's food and flowers.

Because of this, and if you're not Asian, then it may not be for you. If fact, most fragrances are not made for everyone out there.

You have to test a fragrance if it blends well with your natural body odor, which explains why some people don't like this one (maybe they have bad skin odors and try hard to cover it up with sweet scents?). If you're a girl who's always into sweet scents, then it might NOT be for you.

This Kenzo is a floral scent with a hint of ginger in the background, which is typical for Kenzo frags. If you like floral scents, it can be you're signature scent.

This doesn't scream at others or demands attention, but it's subtle as a young lady walks by others not trying so hard. In other words, it's NOT masculine in any way.

I love wearing it on a chilly windy fall day, maybe just one or two spritzs and it smells warm amazing throughout the day. It smells very floral with the hint of the original smell with a whiff of aquatic scents if that makes sense.

I do not know if its me or the fragrance, but i have found it in shop on sale huge 100ml bottle for less than 40eur and almost did by, since i thought ""originelle"" should mean ""back to its roots"" and was hoping for the original formula (i still have some left from first release, so i thought i could use this one now). Boy am i glad that i have not only tested it on paper blot, on which it smelled ok, but also on my skin. It smells horrible on my skin and very few fragrances do so. It smells of a scent of metal in the very cold weather, you know, that tadte on metal, when you lick it in the cold. I guess its a combination of watery notes, musk and a lot of ginger flower. Do not be fooled by ""originelle"" it smells nothing like the original formula!!!! Horrendeous for tje first 30-40 min, it then becomes more flowery, but until that time all i smell is a metal. Not my type of smell at all, i better buy some other versions.

good lasting power though!

Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"La primera vez que lo olí me llamó la atención, no soy muy fan de los perfumes de Kenzo porque odio los aromas florales, sin embargo, este perfume es todo lo que llevaba buscando hace tiempo.
Lo compré a finales de agosto, con una temperatura de 35ºC en una zona húmeda. Es un olor dulce pero no empalagoso, es suave y delicado, pero no atalcado. Tiene una dulzura más frutal que floral, pero esa nota tan potente de mimosa es la que rebaja la posible pesadez que lleve este perfume. Es una fragancia fresca, ideal para el verano si no quieres renunciar o oler siempre dulce, e incluso adaptativa en los días más fríos. Es versátil, pero no milagrosa, no lo recomiendo en climas helados, no encaja con un ambiente gélido. En primera aún no lo he probado pero ya doy por sentado que será ideal. Al echarlo en mí puedo percibir notas frescas, casi rozando lo acuático sin recaer en lo salado y cítrico, es estar tumbada un día cálido de sol en un lecho de hierba y flores, con un vestido largo y holgado, que acompaña bien el calor con la brisa fresca. 100% lo volvería a comprar, es un olor del que no me canso.",,fina prosa digital
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"The opening smells like fresh persimmon fruit/kaki fruit--it's earthy, fresh, slightly nutty, and slightly sweet. I have never smelled kaki fruit notes in any perfumes, so this one is really unique.

I'm shocked there is no vanilla in here. This simply smells like mimosa and vanilla to me. I can imagine there's tangelo in there as this smells quite fruity out of the cap, but the wood and sesame I don't detect. This is just a simple light, creamy mimosa scent. I'm enjoying it.",07/02/25 21:15,LaMiaRosa
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"The powderiness in this perfume is not from mimosa, but from the sesame note which is stronger to my nose. The mimosa here is smooth and clean and not too fluffy/pollinated. I think I would get this more for the nutty note than the floral one, if I didn’t already have L’occcitane’s Melilot which has a similar scent profile.",05/23/25 09:52,Willowthewisp

Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"Such a unique and elegant scent--I've never smelled anything quite like her! I was a little apprehensive when I first bought her, as I hadn't had much experience with mimosa fragrances and didn't know what to expect, but she left an amazing first impression on me! I was so pleasantly surprised by how well her notes worked together and the overall complexity of the fragrance, I fell in love immediately! She had good longevity, around 6-7 hours for me (it depends per person, but I don't really need much more than that...if I need anything more I'll just apply it again!) with intimate to moderate silage. She's SO perfect and I really REALLY recommend her! I can't wait to be able to get my hands on her again!!!",02/07/25 06:23,goroascentchi
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"This is an interesting perfume. At first I felt discrete sesame seeds notes, but then it evolved into something complex; the hidden mimosa comes out and becomes the star of the fragrance.
It's fresh, with no sweetness in it, more green, and... elegant.",02/04/25 04:38,papagalulcric
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"Instant love! The mimosa took me back instantly to my childhood holidays in the south of France. Such a lovely, radiant, sunny mimosa scent, ideal for warm summer holidays or if you want to invoke the feeling of such a beautiful day. It's a definite yes from me!",02/01/25 12:03,Eva1976
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"The first in this line, Flower Ikebana Sakura, was an instant “love” for me and is completely unique in my fragrance collection, whereas this Mimosa flanker is just a “like.” (It was also, oddly, difficult to find here in the US despite being a new release…I ended up purchasing it on Fragrancebuy.) I feel like it is a bit less unique than Sakura.

That being said, Mimosa is still lovely. It’s floral like Sakura, but without the woodiness. Because of this, Mimosa comes off as a tad lighter, airier, and strictly a spring/summer fragrance. I get a bit of citrus at the top, which might be the kumquat? (I’m not sure what a kumquat smells like!) There’s some aquatic notes and a touch of powder in there too. It’s overall light, clean, elegant, and inoffensive. It’s perfectly office appropriate, and also good for casual daytime wear.",01/15/25 08:56,booksandcats457
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"Beautiful, light mimosa with a powdery dry down. I get a hint of sesame, but not very much. I’d like more, as that savory aspect is really enjoyable to me.

Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"First I was in love with it. Feminine and clean mimosa, very elegant and a bit powdery. I was a 100% sure that I'd buy the bottle. After a couple of hours, I noticed the powdery notes getting stronger and after 4h I was done with it. HEAVY powder, almost as heavy as Narciso Poudree. Had to scrub it because I started feeling nauseated and it was hard to breathe. I was left with fresh and somewhat sweet cucumber water after managing to get most of it out (a bit stuck to my hair which I didn't wash). I think you have to absolutely love powder for it to work for you, for me it was way too much.",12/22/24 11:05,Cherryz

Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"A luminous, warm, clean, and enveloping composition. Elegant and discreet. Floral-powdery, with powdery notes that are less pronounced than in the classic Flower.

Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"This is nice. It’s fresh, sweet and floral. It smells clean and a bit creamy. It’s a soft, peaceful fragrance. There is something a bit earthy too that gives it a nice touch. I think it’s pretty inoffensive. A good choice if you want something clean and safe and not citrusy for summer.",07/18/24 06:00,raiza1990
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"I normally don't like Mimosa in scents, and this seems to be the first exception. I really like this greenish, powdery Mimosa here, I can smell the other notes very clearly too, a zesty fresh, lighty sour kumquat and slighty roasted sesame...somehow the scent gets a very soft aquatic vibe in the drydown which gives it an airy, quality and makes the mimosa softer and lighter. This will be the first mimosa scent in my collectinon, bottle is beautiful too.",07/15/24 15:25,Gyda12
Flower Ikebana Mimosa Kenzo,"Winter skin test.
This one sits alot like the other Ikebana, quietly musky floral woody.

Flower by Kenzo Summer Fragrance 2014 Kenzo,"Lovely, soft and powdery yet great for summer. Makes me feel comfortable. Very similar to Flower Lumiere, though lumiere has top notes not drowning as much in powdery cloud. This summer version is very good, they immortalized it in the Flower Lumiere version it seems. I cannot truly name what I feel in this scent, only that it is creamy, powdery, good body balm like and very pleasant.",07/29/24 14:00,MademoiselleMaya
Flower by Kenzo Summer Fragrance 2014 Kenzo,"I got a very strong note of freesia and the musk with a bit of sweetness from the violet. Overall a very soft, dreamy perfume with a lovely tall bottle. It's not my favorite but it's a lovely floral perfume nonetheless.",04/02/15 19:55,marenanne6
Flower by Kenzo Summer Fragrance 2014 Kenzo,"it opens with a hint of beautiful freesia and citrus. now and then the litchi and ginger pop out and the soft violet from middle note provides a feminine vibe but gosh this fragrance is all about musk! the white musk goes very strong on my skin. soapy, powdery, a bit aquatic, smells careless and dangerous at the same time! actually the dry down is somewhat salted which reminds me of the breeze on my face at the seaside.

sillage is moderate and lasting power is absurd for a summer scent(9 hours)! this is a very interesting fragrance, laid-back in an elegant way. it's perfect to wear it on a sultry summer night.",10/20/14 07:29,sirenacheng
L'Eau Kenzo Aquadisiac pour Homme Kenzo,"This came out a year after Artisan Blu and kind of gives the same impression, only as a LKPM flanker.

L'Eau Kenzo Aquadisiac pour Homme Kenzo,"I am a woman and got sent this one by mistake instead of the female version. I tried it and ended up loving it. This perfume has a fresh, citrusy scent without being overly sweet - perfect for summer. Very unisex, leaning masculine. It lasts well above the average female perfume (about 4 hours) but if I compare it to my boyfriend's perfumes, it's a weak contender in the endurance game. It projects softly, no more than an arm around me, but people noticed it and complimented me. I will happily finish the bottle.",08/12/20 07:32,diva_100
Flower by Kenzo Summer 2008 Kenzo,"My favorite flanker of original Flower. Even went an extra mile and bought a back up bottle when I realized that it is disappearing from the shelves.

Flower by Kenzo Summer 2008 Kenzo,One of the worsts scents ever... sour sweat with a disgusting something. Where have those notes hidden? I really can't 'see' them. Summer.. ? Flower? Maybe 'dizzi nightmares' should be the name of this fragance if we can still call it so.,01/12/10 21:14,Amethyste
Flower by Kenzo Summer 2008 Kenzo,"A funny thing is happening......against all odds I started finding myself LIKING a Kenzo Flower! No love, just a like...

The original Flower gave me a horrid headache - sweet, powdery violets on hyper-drive. This put me off wearing this Summer fragrance, until now....curiousity got the better of me.

This version is much less intense, it is soft & velvety, powdery & sweet but toned down in comparison.

At first I smell there is a strange sour-grassy smell which I often find with summer fragrances. Luckily this disappears after a while & the lychee & there is a scent-impression of a fuzzy peach & a glass of ginger beer - sweet, & juicy with a sour bite. The powdery violets are noticable, but not heady or cloying...there is still a wet, delicate fruitiness in this version.

This is a summer scent, so my hopes of finding some dark, daring incense were dashed....but there is a good depth in this mid-weight fragrance which stops it from turning into a flighty fruity-floral. As it mellows it warms, deepens & opens into a rich, velvety rosey-red flower smoothed by musk.

As soft as cat's paws, feminine, cute & sunny whilst managing to steer clear of being too girly-girly or twee. Good staying power & reasonable sillage. Dare I say it....this perfume is growing on me!",08/13/09 13:34,sky76sky
Flower by Kenzo Summer 2008 Kenzo,"A warm scents, light version of kenzo flower a summer fragrance without alcohol in ingredients make this one is fresh, long lasting and not a dizzy type fragrance, if i have to choose, i love this than original one.

i think i love the scents from first spray until last note, a fresh fruit notes but has flowery characteristic too make this fragrance is very feminine but not overpowering, there no need to wait, from ist second till hours all layers are lovable :))",01/26/09 21:03,imey
L'Eau par Kenzo Love L'Eau pour Homme Kenzo,"It's similar to the original but it has less mint note in its heart together with (more) lotus flower and green pepper.
The top note is surely yuzu with marine notes.
Base contains (I think) a little rose and lily water with a hint of musk (I haven't smelt any wood in it).
On the whole it's really romantic and projects better than the original.
I like very much this crystal clear harmony closed in a scent and I keep in my wardrobe always a bottle of this limited version :)",05/01/11 00:32,kisherceg

L'Eau par Kenzo Mirror Edition pour Femme Kenzo,"Well I guess I'll be the first to review it. I got it in the mail last night. First thoughts upuon spraying - it smells EXACTLY like the John Frieda Frizz-Ease line. I got mostly raspberry and mint, and a hint of lily. It is nothing mind-blowing or unique, but a great scent for those hot summer days when you just want to throw on something refreshing and simple. It smells like a shampoo/body wash, like you just out of the shower. Fresh: and watery - perfect for hot, humid summer days.",06/24/14 13:13,superbity

Now all I have to do is wish and hope that this flanker will arrive in my country so I can try it out ASAP. I am really anticipating a substitute for RL Cool!

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"From a floral lover
this rose fragrance has that kenzo dna but the scent itself is sweet rose with something airy in the drydown like freesia or maybe the magnolia although the musk isn’t noticeable to me its there i can see it but not too much
the opening is synthetic creamy raspberry and rose how does the raspberry snell creamy ? Idk when the fragrance settles a little it turns into rose and freesia with something creamy but not the gardenia creaminess another creaminess but fades right away when the base show off the fragrance turns into just rose and white musk",09/19/25 05:19,Onlyclean
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This is a fresh, bright red and deep pink fragrance. Juicy- and fruity- are words that come to mind. The scent profile is unique but simple- and when I first smelled this one around 2014, I had to have it. Kenzo's aesthetic is all about elegant simplicity, and this one feels like a youthful rendition of that- and an easy crowdpleaser.

Top notes are Raspberry and Pink Pepper. The raspberry & rose combination had me sold- and may be underneath that red, red, juicy topnote. It's strong and immediately recognizable as Flower in the Air. I definitely get the airy effect because of its fresh aesthetic. This effect fades after about an hour.

Pink pepper, to me, is not something I immediately smell as a stand-out feature- but after reading the notes- it's definitely there, but likely synthesizing with the other notes to create a musky base that throws the prominent features forward. Another way to put this: I owned about 4 pink pepper scents in my late teen years (before I knew anything about fragrance notes)- and was attracted to it as something that smelled a little complex, modern, and wild- like other basenotes- but still youthful and non-animalic. It was right up there with patchouli & amber for me for this effect. All of these scents had a peppery bite to them that was immediately noticeable. Flower in the Air (by comparison) has no bite- no wildness- and the pink pepper, to me, fades into the background and is muted by the rosy, raspberry juice.

Middle notes are Rose, Magnolia and Gardenia. I smell all of these on the 1-2 hour mark, and the sharp raspberry fades. Because of the synthesis of notes, magnolia & gardenia aren't stand-outs to me. I'm smelling all of them at once- and it's airy, fresh, floral, and red. This is a red garden rose, rather than a powdery, english rose. Flower in the air is spot-on. The effect I think of is shopping in the organic grocery on a Saturday morning. It's refined, feminine, and sophisticated- at once. Silleage is moderate- and this is one you can sense from arm's length- but won't leave a trail. When my body heats up, I can smell this one emanating from my chest for 2-3 hours.

Base note is White Musk. This one is a clean musk, and I can barely sense that it's there. It's shower fresh.

Overall: Flower in the Air is about a 3 hour wear for me- with arm's length silleage- and an incredible fragrance. It is a floral, fruity scent that works best during daytime in warm or hot months. I spray this one heavily after a shower on weekend mornings- and it's modern, inoffensive- unique. If you're looking for something striking or signature- you'll need a respray after 2-3 hours. A 7/10 for me.",07/04/23 08:03,ashleydvan
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"it’s giving me rose, fresh fruits, followed with a little spicy from the pepper. this isn’t something i would choose if i have to pick one from the counter but i got this as a gift. i’m not a flower person but this is pretty tolerable hence the fruity notes. the longevity is insane on me, so this is a good fragrance i would apply on weddings and more formal garden-outdoor occasions.",02/18/23 06:41,nadjooece
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"A rosy and sweet scent dressed in one of the most beautiful bottles. Fruity opening but I smell the rose magnolia and gardenia too. A good buy, especially for the bottle.",12/24/22 20:01,KippieBall
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This is a delicious fruity floral: red fruits, blooming flowers, a sprinkle of pungent pepper that gives an edge without overpowering the other notes.
The rose is modern, fresh and sweet. The powdery / soapy scent of the rose is subtle and perfectly balanced with an overall juicy / fruity vibe.

On my skin, I don't pick up a drastic evolution in this fragrance, as it actually comes across as really smooth.
The pepper transforms into the lemony notes of magnolia, the fruitiness lingers into the floral part.

Flower in the air is a feminine fragrance that brings joy, it's perfect for spring and autumn, office and school friendly.
A safe blind buy if you love juicy red fruity florals with an hint of spiciness.",06/21/22 02:03,Lady Nightshadow
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Very aromatic kind of scent, but fresh and sirupy. Rose is really dominant, but raspberries give that sweet fruity vibe into the scent. There is also the strong musk undertone in the scent.",04/10/22 11:38,TatianaChoco
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"So far I have not found a fragrance from the house of Kenzo that I dislike, although not all of them are for me, all the ones I have tried feel attractive in their own way, in this one Alberto Morillas played with his beautiful Flower creation from the year 2000 and he brought us more than a flanker an oxygenated and crystalline version or ""vision"" of it, which although he remembers it does not have much resemblance to the besteller of the house.
""Flower in the air"" as its name suggests is a more ethereal interpretation of the classic poppy (the house's insignia) that opens with juicy red rose petals, garnished with pink pepper and bathed in raspberry water (here the fruit does not feel red or very sweet, but rather with a pinkish tone, tangy with natural sweetness but at the same time a little synthetic)
Although this fragrance is delicate, its opening is powerful and the rose is felt from beginning to end, in the beginning playing with the raspberry notes and feeling a little soapy (very little) perhaps due to the pink pepper, and later with more floral tones due to the magnolia and gardenias present at the heart of this composition, the fragrance remains fairly linear throughout its life, only allowing glimpses of white flowers to be seen in the drydown with a background of white musk that adds layers and weight to the composition.
This fragrance is very happy and dynamic, perfect for daytime use and despite its fresh smell it performs quite well, projecting very well the first hour and a half lasting about 4 to 5 hours, I highly recommend it and apparently it is discontinued, so if you find a bottle do not miss the opportunity because I feel that even with several more sprays it will work perfectly also on slightly colder days.",08/28/21 00:35,Abry_81
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Oh yes! This is a nice fragrance! Subtle, sophisticated, flowery mild elegant spicy. It reminds me of Guerlain complexity.
Love it. Light, clean, fresh, classy but young.",02/24/21 14:54,EllaDe7
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This is what Flower would be without its musky powdery violet and with fresh fruity top notes. Fresh, easygoing and quite youthful. It's a sweet floral, but not sweet in a gourmand way at all. More like a typical pink floral fruity. Strangely the raspberry and gardenia notes strongly remind me of the sweet pea and freesia accord used in My Burberry. I even get more freesia than raspberry, actually. So I totally can see why Flower In The Air is also compared to Miracle. It's not quite as sophisticated and classy as My Burberry, but it's a very pretty fresh rose nevertheless, and a great Spring-Summer fragrance.",01/23/21 13:45,Rose du soir
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"A nice, inoffensive fragrance.
I personally think it's a bit of a stretch to claim ""FITA"" and the original ""Flower"" as similar. They are similar in the sense that they are both perfumes, and come from the same fragrance house, and are predominantly florals.
I adore ""Flower"". No question. It's bold. It's powerful. It's straight-up gorgeous. It just brings me so much joy.
""FITA"" would be amazing if it was stronger - which I gather would be counterproductive to its name. It's meant to be airy and light, and it succeeds.
Very slight raspberry beginning with gentle peppery, rosy overtones.
It's the fragrance equivalent of meeting your idol, and realising they're actually human.

PERFUME HACK: I can't detect it on my skin, but I'm loving it on my clothes!

There have been some mornings (always fairly early mornings, strangely) where I have felt *this* is the only perfume I want to spray in that moment. I like it. I do like it. It's still not a true (in my opinion) flanker of ""Flower"", but...it's kinda nice.

It's floral, but unlike the typical floral scent- this is so delicious and creamy almost like it's edible, so yummy! I love it. It's not Britney Spears' fragrances kind of sweet, it's the sweet with depth, with delicate musk layered underneath. It's rich and yummy, honestly I can't stop sniffing my wrist after I spray this perfume on me lol

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"I really liked this one at first spray however the raspberry scent was a bit sharp and I think it doesn't blend well with rose. I am not a fan of fruity fragrance in general. It smelled cloying and too sweet and sadly, smelled cheap too (but I bought it at full price!) The bottle has been sitting on my desk for quite some time now. Longevity and sillage is moderate.",06/05/19 22:01,alexisdavid1892
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"A very simple and sweet floral - perfect for an everyday type fragrance - office wear etc. I don't get much musk, there's no fruit, and it's fairly weak. It would make a safe gift for a floral fragrance lover, but it's not outstanding. Just pretty. It's really not that different from Kenzo flower, so if that's already in your collection, this is probably redundant. I like Kenzo flower by the way - as a nice, safe, pretty floral. I think this is probably an either/or situation. If you're after a pretty fragrance, get one or the other. Both is just a waste in my opinion. Lasts 2-3 hours on me.",03/11/19 05:19,chloematilda
Flower in the Air Kenzo,A very pretty rose fragrance that almost reads like peony on the skin with some musk and pepper supporting it. The raspberry just sweetens the scent but does not make it a fruity floral in the least. Glad I blind bought this and love the bottle cap.,03/11/19 04:52,gtabasso

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This one is really nice. It is a soft, clean fragrance, but it has a ""body"", if you know what i mean. It is delicate, elegant and feminine. Not overly flowery, not overly sweet. Office and date appropriate.
The only con, is that it is not really unique.
I imagine a young, intelligent and serene woman wearing it.
Try this if you like musk and sweet florals.",01/31/18 05:52,raiza1990
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This is very nice. It is very linear as others have mentioned. I don't really get the top notes at all- it goes straight to the rose and that is where it remains. The rose is tempered though by the other flowers so even a non-rose lover like me can enjoy this. The rose is not overwhelming. It's sweet but not sickly sweet.
I don't get much of the original Flower in this, which IMO is a good thing
Silage isn't great on this although longevity isn't bad. I wish it would project more.",01/30/18 05:26,cookygirl

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Kenzo is quite an underrated fragrance house. Their scents are something I've come to appreciate the older I've become. Flower by Kenzo, (their most well-known scent), was something I detested as a young woman, but have come to love with maturity. I was keen to see how this flanker, Flower In The Air compared to the original.

The first thing I noticed was that Flower In The Air was lacking the powdery-ness found in Flower by Kenzo. This fragrance is instead very fresh and clean smelling with notes of raspberry, rose, magnolia and gardenia on a bed of clean white musk.

Some reviewers have complained that this composition is quite linear. I would have to agree that this scent is not all that spectacular, however when it all boils down to how it wears on the skin, I am very impressed.

I tested Flower In The Air alongside many other scents when last at the department store. From all the tester strips I sprayed, Flower In The Air stood out the most to me. What captivated me the most was its easy-going, carefree aroma. It's comforting in a clean, crisp and shower-fresh kind of a way. I would happily wear Flower In The Air as an office and/or running errands scent. It's essentially a staple for anyone's wardrobe, the scent you reach for when nothing else suits.",11/15/17 18:16,missk
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Love the smell of this but quite an uncomplex perfume compared to other kenzo perfumes. The main smell of it is a very sweet rose. It is quite a linear perfume which is most people think it doesnt last as long. I think it lasts just as long as others but because there is not much evolution of the scent, your nose gets use to it and then you cant smell it one yourself.",08/16/17 16:10,jansiri
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"A lovely feminine scent! The perfect combination of rose and raspberry makes it a classy and soft fragrance with a spicy touch. It radiates beautifully through out the day, with a good longevity, about 8 hours. It reminds me the original Flower without the remarkable powdery notes. It's fresh and delicate, just like flowers dancing in the air!",04/03/17 15:01,KamyFlower

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"I've worn this both in summer and colder months and I must say that the sweetness is more suitable around fall and early winter or spring. The fruity blast in the high heat is obviously tamer and lends to brighten up the otherwise strong rose and gardenia. After 3 hours on me, the musk is noticeable and blends everything in a warm embrace. Longevity is excellent on me (about 6 hours) and please be mindful when spraying this, as with any Kenzo fragrance (in my experience) it is potent. I think 2 sprays are good enough in the summer heat (because the rose is more pronounced, unless you are a rose lover) and 4 in colder seasons. All in all, a very good perfume with excellent performance and if you are lucky you could get it at a very good price.",12/27/16 17:45,obar6084

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This was a gift that my husband personally picked out for me for Mothers day. It is sweet and i like it. The more i wear it the more it grows on me. If you ever smelled rose scented luxury bath soap from the 70's, this is that type of rose smothered in rasperry. The raspberry smells like bath and body works sun rippened raspberry body spray. There is a sprinkle of pink pepper. As the perfume dries it becomes more musky keeping the sweet rasperry and vintage rose. My husband loves this perfume and i receive alot of compliments wearing it. The best part about this perfume is smelling it wisp around me and through the air. It's 60 degrees outside with a slight breeze. I walk outside and in the wind the smell of roses and rasperry leave a lingering trail behind me and around me. It's quit beautiful. Sillage is soft but it continues to radiate softly all day. Longevity is about 6 hours. When you first spray Kenzo flower in the air wait a few minutes before smelling it, it takes time to settle and develop. If you smell it immediatly it's all sugary, after a few minutes it turns into something beautiful.",05/10/16 11:02,Perfumeaddict777

Lol this smells amazing but doesn't last at all.
Raspberries plus pink pepper in the beginning equals heaven.
Out comes a amazing trio burst of Rose, Gardena and magnolia.
The white musk base is perfect and would make me think it would last on me.
Sadly it only last a max of four hours on me. In my country I live, they sell this at department stores way over prices almost double. So it's highly unlikely I will buy. It's also maybe too teenagers, Abercrombie or Hollister etc. Lol type smell for me to spend that kind of money.",11/04/15 13:57,Meganmarijuana
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Flower in the air? More like cotton candy exploded in the air. LOL

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"The name of the fragrance suits it very well! It leaves some very nice floral scent in the air. The sillage is moderate, longevity also moderate. I think it perfectly avoids the nausea that strong flowery fragrances sometimes can cause (at least for me); this one is fresh and sweet without being overpowering. Very feminine, and I prefer this one to the Flower In The Air Eau de Toilette. And keep in mind that I do not usually fall for floral scents since I love aquatic, citrusy ones. Well done Kenzo! And I could even imagine wearing this in the winter.",05/11/15 07:24,GinWeed
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Its like having a rose absolue candy for the beginning, very sweet roses and gently intense. Gently intense? Ironic phrase but that is how it feels. The rose doesn't come on sharp or very flowery. Like the air its gentle yet massive with just one spray. This candy scent lasts probably nearly 2 hours and turns into a very strong musk. This musk is not gentle like the famous Narciso. It may sting a little (still tolerable for me), but this will turn into a much softer musk in an hour with the hint of rose.

Tresor Midnight Rose is much more like the raspberry i would imagine. For Flower in the Air EDP it does not feel like raspberry. I agree with others on the cotton candy. No pickups of notes like lily or gardenia either.

Overall a very likeable scent for sweet rose and musk lovers, a little romantic, a little dreamy, a little sexy. I just don't really like the bottle's design...",04/17/15 11:07,cherlynnie
Flower in the Air Kenzo,Well this one just crept up on me I would never choose Kenzo usually as I think that most of theres are revolting like the flower one in the tall bottle smells likes earl grey tea rather disgusting. However this one has surprised me in a good way it is just lovely right through the notes and my husband really likes it so that is good enough for me and it has a lovely bottle I give it a 9 out of 10 it's just sweet and light and very pleasant I really love it,04/10/15 14:18,Suzi
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"I bought this on a whim and I'm not happy. It's very rough on my senses. If you like soapy flowery scents, you may like this. I find it too strong and sweet, and slightly powdery. I'm so sad, the bottle is gorgeous.",03/13/15 14:32,EarlButAGirl

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Flower in the Air is an oxygenated version of Flower, if that makes any sense. It smells fresher, cleaner, slightly synthetic (like nearly all perfumes do these days), brighter and younger. The intoxicating (or nauseating) effect of the original Flower is considerably muted, but the relationship to it is there. Perhaps one could say Flower in the Air is the bright-eyed, freer (yet still composed) child of the more earthbound and serene Flower...",11/14/14 07:33,DarlingNikki
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Very prominent raspberry note. It reminds me of Amethyst by Lalique without the ""soapiness"". The longevity is not that great, but not terrible, about 4 hours on my skin. All things considered, great fragrance for spring or summer.",09/30/14 19:06,epg
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"I'm writing this review as I'm smelling the perfume on my arm. I know it might sound odd but this perfume just boosted my ego, I feel very feminine, sophisticated and amazing. I usually wear light, flowery, fruity scents but this one is a great alternate. The opening is fantastic with rich and luxurious rose, plus the sweet berry helps the rose not to be overwhelming and old. But I think it's the gardenia that grows on you, the more I smell this perfume on me, the more I'm loving it. It's the clean yet luxurious smell that I've been looking for and really wanted Bulgari Omnia Crystalline to work but it smelled a bit heavy on me. I will definitely add it to my collection.",09/20/14 00:24,Yumji999
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"I love the rose-raspberry-pink pepper trio in the opening. It's sweet and fresh and romantic, possessing the ""airiness"" that the name suggests. But after a while it slips into a rather generic fruity floral. There's nothing wrong with it and I wouldn't say nay to a bottle, I just wish it had a little more character. But I think this flanker is designed to be an unassuming, unobtrusive version of its predecessor and in that Kenzo has succeeded.

I'm a firm fan of the original and don't see much resemblance outside of the rose note. This is light, slightly soapy and a skin scent vs. Flower's potent powder bomb. Don't assume love or hate based on one or the other.",09/16/14 16:04,HanamiTsukimi
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"First of all- yes, I bought this because of the bottle. I adore everything with poppies, and when I saw this on the ""sale"" shelf... The bottle is like a design object in my room - irregular shape, simple,transparent lines and that red, bright poppy on the top. Beautiful!
Now about the scent...
I smell a dangerous rose in this perfume, and it reminds me that song by Kylie Minogue & Nick Cave ""Where the wild roses grow"".
The opening is fresh, sweet, dewy, wild rose and juicy raspberry mixture with some lightweight very mild powder. I smell some sparkling pink pepper which gives French vibe to this potion.
Then all this becomes more green, it must be gardenia. And then comes the ""evil"" in this wild summer garden -the musk. It adds a sensual, even a sin edge to the perfume. Modern, light, but still classic and quite unique daytime scent.
"" They call me The Wild Rose, but my name is Elisa Day...""",08/11/14 13:00,Juliana6
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"I had low expectation for this perfume due to the negative comments, but surprisingly, I like it enough for it to be my primary go-to perfume for a few months. It's very flowery and powdery--if you're into woody scents you may not like it. Sweet with a lot of rose and berries in it.

Longevity and sillage are excellent to me. Just a few spritzes on the right places and you're good. It's light enough to be worn in the day, but on a hot day it may turn overwhelming if you spray it even just a little bit too much.

Overall, it's quite versatile and it's likeable enough for me to wear it quite often, but I can see why this doesn't sit well with some people.

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This edp smells like gasoline mixed with melting plastic.
Many new releases do just that, strangely enough.",06/23/14 13:56,The Swedish girl
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"In 2013, Kenzo released this fragrance (not to be confused with the EDT version, announced in 2014), to integrate the Flower by Kenzo line, which is a sales success worldwide, taking the poppy as its central theme. The idea behind this creation was of a lighter poppy, as if the flower, which was planted on the floor, could achieve and bloom the sky.

With a simpler composition, without resins or incense, this floral won lightness, getting less powdery, but still keeping the DNA of the traditional version. Flower in The Air EDP contains notes of raspberry and pink pepper, in the output; Magnolia, gardenia and rose in the heart; white musk at the base.

Normally, the first impression you have of a fragrance that takes raspberry in its structure is that it will be sweet, with red berries aspect. A huge mistake! Here, the raspberry provides a slight bittersweet nuance, but what dictates the rules is still the bouquet of flowers. The scent of roses is perfect, as well as the presence of Magnolia, with its unique scent. The musk serves to terminate the evolution with its cleansing nuances, which transmit even more lightness to this fragrance. Although possessing Eau de Parfum concentration, Flower in The Air EDP does not exude for a long time but lasts fairly.

For the fans of Flower by Kenzo, here is a great floral option for torrid days of summer or for those who need to wear perfumes in a more contained manner.",05/08/14 06:39,Cassiano
Flower in the Air Kenzo,"This isn't bad but it's nothing like the original Flower or my personal favourite - Flower Essentielle.

More fruity, no powder, kinda like a synthetically constructed rose out of geraniol, dihydromercinol... sadly a no for me. It veers precariously close to smelling like one of those mainstream-nothing fragrances...

It doesn't smell bad... it just doesn't wow me - I don't feel alive in it. But for someone else this may be the exact thing they were looking for. I recommend trying it on the wrist, the opposite inner elbow... and on some fabric... I guess, see if its love for you...",04/26/14 22:09,maltatude

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"Tried today. It almost brought tears to my eyes... no, I'm joking! well, that would be an exageration, yet Flower in the Air really came to my sense as a Kenzo-relief.
Kenzo (if he cares about or rather leaves all the work to Others) launched some of the most beautiful and original perfumes of last decades. His original was a real floral dream. Real flowers.
Jungle L'Elephant was an unforgettable daring powerful oriental. The longtime lost Kashaya, that smells like nothing else I ever smelled.

Then Kenzo lost himself into the mists of fake plastic vanilla and burned nauseous powder... Kenzo Amour, nice enough but soooo headache cold vanilla, the same kind as HP.
And then Flower. One of the nightmare scents of last 10 years. Something I cannot smell without feeling my throat clenching and wanting to...
A long list of more or less meaningless works. Some good with Once upon...
Now Flower in the Air.
As I took the pretty enough but also a little tacky cheapie bottle in my hand, I thought: ""Ok, let's go. We need to do it for perfume reference, but try it on paper first!""
Oohhh! So nice and such a relief! Kenzo you came out of the burned plastic toxic mists, eventually!
Flower in the Air comes as a relief! It's highly breathable and that's already a lot!
And for the first time after years a Kenzo's perfume that state flowers in its name actually smells like something that can be called a flower. Name=thing, flower=flower, rose=rose. Not so difficult, an easy concept after all.

Flowers in the Air starts with a good vaguely sparkling rose as a statement: I'm rose.
I'm happy that the raspberry is done so gently and doesn't kill everything. This way it becomes a brilliant complimentary note to rose.
The mentioned White flowers are present and playful, but quite subdue compared to rose.
When the rose calms down it comes a sweet powdery musk. I should not like it at this stage but I actually do, maybe because it's vaguely reminiscent of Guerlain Idylle. Anyway a soft musky drydown with a gentle powdery edge, nothing screaming.
This is a scent I could wear very easily in spring when the weather is only warmer but still chilly. It's pretty, good, uncomplicated, modern and girlish without being boring.
Still chemical at certain degree, but gentle.",02/17/14 12:36,Mellyhelly

Flower in the Air Kenzo,OK. Actually I am not a kenzo lover. I even wasn't curious about this perfume because any of kenzo's creations didn't excite me. So being polite I tested it at the local drug store...... I was so surprised! It was exactly what I was looking for: optimistic energizing and very feminine perfume. It lasts a lot!

Flower in the Air Kenzo,"I won a 50ml version and was excited to try it, despite disliking the other Kenzo perfumes.

Despite the classy bottle, the scent itself is very plain and sugary to me. All I get is raspberry candy floss with roses, which is quite a sickly sweet smell. The lasting effect is poor.

The fact that it is extremely expensive would put me off it, but since I got it free, I gave it to my mother, who also said she thought it was unexciting.

(Now I´m thinking.... since this ""extreme"", ""intense"" wave is in vogue, is Kenzo thinking about releasing a stronger version in six months, just to have something more to sell?

Kenzo Homme Sport Kenzo,"I blind bought this. Been wearing for several days. Love it.

Right, it's not mind blowing, but I think it still has its own uniqueness. Very pleasant from start to end.

Doesn't project like crazy for sure, yet it is what it is. It does the work nicely. Very uplifting every second getting a whiff of it.

Really interesting juicy a bit sweet citrucy in the beginning. Plus a just right dose of mint blending with that fruity fresh juicy sweet citrucy.

The start getting that interesting ginger and bit of spicyness in the middle. The sweet refreshing citrucy is still there though.

Then ends in smooth vetiver and woody cedar.

I get a consistent 5-6 hours of longevity. Spraying on clothes however, really help to 7-8 hours. It even stays for days on my jacket.

In short, this is a great option for daily wear. It suits nicely both in hot weather and cooler times like night summer or rainy tropical climate.

Very happy everytime getting a whiff of this scent after 3 or 5 hours from the first spray.

Kenzo Homme Sport Kenzo,"Kenzo Sport goes on slightly sweet and minty, with a heavy oxide-like aroma carrying it. Brazen—you get a hint of the cedar from the start. It is a very monotone cedar essence. It strives to create a sense of masculinity with the warmth and abrasiveness that it adds.

There is a synthetic constitute that doesn't exactly sit well with me. Possibly a virgin nose would find it more enjoyable, but my nose is very seasoned and it muddles the mint essence for me. It's almost like a gingery balsam, with the sharpness of an oxide.

The fragrance dries down to a strong dominance of the monotone cedar, with the sharp oxide behind it, attempting to lift the warm abrasive qualities. They are a bit too heavy for it though, and I believe this is a boot technique, because I've experienced this exact same 'cedar' in Legendary Fragrances Treasure Island Lady.

The style of this fragrance is very adolescent, and seems to be geared more towards people in their high school years. However, I don't find that the basey use of cedar here would appeal to younger individuals like that—but is force-projecting—and would moreso be the kind of thing that makes them feel uncomfortable.

I do subtly enjoy the fragrance, but it's a bad sport, in the sense that it doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing anything sporty, attractive, or energetic.",10/09/20 16:55,Grasshoppaaa

Kenzo Homme Sport Kenzo,"Something about the drydown or latter end of this scent just really intrigues me. Towards the end ginger, mint, lemon and maybe grapefruit combine to make an odd scent that I like to smell.

It has an odd beginning, maybe synthetic or lemon furniture polish-like of an aroma. This weird beginning to it goes away and moves on to a slightly spicey end life.

Dior's Homme Sport is just a tick or notch above this Kenzo sport scent, the ginger is sweeter and stands out more in that Dior fragrance.

This is lite and lasts well into the 5-6 hour range and radiates well off of my skin.",10/20/15 21:09,siririschmoos

The dry down remind me of VPH and Allure Sport plus the ginger note. It's pretty linear and safe, great fragrance for summer outdoor activities.

Kenzo Homme Sport Kenzo,"In 1991, Kenzo brought Kenzo Pour Homme, which became a sales success and maintains numerous faithful fans, until nowadays. And as happened with other famous brands, the market has evolved and opened space for versions of the biggest hits in the world perfumery. Obviously, Kenzo Pour Homme has also won several versions, such as Kenzo Homme Fresh, Kenzo Homme Boisee (also called Kenzo Woody) and, in 2012, this sport version, which already owns even an intense version called Kenzo Homme Sport Extreme, released in 2013.

Kenzo Homme Sport follows the visual line of men's fragrances, with bamboo-inspired bottle, this time in a gray-blue tone and with the letters in red. It seems, too, that some bottles were sold with the ""sport"" word in the same white and smoky style as in the box, but that they do not continue being marketed currently.

Another important aspect is that the perfumer of this fragrance was François Demachy, who created fragrances for Acqua di Parma, in addition to numerous successes of Dior, Fendi and Givenchy.

This is not a replacement version of Kenzo Homme Fresh, as some believe. The latter was a great alternative of freshness to the original version. Here, I see another attempt to create a new version, focused on establishing its place within the family Kenzo Homme. And if we're going to talk about dna, this one kept something from the Boisee (Woody) version, with the notes of mint in the output and cedar in the base.

Kenzo Homme Sport is an aromatic spicy fragrance, with tonic notes of Mint and ginger, combined with the grapefruit, which merge into a heart of geranium and a base of cedar and vetiver.
The output is almost an energizing shock, rich in citrus and refreshing aromas, ideal for the sportsman. The heart is more voluminous and the Ginger takes time to appear, but is a full prize for those who enjoy fragrances with this note. Finally, the base is woody and light with the typical aroma of cedar, representing the soil in which the athlete steps.

The sillage is great and the lasting is not bad, as many others within the standards of sporting fragrances.

For the man who doesn't make a point of showing off, who is free and sexy in a natural way and doesn't take life too seriously, Kenzo has brought Kenzo Homme Sport. I must confess that I'm curious about the Extreme Sport version.",01/17/14 03:07,Cassiano

First I thought this to be a more weak Kenzo Boisee with a hint of citrus (the last main accord of the five listed above) among the top notes, but Sport is a stronger scent, is very long lasting and usually tires my nose quickly, although I receive more compliments with it than with Boisée. Also, is not herbal orientated as Boisée is. Anyway, my feeling with this Kenzo is that they aren't trying to create something really new, even as a sport scent, but just going with the wave of the majority. Some are better than others, but most of them still very average or unoriginal. Here they took Kenzo Boisee, recycled it to look like a sport scent, and voilà.

Kenzo Homme Sport Kenzo,"First impression; this one reminds me of Givenchy Play Sport with citrusy sweet mint. It just lacks the floral accord that is in the Givenchy. Spices create something a bit vulgar and animalic like a body odor. It's not a good thing but luckily it is subtle (phew!).

So far, I find this edition of Kenzo to be pretty good. It's nicely woody, average staying power, but it's not as chilly and cool as other sport frags. It's not even spicy either. It's just somewhat mellow. I am not totally in love with it tho because Givenchy Play Sport is still on the top of my list for 2012 sporty fragrance.",06/12/12 18:34,nattonline
Kenzo Homme Sport Kenzo,"This one has no DNA of the regular Kenzo Homme and smells more lika a sporty version of Kenzo Homme Boisee. It starts like a lighter variation of Armani Code Sport: minty notes on a gingery lemony foundation. But soon the scent becomes more herbal reminding a bit of Burberry The Beat and especially the dry down of Bleu de Chanel (not the fruity opening, but the earthy dry down of Bleu!).

The good point of the fragrance is the high quality of ingridients. The bad ones are average projection and worse longevity than Armani Code Sport, Dior Homme Sport and Bleu de Chanel have. Nevertheless it's a decent stuff in the range of sport fragrances.",03/30/12 08:26,antonpan

I can see it worn at a colorful business suit maybe a sky blue one with a white blouse in a spring day while you are in a city break vacation in a location like Vienna or Verona or Copenhagen.

To my nose this is very much like walking through an apple or pear orchard in full bloom on a sunny breezy day. Not heady or too sweet. Very carefree and easy going. Although I'm looking for an easy floral for spring, florals and fresh are always a crap-shoot on my skin and while this is not bad at all, Floralista is a bit ""too fresh"" for my tastes. It's still quite chilly out so I will try it again when the weather warms to make my final verdict. I'll update then.

Floralista Kenzo,"24. March 2014

Today i have tested it for the first time in tax free shop and i must say that it is a very very good floral fragrance. The notes didn't sound promising, but the actual scent is a great one and now i will get certainly several bottles of this beauty. It makes you feel like you're standing in a garden in full bloom on a warm sunny late spring day. Delicious i must say.
At first it opens with a bit sour combination of apple blossom and peony, and i had fears that it might stay that way through the whole composition until the very end, but after 15-20 minutes it becomes much more softer, thanks to the peach blossom, which i didn't detect a first at all. It turns into more creamy oeachy delicate yet strong scent, which i haven' t smelled in countless other releases. Very good indeed, i enjoy it very much and surprised to see such a good fragrance made for a tax free retail. Normally these kind of fragrances are bland and generic but Kenzo positively surprised me this time.
I don't smell any pear gladly, or if there IS one, it is not domnanting at all but accompanies other notes.
Kenzo has made few good scents for tax free retail in the past and this is another great example. I feel like it will become one of my favorites for spring, but it is also good for autumn. Somehow i feel like it would be too strong for summer, at least for me.
Longevity could be better, it lasted around 4 hours on my skin.

Has Daphné Bugey ever set foot out of Europe?

Nothing about this fragrance invokes anything remotely related to the smells or feelings of being in Bali let alone anywhere in Asia. Knowing Bali well, I was at least expecting some Southeast Asian florals like kamboja (frangipani), champak, lemon grass or kenanga (ylang ylang).

7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"14. december 2020

It seems like most of Kenzo fragrances are not really my best matches and to me most of them are quite boring. This Bali fragrance is also the case, it is very nice done vanilla scent with sprakling grapefruit and the ingredients are of a high quality, but still it lacks that extra ""oomph"" for me. And judging by the price of it i can tell you that it is overhyped. You can get similar fragrances for less. Call me crazy, but i get a very close dupe of L´instant by Guerlain after the opening fades away. It is quite linear without development, it basically stays the same the whole time and this is not much exciting for me either. It does remind me a lot of Madagascar, but this one is lighter. I also get quite a similar vibe with Boucheron´s ""Trouble"" but Bali is less powdery and less strong. Overall it is nice but as i said before it is not something i would brag about or spend a fortune on. Moderate sillage and average lasting power. I have sold my bottle, since for me i like my ""L´instant"" much more and they are quite close to me, when i tested them side by side, so since i have enough of ""L´instant"" i decided to let go of less exciting ""Bali""

7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"Mm. Sweet and sour, airy, very Kenzo. On me it's barely more acidic than vanillic. I can't believe there isn't any frangipani note in it, it has that kind of a vibe. Don't lynch me over this but there is something in it that reminds me of Midnight Fantasy as well, though certainly very restrained.

The name seems about right, it has a morning kind of vibe, but I almost feel like it evokes a cityscape rather than Bali. I don't know why this is, I haven't even been outside of Europe, so I wouldn't know what Indonesia/Bali is like to begin with. This fragrance makes me think of living in the heart of a major Asian metropolis and getting ready to dive into the morning bustle on a day where you feel well-rested and excited for what the day will bring, maybe knowing you have a date lined up after work or something like that.",03/31/17 11:18,Madrona

Nulla di originale, nulla di spettacolare, soltanto la sintesi, nel senso chimico del termine, delle 7,15 a Bali. Esotico senza essere fastidiosamente carico di tiarè e simili, fruttato senza essere sciropposo, discreto quanto basta per immaginarsi lontani senza strillare. bello e fuori produzione.",02/21/17 03:50,polly golightly

The light airiness is typical Kenzo and there are certainly Kenzo scents I adore (Elephant has my heart). But this one just smells very drugstore, mall-frag to me, nothing distinctive.
However, it is ""true"" to its notes, so, if you are a vanilla lover but want to try something different with an aquatic grapefruit-passionfruit vibe, instant powder from the orchid, then go for it. I think it is ""office friendly"" and more appropriate for spring and summer days in the heat. Perhaps it might even be better then, as I'm wearing it in the winter now.",01/24/17 09:22,shiva-woman
7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"Instantly recognizable as a Kenzo fragrance Almost like it says ""I am Kenzo, be prepared. You know who I am, let me welcome you to the experience.""

It is sweet like candy, but not the kind of candy you find usually in fragrances. It's not like cotton candy, gummy bears. Not like a celebrity scent appealing to teens who want to smell like a sugar bomb. It's more of a sweet, soft, slightly creamy sweet made for adult taste. Imagine planning your dream trip to Bali, expecting what it would be like. Things are rarely what you imagine them to be, but your trip to Bali is exactly what you expected and wanted. That feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment mixed with pure joy and relaxation is what is evoked in me when I smell this - my expectations are reality.

So first of all, when I see grapefruit in a fragrance, I avoid it. The fact that 7:15am in Bali also has passion fruit only further pushes me away. The scents I have tried with this combination always, ALWAYS result in an acidic, pungent, sour quality that I just do not like and it does not work on me. However, 7:15 leaves only the most sweet, creamy, and friendly aspects of these fruits, though their signature qualities are still there. They are perfectly balanced with florals of jasmine and orchid which soften it even further. Lastly we have this delicious, warm, creamy vanilla that wraps everything up and slowly sinks in through the notes, blending beautifully as our journey of 7:15am in Bali continues.

As we come to the end, like a memorable vacation, the sweetness I initially experienced returns quietly as a reminder, until this scent slowly disappears and sinks slowly into warm vanilla, until you're left with nothing but a lovely memory of 7:15am in Bali.",04/29/16 12:34,Oamae

7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"Long ago, I sold my Kenzo 7:15 am in Bali on EBay. I thought it was too strong with crazy longevity on me and ""flat"" vanilla. At that time, I was wearing Chopard Casmir, so you can see why the poor Kenzo didn't stand a chance.
I recently swapped for it, and I got it back into my collection. At the same time, I swapped for a 5ml decant of L'Elephant. I thought I really would learn more by wearing these two Kenzo vanillas side by side, so the left wrist has the L'Elephant and the right wrist has the 7:15 in Bali.
Both are creamy, but not sweet vanillas. I use mexican vanilla when I cook because it's much better quality and has almost no alcohol. Kenzo vanilla is like that. It's rich and creamy pure vanilla pared down. So, what the house of Kenzo does, is add other elements to that vanilla base to change it up. The L'Elephant has a dry leaves and hot dirt in the sun feeling. Because I also have Dzing!, which has the horse note, this Kenzo does have a dry elephant skin note at the very opening! I really don't know how they managed that, but I love it. This fragrance DID remind me of my safari in Kenya. It had the wide open skies, the airy vast feel, the dry hot earth in the sunshine (not wet damp dirt like Demeter), and sunshine all on top of that cozy vanilla. The citrus notes with the vanilla actually smell like sunshine! I feel like this really would be the perfect fragrance to wear on safari when you're in the hot sun in those open air jeeps watching all the beautiful elephants walk by. It's making me feel so happy I could cry.

The 7:15am in Bali has that same vanilla base, but with soft palm fronds layered over it. I also got a very very light orchid smell, which I would like to amplify. This one also reminded me of Bali. Bali is probably the lushest, greenest, most floral place I've ever been. One of my favorite things to do in Bali is to go to the spas. There are so many spas in town where you can get a massage, bath, and scrub. One place I feel in love with had little cabanas in a circle around a carved teakwood garden setting. You'd go into your little cabana and get into a warm bath with a ton of floating orchids, then you'd get a sugar scrub and a massage. After the massage, you go sit on a teakwood recliner in the flower garden to relax. Kenzo has managed to bottle all that!! The only note that I didn't get much of was the orchid flowers, but I can layer it in. The 7:15 in Bali has the green palm fronds from the garden, with the vanilla smell that I love, with a hint of the warm woods.

7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"I do love Amour and I think 7:15 is like his cousin. More creamy, soft and more wearable all year. I bought it in a store in Bahamas. Love at first. Sad it's discontinued. Why is that??????.",11/26/13 15:08,hernie
7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"7:15am in Bali is all about creamy vanilla, candied passionfruit and sparkling grapefruit. Not necessarily a scent that I'd associate with a tropical country like Bali, but delicious and fun nonetheless.

This fragrance is more than likely going to appeal to younger consumers due to its sweet and fruity nature. I found myself quite drawn to it at first, however I must admit that I was later disappointed because it smelt similar to other mainstream vanilla fragrances.

So far I have only been able to find this limited edition in duty free stores. My guess is that it is intended for travellers.

If you already enjoy Kenzo Amour, you'd probably like 7:15am in Bali. Kenzo does vanilla well. I can wear this fragrance without getting too much of a headache. It's quite a shame that this fragrance isn't more readily available.

The orchid note in the heart causes this fragrance to smell a tiny bit like Britney Spears' Fantasy, however this similarity is fairly short-lived. I would say that 7:15am in Bali is quite an easy fragrance to like.

The lasting strength is average and the sillage is fairly soft. It's a hard fragrance to track down, but I would recommend searching for it online if you're serious about buying it.",07/13/13 01:49,missk
7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"Love from the first split. Actually it's not that feminine to me. The sweetness of this fragrance come from vanilla and no heady floral. It's simple(I admit) but still very good. Sweet and creamy. Very comforting like a dawn and morning breeze at beautiful resort. a romantic one.

For the unisex fragrance it may a bit on feminine side but not too feminine for a guy either. I found it soft vanilla and not candy or floral sweet. New fav for me and I'll take it everywhere.",03/05/13 04:46,windhill
7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"Another great find by the House of Kenzo. And as usual, I always fall hard for LE's fragrances and this is now very hard to find. I don't know ""notes"" too well, but this is an exotic blend of familiar smells. This is a lovey tropical with orange vanilla and some coconut cream yet it's not foody. I love orange in the warmer months and usually find vanilla better in cooler months. But this is done in such a way I'd prefer it warmer months, but will wear it year round. The orange is the perfect citrus fruit that's not bitter like grapefruit or tart like lemon. The vanilla is not a warm vanilla but more like vanilla ice cream. And the coconut gives it the creaminess and exoticisim that tropical quality. I will wear this when i go on vacation . . . whether it is for real or just in my imagination. Simply lovely.",11/10/12 20:37,40plus&fab
7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"An incredibly feminine sexy gourmand which is powdery vanilla with sweetness and warmth..

I applied 6 heavy sprays

0- 2 mins. Fills the room. This bottle is EDT, Initial smell is synthetic and a little bit off

2 mins -1 hour - 1 foot projection. Okay, here we go, the true scent reveals itself and I am confused, this is listed as unisex...???? ""you've got to be kidding me"".. John Mcenroe.. This is so femine sexy, it is amazing, it leaves me stunned, this is tanned cougar, vanilla-powdery-sweety gourmand with a hint of what smells like leather (not listed). Ages 34- 56. Wowie!

1 hour - 4 hours - 8 inch projection. Quite linear, so sexy, can't get enough of it...

4 hours - 6 hours - 3 inch projection with some trails

6 hours - 8 hours. 2 inch projection, drydown not as nice as start and some sourness comes in

Long lasting

I have been to Bali and there was no smell to recall. What there was though close to Bali was the single most incredible smell that I have ever come across, which I recommend lovers of aromas experience once in your life- you will be astonished. Get a slow boat from Bali to Lombok to arrive in Lombok for approx just before dusk... You will experience 30 mins away from Lombok the most incredible enthralling burst of spice aromas which will encaspsulate your love of fragrance forever..

(Then take an overland bus journey through the Spice Islands to Flores, seeing Komodo, Mt Keli Mutu's dawn, and all that the Indonsesian reefs have to offer.. enjoy the sun and diverse ethnic cultures of multiple islands and most important, take it easy for once!)

Very good",09/30/12 13:12,ChristopherRiley
7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"I obtained a small bottle of Kenzo 7:15am IN BALI out of curiosity from a discounter (hence, scent unsniffed), and after several wearings, I have to say that I'm not really smitten with it. I say this because it seems as though I am alone, given all of the glowing reviews.

To my nose, BALI seems a bit off somehow. It may be that the orchid and fruit are imparting a slightly sour cast to the vanilla, and that may very well have been intended by the perfumer as an olfactory effect, but unfortunately it reminds me somewhat of the endless catalogue of bad synthetic sandalwood vanilla frags.

I should say that, on a good day, I find this perfume rather pleasant to wear, albeit not that exciting, and I do always perceive its synthetic cast--it's just that on a good day I don't mind that so much. I suppose that since this is a limited edition travel issue to be sold at duty-free shops at airports to tourists on their way to vacations in far away exotic places, BALI is supposed to convey the calmness one feels while lying on a beach having left all one's worries behind back home. So it's not really supposed to be a high-energy, revolutionary scent.

Rather oddly, every time I see the image on the bottle, before having focused, it looks like a bodybag to me. On closer examination, it proves to be some pillows on a bed. And maybe that's a good metaphor for the contents of the bottle as well.",04/08/12 13:56,sherapop

7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"I like it, but I prefer 5.40 P. M. in Madagascar, it lasts longer and it's more memorable.

Kenzo in Bali is a pleasant smell with strong vanilla and flowery notes, also nice grapefruit. All in all stays rather close to skin but more than 12 hours on me, that's good. It's darker than Kenzo in Madagascar, actually it brings flowers and fruit covered in chocolate to my mind, or a room in semi-darkness, spring or summer, morning is near, air blooms. Comforting and subtle, a bit similar to Madagascar in climate but different ( it's thicker, Madagascar is more as if a cloud was flowing around you).
I'd say it's a fragrance good for days you just want to feel comfortable, nice, you're tired of too sophisticated fragrances and as if you went to hot countries. I've never been to Bali, so hard to say if it shows the real atmosfere in the place, but I really admire these fragrances - stops to show atmosphere of nature and places I've never been to.

The bottle looks nice. What the fragrance lacks is I wish there were better quality ingredients here.

In my opinion it's oriental-vanilla or even oriental gourmand (but not imitating food!)

Despite being mildly sweet, can be frec, something like a passion fruit popsicles ... The fund vanilla is very cozy, is not dense, but that evaporates and leaves a touch of purity to the skin as well ... Think of a leaf with a green and fresh passion fruit mousse on top. That's how I feel when using this perfume! But there's a catch, it's a scent that is not noticed, have to get up close to see, lasts up to 4 hours on my skin",05/19/11 17:21,Nikka Miró

I love it, the flowers, vanilla and passion fruit are so superbly blended, it smells very ""niche"" if I can say that.
This perfumes is indeed sweet and humid, smells like rays of sunshine on wet flowery gardens or jungle. It has a salty undertone, almost like skin covered in ocean water warming in the sun.
Silage is minimal, lasting power less then average too. The bottle, quite hideous. What were they thinking?
I don't understand why Kenzo would create this little beauty, and give it so little power....
Recommended because it's truly a beautiful skin scent, but it should definitely be stronger.",11/15/10 20:11,Happyme2009
7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"I was very excited to try this scent for a few reasons. First of all, ""7:15 am in Bali""? I mean, come on! That sounds wonderful! If a perfume can transport me to a morning in Bali, it's definitely worth a try. And second of all, the reviews on here were very good, people seem to love it.

I loved it too when I finally got my hands on a small decant. It's deliciously sweet and summery, like the smell of sunscreen and dry oil on sundrenched skin. The jasmine and vanilla envelop you in a comforting blanket of scent. It is easy to wear, not offensive to people around you, and works really well as a summer scent.

However, the love affair didn't last long. I'm not sure why, but shortly after smelling it for the first few times, I started picking up on a sharp note. And every time I smelled it after that, my nose went straight for that sharpness. Maybe it's the grapefruit or passionfruit, but it's like coming across a slice of lemon inside a rich chocolate cake. It takes away from the rich mellow sweetness, and ruins it for me a little bit.

I'll still wear the rest of my decant and maybe even venture into buying a full bottle if I see one, because it is quite a nice scent. But the short staying power and sharpness make it difficult to really love.",11/15/10 18:45,divadani

7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"7:15 am in Bali is a creamy wonder. It starts, and finishes, the same on me which makes me very happy. It's a creamsicle reformed into a high end, low lit, romantic restaurant, fine dessert. This would be a custard delicately, a lightly browned top, surrounded by creamy orange and vanilla sauces lightly drizzled on the plate. The creamsicle effect is most likely the passion fruit blended with the vanilla but it's very soft and unassuming and I love it.

It stays close to the skin after the opening but it's well worth the effort to re-apply if needed. For me it conjures up a humid steamy summer evening out. It isn't necessarily sexy, more warm and slightly sultry. I just picked up a full bottle after burning through my sample vial. I agree with nathalieZ, this is definitely more feminine.",04/30/10 10:22,c3c

7:15 AM in Bali Kenzo,"The opening was a delight! I couldn't tell it was grapefruit--just something citrus. It almost began as a light orange creamsicle on me. The passionfruit kept the grapefruit from being to bittersweet & citric. But the middle notes turned into something not so pleasing to my senses--almost the same way that Moschino Funny dried down on me. This wasn't as bad though. It turns almost into a powdery vanilla with a hint of citrus/fruity flavor after the middle notes go away. I'm on the edge over this one. Sillage isn't great (but I only have a sample). Might be different in spray form. It's been on me for 3 hours so far, and still seems to remain noticeable if you're in close proximity of me. Will update when it begins to fade completely.

I absolutely loved the smell of this perfume when I first found it at an airport duty free.
However the fragrance really does disappear quickly from my (male) skin - I applied some at the departing and arriving airport and when I got home an hour later it was only slightly perceptible ...

The fragrance is soft, not too strong, but fit to my skin very well. When dries down, I feel vanilla and orchid, and - it’s interesting - feel some coconut notes (although not contains coconut). It’s not similar, but the character of this fragrance on my skin reminds me to JLO Miami Glow. When I wear, my feeling is the same: hot summer nights at the sea.

Eau De Fleur de Magnolia Kenzo,"I've been neglecting my bottle of this for years, I'm ashamed to say. After I bought it I went through a niche perfume phase which led me away from the simple beauty of fragrances like this. I discovered Eau de Fleur de Magnolia the other day during a clean out and have been wearing it constantly. I've looped my way back to this, and to a better appreciation of simplicity done well.

Eau de Fleur de Magnolia is a tender, creamy floral with a pronounced citrusy topnote. Despite its delicacy it has some tenacity, about 5-6 hours on me. It's spring here and soon the magnolias will be in bloom and I'll be able to compare them to the perfume. Still, Eau de Fleur de Magnolia is beautiful regardless of how close to nature it is. This is the only magnolia soliflore I've ever smelled so I don't know how it compares to others, Frederic Malle's for instance, or Acqua di Parma's. Again, it doesn't matter.

It was only ever a limited edition which is a terrible pity because it deserved better. It could be the summer signature for an elegant woman of any age. Good taste has no age.

This is light, linear, genial and utterly inoffensive. I often reach for it when nothing else seems to appeal, particularly on hot days.

It layers well with other light citrus scents or scents with a coniferous note. On this warm July day, I'm wearing it layered with Jo Malone's Verbenas of Provence and am very pleased by its blend with the lemon and cypress notes in the Jo Malone.",07/13/13 15:26,drouhin

Eau De Fleur de Magnolia Kenzo,"This is a very beautiful, creamy magnolia fragrance with a delightful citrusy opening. Unfortunately Eau de Fleur de Magnolia was limited edition, but if you do happen to stumble on some going cheap, grab it. It was composed by Francis Kurkdjian before he set up his own house and started charging big bucks for his perfumes.

Eau de Fleur de Magnolia is not especially long-lasting. To me it is rather unsexy and overall is a little too polite and discreet for me. I agree with the very first reviewer, at the bottom of the screen, that this is an introverted scent. I'm an introvert myself so, paradoxically perhaps, I prefer my fragrances bolder than this. It makes me think of a person who strives so much to demonstrate her elegance and good taste that she fears making any sort of statement at all.

But I have found a use for my full bottle of Eau de Fleur de Magnolia: I spray it in the bath as the water is running. (You can do this with any perfume.)

Eau De Fleur de Magnolia Kenzo,"I stumbled upon this fragrance while searching for perfumes with Magnolia notes. Bath and Body Works' Magnolia Blossom was one of my favorite fragrances of all time and since chances of them bringing it back are VERY slim I decided to try to find something to take its place.

I bought Eau de Fleur de Magnolia because of the good reviews, and one that even mentions BBW's fragrance. I am not disappointed - Eau de Fleur de Magnolia is GORGEOUS. It is the only soliflore that I have bought thus far. It is a good, clean, sunny floral that takes on a wonderful creaminess as it dries down. I have to say, it doesn't smell like I remember Magnolia Blossom smelling - but, to be fair, I haven't actually owned/smelled Magnolia Blossom personally for a few years at least. There is something about Eau de Fleur de Magnolia that is both invigorating and elegant. I have never smelled true magnolia, but if this is any indication of what they smell like I can guarantee I would love them, too!

I am sad that there is such limited availability of this fragrance. This gorgeous, feminine number ranks among my favorite fragrances of all time.

Eau De Fleur de Magnolia Kenzo,"I have been searching a long time in reality and my dreams to find a magnolia fragrance that actually features the magnolia blossoms from the southern U.S. Let me tell you, THIS IS IT. I hardly get much of the citrus, as this fragrance is not like a Guerlinade which often starts with a big citrusy bite, and then calms to the rest of the story. This fragrance is simply, beautifully, a magnolia sole flore. As time renders the fragrance, it feels more acquatic and ethereal. This could be seen as a negative but since I am not a big floral fragrance lover, this is a positive for me.

When I spray this, I am immediately taken back to my grandfather's farm. My grandmother had many very large magnolias in her yard along with about 100 diffferent varieties of Irises. They lived not far from the Chesapeake Bay a little north of Norfolk, so the summers are very hot and humid. The smell of these lovely magnolia blossoms carried and hung in the air like the heaviest velvet.

This fragrance brings forth the magnolia in all it's dark green glossy leaves, white flowers with yellow/orange stamen and interior. If eating a magnolia blossom burst all it's flavor into your nose and mouth, you'd have this fragrance!

Eau De Fleur de Magnolia Kenzo,"I love the scent of magnolia blossom and was actually looking for a soliflore when I came across this one online. Hmm, magnolia blossom and citrus together?

WOW! This is an amazing combination. Pure sunshine in a bottle. Fleur de Magnolia starts off with a generous blast of lemony citrus, which burns off quite quickly.

The end result? A delicate, natural and beautiful magnolia blossom scent with an ever so slight citric twist. Bright, uplifting, cheerful and warm.

Eau De Fleur de Magnolia Kenzo,"I won this fragrance in a drawing (Thanks, Now Smell This!) and haven't smelled the other two in the series.

I do get a burst of fresh, light citrus in the top notes - I think perhaps mandarin, not bergamot - but it does not last more than five minutes. Very quickly I smell freesia, and lemony-creamy magnolia. As the fragrance wears on, I begin to get lily of the valley along with the freesia. After a few hours, the scent plays out (normal for an edt strength), with just the remnant of the light florals on the skin, rather than the basenotes one might expect (white musk? woody notes).

Clean, fresh, pretty, and ladylike. This fragrance is one of those pleasant background scents every woman needs, for when you want to smell nice but unmemorable.

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"***Update about one year in***
Well DAAAANG! So, I e owned my bottle of the latest formulation of Kemzo Jungle Homme for about a year now and while initially I was NOT at all impressed with the performance, its just gotten better and better over-time! Id noticed slight improvements the first vouple.months in, but NOE after not having used it in about 5 nonths I pulled it out, did a couple spritzes on my arm and its REALLY projecting and is lasting much longer that it did (Especially in the begining.) Lemme tell ya'll those 2 little spritzes on my forearm are continuously reaching my nose and seems much more rich, deeper and the top notes arent leaving my skin fast like it used to.

My advice (IF you own a lot of frags) is try to not use it too much so as to NOT waste it trying to over-spray so you can get decent longevity. I mean Im NOT exaggerating, the different is pretty drastic and although this is considered sort of ""A cheapy"" , it is SOOO worth the wait! So just wear it a few times to let air in your bottle, then put him back in his box and put him away for a few months! A STELLAR unique, Fresh/Spicey fragrance! The Cardamom and Mate with lime and the Sanflewood base... AMAZE-BALLZ! I NOW give this little ""Hidden Gem an 8.5 outta 10.. Plus this has been discontinued guys! But its still available and affordable so order yourself a bottle! I'M So glad I did and that I waited so it ""Maturated"" properly!

Now, in the new version, there is only a pale shadow of them. It's a piece of shit. Yaano's perfumery took a wrong turn and became obsessed with 2 notes - sickly sweet fragrances and akigalawoOd. perfumery is no longer about olfactory art, but about the conveyor belt. It's the buzzers that are to blame. They don't give a fuck, they treat everything like an endless social media feed with 15-second clips.",07/27/25 10:30,AlexPurple
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I’m reviewing a 50ml bottle with the older style packaging, ie, “Kenzo Jungle Pour Homme” written inside the green box in the centre.

Make no mistake, this comes from a time when fragrances were intentionally designed as works of olfactory art to be sprayed, truly taken in, and savored. Things have sadly gone downhill since, with the current climate of churning out as many bubblegum, sugary elixir flankers as possible each financial quarter to feed the drooling social media algorithm-addicted basics who buy whatever influencers tell them to buy.

This? Fragrances with this much pre-conceived thought, focus, and vision feel completely alien in 2025. Like they were created on an entirely different planet. Designer houses took creative risks back then. Putting trends aside, there is absolutely no way this fragrance would ever make it past the focus panel/product/marketing approval stages in the current landscape we find ourselves in. Because no one has the balls to take creative risks anymore.

The slight animalic funk coming from the mate note that hovers in the background gives this a “carnality”. Really earthy and human.

Smells like making love to a woman on the packed, dry earth of the Serengeti savanna under a clear, moonlit sky next to a guaiac wood (palo santo) crate filled with limes and jars of spices. This is citrusy, earthy, woody, sweet, sour, and spicy all at once with a slight “sweat” type of accord humming in the background but I mean that in a very good way. Maybe there's also some dried Zebra dung funking away in the distance for added measured haha.

Longevity/performance, even on my older bottle, is not the greatest. But overspray this bad boy, enjoy the ride, then smile once it’s over. Knowing you’re always only ever one spray away from returning to that far-flung African trading post on the savanna.

I bless the rains down in Africa.

Just received this in the mail and applied it post shower. The middle notes are similar to those found in Versace Blue jeans, another 90’s scent. Jungle for sure has some similarities to others released in 1998. Armani Emporio comes to mind. Jungle has a good sweetness to it to offset the woody notes. It is an Eau De Toilette so apply it liberally. Perfect evening cologne for the summer, depending on the temp you could get away with it being a summer daytime as well.",07/25/25 10:27,AConnoisseur

Great. There's this interesting but somewhat funny sweet aspect about it. I wondered at first what this accord might be. I guess it's the citruses mixed with the typically spicy notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom. There's also something bubble-gummy about it. And I also get the Byredo Gypsy Water comparison. Jungle is more about citruses, Gypsy Water is more about spices. To me Gypsy Water smells like indian workers in Dubai, or just like some indian incense.

Really very interesting.

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Ive already reviewed Kenzo Jungle Homme, but I want to offer up my experience thus far as a word of advice to whomever is planning on purchasing this (possibly discontinued) GEM of a masculine, woody/spicey/fresh, unique scent.

So when Id first purchased my very first bottle of Jungle homme a few months ago, I was pretty dissapointed with the performance over all. It did NOT seem to last over 2 hours, and the sillage was a bit too intimate for my liking. So, what I would do is I would definately over-spray this scent liberally so I could get atleast moderate performance out of Kenzo Jungle Homme. Loved the scent, but yeah after watching review after review stating that it had ""Solid Performance"", I felt completely let down. Now OF-COURSE its bc of reformulations as this scent has been around since ""1998"", so I was sorta expecting the poor performance all be it with fingers crossed in hoped that it hadn'tbeen completely neutered!.

Well, Id try wearing it again here and there while over-spraying with minimal performance improvement over-time which caused a pretty good dent in my bottle, but still, no drastic improvements. Well after 2 or 3 months of not wearing Kenzo Jungle, I picked him up again and was pleasantly surprised at how much the performance had improved! Its now WAY MORE PRESENT, Lasts quite a bit longer on skin and ESPECIALLY on clothes where I can clearly smell it even into the following day, and it lasts a good 5 to 6 hours on skin. Plus Im not even having to over-spray too much for it to give me decent sillage/projection and longevity.

So my advice is, if you really wanna grab a bottle of this 90's gem of a fragrance. Wear it a couple times spraying a decent amount out, but then put it away for at-least 2 1/2 to 3 months so as NOT to waste as much as I have. Trust me, your patience will certainly pay off, plus again, I do believe this is or will be discontinued soon so it wont be as easy to come by sooner rather than later! Thanks for reading my thoughts on this great scent! Blessings! And remember... BEEE PATIENT!🫠😉",05/10/25 10:19,Morenoetrata
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,I first reviewed this 11 years ago and I remember it being really strong and more complex. It used to be able to fill up a room with its aroma. The bottle I have from 2018 is more mellow and more citrus forward with some spices and woody elements later in the dry-down. The older formulation was more of a cooler weather scent because of how strong it used to be with the spices and cedar notes but the newer formulation can be worn during the warmer months. It's still a good scent and unique either way but I wish it was closer to how I remembered it.,04/23/25 20:32,Roman86

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Glasgow airport, 1998. A woman was promoting this in the duty free section, so I took a spray, then bought 2 bottles straight away. For me, this is one of the holy trinity of my youth. The other 2 being Gph 1 & Envy. And i'm fortunate enough to own all of them today.

What can this compare to.... nothing really. It stands apart from anything else I've ever tried. Longevity isn't great, but so what. This one is the old mate you've known for decades who visits you every so often for a couple of hours, we've all moved on and have families and busy lives now, to reminisce about the old days. And when he leaves, you're glad he dropped by, because you're always left in a really good mood.

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I just picked up Kenzo Jungle Homme for a steal, and I'm thoroughly impressed so far.

Judging by the reviews I wasn't quite sure how animalic, cumin-spicy, sweet, or generally weird this would be. I'm here to report that, at least based on a freshly opened bottle, this is very smooth, well-blended and balanced.

Mentions of a discongruous, disgusting opening do not align with my experience. The refreshing citrus and spices mingle immediately with warm and woody base notes and does not come off as super challenging or helter skelter. Yes, there is cumin, accounting for the BO complaints, but it's brief and enjoyable and is mostly gone by the time the heart arrives within 30min. Do you like cumin? Great. Are you super sensitive to absolutely any amount? Avoid this, but for those in the middle know that it's not overbearing and blends in with the rest of the notes quickly.

There is some cinnamon and nutmeg, adding a spice melange texture that plays nicely into the woods and mellow benzoin sweetness. I detest any syrupy, overdosed sweetness, and Jungle provides sweetness in a balanced form that plays into the naturally sweet qualities of cinnamon, nutmeg, sandalwood and guaiac wood. No cavities here.

Is Jungle a little funky? Yes! But that is part of it's charm, and that subjective funkiness completely melts away quickly into a very pleasant and silky experience for lovers of wood and spice. Time will tell on performance, but first impressions are that after the first 30min this sits closer to the skin, with middle of the road projection.

What I really love about Jungle is the subtlety in how the woody base is rendered. It's softer, subtle, and allows itself to be discovered, which is directly opposite to the trend of akigalwood, amberwood, and super loud woody aromachemicals found in many woody bases of today.

I am slightly reminded of Costume National Homme, but that is louder in spice, projection and sweetness but shares the nutmeg spice over a warm, sandalwoody base. Azzaro Visit is in the ballpark as well, but that is far muskier, has noticeable vetiver, and the woody notes are far more scratchy and synthetic to my nose. Kenzo Jungle threads the needle of these two for me, and instantly resonates more.

The last comparison is one to Principe Real by Antiga Barbearia de Bairro (a small shaving company I discovered in Portugal) that I highly recommend. Both share fresh citrus openings, spicy and semi-sweet notes, on top of beautiful and subtle woody bases. They are different but similar in general character and both make incredibly versatile scents that span age ranges, seasons, and note profiles. Apparently, Principe Real is extremely similar to Guerlain L'instant Homme, so I would guess fans of Kenzo Jungle could give that a look as well.

Jungle is currently a huge bargain under $50, but I think it transcends the bargain category and is just plain good. Last thing, I think the bottle is ridiculous and fun and very 90s. The zebra mohawk is zany. The cap is kind of tough to get off. But the ergonomics?! They are great. The bottle shape and the textured frosted stripes on the back of the bottle are a textural smorgasbord, and sum up the contents well:

The woody side has a soft velvet texture and a wood sap type of sweetness. It has my Goldilocks level of presence- consistently noticeable and enjoyable for the wearer over long hours without screaming or assaulting everyone in the room with harsh or brash aromachems. It's soothing and soft on the senses the whole way down, with the far dry down being such a lovely sandalwood. There is also something that makes me sense the creaminess of a freshly opened gardenia blossom without actually smelling like gardenia- I don't know what's accounting for that sensation but I love that aspect.",08/18/24 16:05,Airborne Armadillo

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Kenzo Jungle Homme is among Olivier Cresp's finest creations. An apotheosis of woods and spice, it shows how spices, especially a radiant cardamom and bittersweet nutmeg complement woods, giving them lift and diffusivity. Opening with a lime and bergamot, these spices are the spine right through to the bass line.

Fresh and tangy transform into a peppery warmth, with what I detect is a sizable amount of guaiac wood, which has a unique, slightly smoky, oleaginous and balsamic feel. It fuses woody notes together in perfume; a fascinating material, it serves as glue to the otherwise elusive facets of sandalwood and cedar. It's like the oil that keeps the warmth in the lamp going.

There is an underlying fresh perspiration feel here, not unlike that of Declaration (no Iso E Super here, however). This imparts a subtle human carnality. The overall effect is balmy and exotic, much like its sibling Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant; however, Homme is modulated to a more simmering volume and is reignited through the heat of one's own body through wear (I love this phenomenon).",02/01/24 07:30,alphairone

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"MATERIALS:
Kenzo Jungle Pour Homme, Eau de Toilette
Batch Code: V818806
Box: Maroon with a dark maroon raised zebra pattern that only appears on the upper half of the front of the box. The neon green square on the front feels slightly raised and has maroon print letters on it that read “Kenzo Jungle Pour Homme”. The inside is lined with a removable neon green carton insert. Mine also came with a folded mail-in survey about the fragrance.

Bottle: 1.7oz./5ml. Clear, rectangular, glass spray bottle with matte silver sprayer and cap. The cap is topped with black and white plastic bristles that alternate to imitate a zebra pattern. The face of the bottle says “Kenzo” in dark maroon cursive letters appearing right-of-center at the base. The back of the bottle has a zebra pattern etched on it that mimics the design on the box and the batch code, also etched, appears centered at the base in small print.

PROCEDURE:
Tested on a cool spring day. Low activity level, mostly sitting (working from home):

OBSERVATIONS:
To my (41M) untrained nose…

First spray to 30 minutes: Upon first spray the citrus smell is dominant – a very sharp and tarty lime. This remains so for about 20 to 30 minutes before the woody notes creep in.

Minutes 30 – 40: The woody notes intermingle with the citrus for about ten minutes until the citrus becomes less prominent.

Minutes 40 – 60: The citrus has taken a back seat but has not entirely disappeared. The woody notes are now prominent and seem sweet but not cloying.

Minutes 60 – 70: For a very brief 5 to 10 minutes, the scent becomes sweet almost resembling the smell of bubblegum. Then the spices come in to play.

Minutes 70 – 90: The spices emerge to combine with the sweet, woody notes and the citrus. For a brief couple of minutes, this combination of notes smells like a showered man who is drenched in his fresh sweat has just jogged right past you – don’t let this alarm you, it’s pleasant and it passes quickly, unfortunately. The rest of the scent ride is dominated by soft spice notes that fade into a skin scent.

CONCLUSION:
This is a UNISEX scent all the way, despite the “pour homme.” The ride is short but adventuresome and worth it. On a cool spring day and low activity level, the scent felt private and very quiet. Although further testing is required under different weather conditions and activity levels, its performance indicates it may be appropriate for year-round use for formal, informal, and professional settings.",05/02/23 12:48,OneThinksOneNose

Love it, love it, love it!",09/16/22 14:58,Bllynch1
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,This is a divine scent! This scent is beautiful! I get a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg initially with a nice vanilla and benzoin under side. When you smell this you'll be glad you got it! This is an easy blind buy if you think that it's a type of fragrance you'll like. It's spicy and vanillic mostly with some fresh citrus. Also the tea note is noticeable which gives this a sort of jungle vibe. This is extremely unique and good for the collection! This is a fantastic scent!,08/08/22 20:02,Criglett Clussnum

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I thought I would love this based on the notes and the fact I love nutmeg. The one note I was worried about was the benzoin. Just got it today and the benzoin was so sickly sweet I could feel it in my throat. Most of the online reviews played down the sweetness and said it was hardly noticeable and they were Def nicely wrong. Almost made me feel sick. I hate sweet men's fragrances as they smell childish. So from now on anything with vanilla, benzoin or tonka are a no for me.",06/22/22 18:35,Jassar
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"1 of the best fragrances I ever owned ""as a scent profile"" .. little sour, tangy, peppery, very unique & different💗 ..nothing beats spicy peppery citrusy fragrances.. think of Terre dHermes EDT and ADG by Armani and this one.

Average performance... the whole experience lasts for 5 hours ..still can be the perfect light cologne after showering/bedtime maybe.

KJ by Kenzo, ADG by Armani, and the dreamer by Versace were my favorite fresh fragrances when I was 15....memories 💙... I recommend buying / blind buying it...YES, I forgive the average performance... 100% worth the try!",05/25/22 23:31,BASMAJ
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"This is a really interesting fragrance. On me, it's like they blended all these components and notes to come up with a really musky scent.
This is really warm without being cloying, and spicy without being abrasive or harsh. It is unique in that for a spicy scent it does not rely on pepper.
Jungle is comforting. It's a wonderful blend of wood and spice and gives me the impression of a richer Lalique Encre Noire original with the vetiver dialed back and amber turned up.
Mr. Cresp, most appreciated. Thank you for this beautiful blend that melds with my own scent so smoothly and keeps me relaxed throughout the day. Bravo",05/14/22 07:26,fanzypants

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I bought this 2 1/2 years ago. I love the scent. Oily sandalwood with citrus floating over a cinnamon and nutmeg base; nothing bad at all. In fact, it smells great. My original signature scent senior year of high school and college was Obsession After Shave (early 90s). It smelled great, but nothing like today's Obsession. I am always looking for a replacement for that hole in my wardrobe.

Kenzo Jungle would fill that void nicely, but the performance is so lousy. 15 sprays goes nowhere. Whether on skin, clothing, lotion, or hair, doesn't matter. Jungle does not last. I found a seller on ebay selling a sealed bottle date 2011. I paid extra for the older formula and it has terrible performance too.

So, Kenzo Jungle smells sublime. Take the bottle with you. Spray it intermittently all day and you will smell fantastic. This could be a 12 month scent. It is pretty versatile. Just very weak with no longevity.
Scent is a 10/10. Longevity is 1/10. So if you blind buy, be aware of the lack of lasting power of this scent.
The only scent I have that is worse is Pat Zileri Sartoriale. Another beautiful scent that goes poof and is gone.",01/08/22 10:02,Shugenja

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Nice smelling fragrance. Sweet spices and a slightly, whispered, roughness in the mid that, keeping with the jungle theme, smells sort of like the canvas of the tent you would pitch. Didnt notice it on card, but on skin it manifests. Sort of a canvas or leather. Maybe it's the wide brimmed hat you're wearing on your trek through the jungle. It's not cumin, as some have suggested. It's got to be an accord formed by other notes. I would guess that the mate note plays a big role in that facet. I am very sensitive to the body odor, sweaty smell of cumin and can detect it a mile away. This stops way short of the unpleasantness of cumin. I like it. It's like the difference between the sweatiness of canvas compared to human body odor.
The bottle is nice too.
But the performance is almost zero. None. Many sprays. Over 15 including clothes. Always a faint skin scent.",10/11/21 13:57,JmThms

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Man, I love this one..for the smell. The top is free will citrus and tall grass and I guess cinnamon..not heavy on the cinnamon but more on the vetiver. The mid is my favorite part where the cumin comes in and gives it that animal funk but it is not stinky funk. Cumin I do not see listed in the ingredients but I say it is there. It has to be. On dry down the cumin lays back a bit and the woods benzoin and vetiver take over and at that point you have another few hours before its a skin scent and shortly gone from there. But what a ride! I really LOVE the way this frag smells and the journey it takes you on. To me, it is worth having in my collection. Unforgettable and unique. The cap...that is kinda cool and original lol. I suppose you can give it a spray and it is its own test strip? Great bottle.

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Jungle Homme opens with a blast of spice. It smells a little sweaty like cumin to me, so I'm surprised that it is not listed in the top notes. After a few minutes though, it fades...but stays spicy. I definitely get the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom along with some really bright citrus. That spicy citrus floats over a soft, creamy bed of sandalwood and benzoin. That is the best part of this scent, in my opinion.

This was launched in the late nineties and it smells like it. Back then, I think designer fragrances took more risks, in an effort to stand out. I miss that. Years later, Jungle Homme is still amazing...dry, musky, beautiful. So distinctive and memorable, I love this stuff.",08/23/21 20:51,dogmeat
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"J'adore.
Sublime woodsy elegance - yet uplifting, bright, meditative and utterly intoxicating.
Reminds me of an antique Chinese cabinet my Mum has, made from different fragrant woods and even though it's well over a century old, if you leave clothes in the compartments for a few months they emerge imbued with a faint woody fragrance that reminds me of this.

Jungle Homme is very Palo Santo. Palo Santo (""holy wood"") gets its name because it was used as ceremonial incense by the Inca and has a relaxed, meditative quality.
The guaiac wood (Palo Santo aka Lignum Vitae is the raw material) is very prominent in Jungle Homme - the star of the show - and lends a distinctive, uplifting presence that for some reason makes me think of velvet. Guaiac has a subtle, slightly camphoraceous aspect that lends a kind of brightness and freshness, yet still anchors the composition.
If I recall rightly, this was the first guaiac fragrance I ever experienced and I was captivated back then and remain so today.
Incidentally, there is a very similar guaiac thing going on in CDG Wonderwood.

Jungle Homme doesn't really evolve much on my skin, it transitions from the opening into a subtly spiced woodsy symphony (starring guaiac wood), tailored and enhanced by the other components, of which facets of cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg are perhaps most noticeable to my amateur nose, and it is this composite blend that persists through to the dry down.

The bottle I have at present is from 2010, the original version in the purple box with the light green square.
Don't know what the current version is like, but will doubtless find out soon.
Performance is okay, but not stellar, and in Winter KJH lasts around six hours on my currently very dry (but usually oily) skin - really wish longevity were greater.
In the past Jungle Homme did perform much better when my skin was more oily (I hate that term but it's how they categorise my skin type) so I usually extend the lifespan by applying it over an improvised fond de parfum - fractionated coconut oil, almond oil, or white ambergris, which more than doubles its longevity.

As I adore woody fragrances and am partial to Palo Santo as a home fragrance (heating wood chips Japanese style in an electric burner releases the oil without combustion) find this a comforting, relaxing, elegant fragrance that most people seem to really like. Every time I wear this,

Jungle Homme really is an exquisitely beautiful blend of woods and spices - elegant and stylish. This smells niche, quality, classy. Due to the very prominent guaiacol I tend to think of it as CDG Wonderwood's older, wiser, more worldly brother.",08/20/21 09:43,rowan.walters

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Like everyone here, I blind bought this one. Bought the older formula that comes in the older purple box. Right off the bat, when I sprayed it I was hit with a sense of familiarity that this is something I smelled at the turn of the past millennium. Either someone I knew used to own it or the DNA is similar to the fragrances released at that time. It’s quite pleasant but I’m not crazy about it. Was expecting something warmer/darker with prominent musks but this actually has a lot of brightness from the citruses and vetiver. Don’t regret buying it though, as this is nostalgia in a bottle for me and it wasn’t expensive anyway.",06/29/21 03:14,ahmednaseri
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Kenzo Jungle Homme is a cinnamon forward scent full of warm dry spices, touches of light citrus, grassy hay like maté, and some powdered woods. In the dry down it's a big cup of lemon chai tea served sitting on a bed of creamy woods with the vanilla like aroma of benzoin smoldering nearby. One of the most unique spice based fragrances I've experienced. I'm really digging Jungle, perfect for the colder half of the year and could fit in Spring as well. Personally I just wear it whenever but I know a lot of people like to apply seasonal only wears to fragrances. The bottle has a great shape and a random Zebra motif to go along with the Jungle name, even though Zebras live on the grasslands and savannas of Africa and not in jungles. Maybe a Silverback or Leopard would've been a more fitting choice?",06/24/21 18:12,CreepyKid

However, saying that makes it sound like a stinky beast, whereas I actually find it quite mild and even potentially unisex. Not what I would have thought of if you said ""spicy"", definitely not dry. I'm not getting any creaminess at all. I was hoping it would be similar to the women's Jungle Elephant but without the vanilla dry down. It is not.

A spicy, but still subtle oriental featuring nutmeg, cedar, creamy guaiac wood and sandalwood with added benzoine. Rich, sweet and slightly floral.

Opening with lime - a bold and somewhat surprising move for an oriental - on a note of mate, settling on nutmeg and some sweet, powdery woods. Overall, it's rather linear. Longevity and projection are average, but very fitting for this type of scent.

Although I find it quite different from the last I've tried from the Kenzo line (where most are either aquatic or have an asian ""bamboo-feel"" to it that are mostly suited for warmer weather), this is a surprisingly nice fragrance that shines in colder temperatures.",01/29/19 03:06,smellavision

It opens sharp with a ginger/spice/orange top. It goes into the heart and base notes quickly which to me are spicy/warm woods and musk with a little citrus that stays around for a few hours. Silage is around average.

Relaxed, lime opening which is gently spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom, melting into a soft sandalwood musk. It smells exotic and is quietly projecting and lasting well too. Truly stunning. Kinda reminds me of lots of things but is unique at the same time. Maybe Gucci Envy a fragrance from a similar time period, maybe a touch of Lalique Homme and Equis? Something about this is just so 90's. I effectively blind bought as I genuinely couldn't remember what Jungle Homme smelled like and I'm over the moon with it.

My first headturner. I remember it exactly. It was midday and i entered into a perfume store here in Montevideo. The air was hot and humid, like in a jungle. I asked the lady who worked there to offer me something special: she had me trying this. I loved it. I reeked like an alpha lion and i loved it. Once i came into my house, my girlfriend at the time stopped eating as i entered the room just to scream how amazingly sexy I smelled. Roaring appeal.


Today's words: Oral fixation.",09/19/16 09:38,lyon
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"This one is special for me. Very original fragrance, and hard to deliver in words.. the author gave the only possible name to it - ""Jungle"".
It comforts me. It's like I'm petting some wild animal - and not feeling dangerous about that, right opposite - feeling ""related"".. There is also something soft like fur and sweet like vanilla about it.. - not candy-sweet though, rather 'sweet' like reference to person - ""he's sweet guy""; and there is no vanilla in ingredients - so I guess my senses pull 'vanilla' as as association of ""vanilla sex"".
I live in Florida - it's hot and humid here most of the year. Strangely, without being ""crisp"", this fragrance behaves really well for such weather. I've experimented with fresh and airy ""Aqua di..."" and Citrus-y types - they all work, of cause, - but that's what became common way to smell round here, so in a way I feel tired of it.. From another hand - applying other interesting ""fougere"" or ""gourmand"" types not always finishes well for me: I do sweat (excuse details) and get overwhelmed by heat at moments, and suddenly perfume may turn suffocating.. not this one.. This one harmonizes me with all this heat, I don't feel hunted down by blazing sun and steaming everglades - I feel almost becoming part of it.. this is fascinating.
First time I smelled 'Jungle' in early 2000s. I thought ""my gosh, how exotic..."" and I was not ready - I wanted to smell ""popular"" (this fragrance arguably never was and probably never will be ""popular"").. These days I don't want anymore to be popular, don't want to ""stand out and challenge"" either.. This is the fragrance that makes me feel free. I never get compliments or remarks on it, but I notice people's perception of me is affected when I wear it.. they like me and do not attack me.. LOL. I wear it on and off for 2 years now.
Anyways.. silage is 'careful'; projection is - 'crouching Tiger/hidden Dragon'; longevity is 'great' on my skin/hair - in 6-8 hours it keeps radiating gently, and next day in shower I suddenly revive it for one more whiff; fragrance itself - 'Unique and Harmonious'.
If you're looking to be a ""star of the evening"" - I don't think this will ""bit competitors"". It will stand free and non-intrusive, like wild exotic animal we see on a distance..
My overall rating 10/10.

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I don't know if this fume falls under the category of missing notes (not listed) or if the right combination of notes gives the effect of another note...To me, this opens with a very clear cumin and lime flurry that is grounded by the richness of a coconut and sandalwood heart/base. It's like indulging in a spiced coconut cream - there is just a hint of cinnamon, cardamom, and mate sprinkled on a creamy, woody (thanks to the clear cedar note) coconut mixed with a dense white muck and airy sandalwood. This is sublime and smells something like abstract art with notes you are familiar with done in a way that is quite difficult to decipher. I am repelled and attracted to it simultaneously - it is very dissonant but madly attractive...such a mad love! It stays fairly linear in it spiced coconut concoction for quite some time but dries off to a very pleasing white musk (and nutmeg?!?) that clings to skin for hours. It's definitely a unique spring/summer scent that can be pulled off in the colder months as well. I also think this is appropriate for all genders as nothing in here screams man.

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"From the reviews I was expecting something that would take some getting used to. That didn't happen. I liked this scent right from first spray. It started off really citrusy, the citrus gave way to some sweet spices before drying to a nice cozy wood. This might be an ignorance is bliss situation. Not being able to pick out individual notes may be saving me from smelling the B.O. or tropical fruit or wet wood notes that I've seen mentioned in other reviews. The bottle is pretty cool too, so add some points for that as well.",01/06/16 19:44,Sleepalm
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Kenzo Jungle is truly what one neophyte would call ¨exotic¨: Sweet and smokey at the same time (cinnamon,benzoin,sandalwood), round up by a heavy measure of tropical wood notes (cedar+guaiac), a tad animalic (pepper,spices): it´s impressive, evocative, lush, and quite sexy. It lives up to its name; not necesarely reminiscent of the jungle itself, but how it feels like to be in a wooden lodge in the evening, in good company while looking at the sun setting beyond the tropical forest, lulled by the sounds of animals; mysterious, exciting, sensual.
It´s interesting to see that such a fragrance was once marketed for the masses (which really shows how the 90´s were more bold tastewise than what we´ve got nowadays). I still remember the impressive TV commercial for the female version ""Elephant"" back in the day, another interesting and beautiful scent, just a bit sweeter and a tad less woodier.

For those interested in trying it: Jungle always reacted very well for me in any occasion but I would recommend waiting for the drydown to really make up your mind about it; give it time, and remember these kind of fragrances (spicy, aromatic) react differently on each one´s skin. If you pass the tests...welcome to the jungle!",01/01/16 09:38,aeriol.chapito

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,I reckon this is an under-rated gem. Its one of my favorites because of its uniqueness and spicy fresh feel. At the top I get juicy sweet lime/bergamot and nutmeg with a bit of cinnamon in the mix and as it dries its a warm spicy woody scent with citrus fading away.The name jungle is fitting for the smell I think. Long lasting and moderate projection. Doesn't smell dated at all! Not a date scent but perfect for casual wear in cooler weather!,06/27/15 03:03,multipleM7man
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I blind bought this because I read somewhere that it is similar to my dearly departed soul mate, Dolce and Gabanna By (the best fragrance to grace to grace this world). Well, with all due respect, that is nonsense IMHO. My wife says this smells like body odour. My mother says it smells like ****, and my sister says I smell like pine needles and wet soil. My 2.5 year old daughter says I smell like ""Father Kipmis"" (her way of saying Father Christmas or Santa Claus or St Nick). She obviously also smells the pine needles and pine trees. Back on point, this is a unique but very odd scent. I'm not a fan.",05/06/15 07:56,Murray2524
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I have worn this a few times now. It is interesting and unusual so it scores points from me for that. I am not very good at identifying discrete notes unless they are really obvious, but early on I get a slightly sweet, fruity aroma.

My gripe is that it is weak. I need at least 10 sprays on body and clothing to get something happening. Admittedly, the big variable between bottles is how much liquid the sprayer delivers per spray. But I can't help feeling that my 100ml bottle contains 50ml of actual fragrance and has been diluted, as tends to be the way of things these days.

Edited 2018-03-27
I realise now the sprayer on my bottle is delivering a very small quantity with each spray and this is my issue, not its strength.",01/30/15 01:20,hiram.j
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"A blind purchase based on the largely positive views on Fragrantica, but also a desire to try something different. Loving Kenzo Homme and finding a good online offer, I thought what could go wrong?

Before addressing the substance, a distinguishing feature is the course ""brush"" with an angled cut surmounting the lid - presumably meant to resemble a jungle creature's fur. Textured like a shaving brush and striped like a zebra or a hyena — which are savannah (not jungle) dwellers — this seeming inconsistency and confusion extends to the contents.

The opening is like a semi-ferment of coconut, lime and pineapple - the sort of over-ripe fruit scavenged by the likes of tapirs and warthogs. (I keep getting an image of Pumbaa). Bizarre. Challenging. The effect is like...body odour? Even a primate enclosure at a zoo. It is like someone going unwashed for days then applying a fruity/woody body mist to mask their B.O. This is the first occasion I've had cause to describe the top notes of any perfume as unpleasant.

Even so, a slow transformation over several minutes results in a woody ""something"". Just not sure exactly what. To be honest, it doesn't redeem itself a whole lot. It's just less unpleasant.

Wearing this on a long-haul flight would be particularly inconsiderate, not to say antisocial. Which begs a load of questions. Primarily, what conceivable occasion could wearing it be appropriate? Would it be worn in the hope of attracting a partner; or should that be mate? If so, which species? And by extension what sex? (I jest of course. At least up to a point I do.)

Quite honestly I'm lost with Jungle. Fair to say it is off-the-scale niche. I'm perplexed by the encounter and astounded by the positive voting on Fragrantica. My experience has earned Jungle the distinction for being amongst the least likeable mens aftershaves that I've tried, and at present I'm not minded to test it again.

Definitely a try before you buy. But, if you know someone called Jane who expresses a predilection for men in a loincloth, this could be for you. Otherwise be warned: you've no one to blame if you're bitten by a tsetse! Unless you purposely choose to smell like a macaque. Or is it a fruit bat? An anteater? Lemur...capybara…sloth...",12/21/14 03:04,Jerry Can
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Does somebody in this jungle have dysentery?

The opening to this is horrible. It really kind of stands out as a disaster among the many fragrances I've tried. A brief flash of lime and cedar turn into a sour, sweaty mash-up of B.O., rotten fruit, and fetid chaos. At first it was mildly revolting--an unpleasant smell of body odor which sometimes occurs when cumin, carraway, or in this case, ambrette seeds are used. I don't like that, but it's tolerable. You see it in Declaration, Rose 31, Carbon, etc. However, it's like the lime note suddenly decayed before my eyes a la time lapse photography and went from fresh, to sour, to overripe, and finally to something completely rotten and putrid. Blending with the ambrette seeds, this made for an awful stench.

Anyway, that all happens in about 5 minutes. The one thing that really impresses me about this, in spite of its questionable opening, is that the ambiance of the fragrance actually reflects a jungle's climate quite realistically. It's humid, almost sweltering, and exudes a damp, dank heat. So I have to give credit to Olivier Cresp for accomplishing this. It's kind of impressive. How many fragrances usually nail their environment dead-on like that? Not a lot.

As it settles in, the lime drifts pretty far to the background and Jungle becomes more of a wood and nutmeg fragrance. It's nice. The woods are soft, creamy, and warm, keeping in tune with the jungle theme. It's that cedar/sandalwood/vetiver blend which sort of smells like all of them and none of them at the same time--an accord that you can pick apart into each component if you wish, but is probably easier left as is--a pleasant ""woody"" base that does its job well. The nutmeg is spicy and a little sweaty. It's not overpowering. It compliments the woods well, and gives them a spicy character.

At last, everything rests in a soft cushion of benzoin, with its mellow vibration creating a relaxing, tranquil aura. Benzoin has that slightly sweet vanillic smell and it works harmoniously with the woods and nutmeg described earlier.

What a strange fragrance! I started off kind of hating it, and by now I kind of love it. In fact, I'm sort of looking forward to experiencing its awful opening again. Sometimes when you know such a bizarre opening is short-lived, and that what follows is pleasant and good and interesting, it doesn't bother you as much. Harsh openings sometimes even make for the best openings over time.

So would I wear this on a first date? Probably not. But once it settles in Jungle smells good and doesn't really have anything offensive about it. However, it remains interesting. I think you could wear this any time of year, in a casual situation or when you feel like wearing something for yourself. It's too strange to be a formal frag and it's too cool to wear to work. Longevity is excellent, and projection is moderate. If you've ever smelled Burberry London or Pal Zileri's Sartoriale, Jungle's dry down has characteristics of each.

So in the end, Jungle has won me over. I'm still skeptical about its first 5 minutes, but I'll be damned if this fragrance doesn't have character. Cresp nailed the jungle's atmosphere and the fragrance became more and more appealing with each new development.

Thumbs up and a Tarzan scream for this unique offering by Kenzo.",12/08/14 19:53,Buysblind

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Kenzo Jungle Homme is a very nice smell. I don't know how the real jungle smells, but there is something intriguing and very animalistic in this fragrance.
In general it's citrusy, a bit bitter, a litlle bit flowery - but more on the green side then blossom.
What makes it special and unique are these ""animalistic"" notes. Well, I wrote ""animalistic"" but what I really mean is this mixture of:
- wet wood - like you're in the forest in a very hot day before a heavy rain.
- horse (maybe a zebra;)) - :) I know how this sounds but it really isn't unpleasant
- swimming pool - again very odd descripiton but it realy does smell great.

I wouldn't describe Kenzo Jungle as a fresh smell. It has some freshness but it's more dense and warm.
I think it's suitable for every season. I wear it even in the summer and it suits the weather perfectly. You just smell like a humid jungle and it isn't unpleasen't. It's like you blend in with the heat of the summer.

Wearing Kenzo Jungle you smell fresh, woodsy and intriguingly animalistic.",05/02/14 14:03,garmonbozia

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Kenzo’s Jungle Homme is that kind of perfume that I am always ready to highly recommend.
At the middle of the last decade it was, for a while, my favorite scent – and I didn’t forget that.
Its quality and my nostalgia, combined, drove me to an undoubtedly simple truth: Jungle Homme it’s a very, very good male perfume.
It is truly aromatic and very persistent – surprisingly strong for a Japanese fragrance, but equal in nerve with his Elephant feminine version. Those who love Azzaro PH or TdH (among others) know it, I suppose.
The simple fact that Kenzo keeps that treasure alive gives me optimism: some good scents will never die, I hope.
In my humble opinion, KJH is a 9+/10 fragrance. In other words, it’s a must.",11/09/13 11:15,hadrian

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Kenzo Jungle Homme is just as spicy and bold as its female predecessors. Some member on the forum suggested it to me, and although I cannot remember their name, (my apologies), I am most grateful for their suggestion.

Kenzo Jungle Homme is unisex. The same could be said of Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant. Think of these fragrances as genderless. As you would expect, Kenzo Jungle Homme opens with an array of exotic spices, including cinnamon, pepper, cardamom and nutmeg. There's the slightest hint of citrus in the top notes, however it provides more sweetness than it does freshness.

Underrated this fragrance most certainly is. I'm surprised that Kenzo Jungle Homme is one of the less talked about Kenzo masculines. Perhaps some men consider it a risky choice, a fragrance that packs too much of a punch.

On my skin Kenzo Jungle Homme smells fantastic, perfect for a chilly, overcast day. The drydown is fairly woodsy, with gaiac wood, cedar and sandalwood. Now that I think about it, this fragrance could easily pass as niche. To be more precise, it smells like something M. Micallef would put her name to.

Kenzo Jungle Homme's longevity is excellent, and the sillage strong but not overwhelming. For both sexes, a spicy and unique masterpiece. I highly recommend.",09/19/13 22:24,missk
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I really wanted to like this one because I'm a fan of the combination of sweet, spciy and woody notes that are used here.

This fragrance started out woody on my arm, very woody and stayed that way for some time. I kept sniffing my forearm again and again as it really started to develop around the 3 hour mark, turning sweet and the woods started to disappear but ever so slowly. The appearance of the sweet base was wonderful, not too strong, not too harsh and thankfully not too sweet. A scent that can be worn by anyone above 20 in my opinion, but definitely good with a lively, mannered personality.",08/18/13 16:35,craniumbash

I say fragrance combination Kenzo Pour Homme and Dior Eau Sauvage, but a lot more subtle and I would more measured.How time goes on, unfortunately the perfume more and more traction to lime, specifically the for me personally gets some connotation to a citrus so-called heavy I really do not like, not at all! really spectacular opening, one of the best in the range of citrus fragrance similar to that variation, but nothing that is not worth it, and really is a great pity that after such a powerful start, losing all the perfume, heat and 'uniqueness and turns into a faceless mass of citrus, which after a while I even bother, shame that is so, because he had great potential and eventually turned into a clean sour lemonade.Summary- personally it's not a big deal, because it really does not repeat ciitrus like perfume, cologne generally has its own story, which eventually ends miserably.",01/17/13 14:25,DENIULTRAS

The wood is here is almost transparent, actually (but not in a synthetic way). You know it's there but it's barely noticeable. I agree with those who think this is unisex. The spice is obvious and strong. There is also a powdery quality and it's a little sweet, but just a little, and it's got just enough dynamism to keep it interesting. The citrus is blended in nicely so you don't get a literal smell of a particular fruit, which I generally dislike unless it is soft. Really well done and worth the reasonable prices it is selling for at the moment.",09/26/12 18:48,Bigsly
Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I just love the cinnamon-nutmeg chord in this fragrance. Also Benzoin does a good job in the balance. All those woods are in the base all the time and in the opening, the cardamom note is very comforting. Jungle is Warm and mysterious. It reminds me of that old red oil to polish the furniture, I don't say it resembles it, but remind me of. Hours later, close to the skin, it gets very soft and woody. Jungle gives a very nice experience.
//Update: This one is for fall and surely it will be great for winter and holidays. All those notes just make me feel good. I really like the zebra idea, but maybe Jungle is not the best name. It is a very nice surprise how this change with the weather. If someone first tried Jungle on summer, give it another try... from like to love.

Amo el acorde de canela-nuez moscada en esta fragancia. También el benjuí (creo que es la traducción) hace un buen trabajo en el balance. Todas esas maderas están en la base todo el tiempo y en la apertura, la nota de cardamomo es muy confortante. Jungle es misterioso y cálido. Me recuerda a ese viejo aceite rojo para pulir muebles, no digo que huela parecido, pero me lo recuerda. Algunas horas después, cerca de la piel, se vuelve muy suave y amaderado. Jungle te da una muy agradable experiencia.
Actualización: Esta es para otoño y seguro será genial en invierno y las fiestas. Todas esas notas me han hecho sentir bien. Me gusta mucho el concepto de la cebra, pero quizá Jungle no sea el mejor nombre. Muy agradable sorpresa cómo cambió con el clima.

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"I have received a mini of this cologne from a friend of mine and I decided to fill up a little spray recipient in order to make a test on my skin.

I’ve never been a huge fan of Kenzo’s colognes, except for Kenzo Air (which I have in my personal collection), L’Eau Par Kenzo Indigo and Woody (which I liked a lot when I tried it), but I have noticed that the male fragrances are starting to improve, leaving aside the DNA of Kenzo Homme.

Well, Kenzo Jungle is another one that I liked! It is sweet in the right way, the kind of smell I use to love.
When I first applied on my skin, I thought: “uhm…too similar to Black Walnut”. But this feeling ended within three minutes.

This one evolves very fast and makes the cardamom and the amber notes more prominent, well blended with the nutmeg. I think that the real difference is the amber in the heart notes, instead of the base notes as usual.
After that what remains on my skin is a “soft gourmand” smell, which is something typical in scents that bring benzoin in its notes. I didn’t feel the vetiver; only the benzoin and the sandalwood.

Kenzo Jungle remains all day long, but the projection is weak. The fragrance is very good and comfortable, especially in cold weather to complete the whole scene. I give 8.5 from 10!",11/01/11 11:30,Cassiano

We have painted, drank mojito and smoked all afternoon. He is so atractive with those unshaven cheeks...

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"J'ai vécu une bellle découverte et histoire avec ce parfum... Je l'ai découvert par hasard dans une petite aprfumerie au centre d'Alger il y a quelques semaines de cela et depuis il est devenu mon parfum préféré. Au début, les premières sensations, on ressent que c'est un parfum fort... Mais juste si on prend un peu de temps, on remarque qu'il est rempli de subtilité et de douceurs. C'est un parfum de caractère mais qui révèle un côté sensuel très développé. Sincèrement Kenzo Jungle pour homme représente l'homme à la fois classique réservé et contemporain. . Je le trouve vraiment intriguant et on peut le distinguer des autres. C'est un parfum qu'on reconnait parmi les autres tellement il a du caractère et qu'il possède sa propre signature. Je remercie Kenzo pour cette merveille, parce qu'avec ce parfum on se sent toujours plus jeunes et plus classique.

Yes, spray it on your pulse points, and then spend 2 hours in a traditional eastern spicery.
Maybe after that you feel walking through the jungle after rain.

Very impressive …

وای .. این کنزو جنگل گورخره منو کشته
یه عطر تند تند شدید چوبی عدویه ای تند و شلوغ پلوغ و عالی
اصلاً وقتی این عطر رو بزنین انگار دیگه هیچ کاری نمیتونین انجام بدین بجز اینکه بشینین و نمایش جنگل تماشا کنین
بعد از یک سال هنوز برای من عادی نشده و به هیچ وجه هم نمیتونم به فاصله کم و پشت سر هم ازش استفاده کنم

Kenzo Jungle Homme Kenzo,"Despite all the extremely good reviews, which took me to this, and are object of my consideration, it has to be one of the most disturbing, disgusting and awful openings I have ever smelled in my entire life, in such a way that I can not imagine anyone over applying it, unless he wants to scare away everybody, and attract the wrong birds. I mean, it may smell things of a jungle, but unfortunately someone could detect remainders left by animals too. My first reaction was in this way: YUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!

I think I know what ""vdxl"" wanted to say when he wrote ""it may smell 'dirty' and not in good way"" in the summer days, and about ""apply it correctly"".

Well, when the all thing is stabilized, it smells better. I read in another forum someone saying that the scent remembered him ""pine and cedar trees at Christmas time"", and at least twice I had this impression too. Not bad. During the drydown I get the nutmeg. Nothing bad too. I wish I could always get specially the nutmeg!

The orientation is the same: apply it correctly! But as the scent still looks temperamental to me (or I just didn't get the right point yet), for now I don't think is totally safe leave home wearing it.",05/31/09 09:09,periquito89

I also love how this fragrance portrays tokyo vibes of 2007 in the international lens, i believe this would be a great fragrance to wear for a fun memorable night, strolling the streets of elite tokyo (preferrably Ginza/Chiyoda) for a dinner in the posh contemporary restaurants & nightclubs of Tokyo",11/01/23 19:01,Niscensse

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"This has been one of my favorite fragrances for a few years now. I think it's a really mild but sophisticated scent. I wish it wasn't discontinued. What I smell most is the citrus plus the hint of spices. The ginger gives it a pepperiness that feels a little green at the same time. It's clean, unoffensive, subtle and yet also noticeable. This was a go to for wearing to work for me. Unlike a lot of other citrus heavy fragrances, I don't see this restricted to warm weather. It's quite versatile. Like other Kenzo fragrances, it's a bit avant-garde in the men's fragrance game and unique, which I appreciate.",09/18/21 08:24,freepockets
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"I think this is a wonderful fragrance for spring through fall seasons. Unique and not like everyone else wearing Invictus, Dior Sauvage or Bulgari. Dare I say, this reminds me of a much lighter Creed Aventus (minus the birch, vanilla and black currant). It's basically linear, as you get this uplifting, light citrus and woody scent throughout. The performance is average, so it's not overbearing and it's well suited for busy places (as preferred in Tokyo, where I live). Getting harder to find.",07/27/21 19:24,Eau De Treasure
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"This one brings back so many nostalgic memories. I bought my first bottle in the summer of 2007 after graduating from high school.

I had my bottle until my first year of college. The best part about wearing something different at the time (I live in Alabama) were the compliments. I stood out from a crowd of ADG and A&F Fierce. I wish this were a scent that hadn't been discontinued.",07/10/21 13:14,Scenseible
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"What a beautiful scent. I only received this early today but it is already one of my favourites, I’m not being rash either just because it’s new to me. It’s a soft spicy woody scent predominantly, it is rather dry but the composition is very smooth and well rounded. I don’t find any of the notes dominate the fragrance, the spices are calm and balanced, not loud and harsh. You do pick up fresh ginger root on the opening. Then the fragrance comes through like tea & spices, with the woody notes being the base of the scent. It’s actually pretty unique, without being ‘out there’ or unusual either. Just lovely and fairly simple. I think it shares something with Tea Tonique by Miller Harris, though I’m not saying they are the same. It certainly isn’t an everlasting nuclear fragrance... but it isn’t supposed to be, it’s not that kind of fragrance.",12/09/20 06:18,BlackPhillip
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Tokyo is composed of a dry, woodsy aroma—reflected by a thin chain of peppery sweetness. The style is certainly going for the traditional Japanese masculinity here. The elements are bold and slightly stingy—very dry and brooding. The fragrance is like a contemporary of Acqua di Parma Colonia Intensa if I could describe it in one shot.

In my initial impression, I wanted to say, ""It smells like—the coolest m*therf*cker in city of Tokyo!"". It is stylish and unique—and compels you with those qualities.

It is also very linear though—and something most would probably mistakenly describe as 'synthetic'—but is much better described as being 'a touch under-blended'.

Following the stereotype of Japanese humbleness—naturalist or minimalist—it is easily a perfect execution of that style. If you're a simple man, you will be certainly delighted by this.

However, Tokyo is a city of big money and fine tastes. So I hate to not think there is some far greater, more sophisticated, privateer formula beyond this veil.

I have to agree with those who said this is a strong 'paper fragrance'. Not sure if we can blame freshness or not (lots of natural ingredients), but performance is sub-par, and I can't seem to get all the notes together except on paper. It certainly is much brighter and sweeter at least.

Still, I do enjoy it for its masculine qualities, and it continues to grow on me more and more over time. Don't expect to get more than you have to give. Very true to Tokyo itself.",09/30/20 22:25,Grasshoppaaa

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"The scent is perfectly balanced between citrus, spicy, aromatic and woody notes. It's actually quite original and exciting in a bit of a synesthesia -kind of way: I truly get the neon colored theme that is on the bottle. Very, very good.

However, the performance and longevity are poor. I've sprayed 4-6 times and no-one else seems to notice anything special and I don't get anything at all after 2-3 hours.

This is actually a great scent for the days you can't decide what to wear. After a few hours you can spray on something else. And that's not taking anything away from the enjoyment of Kenzo Tokyo. Very good, but short-lived.",10/22/19 08:00,calculus
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"This is interesting. It was unexpectedly spicy and pungent in the beginning - in a good way! Like a blend of freshly sliced ginger and peppers. The green tea notes shine through soon after, and slowly develop into a fresh citrusy woody drydown.

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Tokyo by Kenzo is one of the most awesome 21st century fragrances! It offers 6 to 7-hour longevity and sports moderate to high projection and sillage. It's a delicious, masculine blend of citrus, wood, spices, and green tea.

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"This scent was great if not traditionally nontraditional; a spicy ""Dior Homme Sport and Gucci Pour Homme II,"" as one YouTube reviewer put it six years ago, could be bad!? On average the performance is ""professionally acceptable,"" by which I mean its longevity is average but its projection/sillage is close -- a beautifully decent all-purpose fresh and clean fragrance w/some spice (inoffensive i think in an office-environment) scent for the adult man. Note the decent grade it gets here on Fragrantica. I have the cheap but cool-looking 100 ml. bottle plus the body wash, hair gel, and spray as well as roll-on deodorants so as to (necessarily) fully immerse myself in this, literally and figuratively, making a day of it on the occasions when I wear it. It carries a very natural, engaged and engaging, mature but approachable, positive vibe.",07/17/17 23:11,Eau De Rous
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Citrus and ginger give it some freshness; pink pepper, spices and green tea thicken it up. Woods provide a nice base for all of this to sit on. Tokyo opens a little bright but quickly smooths out becoming creamier.

Sillage and projection are probably the softest in my collection. Even with an unprecedented (for me) five sprays I get a weak four hours of longevity. I'd say this one is ""masculine"" but would not smell strange on a woman. Work safe, inoffensive, not bold or sexy. Bottle and sprayer are both good Kenzo quality. The notes create a fresh, modern blend that is more youthful but I think any age can wear this year-round. Tokyo is interesteing; different from most modern colognes but not innovative or particularly exciting. Pretty inexpensive but even taking this into account I'm not sure it's worth it.",07/10/17 09:53,zesty_calco

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"This is a fragrance I always forget I have, but am pleasantly surprised when I rediscover it. That is not to call it nondescript - rather, I would say its implementation of a prominent combination of pink pepper and green tea (at least for me) makes for a rather interesting take on a spicy men's fragrance. For lack of better terms, this fragrance is very ""Seattle"" - it always seems to come alive for me when I'm in the city on a rainy day. It's soft, though, and that's really where I land on ""like"" as opposed to ""love."" It was a complete blind buy for me, and I would say that's safe to do. If you're intrigued by the notes like I was - I always tend to gravitate towards scents with pink pepper, and this is no exception - then give it a whirl. These days, it certainly won't cost you all that much to try.

Editing to say that, since writing this review, I have made an effort to wear it more. I have fallen in love with this interesting spicy fragrance all the more now! Still have problems with performance and sillage - have to spray quite a bit for it to be noticeable - but when I get it on my clothes, it's such a nice scent that lasts for days. Still love you after all of these years, Kenzo!",12/27/16 22:10,Jag02010
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,I love my spicy Tokyo by Kenzo; I wear it mostly during the daytime (to work) where it lasts a few hours before losing some of the original scent. The bottle is perfect for travel (no lids / sprayers to fall off) and non offensive enough to wear on a plane or to the theatre. Just the ticket; different to what the drones are wearing but still very warm and comforting.,09/08/16 21:40,rockindave
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"I left so many perfumes behind to be reviewed and probably I´ll never gonna do it. But I´m always coming back to some old fellows, and I´m in the mood for Kenzo these days. If I could put two favourites Kenzo scents in my top list they would be Kenzo Homme and Kenzo Tokyo. The only problem with Tokyo? It looses its spicies along the way and finishes creamy. Just that. I don't know if there is an updated edition of the book, but Tania Sanchez in the Perfumes The Guide co-written with Luca Turin I have says that spray Tokyo on clothes wouldn't be a good idea since it amplifies some aspects of the scent. Since what it amplifies is just what I enjoy the most (spicies) I couldn't desagree more, and in fact it remains less creamy on clothes, and I´m tempted to always spray a bit on clothes. I never tried Vintage and others Kenzo scents, but I know Power and it's a fine floral for men.

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"You prepare yourself for the big meeting...it will start in just a few minutes. You are surrounded by the hustle and bustle of meaningless motions, everything feels tight. Tight suits, tight ties, tight glances, tight smiles...you wish there was a way to depart, even for a moment. You inhale deeply and close your eyes...You awaken in the center of an immense cedar forest, lost from all of civilization. The heat of the rising sun gently warms the earth and grass around you - the lemon yellow rays creep steadily toward you. The wind sweeps through these gentle giants carrying their peppered ponderings and a clear rush of calming coolness. Everything else fades away - you are one with the earth and the wind, with nature and the sun. Your skin soaks in the infinite beauty of nature in solitude; you are renewed and invigorated. Your consciousness trickles back into reality - the meeting has begun yet you feel nothing but resolution. Your body still tingling from the kiss of cedar and lemon, pepper and cool wind, and the warmth of nature at peace. You are ready for war.

Day 86 - White noise
Listening to: The Gathering - My Electricity

Notes: This was one of my first fragrances, ever. It spurred my love of peppered woods and the soft touch of centering nutmeg. The description states this fume is of deep darkness - I experience the exact opposite! I am elated in the presence of this simple and beautiful fume. It is undoubtedly synthetic, but there is something serene in its presentation. It opens with an invigorating blend of pink pepper and lemons...one sniff puts a smile on my face and eases my nerves ever so slightly. I cannot really sense ginger in here (it usually tingles on the skin) but it could lend to the brightness of the opening. The core of this fume is a wonderful interpretation of cedar - powerful yet peaceful. There is the slightest hint of a warming nutmeg and the rush of a cool breeze from deep within the fume...it stays a slightly smoky and peppery cedar and warm nutmeg for 6 to 8 hours (I don't get how people say this disappears in a few hours...I finished my original bottle from 2008 and the replacement from 2013 is the same). It does quiet significantly around 5 or 6 hours, but it maintains the presence of spiced wood and musk until the 10 hour mark. Ultimately, this is a subtle yet powerful representation of the wonder of cedar and the strength of nature...a delight for all to experience!",06/28/16 15:57,MetalMan

The bottle sends a strong message of color, energy and movement. while the name Tokyo add even more dynamism and energy.
What was I expecting? Not sure, but I guess something to blow my mind, to think ""this is the fragrance that I was waiting to appear in my life!""
But to be sincere, I'm not blown away by Kenzo Tokyo. It's a nice fragrance, fresh, green and spicy. But it doesn't go beyond that. It feels like a cologne with more staying power.
It has the citrus opening, full of zing and happiness, the calm and wet green and in the end a quiet spiciness that is paired with the cedar.
Groundbreaking? Perhaps not.

Many woody fragrances have this ""grandpa"" vibe which I can't stand. This one is really really cool and pleasant. The scent has many leyers and it is really aromatic. You feel like you're having a SPA treatment wearing it.

The only thing which is not good about this fragrance is this citrusy note wich is somewhat too sour. It makes it almost the opposite of fresh. Like an old lemon peel lying somhere in the room. This note almost disappears after a while so it feels unnecessary.",05/02/14 14:24,garmonbozia

Like picture of old wooden japanese houses and brown paper.(But not melancholic and artistic as Mitsouko).

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"I don't dislike this fragrance for the overall smell, but for what it delivers. A 2-3 hr of presence, if you are lucky to get even that, is not my idea of spending on a perfume which does have a good opening. Spicy, citrus and exciting in the start it end up in its dry-down (if you can call it that) within a few minutes. If someone tells me i smell good after 4-5 hours of spraying, i might be intrigued and might come to a conclusion that its olfactory saturation that renders the perception of this fragrance to a complete non existing. It would still not change the fact that if i don't get a whiff of this once in a while, it just wont do it for me. My most disappointing fragrance purchase. I got it at, what i thought was a great bargain. I still feel mugged. Shame.

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"I ""blind"" bought this for hubby based on your comments, our positive experience with Kenzo scents and the ginger opening. Thanks for the tips. It is a new favorite of mine and great for fall.

This smells like a contrast of light and dark. At first a bright blast of citrus, ginger and zing tickles the nose. Then, the top notes zip away quickly, and a wonderful five-spice aromatic woods aroma plays for a few hours. Longevity is a bit modest yet the arm's-length sillage is nice for those who want to smell it. It won't overpower.

I like that it is not sweet but is zesty. Also I'm thinking that this will not smell good on some people. It does work in our case. After buying the original m7 about 10 years ago, this is the best scent for cooler weather I've smelled that we both like.",10/18/13 18:55,sonia.kassambara

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Gorgeous scent. I find it very very similar to Omnia Crystalline, which is one of my favourite fragrances. I rarely come across a masculine fragrance which I like this much. Pink pepper, which I love, is very noticeable, and so is ginger, which is also one of my favourite notes, and the mixture of notes is really well achieved and balanced. This is really my taste. Love it. I only wish it were a bit stronger. It seems that they are at last making more creative and nicer scents for men and getting rid of those horrible prejudices, commercial and of other natures. Stayng power is not great, though.",11/19/12 15:37,Migalex
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"There is no longevity or ""drydown"" to talk of in the first place. Hard to believe, but this scent simply vanishes in ten minutes.

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"I wanted to like this so much - the concept was cool, as was the bottle, and I am also a big fan of woodsy scents.

But what you get is something that smells like a wet, mossy forest after the rain - very pungent. Which isn't bad in itself, but in this case it resembles some cheap Axe (Lynx) you buy at the supermarket...and that's really not a good thing.

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Being a big fan of this House, I had great expectations of this. The ad was so ""flashy"" and energetic, the bottle was gorgeous and the notes sounded SO intriguing to me. I was overjoyed to see a sample spray in a recent package from a fellow member, and waited to try it (as I usually do for smaller samples) for my review. I sprayed it one time on my hand; it was good, but kind of fizzled. I did a full wearing yesterday, and here are my thoughts...

Oooh a woody spicy from Kenzo!! *gets all excited*

*sprays on both arms, both elbows, both sides of neck and down the shirt* I should really smell awesome now!

Enter a cloud of clean clear citruses and warm, wet ginger; with LOTS of sharp dry pepper. OKAY...this is kinda ""spicy/sporty"", but we shall just wait and see where this goes! Cue a cool breeze (almost metallic in nature) of bitter (and I mean BITTER) orange and green tea. The tea is fresh (almost iced) and does create an interesting contrast to the sour opening and warm pepper. I love the drydown of guaiac and cedar; but where are the nutmeg and cloves I so wanted layered over the woods?!? *sniffs wrists and elbows again, puts head INSIDE shirt and sniffs DEEPLY* What gives...where did it go?!? Okay, others said I smelled great, but I could not (and I mean with my nose pressed against my skin) really smell much of anything but skin, hints of metal...and cool leaves and a faint wisp of pepper. Color me: DISAPPOINTED! I adore L'Eau (and it's considered ""weak"") and the Indigo flanker especially, AIR and Power; and even kind of dig most of the women's AMOURs and FLOWERs too. THIS? I can't help but feel like someone held something great under my nose (for 15 minutes) and said ""You like that? Too bad...you can't have it! Nyah!! Nyah!!!""...I wanted the scents of fast paced life in the Ginza, cool green guaiac aromas of sap & leaves in the wind, shiso incense on the air, flashes of bright lights and ENERGY everywhere! *sighs* All I got was some sporty body spray with a fleeting longevity, and minimal sillage! Maybe, it is just my skin, but overall I can say everyone else liked it on me...and I may have liked it too, but something somewhere in my brain/olfactory system must have just ""blocked it out"". I hoped I would be like the guy in the ad: in jeans and plain white shirt, dancing with free abandon while those in power suits filed past me, and breathing in the night life of the largest city in the world. Instead, all I got was a feeling I had missed the last bullet train home.

Sillage: weak
Longevity: fleeting
Overall: 3/5

My first sniff of this was a single spray from a manufacturer's sample, the ""full wearing"" (for this review) was 7 sprays from that sample, now all but gone! Maybe...I need to find a tester SOMEWHERE and really do a REAL spritzfest of this and see if THAT makes any difference at all! This is the opposite effect or reading notes and going ""Yeah-been there, done that!"" and getting wowwed!! I wanted to try this for ages, perhaps I set my expectations too high...or maybe, just maybe, something in this does NOT agree with my chemistry at all.

I want to like this...
Everyone else likes it on me...
I just don't get it...

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"As a woman, I love wearing rich, woodsy and masculine scents, especially if they're infused with pepper or ginger. Most of the scents I wear that are of this calibre are very strong and at times, offensive. Kenzo Tokyo has a subtlety that doesn't bother me in the slightest. Its softness provides a clean and refreshing quality that I would have never expected.

The fragrance opens with light, watered-down citrus, pepper and tea. This blend is quite pleasant and refreshing. Its sensuality tends to immerge more on warmer skin or during the warmer months. With that thought in mind, Kenzo Tokyo has the versatility to be worn all year round.

I'd describe this fragrance as being sometimes sharp and sometimes smooth. The citruses, pepper and ginger keep the scent lively, yet the base of soothing woods and a hint of non-smokey incense keeps the scent grounded.

Sometimes I feel a little strange because Kenzo Tokyo does have some very masculine moments, but for the majority of the scent's development it keeps me entertained and I still feel like a woman wearing it.

I took a huge chance with Kenzo Tokyo, having decided to buy it blind based on reviews calling it a woodsy and gingery incense delight. Well, I am disappointed that there's not a whole lot of incense, but I am impressed with its subtle, gingery woods. I recommend.",05/06/11 23:06,missk
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"ON the first try, I got astringent green notes, woody alcohol, almost sharp pine needles and booze, and definitely wood notes. Second try, it was orange juice with vetiver first on . It's definitely the trip it's supposed to suggest: a Westerner's jet-lagged first impressions of Tokyo and all her chaotic, deafening life. Fascinating and unisex. It does end very woody and peppery, so if that's a note you don't care for, forget it. But as far as edgy and neon-spangled, this is the ticket.",04/16/11 12:12,tessture
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Tokyo goes Ginger, pink pepper, guaiac wood in that exact order and all other notes are complimentary. This is the only scent ive come across, in as long as I can remember, that has achieved the intended accords that are expressed on the tester bottles.
Starts with a sharp, almost repulsive Ginger accord that could well have done without the citrus harshness, then develops with a smoky, extreme-pepper accord (similar to that found in Marc Jacobs Bang) then finishes with the addition of guaiac wood.
One well worth trying, much more wearable that Bang, but the initial spray may be a bit much for some mainstreamists. I found the initial spray a bit weird.",04/12/11 01:03,Mushroomfat
Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"This is a very unique frag and It's one of my favourites. It begins very spicy until the tea note begins to dominate then the spicyness goes and it mellows into a zen like sort of state. It sticks to the skin within 1-2hrs so if you're trying to impress someone you'd prob have to invade their personal space.

Tokyo should be worn on rainy days. It complements the smell and I think the rain might actually help with the projection. If you're familiar with the frag, just imagine what it would smell like after the rain has fallen, the place is still damp and smell of the rain still lingers. My theory is that the warm moist atmosphere might actually prolong the life and quality of the smell.

with a little help from mother nature this smell will surpass amazing

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Yet another recent purchase and addition to my beginner's collection. The only reason I would stop short of ""loving"" this cologne is the relatively poor staying power and sillage.

Tokyo definitely stays close to the (my) skin, but it is an amazingly unique blend of clean spice that I just couldn't resist. Many have commented that this a young fragrance, but I think just about anyone could safely get away with this one.

Whereas Wonderwood transports a feeling of quietness and contemplation Tokyo is the face of a metropole : buzzing with people, shrieking with noise, bursting with flavour.
Tokyo starts off with a citrus flash, tinging with firy spices, then the ginger comes into effect.
You will be fully awake by then :-)
Later on the pepper shows and is just as relentless but warm and embracing.
After a few hours Tokyo presents warm woods.

Tokyo by Kenzo Kenzo,"Notes of lemon, ginger root, blood orange, shiso leaves, mate, clove, nutmeg, green tea, pink pepper, guaiac, cedar.






It has been created for the young crowd.
The aroma has been inspired by images and the cool vibe of a busy colourful night in the Japanese metropolis.
The result is kind of electric I must say, fruity and slightly peppery.

The ginger root is here the main key, the center of the attention, while the rest of the notes stays in the background, as the juice develops.

Tokyo starts gorgeous and zesty; There’s a explosion of citrus while the ginger reveals itself fiery and dewy accompanied with the sisho leaves.
This is my favourite part of the whole perfume.
The rest for me, loose credibility and interest.
After a little while the fragrance loses power and it gets close to skin scent, the projection turns minimal and ""Tokyo"" remains in your skin a delicate nice halo of ginger, herbal peppery and powdery tea with strokes of guaiac wood.

Not bad.
Tokyo is an interesting fragrance, but if it would keep the original fireworks from the top notes I would love it infinitely.

It’s a fact that Japanese community enjoy subtle perfumes.
I do like the perfume but, also, I do prefer shout out fragrances. It’s part of the mistery and the seduction.
The long lasting is acceptable.
I enjoy wearing the perfume but it is becoming one of those ones that I keep sniffing trying to recall the initial explode. Then nothing.

Anyhow... I was expecting a burst of energy. Something fresh and citrusy.

I got the citrusy... but no burst. If there was one it vanished real quickly. This is actually a very subtle fragrance. This one stays very close to the skin boys.

But there's still an appeal to this fragrance. It's complex. It's not very virile but it's still masculine. It's for the elegant man. Not for Mr. Lumberjack or Mr Business Kingpin. It's urbanite, young yet organic and dewy/foggy. I understand where the name comes from. Japan is a fitting image.

The highlight here is the Tea note. It makes it interesting. It quite dominant in the dry down.

It's subtle and longevity is only ok. I like it but I won't buy it. Longevity is not worth it. It might be fitting for me but it's not the type of fragrance I am looking for. Still... a very interesting fragrance.",09/13/09 01:07,LaPD

During its drydown the ginger becomes light, though this note follows the evolution until the end, which, by the way, is not that long. Could replace a lot of citric scents, by its difference ... a fresh ginger scent, or, like ""jeca"" said, ""spicy fresh"". But is a warm freshness, if you know what I mean.

In the case of men, it is a fragrance not suitable for all audiences, which could perfectly belong to a niche house because of how challenging and different this composition is, which is a nutmeg bomb from start to finish, accompanied by ginger and coriander that They provide a certain heat but not so warm as at the same time it is refreshing thanks to the vetiver base that gives it a freshness and classifies it as an intense oriental woody, very ethnic and with a certain dirty and earthy vibe. For those who did not have the opportunity to find it in their year of the launch, I recommend that they try it now as a fragrance worthy of admiration and to have in your collection, that is, very sober and mature, not suitable for those under 30 years old.",08/16/22 13:37,Abry_81

It's not a fresh scent, it's thick, but not heavy, a kid of pungent greenness to it that's still pretty nice. Definitely an autumn smell. Avoid this one in summer. I really don't know if I like this one.",03/15/11 23:25,Mushroomfat

Once Upon a Time pour Homme Kenzo,"A EDT cool, and manly. Entry notes very opaque and strong, too forest middle notes of wet wood, a little spicy with hints of ginger, green wooden base notes.

I think you may be best classified as a woody aromatic or acuatic woody, with average, leaving a trail peaceful, nice. It has no power to use romantic or serious presence to an office, maybe casual outings with friends, working better day. It has a light touch as a cream or powder makeup at the end.

Kenzo Homme Santal Marin Kenzo,"Fragrance Review:

First thoughts, this is an oud dominated scent mixed with Kenzo Homme DNA.

- Kenzo Santal Marin starts with a strong dose of oud and woody/earthy scent. It has very little sea notes or lavender in the opening, if not none at all.

- I sprayed a total of 5 times. Twice behind each ear, twice on the front of neck, and once in front of my chest. The longevity is okay, it lasts approximately 8 hours on my skin, projects for about an arms length for 2 hour before turning into a skin scent. It does however lasts a few days on my clothes.
(Depends on skin types)

Overall Rating (8,5/10)

I don't hate nor like this fragrance, it's not something I would wear as oud/woody fragrances isn't a combination I enjoy smelling. But if you're a fan of Oud/Woody notes, and you're a fan of Kenzo, then this might be the perfect combination for you.",07/11/24 17:29,Siprian85
Kenzo Homme Santal Marin Kenzo,"First impression after three royal sprays on the back of my hand at 32 degrees Celsius: Santal Marin is what I expected, a mix of Kenzo Intense EDT (blue bottle) and the EDP (black bottle), but more of the latter. I’m one hour in and I hardly smell it anymore. I have the same experience w the EDP which I’m not so fond of. I love the EDT Intense. I might try it again some other time, but for now a bit underwhelming :(",06/22/24 05:30,heymit
Kenzo Homme Santal Marin Kenzo,"An intriguing, modern aquatic-woody fragrance.
Kenzo Homme Santal Marin opens up with a gentle, salty marine accord.
Once the first fresh burst subsides, a creamy sandalwood note emerges, which grounds the fragrance quite nicely. Simultaneously guaiac wood creates a smoky, slightly bitter edge around the sandalwood note. Lavender is listed as a note, but can only be perceived as a distant whisper in my opinion.
The interplay of aquatic freshness and smoky, bitter milky-creamy woods is quite stunning, but might not appeal to everyone.
At first sniff it could come off smelling odd, which I personally appreciate.
Giving the fragrance time and multiple wears is kindly recommended. ;)
Once Kenzo Homme Santal Marin dries down it can easily be appreciated by everyone, all notes come together harmoniously and smell very pleasant with the distinct Kenzo Homme DNA humming in the background.
Do test it out! :)",06/08/24 06:01,tomkleins

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"i mainly get baby powder / baby wipes and very faint violets, but in the best way possible. this was my signature scent for quite a while, and i have very fond emotions towards it as i got it for christmas from my beloved. it is a very gentle and soft scent, perfect for bedtime or when you simply want to smell clean and powdery, elegant and slightly floral. i also adore the bottle, it reminds me of a glass skyscraper with a lovely bright poppy growing through it. i think this is a fragrance which i will repurchase once i finish it, although i do have other favorites now as well - it's just too tender and nostalgic for me. the only downside is that the longevity isn't too great, i can't really smell this anymore after 2 or so hours. that's very unfortunate, but i do think there's something sweet in its fleeting nature. it's a short lived treat, but a very comforting scent to me. i associate it with baby yellow. :)",10/25/25 14:35,celestialentries
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"I have the alcohol free version of this, but couldn’t find it here on fragrantica. I smelled the original years ago in duty free in Stockholm and thought it was absolutely beautiful. It’s a bit out of character for me because I typically don’t like a powdery scent and this is definitely that!! Yet there’s something about it that makes it really beautiful. It’s something I would only wear in the daytime perhaps for Sunday Mass, it’s clean, calm and innocent. The dry down is really unique. It’s a fragrance you’d recognize as soon as you smell it. It’s not my typical preference but I can definitely see the appeal.",10/15/25 14:33,Ismellgood2024
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Flower by Kenzo really surprised me. I was expecting another dull and lifeless white floral as so many designer houses love to expel into the world without a care, but I was wrong. This is actually quite gorgeous, and considering the price it can be bought at, fantastic value for money too.

It’s a very soft and delicate scent, a smell very intimate which is left to be discovered, not announced. The rose has a strong bearing, with a pronounced sharp and salty facet which is just mouthwatering, yet made dry and flattened by that soft powdery violet. Married by soapy white flowers and clean musks, the resulting harmony is lovely.

I’m actually considering whether to pick this up. I do really enjoy it and the price is fantastic, but do I love it enough to warrant adding to my 150 bottle collection? I’m not so sure. But what I can say is don’t look past this if you haven’t tried it!",10/12/25 13:30,RGH01

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"I got this bottle in 2025 from Spain, batch number 5A01.
It’s noticeably different from the original Flower I used to wear years ago. This reformulated version leans heavily on a synthetic powder note - it almost feels like wearing a fabric softener. There are faint floral undertones, but they get completely buried under the cosmetic-like powderiness. Longevity is strong, but the scent is linear. After a while, it becomes tiring to my nose - more of a monotonous powder cloud than the emotional fragrance I remember.",10/05/25 06:48,ladyvioleta

It gives the fragrance personality and makes it stand out. It leans a little vintage, in a good way, like powdery late-90s style. Comfortable and very much of its time.

The only drawback for me is the bottle. It looks striking, but it’s tall, bulky, and honestly a bit impractical.

But this summer, in the middle of the stifling heat, I couldn’t bring myself to wear yet another gourmand (which makes up most of my collection). So, I dug this forgotten bottle out of the back of my cabinet, fully expecting it to be ruined after a decade of maceration.
To my surprise—I LOVE it. The notes feel softer, more luminous, and unexpectedly refreshing in the heat. What I once dismissed as “powdery and strange” now feels comforting and elegant.

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Flower by Kenzo is truly a masterpiece of powderiness, resins and balsams, blended effortlessly with vanilla, violet, rose, jasmine and hawthorn. To my nose, the blackcurrants and the hawthorn are the most easily notes detectable in the opening of this scent.

It’s so satisfying to find a unique scent nowadays and I know that Flower by Kenzo was launched literally a quarter of century ago, but I haven’t tried it until today (potentially I am living under a rock) and I instantly feel in love with it. It’s something else than what’s currently trending on the fragrance market and I find that very refreshing.

Might be slightly controversial, but I don’t find the scent dated or smelling old fashioned. I find it super intriguing, alluring and captivating. This can be found incredibly cheap nowadays and I recommend to all ladies which haven’t tried it yet to give it a shot. I have hundreds of perfumes in my collection, but nothing similar to Flower by Kenzo…

No clue if it’s still popular with older generations but at least on social media isn’t. I didn’t heard anything about it. Deserves so much more love and attention at least online.

Will be adding a bottle of this gorgeousness to my collection as fall season approaches. It’s not the summeriest out of all fragrances, even though it’s called Flower. For me it’s something new, different that totally worth the money.

i got it as a bday present from my mom because i kept talking about it for half a year (it reminded me of the band lamp which i love sm) and ever since then i can't let go of it. it's v nice and powdery and just a lovely and comforting scent. my friend who gets migraines from almost every perfume told me this one is very nice and that says a lot. in summer this perfume is more flowery and fresh, like coming from a bath but in winter it's simply angelic and comforting. my mom bought one for herself too bc she got to love the smell to. such a darling perfume i love it so so much!!",07/16/25 04:02,decayofangel

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"My childhood scent. Growing up my mom lost the cap so I would just see a long bottle on top of our small closet. Smells exactly like her and early 2000s nostalgia.
Beautiful sophisticated clean floral, (which I don't typically reach over for) however everything is blended so nicely, with no note taking over the other with a powdery dry down. This will be my wedding scent. Reformulation hasn't changed much, the originals longevity was insane. I don't wear this scent often because it is so sacred to me.",06/29/25 11:32,gulaabs
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"I had a terrible day today. Lot of negative thoughts, tears, bad emotions. I feel hopeless and tired, so I’m just going to sleep now. Why am I sharing it here? Well, I just sprayed myself and my pillow with Kenzo Flower, because it feels like a warm, caring hug. It’s not the first time when I intuitively reach for this particular fragrance in such moment. It creates a safe barrier. Peaceful aura. Incredibly comforting scent. And I think it’s a true art if perfume can really work that way. In all that mess, it’s indeed a small thing, but let’s learn to appreciate them and be grateful. Thank you Alberto Morillas!",06/21/25 15:35,Punika

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"One of those fragrances that is starting to smell dated. It leans a bit hairspray for my tastes. It is a nice, smooth and powdery floral.

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"A very, VERY late review for what had been one of my most anticipated fragrances. My papa gifted me this perfume for Christmas of 2024 and I have loved it ever since I first sampled it in the perfume store we used to frequent on shopping trips. The packaging is absolutely darling and, unlike some, I am very fond of the powdery scent- especially considering another favorite fragrance of mine is Chanel No. 5. Is it for everyone? No, but I think its absolutely wonderful. The bottle is beautiful and I love how it looks next to my other fragrances. In terms of price, I can't really say considering this was purchased during the holidays at an outlet, but I am sure a decently priced bottle is out there awaiting for a loving home!",06/12/25 22:48,solongmarianne

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"I used to dislike this fragrance. I found it too “clean”, too delicate, too innocent.

But lately, clean and delicate fragrances have started to make an impression on me. And today, I find this one utterly charming.

It’s a powdery floral scent - almost creamy - deeply romantic. Though completely modern, it takes me back to the end of the 19th century. Innocence, romanticism, and elegance, all blended into a single fragrance. Flower is nostalgia for a time we never lived.

Funny how tastes can change. Now, I find it perfect for those moments when I just want to wrap myself in a cocoon of softness.",06/04/25 02:37,Saveria

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"It begins as a beautiful rose and violet, powdery and soft and delicate. Over time it moves to include subtle jasmine and becomes a more moist and dewy scent. This feeling of cool flowers seamlessly transitions to musk.

It's an incredibly smooth evolution over the course of the drydown. I think of this as angelic, soft fluffy heavenly scented clouds, and soft colors of diffused pink and purple. It is perfect for all seasons, day or night.

It is a true masterpiece! I rarely comment on bottles, but this is perfect, elegant, minimalist and suits the fragrance inside. It's not my usual type of perfume, but I LOVE THIS!",05/29/25 23:28,Amber Spice

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"One could say that the powdery fragrance profile of Flower by Kenzo has reached cult status because it is instantly recognizable. To me, none of the notes dominate and everything comes together as a harmonious powdery and musky fragrance. The musk is soft, without sharpness. Interestingly, once dried down, I get wafts that remind me of hard candies, along with a ever so slight hint of sweetness. This is a versatile and classic, but not old-fashioned, fragrance.",05/19/25 04:44,KöbiD

This gorgeoussss bottle consists of a linear concoction of roses and talcum powder,, it smells like a vintage luxury beauty product line.. My aunt owns this since forever and uses this mostly in our hot Indian summers and we've spent many summer vacation days together that it's scent is so familiar & nostalgic to me

Performance is not that intense, it's quite versatile so can be worn in all seasons if you enjoy powdery scents, lasts all day on outfits

People who like powdery soft rose scents would love it which is quite contrasting to the modern tastes,, it is reminiscent of vintage perfumes in the sense of like old Hollywood light glamouresque vibes 🎥",05/15/25 07:18,Advaita
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"If you go into a home goods there's always some sort of bizarre collection of toiletries, one of them often being a body powder. As it has been used for centuries, for relatively cheap you get a powder puff covering a well of floral (my favorite was rose and violet) scented talc. While many reviews claim Flower by Kenzo reeks of baby powder, which I've smelled on many scents and is honestly evocative of an infant or a very elderly person, this distinctly smells like body powder. Very Marie Antoinette; porcelain perfect, delicate, beautiful and desireable, but very very out of touch with the common (wo)man. This isn't a frag I'd recommend to, well, almost anyone I know, but it smells lovely on me and will do the same for anyone whose skin works well with powdery scents.
This was my ""grown up"" scent in high school for when I was attending events where the syrupy scent of Lady Gaga's Fame would be unwelcome, but now as an adult it feels more appropriate to use in casual settings, a pleasant but fairly intimate hint of femininity. Pairs well with Myhrr for something a little more sensual and unisex.",05/08/25 12:53,kuntofmontecristo
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Oh wow, I adore this. I was not expecting much due to it's reputation, but yes, this is absolutely one I will soon be buying a full bottle of.

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Kenzo Flower has always been in my collection. It’s my most comforting scent and the only one that has a true power of boosting my mood. Whenever I feel nervous or sad, one spray is enough to calm my senses. I feel secure when I wear it. It’s really great feeling :)

It’s a very original and magical fragrance, I think it’s really hard to find something that’s close to Flower. It’s powdery, but I disagree with baby wipes suggestions. For me, except for the comforting effect I’ve mentioned above, it’s more of a make up, old school powder puff smell. And since I’m into vintage vibe, I really love it.

Notes in Flower are blended in a masterful way, resulting in feminine, powdery floral composition.

Longevity is very good on me, hard to describe sillage bacause im so used to the smell, but I received compliments so I believe others can smell it as well.

It’s my secret weapon against my fears, sadness and bad mood.

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"If I could paint a picture of this fragrance it would go something like this:

You’re standing in a field of violets and roses, like something out of that vampire movie. It’s going to be a scorcher of a day but at this very moment it’s early in the morning and a little crisp.
You’ve come straight from a bath in a crystal clear pond and are wearing some sweet talcum powder that was gifted to you by a kind, little forest fairy. Your clothes are warm and snug, and are scented by the surrounding flowers.
You feel in your heart and soul that everything is at peace.

So, you’re heading home, but is it bed time or has the day just begun? The choice is yours because there’s no right or wrong answer.

This perfume could suit any age or gender, but I guarantee the person wearing this is more beautiful than they know.

May peace be with you all

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"This perfume was born from an inspiration to materialise the scent of an imaginary sweet-smelling flower, and this is how it behaves.
Thus, it seems created from a mix of rosey violets (!) and some almondy, powdery heliotropes. It is slightly dewy but ambery… sun-dappled, with a touch of shaded vegetation. Although the floral cloud that forms is mildly talc-like, it is possible to find a [slightly bitter] dust present in it, probably from the [unburnt] opoponax and incense, which would provide some weight to the subtle (slightly sweet and woody) floralcy.
This perfume is clean, in a tender way. It maintains a discreet balance and delicacy, until the softly musky finish.",04/08/25 07:47,PFortune

Yes, it is sweet-smelling.
My sister thought it was powdery, but agreed with me when I clarified it as incense-y.
Mall tester was much better than what I have, I can’t believe it.
In my opinion, only ladies that are MUCH older wear this fragrance and pull it off easily. I would only like smelling this on my grandmothers.

I'd seen it online, but had no idea about what it smelt like, but it was more than a pleasant surprise. It's the ultimate powdery floral. The florals are beautiful, especially the rose, and the resinous musky dry down makes it amazingly sexy and almost fresh. The vanilla keeps it sweet, but has an earthy quality that keeps the sweetness grounded, at least on my skin. Maybe not safe for blind buy if you're not taken by powdery fragrances. It is definitely very powdery the more I've come to wear it (especially during the opening). A little goes a long way too, it can become overbearing if you're sensitive to smell! Overall such a beautiful, comforting scent.

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"This flower is beautiful. She can put a smile on your face. Flower by Kenzo can be easily mistaken for Guerlain. Infact in the opening I am reminded of l'instant by Guerlain. But then it sweetens further and further. For a moment you can see a semblance of L'Heure bleue.
Oh how I used to wonder if that heavy fragrance from certain hair oils could be separately sold as perfumes. Today I guess my wish came true. In India perfumed hair oils have been in vogue since ages. And so has been the art of using Sambrani/Dhuno which is a resin and very balsamic to perfume and dry the hair using its fumes. That's what makes Flower by Kenzo so special.

It’s nostalgic and vintage but also clean, elegant, feminine and timeless. If you’re not a fan of powdery fragrances, this might not be for you, but it’s definitely got a unique charm. For a pro tip: try wearing it to bed. The cozy, comforting scent makes for a great nighttime companion.

I was able to ID it by the flower on the lid, the old version is bright red whereas the new one is muted in color. Anyways, it smells very feminine and lady-like. It's powdery but not in a talcum kind of way, but more oily and warmer. It smells floral, musky and creamy although, to me, violet is the most prominent note. It reminded me fo PMB baby violet cologne that I used to wear as a kid. I like to wear this to sleep.",08/08/24 14:02,luanneog

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"I know powdery perfumes aren’t popular in the fragrance community and I am one of the few who do enjoy them. I know they are viewed as old lady-ish, dated, or too baby powder-esque, however, I like them for the vintage, makeup smell they can evoke.
Kenzo Flower is a very powdery, almost, and I mean almost bordering baby powder, floral fragrance. I do get the violet and a mild tartness of the black current, but the rose and jasmine are very faint and overpowered. The vanilla and the musk are present, in the dry down, but the powdery note is the most dominate.
I prefer scents like this (Narciso Poudree, Putain Des Palaces) to wear straight out the shower and to bed. If you’re into powdery perfumes, try this, otherwise be cautious because this isn’t for everyone.",06/19/24 02:38,ClassicallyVintage

A few years ago, I had a miniature bottle and loved it so much that I would steal a whiff every now and then, but never committed to a full-sized bottle. Recently, I realized how much I missed it and finally gave in. While the bottle's shape isn't the most convenient, it earns a pass. The scent is pure luxury; a powdery violet with subtle notes of roses and incense wafting through the air. It carries a slightly gloomy undertone, reminiscent of the charged atmosphere before a rainstorm. It's both comforting and sophisticated, with a hint of baby powder but make it utterly enchanting.

90% of it is synthetic powder, reminiscent to Baby powder, Johnson & Johnson baby oil and Nivea cream). The rest 10% is left for your imagination.

I love lipsticky powdery fragrances, and this has a complety different vibe. It’s clean, soft and pampering. The perfect scent for a natural no-makeup look. It’s floral, but the flowers are not distinct. It’s so well blended that no note stands out as the star of the show. They’re mixed and create a rejuvenating type of fragrance.

And Kenzo Flower remains one of my dearest favourites - ever since it came out. Timeless, ageless and effortlessly feminine. Even though now comes soon the time when I don’t use it so much - summer!

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Oh what a lovely, feminine fragrance! It reminds me of the 90s and 2000s where people would go out of their way to purposely smell like baby powder. This perfume quite literally smells like baby powder. Unless you're into powdery perfumes, this fragrance may completely turn you off. It is strong. People will be able to smell it on you if you walk by or are in close proximity. It may be a nice smell for those that like the scent of baby powder or baby cologne, so beware that this smell will be noticed by those around you! After a while, it turns more into a floral, lipstick powdery kind of smell. The smell transforms from baby powder ---> powdery floral lipstick. I spray it when I know that nobody is going to be around my persona, so I can solely be the one to enjoy this cute, powdery fragrance. It smells comforting, clean, and powdery.

VS first love is the fresh clean floral scent that you would expect from Marc Jacob’s Daisy.

Chanel chance eau tendre is more sophisticated, but soft.

Flower by Kenzo is deeper and I think it’s because of the rose and the little bit of pink pepper. Now on the website, it say in the little paragraph the Vanilla, musk, Rose and pink pepper are the notes. Idk where the perfumers are getting all those other notes from.",03/20/24 18:42,Love.dk

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Fabulous.
I'm going off memory for this one as its been at least 17 years since l had a bottle.
It's very Johnsons baby oil smelling, it has that kind of oily thick baby powder floral smell that is divine, its got the vanilla and powder and sweetness to just the right level. It's a light creamy, not heavy thick vanilla creamy, its feminine and very pretty and simplistic in its notes. Its not overloaded with notes l adore the subtle parma violet notes in it as l love the parma violet flavoured powdered sweets. This perfume is superb if you love the smell of Johnson's baby oil this will appeal to you. I recently bought my friend a bottle for her birthday and remember feeling ever so tempted to keep it and get her something else. My aunt always said when you will know when youve got someone a great gift because you really want to keep it for yourself. It's a lovely perfume it lasts a good amount of time on the skin and is of average designer perfume pricing. I give this perfume a 7.5 out of 10.",03/10/24 09:28,Suzanne loves Perfume

Only recently I have started using it more and I've grown to love it, especially since it reminds me of my childhood.
It's a very lightweight, timeless perfume and I think it can easily become a signature scent, if you enjoy powdery, floral notes. I can especially feel the musk and rose, sometimes the vanilla aswell, but I don't really pay attention to notes as I just enjoy the overall vibe it gives off.
I would recommend wearing this in the winter and spring, and mostly during the day. :D",03/03/24 03:08,farben

I'm not a fan of fruity perfumes or white florals, I adore roses and musks on the other hand, so it's probably no surprise it's love at first sight. Still, liking the notes when you read them is no guarantee you will like the perfume. This one is perfect for me both on theory and in practice. It's linear and I get vanilla way more than musk for now, but I love it the way it is, even though I prefer musk to vanilla every day. I love the creative concept, the bottle, everything. It's long-lasting too, which is not a must for me, but it's definitely a plus. I am pretty sure I will be adding this to my modest collection. (✿◠‿◠)",02/28/24 10:43,jalfrezi

While I see many people say this scent is “old” I personally think on me it becomes quite youthful. It’s addictive and I’m having the urge to buy those mini travel perfume bottles to keep this around at all times. It’s a sweet floral scent, but because of the powdery aspect and the more shy, intimate projection, it’s not enough to overwhelm people during the summer, just must be used with caution.

It's not a new perfume, but it doesn't feel dated. This is all that Mojave Ghost by Byredo tries and fails to be. It's floral, woody, powdery, nurturing, and not quite like baby wipes - though I get the violet+powder association.

People around me find it lovely, not annoying, acceptable, bright, open and i even got an ""optimistic"".

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Vintage Sweet'n'Dirty Musk (but not too dirty) with Rose, Violet & Vanilla...

This is a powdery sweet musk, but not a white musk or a clean musk. There's a contrast where it's more powdery sweet than sun-bronzed skin, but it has some animalic salty skin facets, and smells to me like good grooming sweetened by the days events, or good grooming at the end of the night. Alongside all the notes there's a vintage sweet'n'dirty musk vibe, and although this isn't a dupe I catch reminders of scents like Ombre Rose L'Original Jean Charles Brosseau 1981 and Ange ou Démon Givenchy 2006, which both have that same contrast.

Opens with sweet, baby-powdery rose & hawthorn with violet swelling through. Hawthorn here has its strong honeyed floral tones with dirty animalic nuances which to my nose lean more rooty-green than dirty at first. As it transitions to the heart, the violet & rose tones expand the velvety plushness and opoponax lends a faintly seasoned amber glow, while Jasmine is there with it's salty skin & baby wipes facets. The musky vanilla base keeps the effect going for well beyond average performance, and incense sustains the seasoned facet of opoponax.

Performance is a well beyond average for year round wear. I just have a sample of this, but fans of powdery. sweet'n'dirty musk scents might like this. For what it is, it's well done. Enjoy!",02/17/24 12:22,suzanne_ronald
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"A full on nostalgic experience.
My mom used to wear Flower by Kenzo and many of its flankers, and I recently got a small bottle of it.

To me this is a very delicate and elegant powdery floral with a hint of sweetness. It’s smells really clean !

To me the Florals aren’t overpowering the rest of the scent, but complimenting AND complimented by the other notes. You get a clean and smooth base, with this White Musk and sweet and subtle vanilla. And those aspects are highlighted by the intensity and depth of the Incense and Opoponax.

The fruits are more discreet, I don’t detect any of the Mandarin, and the Black Current slightly shows up on the opening.

It’s an easy perfume for spring and summer, really effortless yet elegant, sophisticated and delicate. Lasts for a long time, pretty good in terms of sillage and longevity.

Not what I usually gravitate towards but it is a great perfume.

Just for the fact of this scent being a huge part of my childhood in the early 2000’s, and smelling so iconic, I give this a 8/10 🌹",01/27/24 07:09,Jade-Ange D
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"I'm not ashamed to admit my love for classic powdery florals with notes of iris or violet - but this is not your average powdery perfume. It doesn't smell like baby powder to me like a lot of other reviewers have mentioned, but I can see why it isn't a universal crowd-pleaser. The opening is very aquatic and fresh, and it dries down into what I can only compare to a vintage rose-scented blush compact or maybe a silk flower that has been scented with an old fashioned potpourri. I love to wear it alone with more elegant outfits and on a casual day, I spray it in my hair towards the nape of my neck and choose something spicier for my wrists to offset some of the heavy powder notes as it sits.

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Sometimes I feel that no words could describe how beautiful this fragrance is to me. Almost 10 years ago I received a small 30 ml bottle from my aunt, unfortunately back then it didn’t appeal to me, however I started wearing it as I realised that it was a good choice for the harsh winter.

And then the magic happened, the more I wore it, the more I liked it. It was clear and unusual exactly as advertised, a velvety freshness which came from black currant and mandarin orange accompanied then by thick powdery rose, hawthorn and violet notes. It is a strange and mystical fragrance, incense and opoponax giving it an almost oriental accord, not oriental as in Middle East, but oriental as in Far East.

The scent is very calm and almost reflective as Japanese people tend to be. In this fragrance the sensuality is not obvious or in your face as the Western world perceives it, instead is serene, mysterious and never asking for attention.

I read here that many people wear it during warmer months, but to me there is no better season to wear Flower than in winter as I tend to associate it with the purity of snow. In my opinion this fragrance is one of the classiest fragrances out there and a true masterpiece, they just don’t dare to make this kind of perfumes anymore.",01/09/24 03:10,dark-gardenia

So my conscious nose was like okay, baby powder and flowery poo pourri, but my unconscious nose was like - noooo, run, poison fumes!!! I do have that reaction sometimes to fragrances but this one was unexpected based on the profile. Maybe the violet is what was coming through? I'm not sure I have a fragrance that features that. So - I can't say the scent was objectively problematic. It's a nice enough scent. And I suspect some wear this beautifully.

2. THE BOTTLE! This bottle (and all the flankers) plus Guerlain's bee bottles are IMO the most beautiful work of art in the world of perfumery.
3. Strangely, is not BAD. It's weird. But I usually like weird so I will give her some time to grow on me or to get out of my life lol

EDIT: Hours later it didn't evolve to anything besides more incense. Even on clothes! No powdery flowers for me, I guess. Still, I don't dislike her. She's just, hmm, meh?
EDIT 2: Second day, don't know if it's the weather but now I can feel the powder and I'm officially starting to love Flower. Such a weird experience, never had a fragrance conquer my heart with time, I usually like or dislike them at the spot. Still confused how she went from incense to a floral powder from one day to another, but I guess that's what makes names like Morillas so great.",11/25/23 08:22,anidamasceno

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,I bought this years ago when it was first launched. It was bang on trend: a powdery floral with heavy duty sillage and longevity. Looks so delicate but boy is it powerful. I loved it for all these reasons but the reality is what originally drew me to it was the bottle. It looks like a beautiful poppy. Made me think of beautiful flowers in a field although in reality the scent was more urban as opposed to countryside. I loved it.,11/09/23 11:59,Perfect10Tara

Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"my favorite perfume of all time. I had a bottle in high school, the first perfume I ever purchased. Its so unique. Very strong, great silage, lasts around 6 hours for me. I get powder and wood notes out of this with a musky background. It's amazing.",11/01/23 11:45,babypong
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"I like the soft and powdery bulgarian rose and the honeyed hawthorn in the opening, but I'm not too keen on the ammoniac smell from the black currant and the astringent and citrusy quality from the mandarin orange. It's a bit harsh and cheap smelling to me.

I feel pretty much the same way about the heart notes too, loving the powdery parma violet, soft and lush rose and sweet and fragrant jasmine, but the opoponax is again too much and makes this fragrance too heavy for me, what with its warm spicy and balsamic quality and all.

The base notes of musk and vanilla are lovely and lend themselves well to this fragrance, but the incense ruins things for me somewhat and makes Flower by Kenzo too smoky a fragrance for me. I like my fragrances to smell a bit lighter and more floral and this is not it.

I'd recommend this perfume for the spring and thw fall and for during the day, but not during other times of the year. I'd say that it leans feminine as a fragrance, but the smokiness and the spiciness skews it towards being more unisex in parts and so it could be worn by a certain type of man. Maybe a more androgynous and/or feminine type of man.

This perfume ended up lasting 9 and a half hours on me and its sillage was I'd say about moderate on my skin.

All in all, I'd give Flower by Kenzo a 6/10. It's slightly above average but still average as a fragrance to me.",11/01/23 07:52,WhiteFlowerPrincess
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"This morning I dug out my sample and sprayed some on my wrist. Well, I tried to, but it wouldn’t spray out and dribbled down the tube onto my fingers and so I smeared it onto my wrist instead. That was mildly annoying. No sooner had I “sprayed” than the baby woke up, scuppering my plan to get up before 5am to have a few minutes to myself. That was also kind of annoying. Yet now I find myself with a warm baby nestled into me and this soft, cakey make-up powder (slightly rose, slightly violet, slightly vanilla/opoponax sweet) wafting around me with a touch of incense as well, and I can’t say that I’m annoyed at all.

Edit next day: I’m wearing Flower again because I like it, and suddenly I realize that this is Trussardi My Name but with more depth and oomph and lasting power. I’ve had My Name for years and often sniff at the bottle but never wear it anymore. Not sure what that means for Flower; I guess time will tell!",10/21/23 06:00,SalinasL
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"i only have a dupe (compared to the original in store and didn't sense much of a difference); to me this smells so much like banana candy in a really creamy way. it's so round and powdery, nothing tart or astringent about it whatsoever. i struggle to pick up any particular flower, it's just velvety like petals. the drydown leans more vanilla, still very powdery.
i've never smelled anything like this before! i more associate strong white and soapy florals with old lady perfumes, so i don't really think this smells dated.",10/15/23 07:00,didilinlun
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"According to the pyramid, there's a violet note in Flower. I've tested this scent several time and can't find the elusive violet. Nor can I find the rose, the hawthorne ... IMHO, F. is a generic flower scent, faintly sweet and more than a little artificial.
Performance is decent, sillage is modest. Kenzo scents don't seem to agree with me, and I have no idea why. Jungle Elephant was horrid and F. just isn't all that good.",10/10/23 06:55,Phantomias
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"It took everything in me not to blind buy Flower for the bottle alone, which is adorable and reminiscent of growing up in the early aughts, so I mustered up some self control and got a sample instead. While I don’t think this would be a safe blind buy for everyone, it definitely would have been for me as someone who appreciates powdery florals and musks.

First impression: A puffy cloud of violet baby powder. After a few minutes the green element of the violet puts the baby powder in a corner and reveals bright black currant and rose. The jasmine is quite green and not lusty or dirty. I will say, although it’s quite floral, I’m not getting an overpowering sweetness from those notes which I actually appreciate. It’s like I’m picking up more of the green flower stem than the bloom itself. On the dry down, a slightly sweet and silky vanilla incense comes forward as the powder fades into the background, an unexpected note for this scent profile but very very pleasant as it adds some nuance to an otherwise linear scent.

Longevity wise, it fades to a skin scent pretty quickly but i will have to wear for a few days to come to a conclusion about its performance.

I appreciate the youthfulness that this scent embodies. Many reviewers have said it’s mature but i disagree. I like the way that the notes surrounding such a prominent violet give way to a very delicate, airy and fresh powder rather than a dank soapy aldehydic powder associated with a more mature scent profile.

There is also a nice comforting and cozy quality to this scent. A perfect bedtime scent and neutral enough to wear to an office setting. Maybe there is a maternal association with the baby powder profile but it’s also just very soft and rounded out. It has a floaty cloud-like vibe. I think Flower could work in any season, but especially in spring and summer. It seems light, fresh, and green enough to stand up to heat. In fact, I’m curious as to how the notes will develop on warm skin.

Overall, I’m pleasantly surprised by how nuanced and dynamic Flower feels. A very pretty and fresh fragrance that I could see myself working into my collection for casual warm weather wear. Could be used for layering as well. If you like powder and purple florals, this could be signature worthy, I think it’s extremely wearable for any season and daytime occasion.",09/28/23 12:06,jhindsb
Flower by Kenzo Kenzo,"Very pleased with this blind buy--it's a tester of the Kenzo Flower EDP and sadly missing the adorable top that puts the iconic red blossom at the top of the green stem on the bottle--but it's 3.3 ounce, which will last me a long time, assuming this delicate little vase-bottle doesn't shatter. Yes, it smells like powder. Yes, it smells like roses and violets. Yes, it has a bit of an Alice Blue Gown, Gibson Girl parlor vibe to it--completely at odds with the modern, minimalist bottle--and I was expecting it to read more 21st century (or even late 20th century). But as it happens, this is the kind of fragrance I love (and not unlike another great recent bargain find, Jaipur Bracelet by Boucheron, although that is more of a dusky violet whereas this reads to me as more of a deep velvety pink, like the deepest pink in the inside of a conch shell, or a kitten's mouth. I also pick up some citrus sparkle from the blackcurrant and mandarin orange. The jasmine and musk are exquisite, but I can't really discern much incense. It's certainly not as incensey as, say, L'Heure Bleue. Anyway, this smells just like what I was hoping Miss Guerlain Rose nRoses would smell like, only with more longevity (by far). Obviously, if you don't like rose and violet accords and powder, you should probably avoid, but if you do love those Grande Dame cosmetic scents of yore, pick this up; you can usually find a bargain on the online discount sites.

I'm upgrading this longevity and expanding this to day and night. Because who doesn't want to smell like silky rosy sandalwood powder as she drifts off to sleep or rouses herself for another trying day? I do think I would need to scrub this scent off if I were feeling migrainous, but honestly I do that with most fragrances, simply because I would never want to create that association and ruin an otherwise great perfume.",09/25/23 20:32,rene.saller

Madly Kenzo! Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"(review from a man, teste on my girlfriend9

Very very simple, but amazing, soft, smooth and versatile sweet-fruity pear scent. The opening is really fine pear with a hint of litchi, the mid is a solid combination of heliotrope and jasmine, but the base isn’t good, the strong cedar doesn’t fit in the composition. Nevertheless this is a very pleasent scent, and yes, sometimes less is more.

- Sillage ang longevity is totally moderate, longevity is around 5 hours

Madly Kenzo! Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Now I completely understand the differing reviews. I had the same experince - Kenzo Madly EDT is a chameleon. I recieved a decant of this and when first smelling the nozzle I thought ""what a delicious pear scent"". That was around the end of spring. Unfortunately it didn't play out very well on my skin around that time. Overripe pear and really just weird. Tried it again around summer - nope. Now I grabbed the decant again because I need a purse spray for one of my bigger bottles and thought I'd just empty it (sorry). However - being the never-give-up type I sprayed it again and wow! There are no spices listed in the notes (technically) but this is now a wonderful scent of spiced fruits with a little jasmine, woody notes and musk. It could be the cedar working its magic. Absolutely wonderful and very different. I will gladly use up my decant in autumn. At least for my body chemistry this seems to be the perfect time!",10/07/15 04:55,nitschevo

Then it was another month I was using it from time to time when suddenly one day I sniffed my jumper which I had the day before (with Kenzo Madly) and I liked it again, very special smell.

Got it cheaply on a trip to London and felt ""meh"" about it- just one to wear on those days when I don´t really care I thought, since it is nice enough with the litche and jasmine. One night I put it on before bed and I woke up to the MOST amazing, clean, fresh, fruity and musky smell ever! LOVELY! I feel that one shouldn´t be fooled by the strongly fruity opening since that one smoothly carries over to the really nice jasmine and it all together falls into clean woody notes and this so clean and surprising musk. A few here don´t like the musk and yes, it is strong- i. however, love it! There is just something about this Madly i cannot put my finger on and I would really suggest people to give it more than one try in the store! I am really glad I did and I am planning on buying a large bottle since I am sure this is one of those scents that the company just discontinues or maybe they´ll add some flanker with the notes changed... Another thing that surprises me is that I do like the aquatic note in it- I thought I was completely over anything aquatic, but in this it just makes sense- the fragrance is also stronger than frags with an aquatic note usually is!

I'm not going to say this is a stinker, but I am not a big fan of musk to begin with, so I would say this is really just for musk enthusiasts.

Madly Kenzo! Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Madly Kenzo EDT is a tad better than its predecessor, Madly Kenzo, but I still wouldn't buy it. The musk note is quite overwhelming in both fragrances.

Madly Kenzo EDT opened with a lot of potential, featuring a fresh pear note and a juicy hint of litchi. It thankfully wasn't too fruity, just soft enough to allow the delicate, feminine heart of jasmine and heliotrope to shine through.

Unfortunately the synthetic musk that I had an issue with in the original made a somewhat abrupt entrance, smothering those beautiful fruits and powdery florals. Don't get me wrong, I adore musk, but in this fragrance the musk note smells like a disastrous mix of chemicals.

Kenzo is usually a brand that works for me, producing a countless number of scents that I have loved enough to add to my collection. This Madly series has unfortunately been a bit of a let-down.

A dear friend sent me a sample of Kenzo Madly EDT, and I thank her because I wouldn't have tried it otherwise. If you bitterly disliked the original like I did, you might find yourself enjoying Kenzo Madly EDT, as it is quite a different composition, and is not as heavy.

Madly Kenzo! Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I like this smell. It is simultaniously sweet, dry, cool, spicy and warm at the same time. The dryness and coolness prevents it from being too sweet, and the sweetness seems almost fleeting at times.

Madly Kenzo! Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"When I first put this on my skin it smelled gorgeous. Fruity, yes. but also a little spicy. Something different. I couldn't really decide if I really liked it because it felt maybe even a little too spicy and woody for my type. Sadly, when I came home (after like half an hour) it turned really really sweet on my skin which I don't like a all. Too bad. If it had stayed the way it started on my skin, I would have bought it immediately... It might just be my body chemistry not working great with this one, though.
Oh, and it lasts surprisingly long. Even after taking a shower, the next day my wrist still smelled like it.",10/02/12 02:31,melodiadelapaz

Madly Kenzo! Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"20. august 2012

I totally agree with user Antonpan. This has almost (may i even say at all) nothing to do with EDP ""Madly"". While i like ""Madly"" EDP very much for it´s character and being not another floral-fruity, i just don´t get this EDT ""Madly"". Bland, lightly sweet scent with litchi and pear accompanied with a way too much of a jasmine. Oh, yes, there is a heliotrope as well, but somehow these notes don´t combine each other, they mess with each other and if the fragrance would be a chior, this one would not be a good choir at all. More of a music band with one leading singer (Jasmine) and two back vocals (pear and litchi, the opening act). Oh, wait, there is a disturbing fan, that got bakstage and now tries to get on the stage - heliotrope. This concert was a mess, sorry. I´ve seen (smelled) it once and won´t be returning for more.",08/20/12 08:51,passionata20

For some reason all I smell is watermelon. The watermelon is kind of solid, but the overall feel is aquatic, watery. Refreshing and has a 1 metre sillage for like 15 minutes, then disappears quickly.

I tried L'Eau par Kenzo Ice a long time ago and only remembered it was nice. I retested it yesterday, and looked up the notes to find out with quite a shock that there is no watermelon here, while on my it seemed more like a watermelon water with a huge dose of freesia. I am not sure if I would classify it as woody aromatic on my skin, since I did not really get most of the notes, except maybe for lemon and some vanilla. Sadly I didnt get any mint nor ginger.

A charge of vivacity and energy - watermelon crust with lemon, at times as if a green unripe apple. In the base a little bit of wood, sounds noble, not in the style of summer watering cans.

Fortunately in another swap I was surprised with a sample of Kenzo Flower Essentielle and it is what I wished the original to be. KFE is in no way as strong as KF - at least to me - and it is also less sweet. I can actually smell the flowers in here whereas KF was more sweet powder with just a hint of flowers to my nose. KFE is rather lovely; yes, it still packs a punch in the opening but that calms down relatively quickly and leaves me with a wonderful powdery/flowery trail with just a hint of sweetness that rescues it from becoming cold and unapproachable.

After unboxing I just realized they are different :) At first I got disappointed I got lots of rose, jasmine, powder and a little of smoke:)
I wore it at work and I got complements from 3 people so I decided to change my attitude, it is also a high quality perfume. It does not smell artificial and stays for hours.

Flower by Kenzo Essentielle Kenzo,"Well, I tried this one a year ago and it was all about Hawthorn all over me.. not nice at all. Now I have tried it again. Lovely Rose, Insence, Pepper, pink pepper, Jasmin, Musk and Vanilla mix. And its lovely! Less is more and 1 spray goes a long way. Very longlasting on me - 15+ hours.

Day 2: I woke up this morning and Essentielle was still around. Soft, warm pepper/Insence/rose-mix was dancing on my skin. Impressed!

Pepper on my skin is great. Pepper is fresh, warm and calms down the sweet flowernotes. I can't wear strong Citrusnotes - the almost always turn maleish on me, so I love pepper/pink pepper-notes they work perfectly on me =)

Tja, jag provade denna för ett år sen och då skrek den Havtorn, inte alls trevlig. Nu testar jag den igen och den är ljuvlig. Ros, Rökelse, Peppar, rosa peppar, Jasmin, Musk och Vanilj i härlig mix. Helt underbar ju! Lite är lagom, 1 sprejning räcker länge, otroligt hållbar på mig, mer än 15 timmar.

Dag 2: Vaknade i morse och Essentielle är fortfarande kvar. Mjuk, varm peppar/rökelse/ros-mix som fortfarande ångar från huden. Imponerad!

Peppar på min hud är magiskt. Peppar blir fräsch, varm och dämpar de söta noterna från blomnoterna. Jag kan inte bära starka citrusnoter i parfymer - de blir nästan alltid manliga på mig, men peppar/rosa peppar älskar jag och de funkar utmärkt på mig utan att bli stickiga eller skarpa.",11/21/14 06:14,Mooniq

I'm especially happy to wear Essentielle when I'm uneasy or feeling awkward in a situation as it provides to the piece I need in those times.

It's a very clean scent, soapy even. Rose, jasmine, hawthorn, and vanilla dominate mostly on my skin. The incense is very soft like a breeze or gentle wind, and very well blended with the vanilla. I can hardly detect the peppers at all; I don't mind it actually, as I guess it would give a sharper edge to the perfume that would ruin the dreamy image I've got wearing it.

Flower by Kenzo Essentielle Kenzo,"I liked this perfume a lot while I had it. It starts with this oily, pencil like note, quickly developing into peppery goodness. It's similar to the original Flower, but so different at the same time. The pepper gives the scent the playfulness, and sharpness. The incense it's so briliant here, just the right amount to make it smokey and misterious, something so very femme-fatale like. I love the development of this perfume, starting with oily woodiness, ""cooking"" into earthy jasmine with hint of incense and blast of pepper. This does not smell soapy on me, it's quite balmy, which I do not understand looking into the notes. I'd say try before you buy.
I do not detect vanilla, I think it just blends into the other ingredients and makes them darker and richer, without adding sweetness. Kenzo knows how to deal with vanilla, so I think what they did here is excelent. Great projection, great development, overall I'd say it's absolutely 100% oriental perfume, on me at least.

Too good to my coworkers when I wear this, I get a much better person to work with!
Jasmine shows up in a non-indolic smooth way. The rose in this frag is not the overwhelming rose of Agent Provocateur (and I do love Agent Provcateur) nor the superfresh rose of Eau de Quatre Reines by L'Occitane. It's a soft but intensive rose. I feel like the rose on this is the one Very Irresistible was aiming to, but got somewhere else instead - they reached a lovely rose, but not a irresistible one.
Nice powdery clean musk, not too powdery, and a good use of hawthorn, too.
As usual, the Kenzo Vanilla Signature (I like it very very much) wanders throughout.

Almost as lovely spiced as Kenzo Flower Le Parfum. If you couldn't reach Le Parfum, try this one. It's indeed a different smell, but them both share some character.",08/09/13 15:53,IsabelAlice

A lovely, beautiful bouquet of these flowers, more powdery than it is smoky and just a soft hint of Vanilla which adds a very delicate sweetness to the composition. Or it is the hawthorn... I just read the odor profile for this note and this could be definitely the sweetness!

Flower by Kenzo Essentielle Kenzo,"On my skin this one starts very dark and with a great punch of insence. Middlenote gives a licoriseheavy note blended with dark rose and pepper. I usually loves pepper, but I don't like licorise. This one is not for me. Looking at notes in this scent, maybe its the Hawthorn that makes me think of heavy, dark licorise. Hawthorn smells very heavy if you crush the berries, and Hawthorn is a smell I really dont like.

After 3 hours when Hawthorn finally dissapeared the basenote is gorgeous, soft incense, rose and musk. Very classy and elegant mix.

På min hud startar denna väldigt mörk och med en rejäl dos rökelse. Hjärtnoten ger en kraftig lakrits not blandad med djup, mörk ros och peppar. Jag älskar peppar i mina dofter, men jag tycker inte om lakrits. Denna är inte för mig. Dock en doft för karriärskvinnan i mitt tycke. När jag tittar på doftnoterna så ser jag Havtorn, kanske är det den som gör att jag känner lakrits. Havtorn har en tung och kraftig doft när man mosar bären och Havtorn är en doft jag verkligen inte gillar.

I got it as gift, and i didn't really notice the 'Essentielle' word because my eyes set to Kenzo Flower: the notorious floral perfume.My first encounter with Kenzo FLower was years ago, and it was dreadful. It was horrible, overwhelming flower bouquet that turned my intestines upside down. Having read 'essentielle', i don't hope that much either. Not a fan of floral perfume,never was.But i take my chance and give it a whiff.

First impression : it is rose. a very delicate rose, light and intriguing because there is this comforting & powdery scent. but then again, there's incense [oh good lord i hate this ingredient]but on this one, it smells heavenly.I love the dry down part. It lingers for quite some time with this subtle neutral and jasmine-ish scent. It is absolutely beautiful.
About the incense, it is deep but curiously 'buried' under the rose-jasmine duet, a bit soapy like Chanel Coco Mademoiselle, but Kenzo Flower Essentielle is more subtle, not as glamorous as Coco Mademoiselle, but still, a very beautiful fragrance.
i love it so much!",07/22/12 05:50,hotaru

Flower by Kenzo Essentielle Kenzo,"I never was attracted tho the 'Flower' perfumes. I received a sample of Essentielle (the only way to be sure if you really like a smell) and tested it. It's a real flowery scent, I can smell the incense immediately, normally you'd have to wait until drydown to smell this.

On the other hand, the rose and jamsine stay present to, which is a good thing. Lots of other perfumes do differ from the opening scent after a while.
Not this one.

But I do think I know now why I'm not very fund of Flower, there's just too much vanilla. I like it on someone else but for myself, I don't want to be surrounded by this bakery smell.

Must have for vanilla lovers!",12/15/10 23:56,samsara1977
Flower by Kenzo Essentielle Kenzo,I love this fragrance. The weird part is that it's drydown reminds me a little the drydown of Infusion d'Iris on me - probably this is the incense that makes it's appearance. Very nicely blended and feminine...

Flower by Kenzo Essentielle Kenzo,"While I did not at all like Kenzo Flower I like Esentielle much more. The opening is rather powdery,abit wishy washy and slightly soapy. But then later the scent becomes much more sweet and floral and it allmost smells like jasmine and cucumber that has been rolled in vanilla sugar (don't ask me where the cucumber came from). The incence is not that prominent at all but it sits nicley in the background and lingers with the rest of the notes. The type of woman that I would imagene could be caught wearing this. Would be someone who was sweet and rather quirky not conventionaly beautiful but rather strange and intriguing. Because this scent is rather strange and at times sharp and no way near the conventional mold for what is considered a good perfume.",01/11/10 12:25,MoietToi

Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Beautiful gentle floral perfect for Spring and Summer. First spray is a bit scratchy, as if a distant puff of salty sand tickles your nose, but then the pretty flowers open like a breath of fresh scented air. The blend of peony and rose is soft, pretty, with a lingering ultra feminine touch. It's more creamy in the heat, more powdery in cool weather. Overall this perfume is light but persistent, leaving a beautiful trail . It stays on skin for 6 hours, and clings to hair and fabrics until you wash it off. Projection is moderate for the first 4 hours, then it stays closer to skin, still leaving a soft trail as you walk by. The vanilla darkens over time, changing to a deep amber color, becoming richer, adding better longevity to the perfume. This EDT is different from the original EDP. I own and love them both.",04/19/24 07:38,joliecat
Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"If you like rose soap, that typical lotion scent and sweet powder, all without being juvenile or over the top, this one's for you! This is so softly floral, lotion-y and cute, kind of innocent. The pear is the same as in Irresistible. They have some of the same vibe, but I actually prefer this one. This lasts longer and is more like a ""real"" perfume. This is perfect for everyday wear or work, I would wear this any season too. But I think it's perfect for spring and summer. I think this would be more suited for people 25+. It doesn't smell amazing close-up after spraying, but very lovely if you let it come to your nose instead. Impressive longevity, especially for an EDT!",11/23/23 13:01,FrkFors

Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Much less intense than its version in the emerald green bottle, but at the same level of quality and finish, that's for sure! Although I'm not sure I'd like to have one for myself, for now!

A rather frightening opening, due to the odd combination of citrus touches, pear juice and another oily almond content, with zero flowers and one note trying to overlap the other; It was messy, I must say, but if I can get through his exit, it'll be pure joy!

A garden of living Roses and another bouquet of dewy Peonies stand out in the heart, bringing a sensation of neatness, freshness, absolute cleanliness and, at the same time, admirable joviality; cool this tender feeling of young age that he refers here!

Finally, it becomes a fragrance that is very close to the skin, with a vanilla background, and hints of sensual musk, and a few more pinches of wet woods and a very shy, very exquisite lily and for those people who admire more intimate perfumes, who seek to perfume themselves only for themselves!",06/18/23 09:59,Jernê Knowles

Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"The notes look just divine, I imagined something lovely and softer. It doesn't smell like Nivea at all. Very interesting composition, I find it hard to make my mind up about it. I smell something slightly sharp, it's not creamy and too soft (like Nivea), I think, I would really love it without the pear as something stands out too much and destroys that beautiful soft, flowery, milky undertone, which is felt throughout. It is slightly powdery, I'd probably love it if it was less on that sweetness. It's not cloying by all means, nothing close to LVEB sweetness, but I can't love it as it still annoys me.",09/26/22 06:56,violeteme

It has a wonderful rose smell, gotta love how the base notes provide your girlfriend, wife or best friend with that blameless smell of a musk, violet, vanilla and sandalwood. You also really gonna love the freshness of the perfume. I recommend this one.",04/16/22 04:24,vokajlo
Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"Something in this fragrance is off putting to my nose and I really think it’s the rose. To me, this does smell like Nivea body cream/lotion but less pleasant because of that rose. I get the peony here but it’s overshadowed by sharp rose. I’m hoping I can find a way to tone that note down as I’m in love with the bottle and otherwise find the fragrance pleasant.

I think this could be worn as a casual everyday scent. It has decent lasting power and forms a light and airy scent bubble. I could also see this being worn to bed

Update: I couldn’t make it work, gave it away",03/09/22 17:02,CeeTheAurtist
Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I was not the biggest fan of Kenzo World EDP, I didn't hate it but found it rather mediocre and kind of messy. Because some reviewers described the EDT as not similar to the original and as a Nivea cream type of scent, I still wanted to try it.

Well, I do think it's similar to the EDP, but less fruity and more floral, and more harmonious all in all. Both have the same lush, humid, syrupy texture that is also found in the My Burberry line, which is no surprise as they're all by the same perfumer, Francis Kurkdjian.
World EDT starts out fruity, I'm not sure if I would have identified it as pear though. It's sweet and juicy, but the floral notes of dewy rose and peony already peek through. I'm glad they left out the red berries that clashed with the peony in the EDP. After I while the scent becomes creamier and a little powdery with the almond blossom, musk and orris, which is quite pleasant. It's clearly almond blossom, not almond, so this is not gourmand at all, but it's much sweeter than Nivea and similar body cream scents. I wouldn't put it into the ""clean and freshly showered"" category, it's a sweet fruity floral to me. When I once tried it in an overheated mall with a heavy winter jacket on I noticed it turned sickly on my skin, so I'd say this is better suited to mild weather and lighter clothes.
After 6 hours I can barely smell it today, so the performance is nothing to write home about. The whole scent is nothing extraordinary, but it's nice and likeable.",12/18/21 17:38,SailorV

Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"How bright, uplifting and feminine! This is one of those scents if you want to feel fresh, clean and pretty: then splash this on and you're good to go!

Kenzo 'World' EDT smells NOTHING like the EDP and falls into the same category as Ferragamo 'Signorina' EDT (Except I love Signorina more).
First spray I get that crisp, soapy pear. It's definitely citrusy on me and not sweet (if you're looking for sweet pear go for Katy Perry's 'Meow' EDP). Within 5 minutes the florals come in, they are tart! My skin projects the rose most. As it dries down it's quite linear: Powdery, crisp pears on a bed of tart, soapy roses. I get way more peony in 'World' EDP.

Is it a complex, unique scent? No definitely not. Do I think it's an easy reach for all daytime occasions in warm weather? Heck yes!
P.S. If you're looking for a more mature version of this scent 100% go for Lancôme's Idole range.",06/28/21 09:46,Palmer Eldritch

Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I would describe this as a clean, fresh floral. Perfect for spring time. Not offensive in any way. Lots of comparisons to Nivea cream fragrance (and body lotion) which I cannot attest to as I have not smelled that one. This is very feminine and pretty. I don't know how much I will reach for this as I have a lot of other fragrances that I like and enjoy a lot more than this one but I am not mad that I own it. It is not very loud - sillage and projection I would say are moderate at best - which for Kenzo is unusual. Usually their fragrances project and last a long time on me.

Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"The other day I got a tester of this and I wholeheartedly agree with Albiretu, this smells SO much like Nivea cream!

There's definitely a little bit added fruitiness going on, but the Nivea vibe is super strong.

Longevity in cooler European weather (15-20 Celsius, 59-68 Fahrenheit) is rather weak on me. I can smell it for about 2-3 hours. Sillage is also rather quiet. I guess people will mostly smell it when you move by them, as in getting into /out of the same elevator, moving by their desk closely etc.

It's inoffensive, clean, fresh, feminine, the perfect office fragrance. Might also fit well with a white dress meeting your friends for a spring or summer brunch. Weirdly also I could picture 1980s Steffi Graf (or insert any other 80s or early 90s tennis player) to be promoting it.

I don't think I would go out of my way to buy this, but I wouldn't be mad if I got it as a gift randomly. It's a no brainer pick for the daytime and for settings when you're not sure people will appreciate stronger fragrances or not. I'd definitely use it up.",07/13/19 05:23,latafan
Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I remember leaving a rather underwhelming review for Kenzo World EDP some years ago. This one, however, is a whole different story. Very powdery, but in a good way, almond milk-like scent with barely there vanilla and very delicate heart notes.

Kenzo World Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"In love with this, smells to me like Nivea Cream, literally identical to it. Such a calming and soothing scent, appropriate for all occasions, from a work lunch to a family brunch, to even a wedding, really really anything... It makes me feel like I just stepped out of the shower and put cream on, feeling fresh, clean, sexy, and in a good mood.
It has a hint of creamy floral soapiness, it makes me think of thick dense Nivea cream when you lather your hands with it. Great sillage, projection, longevity. I sprayed a couple sprays in the store around 6-7 hours ago and it's still very very noticeable. I will be doing my research to find this for cheap and I will most definitely buy myself a full size bottle. Gorgeous scent, better than the EDP (which is completely completely different), although I like that one too.

This is a nice, safe and inoffensive scent, different to the EdP - much safer and much more tamed.

Pleasant enough and something I might wear should I not have anything else to wear. Just like I would use my Nivea lotion should I not have any more fancier lotions around.

Normally I love peony and pear notes, but those notes are far too muted in this scent for them to really shine, unfortunately.

For those expecting a pretty pink every day scent this is great. If you are expecting much more, like I was based on the notes and Kenzo's own description of the scent, this may be a slight disappointement.",12/05/18 09:10,SaraX

But soft sillage and longevity, 1 or 2 hour in my skin, I have retouch it ever... it's different of the traditional. I really love it (much more than CK One Summer editions).

L'Eau par Kenzo Colors pour Homme Kenzo,"Stumbled across this in a small chain fragrance store, which was a surprise given that getting Kenzo scents in the UK is sometimes a thankless task.

So, the scent itself. It's definitely got citrus there, a lot more so that the original L'eau Par. Though the citrus is more aquatic than say compared to Chanel Allure Homme Blance edition, it's definitely tempered and gives way to a herbal note, as the mint and sage notes suggest. The spiel says this is woody but compared to Kenzo Woody this is a copse rather than a forest.

Sillage, not overly strong. Bearing in mind how close the original can sit to the skin. (Out of the L'eau Par flankers I'd say this is the weakest I've smelt, compared to Indigo and the Wild editions.

Longevity, four hours later and I can smell it close to my skin and perhaps half a foot away. It's not overpowering.

However, I can see its place as a summer scent. Heat would definitely make this react differently in my view and on the drydown it's even nearing some of the Miyake summer scents, but in a slightly more mellow sense. I also think heat would make it project more, it has that feel to it.

Overall, a different direction for the L'eau Par series and one that's in my view a touch more nuanced. Definitely going to be worn in the summer to see what it's really capable of!",03/30/13 04:16,Doktor Gott
Totem Blue Kenzo,"Totem Blue by Kenzo is a unique blend that leans towards the sweet side, with coumarin and pineapple taking center stage. It has a playful, modern freshness that reminds me of Kenzo Aqua, but instead of its signature aquatic vibe, this one swaps it for a melon-like undertone that adds a soft, fruity twist.

It’s easygoing and versatile, making it a solid casual scent. If you enjoy fresh-sweet combinations with a bit of a tropical edge, Totem Blue is worth trying.",03/04/25 06:50,AndrewZb
Totem Blue Kenzo,"I´ve got a sample from my boyfriend today. The sample was probably 0,5ml in little plastic bag with marketing pic. Very unpractical though so when I´ve had opened the bag, the liquid poured on me.. so i put the whole 0,5ml ( quite a lot) on my whole arm. First thing I have to say...the longevity is waaaaay too poor. Maybe an hour on me idk but I doubt even that which is ridiculous when I consider the price of fragrance. Scent itself is meh, nothing special but nothing bad too. It´s nice, soft, citrusy, not-very-loud scent. I thought of this being unisex even before I read the info so that´s pretty obvious. Anyways it´s nothing I would be craving for. So for me this is a Like category - becouse the scent is quite fine - but the longevity and ununiqueness keeps me from buying this.",11/07/18 15:45,Nyrahe

Totem Blue Kenzo,"Totem blue

Tried yellow and blue today, haven’t found the orange.

Blue: it dies nice things in the beginnning, it’s a bit off in the middle, that cedar mixed with other notes is not bad, not good, very different, I will say I was feeling like crap today and the tests I had on were making me a bit queasy.

I had this, the yellow one, Dior jadore l’or, and Dior jadore Touche last ine was a scrubber so got removed, and it might have been the lively L’or whafting up and mixing with the blue totem doing weird things??

The note I got reminded me of roberto cavalli with the oval bottle and Fancy lid edp. Like a (nice) rubber eraser note??

I got the pineapple at the dry down after several hours, it was cooler and more unisex than the yellow one, but warmed up in the dry down.

I think both could be easily unisex. Great sillage and longevity. 6hours or so",02/09/18 05:30,dglightblue

Totem blue is straightforward citrusy juicy pineapple, laid over a semi-sweet woody base, with occasional spicy and coconut-y accents. Good for cooler summer nights and laid back occasions. Unpretentious and quite fun, the bottle is nice too.

Totem Blue Kenzo,"This blue totem opens with a bunch of sweet pineapple notes. There is also something ozonic or aquatic in the mix, that gets a bit stronger as the scent progresses. Still lots of pineapple but also darker notes that give this scent a certain bite and make the base more sturdy. The drydown is cedar-ish, tiny bits of ozonic aquatic notes, a bit of iso-e-super and pineapple on top.

Sillage is moderate, longevity moderate.

I can't really define the cardamom in here, it's part of a dark accord but not as cardamommy as I'd like it to be. The pineapple, on the other hand, is quite out there and enjoyable. I can see myself wearing this in summertime when I feel like something simple and fruity.",08/07/15 08:19,freakypirate

5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"its weird nobody mentions Jungle le Tigre in the similars. id say they are practically identical, only here Kenzo replaced spices with lotus flower to make it watery and ozonic... but the key note - vanilla - is done in the same fresh, almost lemony, a bit sour style.
although launched in 2009, it still carries that particular 2000s vibe, like shiseido zen, avon pur blanca etc (in terms of style I mean)

I know this is extremely difficult to find, but I don't think it's worth its current eBay prices. Maison del'Asie has a fragrance called Mother x love which smells practically identical (despite different notes), and performs much better",06/12/25 07:52,koxayous
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,Ah Kenzo ... Such an underrated house. This is a shame. Kenzo produced some amazing and wearable fashion ... and beautiful perfumes :) Somehow they have been mostly forgotten despite the originality and the talent. Now back to this perfume. This is the best vanilla-heavy perfume I own because it stands out in the crowd of overly plain gourmand vanilla that are smelling like a cake. You definitely smell the lotus and some freshness for the first hour or so. It's woody as well. The dry down is some sort of vintage woody vanilla that is quite pleasant and not cloying. It's stays on my skin for a couple of hours. It is true that it is beautiful even during hot humid Summer days. And the bottle is beautiful with its sunset background.,06/30/23 16:25,annema
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"I genuinely miss this perfume. I used to always bring it from the trips in 2009-2011 and I haven’t smelt nothing like it since. Very airy, ozonic, but also woody, sweet woody, lactonic, very unique. Still looking for anything close to it or a dupe. That’s the only vanilla I ever liked, it’s raw woody vanilla that you don’t find in modern fragrances. Wish Kenzo brings it back at least as limited edition one day again.",02/04/22 08:51,AnastasiaS
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"I am so upset, I bought this a couple of years ago while traveling and I loved it. I didn't wear it every day but when I did wear it I had a lot of very happy memories associated with it.
This past year we had to move into a condo when our house sold faster than expected and we waited for our new home to be finished. So we started moving into our new home and still had things in the condo, not much but a few things including about half of my perfume collection. Well someone broke into the condo and while they didn't take much they did take my box of perfume that I didn't get moved. And now I am just sick about it.",06/10/18 20:48,PearlJewel
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"Lovely scent. I picked this up 7 years ago at an airport in Europe, and it still smells the same. I don't know what lotus flower actually smells like - isn't it usually in the middle of a pond so how do we peasants know? I thought it was a combination of bamboo, vanilla, and cedar. Very unique - nothing else like it, fits the title completely. I've only smelled this on one girl I know - most don't have this in US. It is NOT just vanilla for sure...that's what makes this stands out.",10/16/17 15:49,syghuang
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"Following a trend of olfactory travels, which was widespread among several companies, the house of Kenzo also released a collection of fragrances inspired by places and their exotic aromas. The first of these was 7:15 AM in Bali, in 2008, followed by this one here, in 2009. There is also a third creation, which was released in 2011, taking Sicily as inspiration.

For those who don't know, some places are very specific to the perfumery universe, because of a certain ingredient that is produced and/or cultivated and that makes it unique as, for example, the Tahitian Tiare flower, the sandalwood from Sri Lanka, the bergamot from Calabria, the rose from Turkey or the lemon from Sicily.

In 5:40 PM in Madagascar, Kenzo has decided to explore nuances of the most famous vanilla of this market, which is obtained through a specific genre of Orchid, and very used in perfumes in the world: the vanilla of Madagascar.
In the composition were mixed notes of Lotus Flower, in the head, followed by notes of Freesia and cedar, in the body of the fragrance, over a rich and creamy vanilla base. But what is little spread is the existence of vanilla also at the top of the olfactory pyramid. No wonder it is easily noticed (and lingers), from the moment that the scent hits the skin.

Overall, this is an oriental scent with some floral nuances. I've read reports of users citing more the Lotus Flower and others who claim to have noticed a lot of Freesia. On my skin, this scent had an extremely linear development, with a floral touch of synthetic aspect, which is clearly a result of the freesia's note. But the star of the fragrance is, obviously, the vanilla. Here, it is not too liqueur or too sweet. It is creamy and sweet in the right measure, giving a unique feeling of comfort. For this reason, the image of the sunset, which is depicted on the bottle, combines very well with the feeling of a cappuccino being drunk on a waterfront balcony while admiring the sunset with a blanket over the shoulders.

Although this collection has been released as a limited edition and was initially marketed only in the airports stores, 5:40 PM in Madagascar is the kind of semi-gourmand scent that can be worn easily in my country (Brazil). As I said before, it's not too sweet. In addition, has subtle projection, making it comfortable, intimate and cosy. And there's more: some say that it is a female perfume, but it is clearly unisex. And it works very well if worn at the same time by a couple in love, no matter of what genre or composition.
It's the kind of perfume that you can wear in a movie night, for example, and ensures proximity all the time. And the lasting is very good!

Finally, the bottles are the same throughout the collection, with pictures of each specific place and in single size of 50 ml.
If you like slightly sweetened scents, are vanilla fan and like Kenzo’s style, this is another perfume you should test.",10/06/15 08:55,Cassiano
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"This is a really strange one and NOTHING like I expected.

The opening of this smells very bizarre. It smells like a very sharp slightly scorched grass, or hay. There are reeds blowing in the wind on the box and bottle and that's what I get. I wasn't expecting that at all. It's actually very arid smelling and I'm going to say..not the MOST pleasant thing I've encountered.

The vanilla hides behind this for a while but starts to emerge when it's dry. It's the most non gourmand vanilla I have ever smelled! It stays crisp..light and almost airy.

I really don't get any of the things the other reviewers have said and I'm really not sure what to make of it.

It's a head scratcher!

Madagascar is a refreshing and sweet little fragrance, purely feminine and appropriate for summer wear. Not too distinctive, hence it has fallen into the back of my perfume wardrobe. I do not sense the aquatic element or the woods at all, I would just say that is a vanilla blended in a light, summery ethereal way. Uncomplicated and very easy going, it reminds me of a young beautiful girl on holidays, wearing a bikini and concentrating admiring glances from everyone without trying or realizing it.

5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"Was interested to try this given that it's labelled as unisex and I've worn other women's scents by Kenzo before.

My impressions are it's a very warm vanilla scent with a trace of a floral note with the lotus. It's soft and veering towards the feminine for sure.

It does last though. I've had applications lasting from morning to night and it seems to thrive in the warmer weather.

As for the scent, once the initial floral notes temper, the vanilla dominates and in a sweet sense. The lasting note is definitely pleasant and one that I'd be comfortable to wear.

Overall, this is a pleasant calming scent that would definitely be of use when travelling and you need to freshen up or give yourself some grounding amid the chaos.",05/01/13 06:15,Doktor Gott

So it was inaugurated in the late afternoon heat at about 40 degrees and lots of humidity. You might think that it is too much but somehow it is well suited to a hot summer night. The lotus and woody notes keep it floral enough to stop guys from eating your neck (although they will try - I had some experience of this stuff being a man magnet!).

Now that I am used to its strange personality, I rather like it and no longer find it sour or confused.

5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"I got this last summer and didn't care for it a lot, it was very very green to me, like the scent of a wet weed pulled from the marsh. It was a nice scent in the woods, but not so good to wear. It might be that very note that smells like pecans to DresdenDoll. I get no flowers or sweetness from this during the summer at ALL. It's mine and I had to at least like this! Well, it might be that sometimes the first few sprays are rather unpleasant in perfumes and they have to be sprayed a few times before you can detect the most pleasant notes. Perhaps it's from the air in the sprayer, I'm not sure, but, I like this scent quite a LOT now. It still comes out green, but a fresh green, not mossy and damp. Within 30 minutes, this turns into a lovely vanilla. I dislike very much vanilla in a perfume but this is one of the exceptions for me. This is the dry, natural, vanilla that one would smell on a very hot, late afternoon, in Madagascar! Of course I can only imagine as I've never been there. I love to grab my sweater and smell this on it from the evening before. It's most lovely when you can smell this the same way someone smells this ON you. This could become a favorite of mine in no time. I wonder what this summer again will bring to my nose. I hope this isn't just a winter scent for me. Heavy damp air makes me dislike most perfumes and with luck, that's all that made me not cozy up to this at first. Wish me luck!

But it smells almost exactly like this:

A vanilla bean red (rooibus) tea I used to have.

So rich and flavorful, sweet and fragrant, that it didn't really need the honey I always added.

the cedar is very delightful and round, the flowers light and sweet, the vanilla lingers smoothly in the background. the scent is very powdery, earthy, woody, warm, with a hint of lovely vanilla.
it stays close to skin and will let you catch some wiffs the whole day long. when hugging people they always compliment how good i smell when i wear this! this would certainly not offend anyone... i even think it will attract people to come closer to you :)
maybe it's not sexy but confidential. can't stop to sniff my wrist and let me feel immediately cosy and safe. it stays for days on clothes as well.

I felt, at first, a odd smell, that I figured later it is oakmoss. Truly, I never smelled oakmoss, but after I read here that theres is some in this parfumes's composition, I reallize that it must be it. I found it a strange smell, I could feel it after 3, 4 hours. Than, I smell only vanilla and some flower that I can't name.

It is a sweet and nice fragrance, good enough to every day use, better in colder days.",07/27/10 12:56,anaaranha

5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"I was very excited when I found it in duty free store at Gatwick airport. I love vanilla so I sprayed it on my wrist and after I smelled it, it brought my early teen memories back. I found that really odd and couldnt figure out why this happened. I was thinking about it all day and then I realised that it smells very much like Spice Girls Impulse deodorant, the one with the orange cap on it (I know, thats really weird) - it was discountinued years ago but I swear it smells very similar.
Overall, it is a pleasant 'fresh vanilla', but I find it a bit too simplistic - I wish at least one more note would be added to create deepness. Its longevity on my skin was quite good -I could smell it on my wrist for about 5 hours",12/08/09 13:11,LenaBel
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,"At the beginning it smells like morning dew, wet grass, pure herbs, I couldn’t smell any flower, but after a while vanilla with freesia and lotus, and it seems you are walking in a forest, maybe they shouldn’t have classified it as oriental/vanilla, because it’s more green than anything.",10/14/09 14:58,alianeblue
5:40 PM in Madagascar Kenzo,I tried this one on in the cosmetics section of a shop aboard a cruise ship. I did at first not understand that it was a unisex scent beacuse it's very sweet and vanillia esque. But unfortunatley this perfume does after ca 7 mins on my skin.

Flower by Kenzo Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I don't know why but EDT is more heavier than the Original. It is more citrus, wood, musk, vanilla, while the original is more violet and muguet all over. EDT smells like Nivea lotions or those kinds.",06/22/24 03:14,Mez0Nez
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"This starts out differently than the eau de parfum, very mandarin citrusy, but dries down to exactly the same scent. After smelling this, I can understand why Kenzo felt the need to create a new eau de toilette in 2021. Maybe someone there realized this was essentially the same scent as the eau de parfum. The note profile for the new 2021 eau de toilette, created by Alberto Morillas (which is a big bonus in my book 😊), is completely different. I now want to try that too.
While I like this, I'm still not sure this edt would wear any lighter in warmer weather, which is why I wanted it. The only time I can wear the edp is during the cold months because of the heavy powder. I see no difference in the level of powder here. It's still a powder bomb on me.
I was considering getting a backup for the edp but now no longer feel the need, but I am disappointed that they didn't make this a true edt, sans the powder for warm weather wear. Despite that, I love this too and am glad I now have what I consider a backup bottle of the original scent.",04/18/24 13:46,Anamandy
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"At least three ways to do a flanker:

One. The original composition in diluted concentration.
Two. Something else entirely — while trying to use the name of the original to promote the flanker.
Three. A satellite of the mothership—bears the family resemblance but missing some parts, and/or with parts unique unto itself.

This is a number three situation — it’s a summer-weight Flower with a green, powdery, musky violet note. Not as rich or as cloying as Flower edp which for me reads mostly as heady, stridently sugared opopanax musk coating roses and violets. No, no — Flower edt is tender green violets from the earth meeting violet pastilles from the candy apothecary meeting a young woman’s first powder compact…all held together in a matrix of clean white musk. Uncomplicated and pretty. Has one of those superfine sprayers that makes each pump like a tiny aerosol spray — I wish more brands used those. Worth the $16 I paid for it at Marshall’s. Weirdly, on paper, the drydown reminds me a fair bit of Baiser Vole.

(As an aside, in my quest for the prettiest violet ever, I couldn’t believe how laundry-ish Guerlain Insolence edp became in the drydown — what started as an over-the-top, maudlin, high-drama violet/berry duet eventually turned into a dryer sheet. The prettiest violet I’ve found so far is the discontinued layering fragrance Soft Violet from Arcana. Happily got that in a trade!)",02/13/24 11:17,ingrid.superstar

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"Initially refreshing perfume, which carries some sweet footprints, but without falling into the routine of contemporary masculine gourmand perfumes that break every week in world launches. That perfume to be used without much commitment, for the day at the Club it looks great!

Light and creative opening, referring to the seaside, only well flavored, kind of a subtle immersion bath of fresh herbs, along with a lemonade heated by the sun and another light Yuzu tea, very aromatic, relaxing!

In drying it becomes a handmade vegetable garden, emanates an amalgamated aroma of riches of herbs that reminds us of gathering people with indigenous roots, or family cultivation, this is beautiful, I like to feel it, the citrus aroma of the beginning remains and the aromatic issue of herbs increases with each movement, referring to the aroma of male.

In drying it becomes dense and more serious, the Vetiver in it does not shine so much, but attributes to it a special ""what"" of remote anthropological ritual, because who stands out here is the Cedar, in raw chips of fresh, half moist, half spicy and highly aromatic; very well there in the fundão, after a few hours, L'Eau Kenzo Intense",01/10/23 09:59,Jernê Knowles

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"Smells good it was my first fragrance so I like this.This have own smell I think this is unique enough but only downside is performance it becomes skin scent after 40 minutes you have to reapply it

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"I see the similarity with Invictus, I would say it is a darker version of Invictus, for summer night occasions ( not a clone, but the similarity is there ). Longevity is not bad, projection is very good for the first hour, but then disappear completely. The problem with this one is that you need to spray a lot of it to get a good amount of projection and sillage, but being a sweet scent, if you overspray it, you will literally choke anyone around you for the first hour. So when I know I will wear it, I heavily apply it at least 30 minutes before to meet someone else. If you like the Invictus bubblegummy vibe and you find it a 20-25 dollars, give a try, but I paid it 56 $ when it was released and with that kind of longevity and projection it doesn't really value that much.",06/25/19 13:34,RonnieR
L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"This is a good fragrance for the price.

Sour citrusy and strong opening with smooth ambroxan base. Maybe because of the ambroxan / salty accords people are saying it is invictus clone while in fact it is a defferent scent. The powerfull sharp lime and bitter yuzu balance the ambrox bubblegummy sweet effect in a good way.

It is pleasant, modern, fresh, complements getter and affordable at discounters.

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"Yes!

I must admit that it makes the impression of being a new and likable summer scent. It is not weak regarding longevity so that's a plus as well compared to other options from this house.

To my nose this is not comparable to PR Invictus. Yes, it is a sweet scent as well but the depth is different.

Nonetheless I'd rather pass on this because I'm not a fan of too much sweetness going on.

If you can ignore or get past its syrupy kool-aid notes then it really is a nice minty, cedar, yuzu combination.",08/06/16 13:08,nonsisa

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"Released this year (march of 2015), this version was introduced in the market as a fascinating and refreshing fragrance.

L'Eau Kenzo Intense is a limited edition of the L'Eau Par Kenzo collection, which was launched almost 2 decades ago. I don't know why they changed the name. However, if we translate, L'Eau Par Kenzo means ""water by Kenzo"", while L'Eau Kenzo is closer to ""Kenzo water"", which means that, what was once an interpretation, now became an affirmation. Either way, it's the kind of change that I think is unnecessary.

The official composition brings marine accord, lime and yuzu, in the head. Then, notes of black basil and Lotus flower are blended in the heart. Finally, cedar and vetiver at the base.
The result is an aromatic and floral fragrance (in my opinion), that reaches the skin in a sour and slightly minty manner. It is very easy to notice the nuances of yuzu and lime at this stage. After a while, a drastic change occurs and the scent shows itself more floral, with great presence of the Lotus flower. When it reaches this stage, does not change anymore. I haven't met the female version yet, but this one can be easily worn by women.

With respect to the projection, is very good at the start, but then, almost disappears without a trace (literally). But I can't complain about the longevity, since the scent got stuck on the skin for many hours, albeit very close.

The bottle kept the pattern, with a dark blue color, becoming very beautiful. Unfortunately, is another one of those fragrances that are coming to market with the promise of more intensity, but do not match expectations. Works very well as an Eau de Toilette, but the term ""Intense"" only serves to draw attention.",07/16/15 10:09,Cassiano
L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"Sadly i agree, this is so close to Rabanne Invictus, maybe some notes are in diference, a sweet overdose in invictus, and maybe an stronger floral vibe in kenzo, .. strange coincidence.",05/18/15 00:08,urobian
L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"Recently purchased this, and it is a solid and inoffensive spring/summer fragrance that starts off with a burst of yuzu before settling down pretty quickly (at least on my skin) to a moderate vetiver and cedar in the base. Longevity and sillage are both weak to moderate. Smells really pleasant and is perfect for casual wear in the heat. 7/10",05/15/15 05:33,Richi-iain
L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,A 99% copy of Paco Rabanne Invictus. The differences are almost non-existent. An overdose of modern salty aquatic molecules. This is absolutely not the style of Kenzo!,04/29/15 12:13,antonpan
L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Homme Kenzo,"I was stearing at the boxes of this perfume on a store shelf for few months. somehow Kenzo distributed them a way before it was supposed to be presented, that is why testers were not supplied. for me, as a l'eau par kenzo fan, it was truly hard to visit the stores every week to check the availability of testers, because I gave myself a word not to make a blind purchases so many times. finally this week testers have arrived. disappoinment. complete. probably it was my mistake to expect a intense version of the first l'eau par Kenzo. this one has nothing in common with the original. however, if someone will be seraching for a new perfume, it will be ok. I couldn't understand the idea. why Intense if it's a first among L'Eau Kenzo (without ""par""), and why it's completely different if it's a Intense of L'eau par Kenzo. well anyway, don't make a blind buy.",03/29/15 07:01,Sultan
Kenzo Jungle Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,Why?,09/21/25 11:31,djbethell
Kenzo Jungle Homme Eau de Toilette Kenzo,"I’m reviewing a 50ml bottle with the older style packaging, ie, “Kenzo Jungle Pour Homme” written inside the green box in the centre.

Make no mistake, this comes from a time when fragrances were intentionally designed as works of olfactory art to be sprayed, truly taken in, and savored. Things have sadly gone downhill since, with the current climate of churning out as many bubblegum, sugary elixir flankers as possible each financial quarter to feed the drooling social media algorithm-addicted basics who buy whatever influencers tell them to buy.

This? Fragrances with this much pre-conceived thought, focus, and vision feel completely alien in 2025. Like they were created on an entirely different planet. Designer houses took creative risks back then. Putting trends aside, there is absolutely no way this fragrance would ever make it past the focus panel/product/marketing approval stages in the current landscape we find ourselves in. Because no one has the balls to take creative risks anymore.

The slight animalic funk coming from the mate note that hovers in the background gives this a “carnality”. Really earthy and human.

Smells like making love to a woman on the packed, dry earth of the Serengeti savanna under a clear, moonlit sky next to a guaiac wood (palo santo) crate filled with limes and jars of spices. This is citrusy, earthy, woody, sweet, sour, and spicy all at once with a slight “sweat” type of accord humming in the background but I mean that in a very good way. Maybe there's also some dried Zebra dung funking away in the distance for added measured haha.

Longevity/performance, even on my older bottle, is not the greatest. But overspray this bad boy, enjoy the ride, then smile once it’s over. Knowing you’re always only ever one spray away from returning to that far-flung African trading post on the savanna.

I bless the rains down in Africa.

L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"This is decent, but it's nothing to go out of your way to try in my opinion. It's fresh and oznic but it's kind of flat and doesn't really change much. This is unisex but I would say that this reads as somewhat feminine, but only because of the other fragrances that it's reminiscent of. This reminds me of those late nineties and early 2000's female perfumes with the super fresh melon and ozonic notes...I can't remember any of the names off the top of my head. Like those scents, though, it's ever so slightly headache inducing and nauseating, just barely, but if you're sensitive to that then you may not like this.

I like that Kenzo is going for an unabashed freshie but I think they've missed the mark with this one. I just can't imagine who this is for in 2025. Again, it's not a bad scent, it's just unexciting and I'd rather be wearing something else.

I'd give it 5 out of 10.",09/08/25 12:19,Fuju

Very clean fresh and 100% a solid summer frag if you can get past the first 30 minutes or so. Well done kenzo. At first it reminded me of este lauder pleasures for men, I still feel the same way in that regard, however this is a much more modern take on that scent profile without the oak moss Happy sniffi’N
THE END.",09/02/25 15:36,Kustomeyez
L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"Pure freshness, a bright aquatic citrus splash. It’s in the same family as D&G Light Blue, Moschino I Love Love, or Divine Paradise, the drops by Issey Miyake: easy, refreshing scents made for summer heat. A little sweetness comes through, then it settles into a musky dry down.

I really enjoy the aquazone note here. I like when synthetics are used well, as is in this case. The fragrance itself is simple, but that’s kind of the point - it does the job of cooling and refreshing you. The bottle is beautiful too: baby blue, crystalline, soft and rounded, it matches the scent perfectly.",09/01/25 03:29,MetaMystic
L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"That's an interesting twist. Kenzo normally focuses a big chunk of its perfumes around the idea of ""aquatics"". L'eau Pure per nomenclature is an aquatic perfume as well. Without a single marine accord or note. The perfumer directed it to the aldehydic freshness. It's an ode to crispy laundry sundried on the chill day. Now, I am even more curious to try Ms. Bugey L'Artisan Perfumer's awarded perfume because it seems ""aqua fresh"" area is her expertise.

The fragrances itself opens with loads of bright citruses and as many noted - some kind of detergent. It's not too pungent and does not develop much rather than gets softer over the time. The overall longevity - 3-4 hours, which is not bad for this perfume genre. I did not focus on silage much.

The best thing in this perfume for me is the feeling of prolonged ""hug-you"" laundry freshness and the pyramid component trick. One of the best designer releases this year even though I am not a big appreciator of ""aquatic fragrance family"".",08/25/25 23:55,Gabrooch

L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"Almost a carbon copy of ""CK2"" from Calvin Klein. There are a few very minor differenses though. ""CK2"" has more blue watery freshness whereas ""L,eau Pure"" is a bit greener turning cucumbery later. The minerality (wet stone) of ""CK2"" lingers longer, whereas ""L,eau Pure"" turns softer and soapy clean but in a funny way. I kept looking for fresh coconut to be a note but no, it is not. Nonetheless, there is a tender soft coconut scent (maybe white musk and sandelwood). I find that note as well in the Body shops now discontinued ""Italian summer fig"". I am wearing both scents right now, and there is not much to tell them apart. However ""CK2"" dries out to a dry mineral note, ""L,eau Pure"" turns soft coconut.
It has a few family traits with ""Noa"" from Cacherel, It is in the same vein of soft, clean and non sugary.",07/03/25 05:38,VikingWoman

L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"I find this to be quite strong for a ""l'eau"" fragrance. Definitely more feminine than masculine, with a strong lavender-lotus-peony presence, like the review below rightfully acknowledged. Sadly not for me",06/03/25 11:11,mravenec
L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"I just got my Kenzo L’Eau Kenzo Pure, and I have to say—it instantly reminded me of A Drop d’Issey Eau Fraîche. They share a similar vibe: clean, fresh, and watery, with that calming, almost zen-like softness you’d expect from both brands. But Kenzo has its own unique presence too.
Kenzo L’Eau Pure opens with a refreshing wave of watery citrus and light floral notes. It feels incredibly airy—like mist over a still lake on a summer morning. You’ll notice soft florals like lotus and peony, mingled with hints of green tea or mint, depending on your nose. The drydown settles into a very light musky base, keeping it clean and skin-like.

It’s very much in the same family as A Drop d’Issey Eau Fraîche, but while Issey has a slightly sweeter, creamy almond twist, Kenzo keeps it crisper and more minimalist.",05/27/25 09:21,LazaPapo
L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"Kenzo is great at creating ""harmless"" fragrances for the smarter population that does not want to stand out in a vulgar way.

L'Eau Pure Kenzo,"This is fresh. Purchased a bottle at El Corte Inglés in Barcelona and have to say this is definitely different from anything Kenzo has put out.

It’s a fresh aquatic that smells very similar to scent like Hugo Now. The aquozone molecule is very distinctive in that it runs through the life of the fragrance. As it dries you can smell the lavender and sandalwood but the whole composition is very shampoo, brisk and summery. I like it . It’s not unique but it definitely is great for the warm weather. Some will say it’s too pedestrian considering the Bisch creations for the brand.. but I think it’s perfect for the summer and will definitely be a super seller. Especially abroad. The sandalwood in this is not pickle centric or even that noticeable. This is a keeper. Leans a little feminine.",05/26/25 02:29,septemberlibra

L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,I just received this today and it smells very nice it's very warm and perfect for this time of year. But I have smelled it before and I'm racking my brain to try and recall what it reminds me of. I want to say it's very similar to cinema yet somewhere in there I'm getting a Nutty smell like Sensi Armani. So if you like both of those fragrances this is on the same lines.,12/09/19 13:12,perfumeaddiction
L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I purchased this online by accident. I thought I was buying the regular Kenzo Amour.

At first spray I was so disappointed. The opening is horrible, stale, sharp and acrid. I don't think the tea and bitter orange go well together. Luckily that stage only lasts about 15 minutes and you are left with a lovely creamy, soft, floral vanilla.

On me it has moderate lasting power and light sillage. I like it but it's not a love. The bottle is stunning.",09/18/18 11:44,kimberly_j16
L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Definitely shares some DNA with Kenzo Amour EDP....but is lighter and fresher (thank you Peony!!) and just a bit more floral, which is fine for this time of year. I get a lot of tea/vanilla/bergamot with a musky vanilla drydown. The peony shines in there throughout, fresh and clean and bright, but never overpowering or sharp. All in all, a very beautiful composition. The bottle is gorgeous as well, of course. Different enough from the original EDP to own both, in my opinion.",07/17/18 12:22,Lipglossjunkee
L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,The top notes are awful on me. It's unpleasantly sharp with obtrusive floral. It drys down a little softer but the bitterness is still there. I'm starting to think I really don't like peony. I agree it's similar to Cinema which I also thought was awful. Both are much too sharp and floral for me.,12/18/16 00:29,blake.lee
L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This flanker of amour is extremely lovely!
Not that much similar to it's procedure,it's cozy and a lovely vanilla,tea combo but much brighter and wearable all around year
It opens with uplifting citrus and tea notes,it has the lovely freshness of these notes but not the expected sharpness.vanilla and musk hug this citrus tea and make the overall combination rounder,warmer and deeper..there are also pretty floral notes,dominant bright frangipani,ylang-ylang and some peony blended perfectly with other notes
Kenzo l'eau amour has all features I love in a fragrance,it's fresh,feminine,smooth and cozy.it's versatile and smells pretty.it's very balanced and bottle is adorable .vanilla is used artistically here,it makes all this sharp notes soft and smooth and prevents the combination to become a very light summery scent.indeed both longevity and sillage are good and acceptable
Although it's wearable year round,IMO it's perfect for late summer,early fall.because of it's sunny fresh fluffy feeling,very relaxing
Kenzo has some great fragrances and this is One of them

Comforting, subtle and not over-whelming at all. The only downside is that it might be too ordinary.
Still nice enough and worth a try.",07/07/15 12:37,ScarlettX
L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I love the bottle for this fragrance it is so pretty and so is the juice inside it! Kenzo Amour L’eau opens up with a smooth bright citruses and gently fades into one of the best tea notes I have ever smelled in a fragrance! It is fresh but still a little heavy because of the musk and a tiny bit of vanilla. I think I also pick up on peony and tiny bit of ylang ylang which blend perfectly with the tea. On my skin the tea note manages to linger on my skin until it reaches the drydown which took about 4-5 hours. The drydown is simple but still lovely a blend of vanilla and musk light and still fresh. This has great lasting power, I got 8+ hours out of it and considering that it is an EDT I thought that was impressive, but it was never too heavy in the heat. It might as well be summer already where I live it been pretty hot this last couple of weeks.

Somehow Kenzo fragrances allow for notes that I usually can not stand to become wearable such as tea which usually gives me an instant headache and violets. They are almost like miracles for me haha. I’m glad to have the perfume in my collection I find that it’s a great scent for summer, but I am sure I can wear it all year long without a problem.

I also have to thank Vie Café for introducing me to this lovely fragrance I would have never found it if she had never mentioned that I would most likely enjoy it. She was right I totally love it! <3",06/06/13 19:37,yuugainotenshi

L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I know this is intended to be a summer scent, but after testing it in both cold weather and in hot weather, I actually prefer it in cold weather, where the base notes seem to be more prominent!

In the heat, there is something about this scent that is very green and sharp. I think it is a combination of the green tea, bitter orange and ylang ylang. The peony is also clearly detectable, but the base notes feel completely overshadowed.

In winter, it's a bit creamier. The peony is still detectable, but the composition feels more balanced on my skin.

Overall, though, it's a very sheer skin-scent, and maybe a tad too floral for me in the end.",10/14/11 17:11,Jillzilla

L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Just got it in the mail today. The bottle is stunning, the picture does not makes it justice!

I like the fragrance, in my opinion it is Amour that is more suitable for the spring/summer - like Amour in love :)

It's more lightheaded than Amour but still you can definitely feel the original fragrance in the background – as if you layered Amour with something citrusy. On me the staying power is not bad and so is the sillage.

Not sure it is full bottle worthy if you already own Amour, but I'm crazy for Kenzo fragrances, so now I'm a proud owner!

Update: swapped it. Always prefered to wear the original over it...",02/16/11 16:15,Anna_gr
L'Eau de Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Why does this bottle has to be so big, but so pretty!?

Because for the juice inside, I would not háve to have it. Still, it's a nice fragrance:
the original amour sure comes trough, with it's ricey smooth -not too sweet- vanilla. The big difference is that this l'eau has a orange in the opening added, and a frangipani/peony heart, which make it appeal more fruity. It is less dreamy and cosy than the original, l'eau is a bit more uplifting and awake. Like a breeze of sunlight (if sunlight would be like air). But still, there is that creaminess like in the original which makes l'eau a comfortable fragrance too. The silleage is good, but the staying power is worse than the original's. All in all, I wouldn't say l'eau -as the name would assume- is more acquatic, watery or light. It's just more bright! And probably more suitable for summer then it's mother.

PS: Personally, I prefer 'the mother'.",02/16/11 10:13,melia

Soleil Thé Kenzo,"This fragrance centers around a powdery iris, but what truly stands out is the strong presence of ginseng.

There’s indeed a distinct sunscreen-like impression here, likely from the soft, powdery iris combined with the clean, comforting white musk and the warm ginseng - or perhaps from some unannounced ylang-ylang.

However, the overpowering ginseng cuts through this softness with its sharp, almost spicy edge.

In the end, it’s an ok scent, but the imbalance keeps it from being truly memorable.",06/10/25 02:25,Saveria
Soleil Thé Kenzo,"The note is very deceptive - as many have said, it smells like a very sweet “sunscreen” scent. It's not powdery, but rather a coconut+frangipani+watery+balsamic scent composition.",01/07/25 06:45,Mez0Nez
Soleil Thé Kenzo,"It smells like s sophisticated day in beach. It has that ""sunny"" or ""solar cream"" smell, bit in a very faint or delicate way. The tea note is not as strong as it is on other tea perfumes. It blends so well with the iris.
There is no frangipani listed, but that is the vive of this perfume. Definetively ""Soleil"" is a good name for it. So bright in a peaceful way.
Projection and sillage are quite weak, still, it is very unique and beautiful.",06/14/24 22:51,Baileys
Soleil Thé Kenzo,"A lovely iris powdery fragrance. It has a slight make-upy feel (as is often the case with iris fragrances), but it's not too vintage; it's the green tea that gives it a lovely Asian twist. I didn't understand the choice of its name (""Soleil The"" which means Sun-Tea) until I realized that it leaves behind a pleasant solar trail - which is surprising without the presence of tiare/coconut/monoi/ylang/jasmine!

Soleil Thé Kenzo,"I love Kenzo Memori Collection, stole my heart with these beautiful relaxing and soothing fragrances🤍 Nuit Tatami is my instant crush and Soleil Thé comes afterwards. Soleil Thé means Sun Tea and i find it really happy and sunny as its name☀️ Though the notes don’t include any yellow or sweet fragrant flowers i do clearly get mimosa and maybe some honeysuckle flavours🌼 It has iris which leads the fragrance from the beginning until the end, ginseng, tea and white musk are the remaining notes. This yellow flowery, let’s call it mimosa feeling gives a bright vibe like a warming effect of the rising sun. Pulls the fragrance to the breezy side. Here you may find iris powdery and creamy instead of reflecting cold and distant energy of its own. Soleil Thé is soft, airy but bright and a happy member of this collection✨",01/23/24 13:06,GREENGREENLADY
Soleil Thé Kenzo,"The beginning is promising: Magnolia and sunny powdery cloud. But then things do not go the way I expected :( Baby powder, johnson & johnson baby oil, Nivea cream + rice powder and Matcha tea. Not the kind of powderiness you'd normally get from Iris. A bit itchy Musk that dominates a bigger part of the fragrance.

Soleil Thé Kenzo,"I had half an hour to sample the whole line represented and though several new Kenzo Memori started promising, the best drydown on blotter belonged to this one. Hence - the bottle.
Definetely soleil - whatever we usually mean by it - light, airy, slightly mineral, but not salty. Soft and ligtly creamy it feels suitable for a skin care line.
Reminiscent of Sunflowers by E. Arden and Memories by Gucci. I found longevity and sillage not very prominent yet and pair it with Eau de Soleil Blanc by TF, now the combo is longlasting and nice.

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Femme Kenzo,"Gross typical fruitchouli. Yes, it's got a distinct apple note and the florals are a bit fresher than some others, but it's still a fruitchouli, so when I wear it I smell like a perfume store that only carries the very most basic and crowd pleasing scents and sprays them all every hour on the hour in an attempt to showcase their wares. If I wanted to smell like Angel, La Vie Est Belle, and Coco Mademoiselle somehow all had a baby with an apple, I would...well I wouldn't.",07/16/23 21:02,Pachida
L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Femme Kenzo,"Review is for my own reference - I am pleasantly surprised by this scent! The other Kenzo scents I've tried are too floral for me, but this smell like fresh sweet (fruit vs. candy sweet) and peppery to me (not as good as PR Black XS though), and maybe a bit aquatic. The package says this is a Gourmand Floral, which I would agree with, Fragrantica has it as a fruity floral. I think this might be too cloying in the humid summer months, but great for daytime the rest of the year. I think this is a unisex crowd pleaser, a wide range of ages could wear this. Someone mentioned that it smells a bit like walking past a BBW, but in a non- cloying way and I would have to a agree. This would make a nice candle scent too. It is a stronger scent with a decent silage. straight from the sachet its fruity sweet. left on the skin for a bit it smells a bit more floral pepper.
Unfortunately, the sample that I got was not in a mini spray bottle, but in a sachet like a moisturizer sample. I wish I could have a bottle to try multiple times. I'm assuming if you sprayed too much you would get a headache. The red apple smells nice in this scent, I wonder if there is a DKNY similar scent?

I strongly disagree that this smells like La Vie Est Belle by Lancome. This is less intense and more fresh sweet, where as LVEB is richer and less fresh. It also does not smell Missoni Missoni EDT!

I really like it, almost love. but there are other fragrances I want to buy. I would keep if gifted. The price is okay too at about $55 for 100ml on discount sites. I think this would have to be one of my favorite fresh fruity floral smells.

Edit: as it's dried down for about an hour it smells a bit smoky and meaty. Maybe that's the earthiness? Not super gross, but not really pleasant for a femme perfume. I don't think I've had a perfume that changed that much on my skin before. Usually, complex scents will go from sickly sweet to a warm caramel sweet. but this went from sweet to smoked wood. Again this makes it lean more unisex. A bit disappointed by the end scent, I wish it stayed sweeter, but it does piqué my interest as a scent.

A few more hours have gone by and it smells a bit sweeter and smokey.

The smokiness of this scent reminds me of Dior Poison Girl.",07/22/21 22:51,natasha28

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Femme Kenzo,"Wearing a sample of this as I type this review and I have to say I do like the scent but it's a bit too feminine for me. Not something I'd wear because frankly it screams preppy bubbly woman in a sundress on a warm afternoon or high school girl who oversprayed her bodyspray. Anyone else remember that era around 96-2000 when every girl left an absurb trail of cheap bodyspray throughout the hallways? Not the aura I'd want to give off as a 6' dude who's into spooky stuff and metal, but hey it still smells fresh and nice. Very sweet, fruity and floral, reminds me of fancy lotion or bodywash you'd find at a place like Sephora or Lush. Okay maybe there's a slight ""walking passed a Bath and Body Works in a mall circa 2000"" smell too but it's not that cloying. I could see this one being offensive to people though as it IS strong and projects hard. Up close it's almost too much.",06/18/21 09:31,CreepyKid
L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Femme Kenzo,"This is not just another flirty fruitchouli of the decade, but way more than that. Sharing almost no similarities and/or common DNA with the original L'Eau, this fragrance could be a strong player on its own (and perhaps that way would be less overlooked).

It opens with ripe yet fresh and sharp, almost metallic and cold apple notes, which never gets tart, juicy or overly sweet. Instantly patchouli comes into play - soil like, but not dirty and very cold. Like loose soil holding some frozen water droplets in the shape of small ice crystals. Some peony and lotus gives soft fresh floral nuances making L'Eau Kenzo Intense more wearable. After some three hours the scent turns more woody. Also some resinous warmth is detectable (like ambra or benzoin), but it is still very patchouli heavy.

This perfume lasts up to ten hours with moderate sillage; however with heavy spraying heavy sillage could be achieved. Cooler and colder weather, day and night appropriate, unisex.",09/08/20 06:55,Liene

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Femme Kenzo,"It smells pleasant and fruity-generic (aka boring) for the first half hour or so, but then it blooms, and smells so irresistibly pretty!! I couldn't stop sniffing myself after, and the scent stayed all day. The 'vibe' I get from this is a cross between Miss Dior Cherie 2005 and original L'eau Par Kenzo. It's sweet, warm and optimistic, but also clean, chic and very feminine. Definitely 'spring-y'! But I would wear it all year round. The patchouli here is clean, and it's not too sweet, so it could work in summer too (maybe not when it's really hot out). I personally didn't get apples right off the bat, just a rich, happiness-inducing fruity-floral with refreshing watery nuances to tame the sweetness...that L'eau Par Kenzo DNA in this scent stops it from veering towards sticky-syrupy territory. A youthful aroma, but not juvenile...for those over 25, yes, it's grown-up enough for the office or general everyday wear for sure. It doesn't really smell like any other fragrance out there, though it might remind you of a few. Sillage is alluring, and longevity is 7 hours +.",05/10/18 22:35,marialena888m

Opens with a burst of very sweet apples. That's pretty much all I can smell at first. Unfortunately I find these apples quite generic to be honest.
I expected something else after the drydown but the apples still stay the most prominent. I get a bit of lotus and quite nice patchouli undertone.

The scent itself is overwhelming for me and way too sweet. On the other hand its quite unique fruity fragrance I have to admit.

L'Eau Kenzo Intense pour Femme Kenzo,"There's a strong linden blossom note in the top - it's juicy, sweet and deep - though it's probably a combination of lily and apple. I like the fragrance so far, but it's completely different from other Kenzo L'Eau incarnations.",03/19/15 06:49,MademoiselleMaya
Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,"Felt like a prayer and blessing on the skin, like a very intimate caress. Very sad about it being discontinued, it was the first tea fragrance I loved",12/05/24 13:58,Nocturna13
Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,"One of the first fragrances in my collection. Til this day, I will never understand why Kenzo discontinued this fragrance. It smells like citrus green tea. I would consider this a unisex fragrance. However, it leans feminine, because of the drydown, where the powder engulfs the entire fragrance. Hence, the reason it's marketed for women. I like the scent, but I wouldn't buy it again because of the dry down.

If Kenzo brings the scent back, hopefully it's reformulated for a more masculine scent, because I like the citrus, floral, tea opening and middle, but that drydown is not for me, lol. It smells like a woman's powder.

BUT DO NOT let my review influence your buy. Assess it yourself and have your own thoughts, rather than strictly going off someone else's thoughts and opinions. If you can, I suggest getting a sample first…or looking up the notes to ensure you will like it. Read reviews before buying a fragrance, but take them with a grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinion regarding smells. IF you do buy it, enjoy it :-)",06/03/21 12:16,donshan123

Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,"This is a very nice fragrance, powdery tea scent that makes me relax and refresh...got many compliments. Projection is moderate, but the longevity is quite good on my body (8-9 hours). This one would be my new fave for fresh fragrances.",05/08/14 00:51,an.jorePipip
Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,"This is a scent that comes from a really interesting line- very low key, clean, crisps scents that are very appropriate for every day wear, office, school, hospital, you name it.

Eau de Fleur de Thé is perhaps the most unisex out of them all. It would work on both men and women; I do not find it particularly 'tea-ish', it is citrusy and musky above all and not sweet. I am drinking tea as I write this little review and definitely I can detect tea in my glass, but not in the perfume bottle or on my wrist.

It is not a scent you can write paragraphs about, as it is simple and straight forward, so I can just end with a recommendation to try it if you like brisk, energizing scents that are not too loud or sweet.",01/19/14 06:55,Migotka
Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,"It says tea on the label and green tea is what you get. The musk note is pretty subdued and instead it's a very linear green tea scent with moderate projection.

And it works as unisex fragrance. I've worn this in contrast to Kenzo Tokyo, which takes the green tea and adds red peppercorn and ginger, but the tea notes are suprisingly similar. Out of the two, I'd prefer this for its longivety and the fact that it is so linear.",04/21/13 05:07,Doktor Gott
Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,"a little bit of citrus in the opening and then just plain tea, not green or white but more like regular tea bags.

Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,"I feel is so strong, so citric, almost masculine; but I love tea and I wear this when don't care show me little feminine. Is not for girly girls. Is for independent girls.

Eau De Fleur de Thé Kenzo,It smells like a combination of Bulgari's White Tea and Green Tea fragrances. I can actually recommend this as unisex.

Kashaya Kenzo,"In one word-retro.I dont mean it in a bad way,just saying the obvious.I like vintages ,i adore them actually,but i just spray them at home on my wrist to enjoy them by myslef.I blind bought it today hoping it will be from these wearable 90's scents ,but this is not a good one for me to spray it on and go in public.I will try it in the warmer weather,i think it will be sweeter then and the retro carnation will be mellow and not so spicy .By the way on me it smell extremely close to Sun moon stars.The dry down is like a vintage lipstick smell .Nice ...",01/21/25 05:05,reborn
Kashaya Kenzo,"I had never heard of Kashaya before - even though I have always loved Kenzo’s fragrances. But then I stumbled upon it, when I was looking for another fragrance from Kenzo. Apparently, it seems like it is actually discontinued. And so I fell for another blind buy. Again.
I was a little bit nervous about that - I don’t want to waste my money on something really odd.
But I am really pleased! To me, this is a quite unusual fragrance. It is fruity, but not very tart, nor childish. Not sharp or too strong. The fruitiness combined with the creamy and powdery softness is really special. I could have survived without this new purchase - but I am glad to have it!",09/17/24 13:54,Miasha
Kashaya Kenzo,"Kashâya... its name means emotion and desire...

The first note offers us a fresh side with a beautiful citrus scent. But very quickly the juice transforms into something much more sensual, woody and amber. Jasmine - heady - and peach - powerful and enveloping - take hold. The vanilla is not far away and takes place, discreetly.

The end result is a carnal, torrid, oriental and at the same time airy, fresh, light fragrance. Incomprehensible? But nevertheless true.

Perfumes like this have become difficult to find in classic perfumeries and perhaps they're not even unanimous among those who know them. But I eagerly ask for more!",02/27/24 05:02,Saveria
Kashaya Kenzo,"I remember Kashaya from '90ties as a happy, joyos, bold scent.One year I gave my mother a giftbox of this consisting also the bodylotion and it suited her so perfectly. So, one day I was browsing the internet and googled Kashaya and bling! found a page and ordered it immediately, big bottle 75ml for 68euros. And yes, this is still a beauty, I recall the precious moments with mama and I'm so touched by the memories. My hubby likes this one very much, very feminine scent so I'm happy that I bought this. Oh boy I feel so nostalgic...",12/21/22 03:53,lemmenkukka

Kashaya Kenzo,"Fragrance that is pleasant, bright, joyful, and highly energetic It always makes me feel good. I'm captivated by the intriguing fruity opening, exquisite floral centre, and benzoin-sandalwood oriental base. Longevity and silage are both superb. It's the oddest combination of creamy richness and dazzling airiness. Unique. It's very magical. It's gentle and sweet. It smells iridescent, nacreous, and wonderful to me. enthralling, with a lovely fragrance When I wore this to work, I always had praises and compliments.",11/07/22 05:17,abbieclark67
Kashaya Kenzo,"Weird on my skin. First impression was like I smell acrylic paint that in 15 minutes changed into an apricot body creme. After 2 days of tests and attempts to understand this perfume it started to sound more sweet (kinda like Dior Dolce Vita sweetness). Comfortable scent,but nothing special. Longetivity 1 hour max.
Update: after spraying on the cloth it lasts all day long. Sounds like opaque oily waxy apricots. Weird, but still comfortable. Finished my 5ml tester. Will not buy again.",10/09/21 06:07,neonaya
Kashaya Kenzo,"The full bottle of this honeyed beauty found me through blind swap, and it was absolutely delicious surprise! I've kept it since last November to wear now - in mid-August heat - just wow! All jammy, slightly honeyed and syrupy apricots and peaches are in the forefront. Its quite complex, like 80s and 90s such scents are, with supporting variety of florals, yet completely unique imo as fruits are jammy and strong, really edible. And its not actually old-fashioned or classic the slightest, but instead joyful, playful and opulent.

Bold, but friendly, warm with benzoin giving boozy sweetness to the base. I actually wore it a bit in winter for lifting my moods, but it opens up much better right now - comes out more rounded. I smell spring florals (narcissus) and y-y in it, that add freshness and a touch of fresh dampness to balance the honeyed sweetness. And pineapple adds a touch of acid...

I'm not very familiar with lots of Sophia Grojsman creations, but I can see some similarity with what I know: Eternity, Vanderbilt, Sun Moon Stars, Tresor and now also with famous Champagne later named Yvresse that a very kind perfumista sent over to sample blindly. Its a lot about vibe- there is undoubtedly smth like Grojsman vibe in these... Kashaya does not have super sillage or super longevity but whilst its there for a few hours, its incredibly voluptuous and delicious. And who could also resist this beautiful crazy sunny bottle fitting for forest elves? :)",08/12/21 11:27,katariina9

Kashaya Kenzo,"Finally I got my hands on Kashaya!!! I have been sniffing it and sniffing it again and again in the shops, when I was young woman, but than I never could afford to buy it, but now, the children are adults, the dogs are in heaven, and, I quitted smoking 11 years ago,

so, it was time for me and Kashaya, and of cause I love Kenzo, and the japanese komposer Kitaro (I have a LOT of cd's!!!) Kashaya is for me the spirit of Japan, it's clean, tidy, just right amount, I want to travel to Japan, and visit it's gardens, smelling their flowers, eating their food, walking on old roads, drinking tea, se mt. Fidji, visit Tokyos most famous zebra cross-road,

with Kashaya, I first smell the apricot, which is why I love it so very much, than there is the flowers, and all the spices, this juice is intoxicating, and I am waiting for the mothership to come and get me .....

12/10 points. Fits enyone, everywhere. Happy Easter to all of you :))",03/29/21 15:43,Mona Lygre
Kashaya Kenzo,"I blind-bought this based on the exciting reviews here. But I'm disappointed. There's a bold synthetic note in Kashaya that evokes the sweet-plastic scent of a latex birthday balloon; it's overpowering and unpleasant. Once it dried down on my skin, however, what's left is very pleasant, soft, creamy floral that's very close to the skin. 6/10",01/28/21 20:59,LionsTigersBearsOhMy
Kashaya Kenzo,"This is delightful. At first sniff I immediately started comparing it to other fruity florals of the 90s. It has less spice than Dolce Vita, less cedar than Chanel Allure, is not as syrupy and heavy as Tresor, and not as loud and overbearing as Amarige. Yvresse is another one but it's too long since I've smelled it for me to comment.

For me it's much more wearable than any of those. Where Kashaya makes a contribution is firstly that it includes a deliberately artificial accord that is so characteristic of Kenzo fragrances. And secondly, its sillage and longevity are surprisingly moderate. It's as if Grojsman was asked to apply some Japanese restraint to her normally florid style.

With all those heavy hitters on the market I can see why Kashaya struggled a bit and, as a reviewer on Basenotes expressed it, 'drifted into obscurity'. It can still be found in a few places online.

The bottle is fabulous, pictures don't do it justice. It reminds me of amber-coloured Depression glass. Love it.",10/16/20 18:58,Annemarie

Kashaya Kenzo,I really like this because I love peach/apricot but unfortunately it lasts rather poorly on me and I have to keep respraying throughout the day. I won't be repurchasing. I much prefer Ted Lapidus Fantasme which has the peachy apricot fruity sweetness that I'm craving with much better sillage and lasting power for a better price.,05/16/20 13:05,juniemoon
Kashaya Kenzo,It smells like very high quality body cream to me and that's awesome if you like creamy frags. It's very suitable for office wear and I'm sure everyone will compliment how femininely beautiful you smell. It has a lot of notes but it's very hard to tell them distinctively as a amateur fraghead. Overall very pretty scent that will make everyone happy.,02/21/20 05:37,ayşenur.sevinç

Kashaya Kenzo,"I was looking for a talisman, or rather a fragrance to wear as a lucky charm on tough days.
I happened to come across Kashaya in an old stamp shop, and bought it straightaway without the chance to try it, with the feeling that I had almost certainly read something positive about it just a short time before.

I consider it a privilege to have in my hands such a good luck charm, this (masterly) blend of hiacynth, pineapple, carnation and apricot-in-syrup_like.
Kashaya has a delicious, contemporary spirit that kidnapped me and always will, I think.
Let me suggest you try it.

The skillful combination is soft and warm, and make for a charming, feminine perfume. Sillage and lasting power are average.
The bottle has an unusual shape, like so many Kenzo frags. Even the box is decorative with leaves on the inner flaps.",03/15/19 10:51,Phantomias
Kashaya Kenzo,"Kashaya is a first class Floriental and another hit for perfumer/creative nose Sophia Grojsman hands down the best in the business. In '93, this was a luxurious and well made fruity floral. I remember smelling this on some of my teachers in school. My 5th grade teacher wore this all the time and also alternated this scent with Sun Moon and Stars. Fruits in this fragrance include apricot, peach, bergamot and pineapple. The peach and apricot combo is very intense, but I love peachy scents in fragrances so this was a good thing. Flowers in this fragrance include orchid, rose, narcissus, orange blossom, jasmine and ylang-ylang. There is no way you can overlook these flowers. The Oriental touch of sandalwood is strong here as well. There is a vanillic base and amber. This is strong stuff. I remember smelling it on my teacher even after she had left the classroom. I have enjoyed wearing this in summer time when the fragrance really stands out. Beautiful.",01/15/16 17:09,Gigi The Fashionista

Kashaya Kenzo,"I got this today in a blind swap. Beautiful box, beautiful bottle. I put it on my wrist, one spray. In the beginning it smelled like urine. I am not kidding, I was sniffing it and thinking ""what have you done?"". this lasted maybe five minutes. Then it turned into an old school perfume, something like maybe Ungaro Diva. I thought to myself ""ok, I can deal with that even though I am not much into such thing lately"". this lasted about 30 minutes.
And then it developed into a soft, creamy vanilla-like gentle cloud that you just want to sniff and sniff and sniff some more. It's been 10 hours since I sprayed it, I can still sniff a little on my wrist where I put this one spray.
I think it's perfect for the fall-winter, very happy, I think it will be great with real wear, like my usual three sprays on sides of my neck and chest. Should last the whole day and it is probably easy to get over this weird urine opening if you know what lies ahead.
If I would look for a comparison, the only one I can come up with is Ted Lapidus Silk Way which I also love.",10/09/15 21:44,julmax
Kashaya Kenzo,"I just love this fragrance. It is sweet without being overbearing and floral without any single note taking control. Add to that this amazing bottle, which is in and of itself a work of are with the iridescence that can only be seen in daylight, and the wonderfully detailed glass work on the bottle itself. If anyone doesn't like it and wants to remove it from their home, I'll happily take it from you...",08/03/15 21:55,katyas
Kashaya Kenzo,"This has Sophia Grosman written all over it, and to me that's wonderful. Like Paris and Champagne (Yvresse) it's happy, bright, joyous. I couldn't wear this and not feel at least a little uplifted. I don't think it ""smells like Tresor"" but it shares the same DNA, with the interesting fruity opening, lovely floral heart and benzoin-sandalwood oriental base. The moment I smelled it I recognized it as a child of Grosman, and there's no doubt it's a sibling to Tresor, Paris, Yvresse - but I wouldn't confuse it with any of those or any other fragrance for a second now that I've sniffed it.

Longevity is excellent and sillage it great. The first word that comes to my mind with Kashaya though is ""radiant"". It's one of those perfumes that will continue all day to periodically waft up to you if you have it on a test strip on your desk. Spray it in a room, walk out, close the door then return a bit later (or a good deal later even) and it's there, not in a huge heavy fog cloud but brightly and surely.

Generic is the last thing I would call Kenzo Kashaya.",07/28/15 12:17,theladymay
Kashaya Kenzo,"Blind buy.....Everyone is correct....it's an odd perfume, not bad and not awesome but interesting.

Kashaya Kenzo,"Ιt surprises me to read that Kashaya smells generic. To me it is very original. And very unique. I cannot think of any other perfume that smells similar. It is a very nice perfume for autumn or light winter. Creamy and powdery and sweet. I always got compliments when I was wearing this at my work. Once my roomate borrowed it, and her then boyfriend went crazy for it.",09/14/14 10:51,Bublegum
Kashaya Kenzo,"It is the strangest mix of creamy opulence and shimmering airiness. There's no other perfume I can think of that occupies its spectrum in such a way. Unique. I can't account for the fact I love this so much, given its sweetness. I guess there are these little windows of opportunity for new things to wriggle in and become part of us, heart and soul. I think Kashaya got in just after Kenzo and around the same time as Casmir. Kind of a perfume ddos attack, a gang assault. Anyway I am very glad. It's magical. It's tender and kind. The bottle shape and colour are hugely influential in my experience of the fragrance. To me it smells iridescent, nacreous, in a lovely way. This also is unaccountable ['carnival glass?', part of me is declaiming; 'PEACH-toned carnival glass???']. but I completely cherish it. I think for me the whole experience transcends or evades questions of 'taste' and just penetrates to the vital 'soul' [I'm a heathen] within.

Kashaya Kenzo,"Oh, so many memories about Kashaya! It was signature for a friend at college and it suited her very well.
For me I couldn't wear it easily because I found it very chaotic and too plastic sweet.
I think that this burned plastic vibe for Kenzo started there. After Kashaya all Kenzo's fragrances have that cloying disgusting edge taken to an extreme revolting with Kenzo Flower.
In spite of the burned plastic vanilla Kashaya was a very lovely, romantic, seducing and longlasting.
It was very original, too at that time. Nothing smelled like Kashaya! I owned several samples and I wore them till their end, but it was never signature fragrance for me.
Now it is discontinued and Kenzo keeps throwing fragrances on market as if they did nothing else in life.
It would be better to have Kashaya back instead of many new launches.

My perception of Kashaya is what it is supposed to be: relaxing, comforting and mind and body wrapping perfume. I can use it whenever I need or want to be totally tranquil. Sillage is decent too.

Kashaya Kenzo,"Mmmm, a wonderful scent. Like a bashful wallflower waiting to be discovered, freed from the shell and be appreciated and admired for all what he/she has to give.
On my skin it is all about the drydown, which comes rather quickly.

It opens with notes very similar to Elnette hairspray, at least how that smelled in the 80's (maybe the carnations and hiacynths shining through or that the bottle is turning?. I also get that smell and association with the opening of Youth Dew Amber Nude, but way longer time).

However, this fades quickly within half an hour and what is left is rich, soft, peachy, sweet, warm and creamy. I also smell banana and sometimes a little woodiness.
I'm not sure how to write but I experience it like a very moist ripe fruit but at the same time it is dry. It is quite linear on my skin during the day but I still find it interesting.
The sandalwood seems to be a surprise ingredient, some days I smell it clearly and some days not, anyway it just morphs the perfume into another version, still as beautiful as its sibling. It could well be in the background counting for that slight driness I experience, but it is just a guess. The woodiness yes.
Also, I find it well balanced, according to my preferences when I'm in the mood for something a little sweeter.
It holds for almost 8 hours, after that there are hints of vanilla left. The sillage is quite good but not offensive, if I were to smell it on someone else I would really like to know what it is.

Remind me to thank my father for his christmas gift to my mother many years ago, otherwise I would not have known that such a gem exists. I didn't appreciate it back then, but have done for some time now.
Maybe this one should be kept as a secret?",09/04/11 07:17,Lingonberry

this have been one of my fawourites now about 16 years. And still this is so Unique, Beautifull and sweet oriental scent. I have no bad word for this Perfume. I used to be known by this scent. This is one of my Firsts. And still Loving it. For me this Scent is truly eternal Love- Kashaya.",04/16/11 06:32,kosmoskukka
Kashaya Kenzo,"For some reason the opening of Kenzo KASHAYA smells simultaneously animalic and plast-icky to me. Very thick and impenetrable, this composition makes me feel slightly uncomfortable to wear but without quite attaining the status of scrubber.

As it dries down, KASHAYA becomes somewhat more bearable, but it takes some time to get there, and it's never really a joy for me to wear. The bottle is totally unique, but the perfume seems to me a sort of hodge-podge of any number of other Sophia Grojsman creations, although I should say that I myself do not smell anything even vaguely approaching TRESOR here. Not for me.",03/01/11 12:43,sherapop
Kashaya Kenzo,"Kashaya is more of an oriental gourmand with the sweet fruit ( apricot, peach ) overriding the flowers. Very nicely done and does bear a similarity to Tresor as others have noticed! It is an old school gourmand, different from the usual, so I would advise a skin test to see if it's up your alley..Kashaya is borderline too sweet but is softened by a rice note and dries down close to the skin. I can detect some jasmine and rose but no tuberose- the flowers are pretty muted here anyway. A very comforting scent which dries down clean and soft.",01/31/11 21:40,adele l
Kashaya Kenzo,"It was a long time ago I had this perfume. When looking at it a lot of good memories come back. This was my partyperfum in the -90. I had two favourites then Kashaya by Kenzo and Vanderbildt by Gloria Vanderbildt. Both of them strong and loud, but very nice scents to wear. Longlasting too..If I find a bottle I will buy it again.",12/23/10 23:02,Mooniq
Kashaya Kenzo,Yes Harlequin they have certainly some notes in common!! Indeed Kashaya being a bit more creamy and Sira des Indes a bit more fruity oriental to my nose!,11/30/10 09:31,Action
Kashaya Kenzo,"You wouldn't guess it from the notes, but Kashaya is almost identical to Sira des Indes on me - and I literally mean barely distinguishable (even after a week of testing). And yet Kashaya is so well-loved by the members, while Sira des Indes is so not.... weird. (I guess the qualifier ""on me"" must play the major role here.)

Well yeah, Kashaya is a bit more complex + balanced, a touch creamier + subdued, but only when I tell myself it must be so by staring at the notes long enough. Or it could just be the difference between the EdT (Kashaya) and the EdP (Sira). Otherwise, both smell like fruity-creamy ylang-ylang domination - and since I'm hopelessly addicted to the ylang, I could get olfactorily drunk on either one of these, equally happily.",11/30/10 09:19,harlequin1572
Kashaya Kenzo,"AMAZING perfume!!! I couldn't agree more with the opening review of Zoka and couldn't have said it better!:

'I love this perfume. It is really rich scent, very interesting opening with fruits and fantastic floral heart and long lasting oriental base. It is really masterpiece compared to banal fragrances that are more and more common every day'",11/18/10 01:02,Action
Kashaya Kenzo,"I had Kashaya delivered to my doorstop today.
Very excited, as not sniffed it before,knowing that Kenzo is one of my loves for most fumes they have , except for the flowery ones, and then I sprayed it on.....and I thought Oh no, what on earth have I bought.....!!!!
Giving that I am a very fair person, I cried a little...lol...then 10 minutes later I was in awe....... Yay for Kashaya...I am in Love....
Kashaya is really warm, soft squashed fruity aroma, sensual flowery, touches of vanilla, musky and bits of woods thrown in.
Is actually quite rightly a heavenly scent... Love it...xx",11/17/10 02:15,skitten
Kashaya Kenzo,"I agree totally with Nyoka, I just cannot understand why people do not love this. It is so smooth and comfy, it actually is a gourmand, without the typical gourmand notes. The mixture of sweet fruit and soft flowers has been done so well, that is feels like a gourmand shawl to me. I love it!",10/28/10 09:35,Action
Kashaya Kenzo,"Thanks to anorton,I am the owner of this beautiful scent.IT is more about what it isnt than what it is.IT isnt loud,sickly sweet,knock u down in ur face.Instead its Not heavy,but lasts,Very comfortable to wear,and fruity enough to b fresh,light and exciting.THese r exotic fruits that take u to far away lands.It takes u on a journey through,jasmine wrapped tuberose orchid beds of almost magical flowers.as u enjoy all these pleasures u become aware of a slight touch of amber and musk with some vanilla added to give it the spice.Beautiful scent.beautiful bottle.",07/17/10 13:00,nyoka

Kashaya Kenzo,"I don't understand the rating on this one! It is such an elegant perfume!! For all you gourmand lovers and Orchid addicts, a real must have in my opinion!!!",12/29/09 01:55,Action
Kashaya Kenzo,"This is a rich floriental that I would happily wear if I received a bottle for free-the ylang ylang, tuberose, jasmine and orange blossom all have such sweet heavy nectar alone, that I could feel like a queen with a fantastic garden cultivated just for me wearing these nectars-but with Kashaya peach and apricot and mandarins are being held right under my nose, and the garden is heady in the heat of this fragrance...
The anise creates a nice effect before reaching the royal dry down-and all the while, with the flowers, the fruit, the spice, I smell toasted rice with vanilla and amber. This is peculiar and definitely pleasant if you love sweet scents with a hint of resin with your vanilla-If you like heady flowers, you might like this one....I have a love/hate relationship with sweet scents-and no floriental will ever replace my Accenti-but this is not bad at all.
The bottle is almost gorgeous, and kind of ugly...Quite surreal. But it is a heart, and it fits the ""eternal love"" theme perfectly. Although I am not in love with this fragrance, I might want it someday, certainly for the unique (or disturbing) flacon.",12/04/09 18:22,kastehelmi
Kashaya Kenzo,Gentle oriental. Oldfashioned and gracefull. Soft and quiet. Similarities with Tresor.,11/19/09 03:04,Tarya
Kashaya Kenzo,"I was searching for something to put on at night, just before bed. I wanted something mild, not overly stimulating.
This is perfect for late evenings, after a shower. While complex, this perfume is not pungent, it speaks volumes with just it's whispers, and it is perfect for a relaxing, gentle scent. It's very mild and so light that it's barely there, but when you do catch breaths of the scent, it's articulate as a long poem or great novel, and creative and colorful like a Monet..with all the little strokes colors and notes blending and seeping around the edges, but each still visible, recognizeable, as individual droplets of paint and scent, yet all forming a beatuiful scene. I particularly enjoyed the bergamot, anise, ylang ylang, and strong benzoin and amber. It doesn't last long on the skin, you must catch it before it fades, appreciate the few moments of pleasure it bestows.",10/18/09 10:00,Aalia
Kashaya Kenzo,"I love Kashaya. It reminds me of a golden autumn - the smell of dry leafs under your feet on a sunny September day, the smell of dried summer fruits (pears, apples and berries) and dried flowers.
I would call this fragrance nostalgic, warm, very calm, somehow relaxing and with a presentiment of a sunny autumn in the bottle. Try it, there's a chance you might love it too!",06/17/09 04:04,F_A
Kashaya Kenzo,"This could have been a great scent, really. Instead it's a concoction of notes without any care, it's so messy (same applies to the bottle) and it becomes nauseating. I remember this as the first turn to artificial cloyin smell in Kenzo scents. Why??? The idea behind is just so lovely! I'm not sure but I think it has been discontinued (at least in Italy).",05/14/09 06:51,Mellyhelly

Kashaya Kenzo,"The most feminine Kenzo ever.I feel for it`s soft dry down - and in a way it almost reminds me of Tresor of Lancome with it`s slightly powdered flower petals.But this one is more evasive, more subtle, more becoming.The other reason I crave Kashaya is the bottle - feeling the ""vines"" on the glass is almost like trying to decipher a coded message from your beloved.",10/10/08 21:24,Malegria

How come it's no longer in production?
What a shame!",07/18/25 04:11,Antares811
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"For me, Flower Elixir represents one of the best Kenzo perfumes and one of the best powdery perfumes ever produced! It’s such a shame that it has been discontinued because it was loved by many, so I think it must have sold well.

Scent profile is very beautiful and feminine, delicate, warm and super smooth. A sweet raspberry dipped in soft powder, mixed with sweet praline, creamy vanilla, mandarin oranges, luscious rose and orange blossoms! An excellent powdery, fruity, warm floral with strong, gourmand facets.

I personally loved Flower by Kenzo L’Elixir because it’s one of the few powdery dominant perfumes that it didn’t have iris or violet in composition, back in the days I really didn’t liked iris or violet in perfumes.

Flower by Krnzo L’Elixir was a delicious scent that was quite unique to mainstream designer launches for the time it was available but smelled so alluring and beautiful that made so many of us ladies, absolutely adore it!!

I will be forever grateful for my 50 ml back up bottle because on days like today’s, during slow morning weekends, I can enjoy the magic of this and reminisce of good times!

Kenzo, please start producing Flower L’Elixir again! Please, we need it, ten years later and there’s nothing like it!!",06/28/25 03:35,Maya lilac

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This is a gorgeous scent where the raspberry note identical to raspberry hydrolate dominates the composition. It is candied with praline and vanilla, reminiscent of a lollipop. Very pleasant to wear and joyous at that. Good longevity and projection even in winter but the scent does not overwhelm. I think it is even richer in different weather. I loved it initially but then I bought a raspberry hydrolate and it smells just as long and just as divine but for pennies. Now I like it still but I feel like wearing a simple byproduct not a parfume.",02/08/25 13:33,MademoiselleMaya
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This has to be one of my favourite fragrances and like everybody else really disappointed that it was discontinued :(

It opens very much like a raspberry cola, it’s got that deep dark fruity vibe to it. And it’s just the right amount of sweet. One of those fragrances for me you gotta wear it on its own to really enjoy it and I truly believe it doesn’t have to be layered because it is the moment.

Gives off evening vibes, date night. Wore it on a first date with a guy, got cold and he gave me his jacket to me wear. As we parted ways and I gave him his jacket back, he messaged me the next morning saying he couldn’t stop smelling his jacket and I smelt “heavenly”. Beautiful, well blended scent. Top 2 and not number 2.",02/06/25 11:26,Amu@113

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This is a wow vanilla! Unfortunately it has been discounted but definitely get your hands on this if you can find at reasonable price!

This is a powdery vanilla, that is candied with floral notes. The longevity is not the best on me and sillage is close to skin. I can see how this is compared to Prada Candy but this is much more defined candy. I layer this with florals sometimes. This can be a great sweater weather scent!

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,This smells EXACTLY like boume vanilla and it is sooo much cheaper. Performance is actually disappointing for a kenzo perfume. I would not recommend spending your coins on this. Get the cheaper dupe trust me. Boume vanilla is it if u like this scent profile.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Amazing perfume, such a shame it's discontinued it has such a sweet and slightly sour opening due to the Raspberries and the Mandarin, then it turns fully sweet due to the gourmand and vanilla note in it and the hints of really expansive makeup powders.

Overall a really great fragrance for those lucky ladies out there that can get their hands on it.

This Story Below has nothing to do with the performance of the Perfume, it's just a story of how lucky I was to get my hands on it.

Been at a local store that sells personal hygiene items and daily use stuff, saw that they got a really small section with Perfumes afterwards saw a name of few brands Kenzo was one of them, I asked them if they had Kenzo Flower (The original one from the year 2000) they immediately told me they don't then one staff member said yes we do have one last bottle I saw it it was Flower by Kenzo L 'Elixir didn't really care much about it since I really wanted to get the original one for my mom since she used to wear Kenzo d'ete 1992 so thought it'd be a good idea to get her something from the same manufacture seeing that L 'Elixir was a branch of the original I assumed it wasn't really that big of a deal, I went back home and landed on this page knowing it is a discontinued fragrance from better times I was in shock, I immediately contacted the store to put the bottle aside for me for pickup, snatched the 100mL for a good 80$.",10/03/23 11:10,Moe Itani

If you are looking for a dupe, try Blush Cardigan by Bath & Body Works and you will not be disappointed. To my nose they are 90% similar. Blush Cardigan is just a little bit less powdery and the raspberry is more detectable.",07/27/23 11:35,Princessy

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Just received my bottle. So far my impression is that it smells like a mix of designer scents; Flower by Kenzo, Prada Candy, even a little Black Opium. But on my skin it’s so faint in terms of projection even though it has great longevity.

Reminds me of a jam donut with powdery icing sugar (minus the starchiness of the donut itself!). It’s more elegant than a lot of designer gourmands out there and feels very versatile.

My rating: 7.5/10 (points off for lack of projection)
Bf rating: 8.8/10

Edit: I sold this on because I just couldn’t smell it, I think was anosmic to it or I got a bad batch. I find myself missing it, though, so I might try find a replacement.",02/15/23 05:59,jjluvsm9

Well, I love it now. That happens so often with me. Fragrances I dislike, eventually become ones that I love.

This is a sweet raspberry powder delight. It has gourmand vibes and reminds me of a powdered donut with raspberry compote. But it’s not as literal as that, and stays as a reminds me instead of me feeling like I’m wearing food.

It has all day longevity and projects moderately but in a quiet way. Why did they discontinue this?",01/21/23 03:30,Lyric82
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Ah, but it is a very worthy perfume to be appreciated, yes! Kenzo and his habit of flanking everything that is denomination, inflecting only names and more names several times, ends up scaring when he launches them, but this one is very worthy of being honored for its beauty!

As soon as sprayed, it is a refreshing fruity scent with an enigmatic citrus background. The Raspberry note is lively and causes a sensational effect on the complete structure of the perfume, as it manifests itself at each evolved step of the same! I love the juicy reddish feel it gives.

In the dry down it becomes more floral, however, with a very characteristic airy tropical aroma, the Orange Blossom seems to be together with a very indolent Jasmine, dirty that makes it here in this phase a bit complicated and bringing the powdery, sweet and Kenzo heavyweight; nothing that compromises the resourcefulness of the fragrance, since it still bears the raspberry note.

In parting, which by the way is after long, long hours, the fragrance becomes more full-bodied, closed and dense like a true L'Elixir. I can noticeably feel a second skin with thin and slightly powdery makeup, but nothing that refers to colored pencils, really thin stuff, I can also feel a caramel aroma that comes from the delicious Praline that sews and ends with praise this work here; smooth sweet, with almond bottoms and a very tasty hazelnut shell, to cause salivation, even! Wow deliciousness!",01/10/23 18:50,Jernê Knowles
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This should be perfection to me. It smells like Prada Candy (which I really like but it's so ridiculously weak and fleeting that I can't justify the purchase) but with good sillage and lasting power. Unfortunately it also smells like Kenzo Flower edp, which I also really like, but I prefer both scents on their own rather than combined as in L'Elixir.

I don't regret buying it since I do enjoy it, but I'm relieved I didn't order backups. I almost did because the shipping rate was flat, the price was okay (40 euro for 50ml) and since it's discontinued and well rated I knew that I should be able to resell and recoup the cost if I didn't love.

I've had it for a few months but I don't reach for it that often. I like it well enough for most occasions, but I don't really love it for any particular occasion. I've also had a remarkably steady attitude towards it, often my first impression isn't very sticky, but with this scent I feel exactly the same today as when I got it four months ago.",10/26/22 08:49,Heliga

They didn't have Flower EDP and there wasn't a tester of this, but I took a gamble because I've been such a fan of the Flower fragrance for years. The DNA is there--the powdery rose, but it's made a little darker and juicer with the raspberry and praline. I'm not always a fan of raspberry notes in fragrances. I find they can smell a bit cheap and unimaginative, but it's blended nicely with the gourmand notes and I do really enjoy this fragrance.

The sugared powdery notes are still very dominant but come out bursting with the top fruity notes! Gorgeous, soft rose scent, heavenly praline note and a warm vanilla all help create this sweet scent bubble that is far from cloying. Soft, gourmand and powdery sum this beauty up perfectly.",04/24/22 22:48,ScentBliss555

There's a heavy sweet vanilla and caramel very reminiscent of Candy, but tempered by the violets and powderiness of Flower. It's definitely greater than the sum of its parts because I like this a lot more than Flower or Candy on their own; however I wouldn't consider it FBW for myself.",04/22/22 07:27,clairesque
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This one is really growing on me. I had purchased as I thought it might be similar to the parfum (nope, no way similar). I was disappointed. But…I kept trying it. I couldn’t smell much at first just sweetness. However I’m now smelling more notes as our temps drop heading into late autumn. I get strong vanillic sugar notes and some musks. I can now sense the soft raspberries and rose. The raspberries aren’t sharp. Very ripe and almost like they’ve been dipped in ghost chocolate (it’s a whisper like layer) over a ghostly jammy raspberry. It’s intriguing. I find it soothing and often wear to bed. I applied 9pm last night - including the back of my hand (so I could easily sniff it) . Woke, showered, applied my Nuxe dry oil all over, did hand washing of lingerie and a bunch of chores and at 7pm (22 hours later) I can still smell it clearly on the back of my hand. Intense staying power. Unsure of projection. This is a comfort scent and I find it more and more delicious.",04/17/22 23:57,Silverquick

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Sweet, floral, yet dark and seductive. The powdery-ness of it is not overwhelming and makes it very sophisticated. My all time favorite. Love at first sniff. Still looking for something I can fall in love with like this since it's discontinued. It's my go-to evening special event fragrance, especially for close encounters. Definitely a compliment getter and I hope it gets brought back in the future! For those saying it's not a beast mode, your bottle may just be old. I bought mine six years ago and it definitely was a beast mode, but I've had it for so long, and the longevity and projection definitely started fading about three years ago. Still my favorite!

Would anyone be able to tell me of something similar to this? A dupe or layering combo that would get the same effect? I love it but I'm running out and it's been discontinued :(",02/27/22 17:13,nessa_arroyo

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Very powdery. The opening has a soft citrus and a general floral note (not too much like rose). It's not cloyingly sweet. I don't pickup on the praline either but that's because nothing really stands out, maybe the rasberry in the drydown. It's a light gourmand. The YT reviews made me think this would be a beast mode fragrance but on me it's a skin scent when I overspray. I'm talking like 30 sprays. But that might be because the bottle I bought is 3 years old. Overall it's a really pretty, POWDERY, and comforting scent. Also, I just saw that the bigger bottle is available on Macy's right now if anyone's looking for it.",01/14/22 17:15,Sugarpoiso

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS!! HOLY COW IM AMAZED AND I LOVE THIS!!! It reminds me of my beloved signature scent Valentino Donna Born in Roma which I'm actually really shocked to see is not on the ""this perfume reminds me of"" list. They aren't dupes, and the fragrance notes aren't even similar, but they SMELL similar and even give off the same sexy, unique, alluring vibe (in my opinion) on first spray. I can see this being a 100% crowd pleaser just like my Donna. You smell feminine, and pretty, but with an aura that can't be explained because the scent is that unique to others. I can not wait to wear this...INSTANT LOVE and I hope it stays that way. The bottle is NOT MY FAVORITE and really tall for no reason so that's the only negative I have right now. I'll rate for weather, and longevity after wearing it but I'm pretty sure I'd wear this year round just like Donna especially since this is lighter than that one.

Edit: The powderiness of this perfume is EXQUISITE!! the combination of raspberry, and praline vanilla notes makes this smell very gourmand. It reminds me of my raspberry jam donut body care from bath and body works, which I LOVE to pair this with. It's sooo yummy but then that rose, orange blossom, powdery note combo is sophisticated, and classy. This is a perfume that WORKS so well for me as it's everything I want to smell like, my entire scent profile in one. I'm always excited to wear this one. I think it's strong at first but then calms down after a couple hours to be a more intimate sweet scent. Not super loud and projectile which is awesome for this type of scent. The bubble around you is small but when people step into it they are enveloped in all it's greatness and LOVE IT. You just smell GOOD. It's winter right now but still very warm for this time of year and it's not suffocating at all 👍🏾",12/10/21 18:28,Tomadeupjazz
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Kenzo l'elixir is for sure my most successful blindbuy till now. First things first, let's get this out of the way: the bottle (esp. the 100ml one) is outrageous. I've never seen a taller bottle. My mom said it looks like a katana, and it sure does. Could definitely be used as a weapon. I would much prefer a more compact bottle, but I love this perfume too much to care.

This is a gourmand-lovers dream! So so feminine. It starts of with a really prominent raspberry note, wrapped in caramel and some florals (I mostly get rose). It is extremely edible, and although it does not have a chestnut note, I sometimes get whiffs of a mont blanc scent, which is a delicious chestnut dessert with cream and powdered sugar. In the drydown it becomes more powdery (as in ""powdered sugar"" powdery, not ""talc"" powdery). Weirdly, it also has a fresh quality to it, but it remains sweet throughout. This is absolutely addictive to me.

Great longevity/sillage.

To me this is a 10/10! I'm glad I finally found a 100ml bottle and I will cherish it.",11/15/21 10:22,Sillya
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Wow! This was a very successful blind buy based on reviews and the notes and it did not disappoint. It opens with raspberry and mandarin and the raspberry stays through to the dry down for me.

The rose, vanilla and powdery notes appear in the mid notes to dry down, making this an extremely feminine and delicious frag. I also get sweetness from the praline that makes this yummy. I like to wear this as I work from home so I can smell it on myself all day. It is also very unique and garners compliments. I tend to spray like 5 sprays of this one to get it to last longer and it performs fairly well. I am finding myself reaching for this often and it is a very lovely addition to my collection. Absolutely full bottle worthy. 9.5/10 ❤😍",11/04/21 16:54,Christinageor10
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I was soo excited to try this fragrance but I was disappointed. It does smell similar to Prada Candy which I do not like but haven't smelled in years.

For reference, my favorite fragrances is LVEB Intensement and I just recently discovered D&G Pour Femme which I also like and Giorgio Armani Si Fiori is also nice.",11/03/21 17:28,Kryss
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"WOW!! I have been purchasing so many blind buys during this lockdown, and this is one of the best ones by far, it wowed me the most. I love sweet, heavy, gourmand scents and I am so happy that it is exactly that. It is such a thick, syrupy sweet that smells like a raspberry jam filled donut with powdered sugar ontop. The powdery note in it is so nice and sweet that it reminds me of powdered sugar, and not baby powder. It is such a pleasantly strong and intoxicating scent I am so glad that I added this to my collection. If you love heavy thick gourmand scents this will be your new favourite xoxo

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Praline, vanilla, powder…that’s the headline here. I think the most accurate review descriptor I read prior to buying is “powdered sugar”. It’s really quite literal. It smells like you put on a rich bakery vanilla lotion (like fresh cream from philosophy) and patted powdered sugar- instead of talcum powder, over it.
The sugary element is whisper soft, it’s dry, yet super sweet.
If you enjoy the OG kenzo flower, I can’t imagine you wouldn’t love this. The dna is there, especially at initial application.
There is a bitter element I found to be unappealing in the opening of the original kenzo flower, but the powdery elements softened it and redeemed the body of the fragrance once it sat a short while. I had thought it was the hawthorne, but I’m getting a much quieter element of it here.
Definitely not a deal breaker, I’ll happily give this perfume a lot of my time. This confectionary sugar note is so different and gorgeous.
This perfume holds its own and doesn’t mirror prada candy to my nose. They both have a place in my collection.
I much prefer this to the original kenzo…",07/27/21 17:00,StinkyTinky

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,What a disappointment... This have the same dna effect that Flower in me. Headaches. I cant recognize what is that disgusting smell .

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I have used up 2 bottles of the original Kenzo Flower before, so I can say that Flower L'Elixir has 0 resemblance whatsoever to the original Kenzo Flower. Flower L'Elixir is in the family of ""wintery sweet scents"", but it is lighter than I expected and is less sweet than something like La Vie Est Belle or Black Opium - for this reason I think it can work well as a transition scent from end of winter to spring, or from end of summer to autumn. It is quite powdery (as in the sense of make-up powder). I don't like powdery perfumes but this one is still acceptable for me.

EDIT: as I wore it for the first time, the whole day I kept thinking that I was smelling something that is recognisable from the past, but I could not put my finger on it. Today I smelt the cap of the bottle again, then it hit me that Flower L'Elixir has this small part of the original Kenzo Flower DNA buried deeply in it - it triggers my memory of Kenzo Flower in quite an interesting and magical way, but I still maintain my view that this has no resemblance to the original Kenzo Flower.",04/14/21 03:34,Murmur123123
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Maybe it’s just me, but I had to do about 10 sprays just to be able to smell this as more than a skin scent (and with most fragrances I only use 2 to 3 sprays). That still wasn’t really enough, after 5 minutes it was once again only a skin scent. I’m honestly wondering if the person who sold me the sample decant watered it down :(

Sometimes I smell a delicious toasted marshmallow scent from this fragrance, which is very enjoyable. Then, on other sniffs, I get mostly a powdery raspberry rose, which unfortunately is a tiny bit reminiscent of what they spray in public bathrooms. Wish that toasted marshmallow scent would come out more consistently.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I blind bought this...first of all, why is the bottle so tall lmao
So, anyway, I keep smelling this thinking 'i know this, what is it?' It smells similar to Prada Candy!
It's sweet and peppery (Prada Candy gives me that peppery smell too) and I personally get a hint of incense smoke. This is very, very nice. The longer I wear it, it smells less like PC and gives me a light Black Opium vibe. It's definitely going up there with my favorites!

Edit 02/22/2021
I really love this. I don't get Prada Candy or Black Opium vibes at all anymore, but this definitely smells so close to Britney's Prerogative, which is my favorite fragrance. It's not an exact match, but it's very close.
In excitement I held the bottle up to show my husband across the room. Look what I got today!

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Cozy and subtle but alluring gourmand. Dark in the gentlest way. It smells like burnt, brown sugar with powdery notes rounded out by praline and dessert vanilla. It is my favorite gourmand right now. I find it unique and beautiful throughout its whole development. I just wish the powdery facets smelled less like old fashioned powder make up or foundation. I am so glad I enjoy it now, since I didn't like it the first time I tried it. It only smelled like old make up and burnt plastic + some burnt sugar but now my perception changed somehow. Not a safe blind buy IMO, because it is hard to describe the fragrance and the voted notes won't give you the whole picture. But it is a gorgeous perfume with great longevity and sillage so def check it out if you can.

EDIT: I sold my bottle bc I ended up never wearing it. I find it beautiful and cozy but it has zero sexiness to me. I think bc of the makeup powderiness. I also asked a few guys what they think, and all of them said it is not very nice and def not sexy.

Men AND Women. It's unique in my collection.

Opening is a juicy, softly-powdery raspberry that quickly mimics a luxury make-up scent. You know those 8g compact powders, foundations & lipsticks that are worth over $100?
That's what this smells like...but in a more sophisticated, modern and appealing manner.

What I love about this scent is the dry down after 2-3 hours, it literally smells of vanilla-pumped hazelnut pralines (not caramel). But REALISTIC pralines!! Definitely gourmand!!
Beautiful, well-blended scent. It's feminine, elegant and not provocative...actually rather inviting! To top it all off, it's immensely work environment-friendly :)",12/24/20 08:47,Palmer Eldritch

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Fell in love with this after testing it at the airport but didn't buy it. I ended up getting it after I heard it was going to be discontinued but was disappointed because it didn't smell at all like what I smelled at the airport, now it smells sweet, light, and incense like. I remember it smelling like syrupy raspberry and vanilla but I don't get either of these notes now. I'm not sure if it was reformulated because when I checked the batch code it said 2020.. Either that or I got a fake, but I'm pretty sure I didn't because I got it off Feel Unique.. I'm just really disappointed now and the fact that this is going to be discontinued really doesn't make this any better",12/11/20 09:12,frc2n
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"First off; bottle is ridiculously tall 😅 My 100ml of this is by far the tallest bottle I have. Quite inconvenient to store, but I like the look and feel of it more as time goes by.

Already bought backup for this.. It's amazing! This is very powdery.
Prada Candy on steroids. I love Candy but it's majorly lacking in performance, so I've mainly been using it as a stay at home or a comfy bed scent.. Totally wish I had come across this sooner! L'Elixir also reminds me a bit of la nuit tresor a la folie without the nutmeg and more powdery. Also reminiscent of Poison Girl to me.
Wearing it feels sort of sensual and comfortable at the same time. Quite classy actually. Probably the powderiness giving it that vibe. The powderiness also lends it a lipstick or makeup effect, while the praline, vanilla and raspberry is making it half gourmandish. I find it slightly waxy.

If you care about this stuff; in my opinion it can easily be worn both day and night and is most suitable for fall and winter.

The longevity is good, far better than prada candy on me. Lingers around for a long time! Projection is moderate to strong for about two hours and then it dies down a bit, but still very noticeable. I'm guessing it will last even longer if oversprayed.
My partner said it had a slight minty smell, which I am not getting? But I see others have mentioned mint as well.",12/07/20 11:26,Siljemariyeah

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I have been testing this out, on and off for the last week & I have to say that this is an interesting one.

This starts off fruity & zesty, then I get a yummy sweet, rose & orange blossom scent but either the powdery note & or a woody note that ruins it. It almost takes on an incensed tone which I can’t stand to be frank.

Such a shame for me, I get that the woody notes extends the longevity of the fragrance but it is too jarring for my sense of smell. It does lend a warmth to it though so if you like cozy/sweet florals this could be a really good choice.

Longevity is pretty decent, I’d say around 4 hours before it becomes a strong skin scent & another 3 before it disappears on my skin. Lasts a lot longer on clothes. Silage isn’t huge, perhaps arms length depending on how much you spray.

It wasn’t a scrubber, nor was it a keeper. Passing this one on.",10/18/20 05:41,Peeka
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I am so confused with this scent. The moment I received my parcel I put this on and went to work. My first impression was 'score!this is a great blind buy!' - It reminded me right away of a very well blended version of pink sugar and gold sugar. In fact the resemblance with pink sugar was uncanny, only this was better made and had a creaminess behind the first notes (which was what made me think of gold sugar combo).

So, I went to work and a client commented: oh, that smells nice!-mind you, we wear masks because of covid of course, but she could smell it and was impressed. It lasted for hours and I loved that creamy pink sugar version this was- the final notes also reminded me of Kenzo amour...

A few days later, however this perfume changed. Not just on me, it just changed in the bottle. Now I get a sickly sweet creamy scent that is all Kenzo amour, only unbalanced and too sweet. So sweet that makes me want to take it off. Where is the more balanced and sophisticated pink+gold sugar combo I loved on first sniff? Now it all Kenzo Amour throughout, too cloyingly sweet, just... too much! and this projects and lasts for hours!what happened here? I am baffled...

I do now that some perfumes change over time after being sprayed, they get mellower etc. But this to be transformed as such, in just a few days later, it is ridiculous. The only thing I can think of is that when I first tried it I was menstruating (and that, with hormones and such) can make a difference on how sth smells on us, but also maybe how we perceive the notes of a scent? I do not know, I'm lost here and I am sad I no longer love it, but can't even bear to wear it... :(",09/27/20 07:23,Lalouve<3
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I love this! I've developed an obsession with perfume samples, and I got L'Elixir in a large lot. I put off testing it out for a while, as I wasn't interested in the original Flower- floral perfumes don't really excite me. But despite this being called ""Flower, L'Elixir"", there's nothing flowery about this whatsoever.
This is a delicious gourmand fragrance. To me, this is a fluffy raspberry truffle you get in a heart shaped box on Valentine's Day. Sort of marshmallowy, but not like the marshmallow in Irresistible by Givenchy, or Princess by Kilian. It's more blended in, a little more mature. After a while, this turns into a smoky vanilla. Since this fragrance lasts for hours, you could enjoy the raspberry confection in the day and have the gentle sweet smoke lead you into the night.
I see quite a few comments comparing L'Elixir to Angel. I somewhat agree- it's kind of like Angel, if you took out all of the disgusting notes that make Angel smell like filth and body odor. L'Elixir is just desserts.

I didn't like it at first, I was expecting it to be a deeper, warmer version of the beloved original. I came back to it after a few weeks, and I must say I really, really like it.

I smell the raspberry all the time.. the opening: burnt raspberry, then I smell smoky, spicy, burnt sugar. The dry down is vanilla raspberry.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Praline, raspberry, and a powder note that to me leans a little more powdered sugar and a little less cosmetic powder. I can definitely smell similarities with the more balsamic Prada Candy but the caramel in Candy is replaced with raspberry chocolates. Using Candy as a point of reference, L'Elixir is more complex with better performance.

I personally find this to be the perfect cool weather daytime fragrance, but I'd wear it into the night as well, especially because the longevity is so solid! I see her in a huge scarf spending a Saturday doing fall stuff-- apple picking, candle shopping (?), cappuccinos, you know the drill.

This one is a crowd-pleaser in my experience. Gourmand, rich, sweet with depth, you can't go wrong. As a disclaimer, I don't adore chocolate or berry notes but I adore this. Longevity is amazing, lasts 7-8 hours on skin and up to 12 on clothes/ hair. Projection is strong.

It’s comforting and familiar. This perfume lasts quite a while but sillage is light. Probably a safe blind buy if you enjoy sweet fragrances.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This is very much gourmand super sweet with a little sourness from raspberry. It’s sugary sweet I assume from praline. A little powdery and rose adds a little femininity and elegance to the fragrance. I’m hooked 😍


The smoky vanilla dry down is very similar to Tihota by Indult, plus raspberry raspberry praline sweetness. It’s like a raspberry version of Tihota Indult.
Also reminds me of la Nuit Tresor a lot.",05/30/20 14:29,Kots_Tanya
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I loveeeee this so much. I wish I could bathe in this scent. It is so sweet, a little powdery, yummy yummy yummy and a little bit like a syrupy-fruity-rose. It's gorgeous and is perfect for my fellow gourmand lovers. You have to like very sweet scents to enjoy this.

The dry down in this fragrance is so similar to the 'candy' part of Prada Candy. It almost smells like Prada Candy minus the musk and a little less powdery.

Totally a love for me.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I have have been wanting to get this perfume now for over 2yrs... went through duty free in 2 different countries. - sprayed it on and got on my plane home. Twice I got home, could still smell it on my clothes and had instant regret on not buying it. The 2nd time this happened I went straight to the mall and bought a large bottle. Every single time I wear it, I get a compliment from someone. It lasts forever!! I had sprayed some on a little tester paper at the airport and put the paper strip in my car on my visor and I could still smell it a week later. This perfume is beautifully done and smells unlike anything else I have ever smelled before. One coworker who complimented the scent said it did not smell like my usual perfumes, that I smelled more musky or inscenc-y. I did not get that from myself but that was her thought. I can tryly smell raspberries, praline, vanilla and some roses. It is a very comforting and sweet scent. Don’t hesitate buying this, you will get complimented by strangers if you wear it. Blind buy safe. Currently one of my top 5 scents in my collection. Lots of people love the bottle, I am not one of them. It looks out of place with my others as it is so tall. Also, not travel friendly due to size. But I love the juice and can overlook the bottle :)",09/27/19 08:59,Tessa03

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I love the original ""Flower by Kenzo"".And my thoughts so far, is that I do smell the original ""Flower"" DNA, here.

This particular flanker is ""Flower"" layered with raspberry and rose, but unlike other reviews, I don't find it particularly powdery, nor do I get the vanilla or incense notes mentioned.

But I do find it to be, quite a: simple, sweet composition of raspberry and rose, with a minute hint of praline buried way underneath.

It's linear too, just like it's predecessor.

Would I buy a full bottle? Probably.

Although It's not as dark as I would have liked or hoped for, and in my mind Elixer means: thick, heavy, honeyed and magical. And it's nothing like that, but it is for those days when I need something: feminine, young, girly, fresh and flirty to contrast my staple orientals and want to smell like a raspberry and rose.",08/16/19 04:24,amanda-m-lewis
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This is a deliciously intoxicating, well-blended raspberry vanilla start and a praline finish supported by something woody and floral but just barely.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I'm impressed by this Flower flanker. It only hints at Flower edp in the dry down, but the opening and mid would leave one hard pressed to pin L'Elixer as a relative of it. These aren't notes I would typically gravitate towards, but they are executed together quite well. It's neither too sweet or too powdery, nor is it too bitter as praline can often go on my skin.

The vanilla is exquisite. It's a natural, almost candle-wax variety; ie, somewhat waxy and airy but still nicely sweet rather than dense, cupcakey vanilla. It's a grown up vanilla!

The raspberry note isn't obtrusive and it doesn't come across overtly cheap or juvenile. Raspberry is a note I can easily dislike due to my old associations with those cheap Body Fantasy sprays, but in this it works! The praline is welcomed too, despite my usual reservations for the note.

I'm very pleasantly surprised by this, so much so I added it to my want list. I agree with the previous reviewer who said this is the perfect Valentine's Day scent. It's sexy, mildly sweet and soft; not overly gourmand thanks to the florals and powder touch. This is the best recent example in my experience where a flanker far surpasses its pillar in terms of quality and scent. Beautiful bottle as well.

Longevity: Mild to moderate, 4-6 hours before I have to press to smell it

Projection: Polite, stays within my personal scent bubble and doesn't fill a room.

Feelings: Soft and sexy, delicious, velvet-like, versatile but best suited for evenings and dates.",02/12/19 14:18,Swedelish

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"First things first - Prada Candy is my favourite perfume and I thought you people were crazy - how could such different notes smell similar?!
Yet it is entirely true. While Candy focuses on the caramel/benzoin mixture, L'elixir is a powdery vanillic praline (on myself anyway) but the similarities are astounding.
I feel that L'elixir would be Candy's older, more sultry sister.

Back to L'elixir - It is so smooth and refined, and even with the aforementioned similarities it retains its own unique style.
To me, the opening is raspberry heady before slowly fading away into the background and letting the other notes take the spotlight.
And as an added bonus, the sillage and longevity are insane! (To put this in context, I am a heavy smoker and I can STILL smell this strongly 9 hours after application!)
As others have said, there is a slight smokiness to it all - I'm not sure where it comes from, but I think it sits incredibly well with this formula and gives it the boost to be more than just an average gourmand fragrance.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I get lots and lots of raspberry in Flower L'Elixir. It's a very sweet raspberry, not tart or sour in the slightest. Like a piece of raspberry flavored candy with gooey liquid filling. Praline and vanilla are also very strong in this fragrance. The rose is blended subtly into the raspberry, but there is a general powdery floral accord that builds a bridge to the original Kenzo Flower, without making it a similar fragrance.
This is a very sweet, simple scent, but it doesn't smell cheap or too syrupy. It's girly, but sensual. A delicious moodlifter. Like a sexy perfume version of one of my favorite desserts - vanilla ice cream with hot raspberries.

I see that other reviewers have compared this to many other fragrances, but I disagree. Mayyybe there is a slight similarity in texture to La Nuit Tresor, but they smell totally different.
What makes Flower L'Elixir unique is that it's an intense and warm fruity gourmand without any patchouli, and the very distinctive and strong raspberry note.
It's not a love for me, but a very enjoyable like.

Edit from 3 years later: I'm craving a raspberry gourmand now and remembered I have a sample of this one, so I sprayed it once again. It's not a like anymore, I love it now. So freaking delicious, but powdery enough to keep it from being onedimensional. I need a bottle.",02/25/18 07:06,SailorV

I bought the half-ounce/15 ml bottle and I really can't see myself finishing it. I'm feeling annoyed by the smell of raspberries and by the fact that I had a fairly unsuccessful blind buy. (My success rate with blind buys is quite high.)

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I blind bought this based on the reviews and I'm going to start by saying that I do not regret it, but it is not a love for me.
Because each person is unique, reviews are sometimes nothing like what you experience with a perfume. So to make it easier for people who would want to take a leap of faith with this fragrance, I'll try to balance my own opinion on this with the other comments in here.

Is it a gourmand? Definitely. The very first blast of this is very LVEBesque. The dry-down is not though. So if you hate sickly sugary perfumes, this is not one of them. It morphs into a weird creamy and spicy combo. Praline is rather a top note. Like some fragranticans have mentioned, Flower has a smoky tangling feel to it, mainly due to the Bulgarian rose in my opinion, which is the main star throughout the whole development, with vanilla/praline in the background.
Girly? No. Not if you're referring to the dry-down. I even found it to be a bit masculine which I loved. Edgy and nice but the spicy part is not my cup of tea. Longevity and sillage are moderate. With 4.19 on Fragrantica, it's a bit overrated I think. I will definitely wear this (when I am in my black cat mood), but won't be reaching for it as often as I expected.",05/04/17 10:47,Arabian Girl

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Milky, vanillary, and powdery. Floral and gourmand.

Very interesting scent. For me, it opens with a cloud of strawberry powdered milk with a hint of orange zest in the beginning. As it dries down I get the vanilla, but it's soft and not overpowering. It develops as juicy and powdery at the same time.

I don't really get that candy-like or sweet scent like I do with La Vie Est Belle or Black Opium. It's more of a grown-up, mature vanilla. It's very similar to Melanie Martinez Cry Baby Perfume Milk; I get the same powdery strawberry note that lingers on my skin, but not as sour and more creamy with the vanilla.

I have to say that the ad campaign for this is stunning. Ming Xi is beautiful in the advert, very classic. I love Kenzo for their constant innovation and creativity as a brand, as well as, with their perfume releases.

This perfume is pretty and modern like the advert, but a slight bore. I also wish the longevity lasted longer (~ 4 hrs max on my skin).",03/19/17 13:14,loversandxo

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I'm in the fence about flower elixir,I really don't know how do I feel about it
Actually I can see original flower's gene here,a powdery rose but there are more differences
I can get raspberry rose wrapped by lots of powder and sweet notes of praline and vanilla that give it a gourmand vibe
It's warm,sweet,femminine and very sensual,so charming that I could love it
But I can also feel something medicinal here that blends with raspberry and syrupy sweetness and reminds me this syrup my doctor prescribed me when I was a kid.it also has a burnt plastic vibe,although I love plastic smells I just can't get past this bad impression
Longevity is good and sillage is even better,I even like my 1.7 oz bottle so much,so I wish I can like the scent more
I'll edit my review if anything changes,and actually I think it will
Edit :
Oh well, still it's mostly about powdered rose,raspberry and syrupy medicinal/burnt sweetness,it's sweetness is more like melted and a little burnt sugar,but I find it kind of addictive.I really can't say it was a failure but I'm happy that I didn't buy 100mil bottle.it's something that can put me off if I use it occasionally
For me, this is more a night scent and definitely a fall,winter one
❤❤❤
Second edit:
I'm liking it more and more after each wear.the syrupy burnt sugar thing seems to calm down so quickly now and there's just a hint of it present as it develops which isn't off-putting but gives this fragrance s unique and addictive nutty,yummy undertone.I find it more close to Kenzo Jea amour Elixir(which I love) than Kenzo Flower.it's a complement magnet, people around me seem to find it deliciously sexy and it has a good sillage and longevity (I can smell it after 8 hours!)

The fragrance lasts really long and like somebody mentioned already it smells smokey after some time which gives the sweet note a little mystery and glow.

Update. I bought it :) Happy like a child..",10/26/16 09:24,ElectricBlue

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I was expecting to smell flowers but all I got was a nice candy scent on me. Any floral notes are being taken over by sugary fruity vanilla accords.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I just tested Tender Romance by RL and that was a sweet concoction.
so looking at the notes of Flower L'Elixir I was expecting a chocolate candy wrapped in fudge and covered in syrup.
but, oh surprise.
The opening is airy, light with a heady rose in the background that slowly grows in intensity. Somehow I smell jasmine too. Its a very attractive scent. even with heavy notes it still remains fresh and clean.
I like it even after the vanilla appears to sweet things up.",09/08/16 20:30,esteban747
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Love it!! Warm floral oriental, but not so gourmand, I truly love it in the fall and winter...it has a bit of Flower blueprint somewhere in the heart, but the floral undertone is nestled into warm and cozy notes...I detect like the previous reviewer a bit of incense...especially in warmer weather. This is a great creation, nothing overdone, it is a bit like Dior Addict , it has that warm oriental vibe, it is also grown up.,feminine...sensuous . It has great longevity, and warms up deliciously on the skin. I did notice it gets smokey with age!!",08/29/16 15:39,genny17

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This is a love for me! I smelled this and immediately fell in love and bought the biggest bottle available (100ml)! This is sweet but very elegant. I find it to be in the Prada Candy family but I am wearing both right now on different hands and this is much sweeter and less powdery than Prada Candy. They are similar but KFL makes Prada Candy seem very powdery almost like Prada Infusion D'Iris. I find them both to be sweet but in a mature and elegant way. This smells expensive. It is long lasting and sillage is arm's length. I save this for special occasions just like my Dior Addict. I am mentioning these other perfumes so you guys can get a better idea of the type of perfume this is. If you own the ones I mentioned you will understand where I am coming from. I own and love all three of them. This is not an everyday perfume, it's more like a date night or special occasion perfume. I do not own the original Kenzo Flower but have tested it before and this smells nothing like it. This is one of the most expensive perfumes I own so if you find it online for a good price and you like sweet perfumes, this is a very safe blind buy. It's sweet but not sickly sweet. It just melts into your skin and become part of you. It makes me feel sexy and elegant. I will always keep this in my collection.",07/14/16 02:22,Nat001

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I'm going to disagree with everyone and say it's actually rather crude, in my opinion. Toothache sweet and gourmand. However it starts out much better, and promises to be a magnificent creation, but never makes it.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"L'elixir is a captivating and extremely feminine gourmand for me.

It is like a syrupy liquid floral with hints of Kenzo Amour in its opening but that quickly gives way to the sweetly liquorice note (Praliné mixed with red fruits) giving me a vestige of flowers which in some way are in the DNA of Flower by Kenzo.

Harmonious, and very soft.

I like a lot, but I still perceive it in my skin soon have applied; Although on clothes if you have a large attachment.

Heady, a formidable scent.

--------------------------

L'Elixir es para mí un gourmand cautivador y tremendamente femenino .

Es como un floral almibarado con toques de Kenzo Amour en su apertura pero que rápidamente deja paso a la nota dulcemente licorosa ( praliné mezclado con frutos rojos) dándome un vestigio de las flores que de alguna manera están en el ADN de Flower by Kenzo .

Armonioso , y muy suave .

Me gusta muchísimo , pero sigo sin percibirlo en mi piel al poco de habérmelo aplicado; aunque en la ropa si tiene una gran fijación .

Embriagador , un aroma formidable .",03/28/16 04:09,Lito2
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I think 'powdery notes' is the best way to describe the poofy opening of this fragrance but then almost immediately turning to a white chocolate vibe. I must say I really, really like this subtle gourmand approach. As Flower L'Elixir settles though it's much more of a vanilla and deep caramel than the hint of berries and maybe something similar to orris in the opening?
I like it...A straight up creamy, sweet fragrance which has a very light touch, which is a good achievement in that it isn't cloying but bad in terms of longevity and scent trail, both of which are very fleeting.
I don't try 'feminine fragrances' (let me clarify...fragrances marketed towards women with notes typically I don't enjoy.) as often as perhaps I should but I do remember trying the original Flower and it was nothing nearly as enjoyable as this change of direction.
Worth checking out for gourmand fans just let down by a lack of staying power.",03/04/16 03:38,Houdini4
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Reminds me of Lancôme Trésor Lumineuse EdP and the notes are indeed very similar, but this one has added yet another squeeze of raspberry syrup to the pancakes with ice cream and honey. I have never smelled the original Flower so I have no idea how it compares, but this is fabulous.

If I had to choose which one to get a full size of based on the samples I have in my possession I think I'd go with Trésor Lumineuse simply because the packaging/presentation speaks to me more. Otherwise I really couldn't choose.

EDIT: Actually, no. I'm going with this over Trésor Lumineuse on second thought.",02/29/16 12:11,Madrona

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"It has that familiar passed down powdery scent from the Kenzo Flower generation, but with a twist of vanilla and raspberry. It feels younger and more into the gourmand rather than floral. Not sugary sweet though, it fits well for any ladies who love gourmand scents and not want a base like wood / patchouli / amber / which gets too strong and eats up the gourmand scents. There is a good balance of the scent of the original Flower and the Gourmand. If you think the original FLower is harsh and metallic, this version is much much better and safe for daily wear.",02/01/16 23:22,cherlynnie

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I was really torn when I first smelled this. The original Flower is possibly my favorite perfume of all time and initially I thought ""God, they removed all the seductive uniqueness of this fragrance and sweetened it into banality,"" but the more it settled on my wrist, the more it reminded me of Amour Indian Holi and the more it developed into something creamy and irresistible.

Reader, I bought it.

This is sweet but somehow manages not to venture into nauseating territory. The vanilla here is really gorgeous. No matter what my mind may want to say my nose loves it and that's enough for me. Recommended for those who are usually suspicious of fruity scents. This is worth a try.",01/12/16 17:12,DMS162002

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I usually don't get compliments on my scents but I was in Trader Joe's and a young man working there literally started asking around if anyone was wearing perfume and I immediately knew it was my 6 spritzes of this stuff I'd given myself at Ulta (to test longevity and sillage)so I confessed, fearing I'd really overdone it. He said it was amazingly good, thank God, because I didn't think it was that noticeable from a distance. For me this is my most comfortable sweet yummy scent that isn't too much like a dessert flavoring.

Couple of key things about this version of Flower; it is definitely for the gourmand sweet lover. But the weird thing is the praline and vanilla really don't come out well on a test paper or even the spray cap. But it definitely is there when it sits on the skin after the fruity notes have dissipated - and this is really what sets this apart from the original Flower which I find more floral. Longevity is especially difficult to tell on this perfume for some reason because I stop smelling it way before other people and don't realize it is still there. Hence this can lead to over spraying as I did above. But if you spray on clothing it can last for a good couple of days if left aside, and you will notice it when you come back to it.",11/27/15 22:27,satellite99
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Normally I like parfums that are a little bit sweet but this one goes way too far for me.

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"For a sweet and powdery perfume fan (which I am) this is a great perfume. It is yummy sweet due to paroline. No harsh ingredients, no spices. Cozy, sweet, worm and so relaxing. It's very calming. Vanilla is fluffy and sweet no bitter tones. It is slightly reminds of original Kenzo Flower and only in the beginning. I got a small splash first to see if I like it. I do and think will love it. It has more longevity and it is much prettier. It gives this fluffy feeling. Very happy perfume. Best worn in cold weather go sure. I don't find any unpleasant stages in this perfume, and dry down is the best part. I am sitting here at my desk getting occasional swifts of this gorgeous sweetness and I feel like whatever is going on I could not care less.",11/19/15 08:06,Owlsova72
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"It's lovely. Warm, soft, cozy. Autumn and winter dream.
It reminds me of Amour Indian Holi version thanks to a gentle, warm, mysterious fruity aura it creates, and of Diamonds edp thanks to the warm raspberry note.
It has a lot in common with original Flower as well - the warmth, gentle powdery cozy notes, but they are toned down here and in exchange, fruity, gourmand notes are more prominent.
The praline is not of the obnoxious type, that's a relief, because although I like pralines, they are now trailing after every woman in a mall thanks to LVEB and similar gourmand clones.
This one is well balanced.
The bottle looks like it holds a delicious love potion.
Highly recommended.",11/11/15 04:43,MademoiselleMaya
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"So many years have passed since I have smelled this... but in this elixir I've recognized immediatily Flower by Kenzo (one of the first scents I had). Maybe sweeter, but Flower is still here. I am using it right now after a shower. Update wil follow.

The first what I smell is the sweet raspberry and mandarine. Vanilla is the second. It is a gorgeus scent that fast changes from raspberries to rose with powdery notes around. I see people comparing this scent with LVEB, Angel, Tresor and Midnight Rose. I don't recognize these scents in Kenzo Elixir (I have had all of them). If you like Flower by Kenzo you will love this too because Flower by Kenzo keeps coming and going in between. You will get all notes they promisse.

Ps: the drydown is a sweet skinscent and there is something that reminds Angel and flankers after all. Longevity is on the skin more then 12 hours but after the first hour soft sillage. I do smell it though if I come into my bedroom and walk by my scarf.",10/30/15 10:58,lilymorena
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Cherry licquor smell (must be partly due to boubon vanilla). I saw a few other people said it smells like cherries but their comments were deleted. When smelling my wrist the scent is intense but it does not have much of a sillage and I wouldnt want it to either because not everyone around you will like the scent. It feels quite luxurious and made me feel quite sexy when first wearing it. I think this is because I usually go for lighter florals and citrus, lighter scents. I consider this perhaps a more night time scent. I could imagine someone wearing dark red velvet wearing this. It is a bit too sweet for me. Although I like some fruity scents it turns out I dont like overly sweet ones. Not a fan of cherry, almond, marzipan (someone below mentioned marzipan). There are few foods I dont like and wont eat and marzipan is one. So, although I can appreciate it, it's a dislike from me. If it was more like raspberries smell in real life with the boubon vanilla I may like it. I feel the scent is made well - you dont get an alcoholic smell that is separate from the scent, or a faint scent somewhere within the alcohol like some scents Ive tried (including expensive ones).
Compared to the kenzo original (not l'eau originalle, which is a separate one), it is just a different scent. It could be made by a different brand or in a different line. They do both have a slight raspberry/rose smell but thats it for me. The original smells 'dirtier' to me, more earthy (has smell a bit more like earth combined in it). I think those eho like deep cherry smell would like this. I may be up for swapping this sample as it's not really me (uk only).",10/28/15 03:49,Purplegem
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"This is my experience. There are 3 distinct phases:

1 - Explosion of raspberry, flowers, praline and vanilla. It is sweet, but not too sweet. Deep red, if I were to assign a colour. Fruity, floral and gourmand - but in a classy way, not tacky. Absolutely jaw-droppingly... Makes me want to chew my wrist.

2 - Fruit, praline and sweetness swell. It crosses the border into ""candy"" territory. Smells very jammy and syrupy. It is at this point that I call it a monsterous creation, and wish I had never sprayed.

3 - Creamy undertones of milk and vanilla are like cool tides, washing over the cloying sweetness and turning it into a refined perfume once more. I declare it a work of art and consider buying a bottle.

The end.",10/26/15 06:58,Taliera
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I like it and I'm not a Kenzo Flower fan! To be honest I truly dislike original Kenzo Flower, because to my nose it smells like burned plastic sprinkled with powerful cold powder.
This Elixir smells different. It's sweet, yes, and floral. I don't usually go for sweet, but this one is not cloying. There is a spicy sweet edge together with flowers.
Anyway this is not my idea of a dark perfume, if I ever wanted a dark perfume. It seems to me that nowadays ""dark"" is same with ""sweet"". You feel a dark/black bottle with sugar and some dark berries and it's done: your new dark perfume.
Not dark, but quite joyful.
The raspberry is very noticeable in the opening and it doesn't seem to bother me. After the initial burst the scent gets tamed and stays so for long time. No much of evolution. It's still going now after many hours, a little in background, but with same smell as the beginning.
Anyway it smelled familiar to me since. Very familiar. I read it smells like LVEB... not really. I smelled it again and again, then realised! Of course, it smells familiar: it's Lancome Miracle! Not the latest re-formulation, rather the first one many years ago. It was so tenacious on my skin. Both me and other people could smell it after hours. There was an intense version and a Miracle Forever.
Kenzo l'Elixir smells like the spicy sugared version of Miracle.",10/14/15 15:19,Mellyhelly
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"At first sniff, this perfume is like most new releases: sweet, musky with an underlying gourmand accord running through it.
Once it sits on your skin for 5 minutes, the most beautiful raspberry appears and enchants you until the dry-down. Coupled with the raspberry is a marshmallowy-musk, tinged with a cherry blossom character. The feel for the scent has shifted from very sweet at first to an exotic oriental. You can smell the darker tones- even my husband thought I was burning nag champa incense but it was just my perfume!!!

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Gorgeous! ! Dark version of the original edp. The hawthorn note that I dislike appears to be absent in this. Syrupy sweet quality but in a mature deep way.

I think I need to re test but seems to be close to the skin scent. Sigh. What I love about this is that it's not powdery, fruity, vanilla based or rough smelling but smooth deep and elixir like! Definately agree with the reviewer it has a soft lakhoum vibe. No almond hardness just well blended smoothness. Love.

Update after one hour:
This smells like a smoother version of jo Malone rose oud on me.
Crazy! The dry down reminds me of many perfumes without patchouli added to them. Like the flowerbomb or LVEB vibe minus through patchouli .

Oh gosh that same vibe from the body shop smoky rose!!! Esp the edp version. Please test this from beginning to end before getting to excited to purchase. It does change from beginning till the dry down. I prefer the initial phase.",09/24/15 06:14,Shwets

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"I agree with the reviewer below me. This started out wonderfully! It was almost a dark cherry marshmallow scent on me. Neither cherry or marshmallow are in the notes, but that's what it reminded me of.

It's hard to believe that some reviewers could not detect the original flower in this, though. It's definitely there; and on the drydown, it comes out in full force and is very similar to the original. I would buy this if the top notes stayed around, but no.. The drydown kills it for me. I used to own flower, but sold it.

Sillage and longevity are good with this one. Nice fragrance, but wait for the drydown before breaking out your wallet..",09/12/15 11:04,dannysmom
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Flower L'elixir makes wonderful addition to all Flower line. It definitely has this Flower core with smooth powdery base. Opening is very sweet but at the same time light. I was expecting something dense and thick. It reminds me of pimped up version of Flower Tag edp rather than any other perfume.
It's sweet, comforting and cozy. After 3 hours of wearing i was left with exact the same scent as Flower Le Parfum. I don't mind as i'm fan of all scents from this line but this makes L'elixir not that unique. Sillage is enormous for the first hour and then it gets quiet delivering pleasure to the one who's wearing it.",09/09/15 07:19,anna.glowacka
Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"So it looks I am not the only one finding it similar to La Vie est Belle. Sad, are we facing a historical turn where everything will smell Lancome like instead of Mr. Mugler’s Angel or Chanel’s Coco Mademoisele? Smelt it on paper, I still have a little sample I got with something else but it doesn’t appeal to me since I got such a strong vibe of La Vie est Belle when tried it first time that I was put off.
I love the initial one much more than this cocktail kind of thing. Sorry, Mr. Morillas, this time U disappointed me, a bit.
UpDate: Feb 2016: for those days I feel like reaching for a sweet fragrance this has become my choice. I have to just think of it as a non Kenzo Flower like and non LVB either and that may quite work. How much more fun that iris in the middle would have been if just a tiny bit brought more front.....

Flower by Kenzo L'Elixir Kenzo,"Morillas did a great job on that one! It is definitely what an elixir would smell like, strong, intense, oriental...I personally like it a lot, and I don't find it similar to Nuit de Tresor, which I disliked..due to the patchouli..no patchouli in Flower l' Elixir...but they are both warm scents..I much prefer the Kenzo.
In a way it makes me think of Black opium without the coffee note, and of Dior addict, in a smoother version...
Like it isn't anything new, but in the category of orientals, this is nicely done..
I wouldn't put it though I n the category of fruity gourmands, it isn't sweet per se, although in the drydown, the original Flower comes through, in a more warmer tone...and fruity, no, I dont smell that..it even has a smokey undertone on my skin.
I smell a very pretty floral oriental, with dominant bourbon vanilla and orange blossom, I don't detect the raspberry, but others might..

Ciel Magnolia Kenzo,"Not being a huge magnolia fan (as a kid, I was always nauseous in the car, and since magnolia was its interior spray, I made a bad link, unfortunately), this fragrance didn't speak much to me.

All I smell is a musk-magnolia blend that for me is nothing extraordinary and a bit boring.

But I can see why people like this fragrance, it's really pretty and doesn't bother anyone around me. Soft, floral and musky (and slightly woody). Not at all sweet for me!

Reminds me a lot of a perfume I smelled on a friend: Maios by Lofty Paris.

Ciel Magnolia Kenzo,"Synthetic. I fell in love with the opening -it was like waking up to a 22ºC spring morning and taking your dog for a walk by the lake, so I almost bought it without waiting for it to develop, and then... A pure, synthetic disappointment.",12/03/23 14:35,prancingponytail

Ciel Magnolia Kenzo,"Nice powdery floral scent, very much in line with the trend we´ve been seeing in all major designer brands for their perfume lines. I got a decant as a gift for purchasing other perfumes. Frankly I wouldn´t buy the full bottle because I have other flowery/powdery scents that have better performance at a similar price. It has a hint of sweetness to it too....reminds me (distantly) of Red Temptation by Zara.",10/09/23 10:28,AgusMartinez

Ciel Magnolia Kenzo,Amazing floral fragrance smells like an expensive cream. So relaxing before bed i fell in love at first snif. Sillage is very moderate yet i love it so much i had to get it.,07/09/23 06:04,hamidouhanane101
Ciel Magnolia Kenzo,"Fleur Narcotique of Ex Nihilo is one of my favorite perfumes of all times. This is a very good dupe by the same perfumer, but with totally different notes. So, just forget about the pyramid here.
When I smell my skin it is a bit different than FN: there is a tiny bitter note somewhere under the bright florals, but the silage is almost identical to FN. The radiating power is very strong, you will not pass anywhere unnoticed.

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"An incredible plum and peony scent.
The plum scent lasts forever until the very end.
Huh? Doesn't this have any patchouli in it?

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Ugh, this was such a disappointment. I liked all the listed notes and blind-bought it for a good price. I was especially intrigued by the plum note, which I love. Expected some overlap with e.g. MJ's Decadence or Guerlain's Baiser de Russie but less complex, more linear perhaps. So, linear it is (on me). But instead of plum, I got a blast of tobacco that lingered, and the plum note to me read more like a screechy, medicinal cherry or cherry pits. There is zero tartness (which would be fine) and nothing to really soften or balance the sharpness of the uber-sweet cough-drop quality, even in the drydown. I couldn't wait to scrub it off, once I had it on me long enough to make sure it wasn't gonna turn into something amazing (or at least wearable). Happy to swap or otherwise offload this one.",02/06/25 11:53,MimiStahl
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"I was super excited about this perfume as the notes are really intriguing and exactly what I tend to gravitate toward. I’m not sure if I got a bad bottle, but I get such a strong scent of tobacco immediately, and that overpowers anything else that I can smell - even on the dry down. I love Kenzo World EDP, but this one is just so different from the OG. I’m hoping it’ll macerate over time and get a little better, but for now it honestly gives me a stomach ache to smell",12/25/24 07:04,LupusWarrior2024
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Underrated gem.
I quite like this one.

I never hear or see anyone talking about this fragrance on social media.
Kenzo World Intense is my favourite from their line second to Flower. I don't own or care for their other fragrances. I'm sure they're lovely on others but these two are my faves.
Another underdog perfume this one reminds me of is Burberry Black (Francis Kurkdjian creator of infamous Bacarat Rouge)

Luckily found it on sale for $59 AUD. It kind of smells like the Lush store when you walk past. In a high end kind of way. It's musky & fruity. It's extremely strong upon first spray which is why I'd assume people don't like it at first. It's unique. feminine. Original. Smells expensive & honestly if it was sold by a ""fancier"" brand like YSL or Chanel it would be more popular.

So this one is great if you aren't a label snob & want something that is good value, sweet & want to stand out.

I have so many expensive fragrances and affordable ones in my collection and I try not to be biased and follow the crowd.

It's definitely not for everyone. I think you should give this a try but definitely not a blind buy kind of fragrance.",11/02/24 22:23,MissLuella
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Came here after watching the Kenzo World perfume advertisement video directed by Spike Jonze in which actress Margaret Qualley does a very outlandish unbelievable athletic fantasy dance routine. Really fell down a rabbit hole tonight in that the Taylor Swift music video I was watching called Delicate was reviewed as being too derivative of the Kenzo World video. So I watched the Kenzo World video, too. Both videos feature strange facial expressions, some very ungainly and rather uncoordinated but seemingly quite difficult dance moves, extremely weird sequences, etc..Both videos are what I guess would be called avant garde. Not sure I understand much about either video, but the Kenzo one must have fulfilled its purpose if I came here.",02/24/24 22:08,makeupmaven1967
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Kenzo World Intense is an underrated fruity floral gourmand fragrance. The opening is heavy on the juicy plum note. The peony adds subtle freshness and the jasmine adds elegant floral touch to the fragrance. The vanilla here is powdery sweet and alluring. Overall it's a perfect balance of fresh florals with juicy sweetness. The smell is elegant yet sexy. Also it's perfect for formal occasions as well as romantic date nights too. If you're using it as a signature scent or for any formal occasions then 3-5 sprays will be enough to serve such purposes. But for date nights or parties I prefer to go heavy on the sprays. Kenzo World Intense creates a beautiful Scent bubble and leaves an amazing scent trail. Longevity is around 6-8 hours depending on skin chemistry but it lasts longer on clothes.
I enjoy this fragrance during spring and the rainy season but it can be used all year round too. If you're looking for a fruity floral gourmand fragrance then give Kenzo World Intense a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed ❤️",02/13/24 05:30,TasniaTanisha
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"I purchased this fragrance without letting it settle on my skin first. Personally, I find it challenging to wear; it's strong, but not in a way that has an impressive sillage. The scent itself is heavy, definitely more suitable for winter and nighttime wear. To me, it feels overbearing, akin to eating too many cinnamon rolls without a glass of water. I believe a good alternative might be Black Opium by Yves Saint Laurent.",12/22/23 14:37,demi1504
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Wow. Deep, plummy, syrupy vanillic floral. This is definitely not a warm weather nor daytime fragrance. Perfect for cold weather. I see it being compared to decadence, but I don’t think they’re similar. Decadence is much smokier, and KWI is far sweeter. This is definitely a sexy fragrance. I have a winter trip in NYC coming up, and I’ll definitely be wearing this on a chilly night out. Very nice.",12/01/23 10:48,LEM922

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"I was afraid to buy this as the opinions are strong. Curiosity got me and my bottle arrived. Some said it smells like juicy fruit gum, applied lightly - yes that's exactly what it smells like. Someone else said this needs to be applied with a heavy hand, yes it does. When applied heavily it awakens like a low growl becoming dark, juicy, tart, and deeply vanillic. It smells intoxicating, ready for a November evening when heavily applied on skin. I sprayed a lot so I had a big scent bubble and longevity but I feel it would be similar if applied with a lighter hand. It can smell somewhat synthetic, but I don't mind it. If you have Olympéa Legend this is redundant which it kind of is for me! But I will keep her for now :)",07/31/23 17:18,tsubaki3031
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Quite a unique fruity fragrance, but I don’t think it’s a love for me. The plum is very prominent, and as this isn’t a common note, it definitely gives it a point of difference. It almost has a ‘cold’ character compared to other fruity perfumes - more sour/tart than sweet/juicy. I get a bit of florals but I’d say this more of a fruity than a floral perfume. I actually don’t get much sweetness from the vanilla. Overall it’s interesting and unique but I think it would work better as a candle than a perfume - I think it’s just a bit too sour for me.",03/11/23 18:38,arizonaruby
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"The dry down is almost identical (if not identical) to my holy grail, number 1 perfume, My Burberry Black, but as if it’s a poor man’s version. Not nearly as deep or long lasting.

Very tart plum, has a masculine edge, and this fragrance also doesn’t last.

This is a big nope for me. I gave it to my niece.

I wouldn’t say it’s bad. But it doesnt measure up to my other fragrances.",01/30/23 18:46,herculano
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"The opening is very strong and reminds me very much of Bond No 9 ‘I love New York Holidays’ and also a touch of angel. Also something also reminds me of Wish from Chopard. It smells like there is something that reminds of patchouli. I definitely agree with some people saying the opening smells somewhat masculine, but then when it dries down you get the floral qualities. It’s not overly fruity, the floral quality is equal. Certainly smells very complex and expensive! The bottle is beautiful!",01/27/23 19:11,Actorfellow
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"I really liked it when I smelled it at the store.. but the reasons I loved it at first ended up being why I didn’t like it. The plum and vanilla come across as experimental not well blended or balanced, so that beautiful bust of plum and vanilla I enjoyed at first sniff became a persistent and artificial scent on my skin throughout the day, this was distracting and a little obnoxious to the point of headaches. The simplicity of not having too many notes ended up coming across as more simplistic/generic as there was no journey and nothing to break the monotonous scent. Although there aren’t too many notes the fragrance still come across like it’s trying too hard, which was weird. A little too playful, It feels like a night out fragrance and we keep it at that. I really wanted to love this because I’m a big fan of the perfumers and I was curious about the blend of plum and vanilla, but I ended up giving the bottle away. I can see how some people might enjoy this, it has a people pleaser side to it especially at first sniff or short periods of time.. it’s not a bad fragrance, but not a safe blind buy. Test it, wear it around and see if you like before you buy. If you don’t like candy sweet fragrances, you likely wouldn’t enjoy it.",12/29/22 12:31,onosowobo
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Figured it out! This is one of those perfumes, to my nose, you must spray heavy. One spray on each wrist & done makes it smell super masculine. The heavier I spray the more the plum & sweet vanilla comes out and the more that weird masculine note fades. I totally understand the juicy fruit comment now too. It smells divine, only if you're heavy handed though!! I wore it heavy to give it one last real try the other night as I was cleaning and omg I haven't been able to put it down since, I kept getting the most beautiful whiffs of dark plum vanilla. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this now. Great longevity and projection too btw. You just have to be all in with this beauty.",12/09/22 22:43,WifeyPink
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"This smells quite powerful to me, which is exactly what I wanted. On my skin, I can smell plum and peony. This smell has captured my heart. This is contemporary, fruity, and just a little floral. It has a highly invigorating scent in my opinion. This is a terrific fall evening and night scent since it has a hint of sultriness and I adore how the vanilla and black plum combine. I wish the sweetness would have persisted through the drydown, but the heart is much more floral. With the vanilla note present, some sweetness reappears in the base, but it never gets syrupy or cloying. Amazing longevity, silage and projection.",07/19/22 04:06,emmayoung537
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"KWI is mainly a juicy, plump plum with sweet, warm vanilla. The floral notes help keep it fresh, so it’s not overbearingly sweet. The performance is good but by no means “intense” .

It would probably not be as great if it sat on a base of patchouli. It actually reminded me of la Petite Robe Noir Intense with the fruity opening, but I got sick of this one quickly due to it sitting on a patchouli base.

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,Okay so I collect perfumes and I'm always looking for something that's going to blow my mind and this is unbelievable. I love it so much. Huge difference from Kenzo world. On my skin the plum stands out the most and not just during the top notes. It really sticks around. Now I found out they have another one called Kenzo World intense fantasy collection that looks similar and looks like it's the same notes. It's for sale in the UK. Does anyone know if there's any difference between this one and the one called fantasy collection? I think it's the same exact thing but I'm not willing to purchase an entire bottle of it to find out,10/31/21 16:20,waskotransportation

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"I don't understand the relatively low rating for this fragrance. It's a really good and unique fruity floral. The plum is delicious. A safe buy for anyone who enjoys sweet, juicy, fruity scents.

Also, I don't quite get the comparison to Decadence (I did compare them next to each other). In the opening, they are indeed somewhat similar due to the plum. But even after 15min, these two are very different. Kenzo World Intense gets sweeter and more floral, while Decadence just stays Decadence :D (I really dislike it, too sharp and unpleasant for my nose).

This Kenzo is really nice, and if I'm in the mood to get myself a mood-boosting, jammy fruity scent, I'll definitely consider this.

Update: I bought it :) Love it!",08/07/21 02:43,missogi
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Light and floral with a bit of depth from the plum. Not the most exciting (I much prefer the plum in decadence which is very intense on me), but an easy, yet unique fragrance that I happily wear to the office when I want to switch up my regulars.

As a non professional sniffer I can detect plum with vanilla and very pleasant jasmine. And I love me some sweet juicy jasmine 🤤 I’m getting a little bit of Alien vibe, but I’m not saying they are similar, just very similar style and direction. I think if you like Alien you must like this too.
I really don’t like the cap though 😅 it creeps me out and I can’t explain why 😂 the bottle looks actually better without it.

This is a perfume I would wanna wear to cheer my self up (in these gloomy quarantine days). The scent is sweet, bright, and unique. Love the silage, love to smell this scent on me, but I wouldn't wanna wear it just anywhere outside. It's kinda night occasion perfume to me.

Tbh I don't expect much from woman's perfume line because I don't really like floral and fruity, mostly I tried men's and I do often prefer theirs (like, I love Versace Eros), this one though, is an exception.

Maybe because I like bold scent. And this is bold. This is my signature. Would totally repurchase once I run out. This is a must-have perfume for me.",04/05/20 23:52,agate.ne
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"Sometimes I look back at the Kenzo World range and think:

- Kurkdijan is overrated.
- The marketing for this range is more intriguing and memorable than the scents themselves.

Not that they are bad fragrances, nor do they smell cheap like Victoria's Secret body sprays. I have to give Kenzo credit for that.

This is just a super syrupy plum. Peformance is alright, very acceptable for eau de parfum. I can't really smell the floral notes on my skin.
It is definitely not worth the price or the marketing.

It's basically a less sophisticated version of Marc Jacob's Decadence EDP. They tried to make the original Kenzo World more cold-weather oriented...but went with questionable scent choices.

Verdict: Definitely try before you buy. Purchase during mega-sales because then it is kind of worth i(?).",01/04/20 05:59,Palmer Eldritch

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"~Peach nectar, a heart of plum and a warm vanilla base~
I never have much luck with making Fragrantica's smell-a-likes function work, which is a shame because I value comparisons. Having owned both perfumes I can tell you this smells a lot like the much more niche and highly revered (especially in the mid-noughties on MakeUpAlley) Frapin 1270. It's the plum - it's almost identical, and the main feature of both fragrances.
I think Kenzo World Intense can somehow work as a beachy fragrance as well as a winter warmer. Very versatile. A bit of a sneeze inducer at first spray, but very enjoyable, attractive and plummy. The vanilla is warm, there's a sexy, musky sweetness, and enough of a pop of vinyl for it to feel modern. I also happen to love the bottle. It feels great in the hand and when the eye bounces against the glass of the bottle it tinkles.",06/09/19 11:54,pennypencil

I love it from my first testing till now when I've got a decant in perfume swap. On my skin is fruity peony with vanilla undertones which evolves musky on my skin- am I the only one? It must be jasmin. When I dislike the first K. World is this pure love. But I understand this one never could be a crowd pleaser, it's so different to other fragrances.
It has a good sillage and longevity on me.

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"I am a perfume collector that somehow doesn't have anything from Kenzo in my collection. I first ordered the EDT of Kenzo world because of the horrible reviews on this site for this fragrance and the Kenzo World EDP. The EDT was lovely so I progressed to this one. The plum is to DIE for.

this smells very strong to me which is what I wanted and honestly I smell Plum and peony on my skin. those are actually both of my two favorite notes. I'm in love with this fragrance. It'll never become my signature and take the place of Chloe EDP but this is certainly something that I gravitate towards at least once a week. There are so many horrible perfumes available to us that are truly awful and somehow have higher reviews than this one. This is modern fresh fruity and slightly Floral. To me it's a very energizing fragrance. It deserves a 5-star review. now that I have the other two I'm going for the original Kenzo EDP. I thought I would never buy that because the ratings were truly awful but then again so are the ratings for this.

It's slightly warmer and sweeter than Kenzo World in my opinion. After one hour the sourness is gone and I like it again. This might be different on somebody else!,10/20/17 07:21,AnitaHendricks
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"I really love the super sweet, ripe, juicy plum note in the opening of Kenzo World Intense! It combines with the peony and jasmine beautifully! I love intensely sweet perfumes, so I wish that sweetness lasted throughout the drydown, but it gets much more floral in the heart. Some of the sweetness returns in the base with the presence of the vanilla note, but it never becomes syrupy or sugary. Longevity is good on me, around 5 hours. This is beautiful, and different from other recent mainstream scents!",09/30/17 12:53,Jillzilla
Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"No offense to those who love this because I'm sure it smells lovely on you. On me, it smells very sticky and cloying. It made me feel sick, and so is my dad. It projects really loud on me. It is what I love about Kenzo perfumes. They all perform really well. I think it's perfect for people whose skin eats up perfumes. This would probably smell lovely to me if it is less loud and screeching. Because it is so strong it gives me impression of the plum being overripe.",09/30/17 01:46,MissAnnette

Kenzo World Intense Kenzo,"It is just coming out here in France..they had a tester and they were nice enough to let me try it!
Well, it is better than the first one in my opinion., it has a warmer vibe, and gets rather sweet in the base..it is more rounded and smoother too... it is kind of a vanillic oriental. Not heady but it has presence..I am not sure it is my cup of tea, but in winter it would certainly be pleasant to wear..I wasn't like impressed overly with it, it still has a bit of the original in it, but more likeable...if you didn't like the first one, you might enjoy this version..I am kind of liking it, nothing more..well done, but not a huge want for me !
UPDATE: I went again to try it, and my husband liked it, and I found it to smell great on my skin, so I bought it! It is a bit unusual, but the notes are so well blended in.,",08/25/17 05:57,genny17

L'Eau par Kenzo Electric Wave pour Homme Kenzo,"I am a huge fan of the house of Kenzo and bought this online in 2020 for a good price having smelled it in duty free previously when it was first released. I love the bottle too. The smell is very interesting. A crisp yuzu/grapefruit/apple that goes to a woody dry down, the apple is very crisp and sharp. It kind of IS 'electric', and yet I am still not sure it beats the orignal L'Eau Par which I love. I see this is very rare now and I have used half my bottle which causes me conflict between being a collector and someone who enjoys using fragrances to wear them. If this was still in production the fact is I would probably not buy it again. REALLY nice, but not a classic for me. These flankers are released as if to be used in the heady summer of their relase year and then forgotten. Had I spent that summer of 2016 in endless Ibiza pool parties (I wish) I'd have blazed through this. Ah well...fragrance is a fantasy...fun at the time...and then often gone until another one comes along. UPDATE: As my bottle wears down to the bottom, I must say the drydown is kind of odd...almost like the opening apple accords have gone brown and sour. The mix of citrus and woods creates an odd smell. Not awful but...a bit strange. So in conculsion: Beautiful opening, odd drydown. 7/10.",03/31/21 11:43,CoffeeAddict1

Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"Fruity white floral. Sugary warm vanilla base.
Only had it on ten minutes, and so far it does smell a bit ‘purple’ fruity, and floral, I can smell both the tuberose (a bit bubble gummy) and jasmine (a bit heady). It’s more floral than frutiy.

Edit: dries to a sugary warm vanilla, very nice, not synthetic, but definitely designer when compared to the rum present in modern day niche fragrances (ie no rum here!)

Edit: tried it again, and it’s now very, very, Berry. More tart berry than floral, and hardly any vanilla or caramel or anything other than a slight sweetness.",02/14/22 07:48,*loves_shoes*
Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"Blind Buy - This is fruity, sweet and pleasant but it’s nothing to write home about. That’s not to say I don’t like it, it’s just very simple and straightforward. Nothing magical or groundbreaking.

It starts off with a sharp, tart rush of blackberry but quickly mellows out to a sweet, deep berry. I don’t get a distinct caramel not so much as just an over all indiscernible sweetness. It’s nice though, and I enjoy it.

I think this would be best suited for colder months as the berry is quite deep, it doesn’t strike me as a fresh or summery scent at all.",01/03/22 20:40,jmarie92
Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"I blind bought it on a sale. First impressions: it's kinda average, it starts sharp I smell the blackberry immediately, but in a few minutes it settles down to a really nice fragrance that is warm and less sharp ( I loved the sharpness tho). I would love it to stay that way, it's really interesting, but in an hour it starts to smell like vanilla (that is pretty average, not like the vanilla in Si intense the black bottle which was just gorgeous for instance) and that's the only thing I can smell. If there's vanilla in a scent pretty soon it overcomes everything else and you can only smell only the vanilla on me, it's like this with every fragrance. So I got a good first hour- it's a really nice sharp and warm at the same time scent, than it settles down to vanilla as a skin scent and I could smell it on my wrist in the morning as well. If it smelled like the first hour the entire time I would say it's an exceptional perfume, but it doesn't. I wouldn't buy this if it's not on sale, it's too expensive for a skin scent. If I can get a strong scent from a perfume for 6 hours at least I'm happy. I don't like very feminine scents, I like perfumes that stand out and have a good (strong) sillage. I'm an Euphoria fan and I'm very happy with it.
As a conclusion; I don't recommend buying this if it's not on sale, it's warm and nice, but a skin scent (unless you like it being this way) it's average, it kinda smell like many other perfumes. While it's still sharp and kinda sweet/warm (so the first hour) It reminds me a little bit of YSL Black Opium. I would say just buy Black Opium, or if you're a fan of Black Opium try this one as well, maybe you'll like it, but Black Opium has a better performance I think.",11/30/21 21:40,DorothyOz

I have to say it's very similar to Salvatore Ferragamo Signorina Misteriosa. Kenzo is better for me, less sweet, but deeper and stronger, juicier and fizzier.

Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"Amazing sweetly citrus berry boozy vanilla. I love this sort of scent - gourmands are on high rotation with me at the moment. Earthy smooth patchouli and sandalwood keeps this grounded and from being too girly and sweet. This is a high quality vanilla based fragrance with moderate projection and longevity. It's perfect for both evening and everyday wear, and the combo of fruit and vanilla means I can wear this year round.

I do think this is a little more feminine than most of my other gourmands, but it would work as a masculine fragrance as well. I don't get a lot of floral which is odd as I'm very sensitive to too much tuberose.

Overall - very well blended and balanced and a happy blind buy. If you like gourmands, you'll love this.",04/20/18 17:33,chloematilda

On me, it is a warm, rich and powdery caramel, with a intensive berry opening.
Not my thing, because i don't like caramel and i also don't like berries, but i have to say the caramel note is superbly done here. Caramel fans will surely love this fragrance. Berry fans will also like this, but keep in mind that the berry note here is intense but short lived.

Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"And when I thought Kenzo can't really make gourmands, here comes this fragrance.

Opening with dark and prominet blackberry followed by very present caramel.

The drydown doesn't change it much if you ask me. I get some vanilla, unfortunately I can't detect rum, and some floral notes in the background, I wish jasmine would be more prominent here.

Sweet, warm, comforting. It's not like I would get a bottle myself, but I have to pay Kenzo some respect for this one.

Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"I love Jeu d'Amour as a fresh floral daytime scent, I like Kenzo in general so I was very curious for the Jeu d'Amour flankers.

L'Elixir starts with a super strong raspberry/strawberry and vanilla combination. It's funny, the Félin flanker has a strawberry note but smells more like blackberry to me, and this has a blackberry note and smells like strawberry. It's extremely sweet.
The tuberose that is in all Jeu d'Amour scents joins the fruity notes, at this phase it's a bit similar to the original Jeu.
Now I notice a difference depending on the weather. As I tested it in warm weather on the inside of my elbow, it got really weird. It smelled like caramel, but also like monoi oil and a bit fruity. Very heady and like a crude mixture and somehow also like a shower gel.
I later tested it again on my arm in cooler temperatures and now it dried down to a sweeter Jeu d'Amour with a strong berry and a slight boozy note.

Overall I'm not impressed. The cool skin version is okay, not great but not bad, the warm skin version is just uuuugh. Might be better on different people, of course, but try with caution.
The original Jeu d'Amour EDP is still the best scent from this line.",07/31/17 10:03,SailorV
Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"The opening of this reminds me of Escada's Magnetism. Tart berries mixed with something green, patchouli in this case. Whereas Magnetism had patch, basil, cassis and green leaves. I do pick up on a hint of citrus and florals. Sweet and tart without being cloying/candy-like.

Pleasant, but nothing ground-breaking. Having owned Magnetism for several years I think I've done by dash in this department.",07/11/17 20:45,MiuMiuKitten

موافقم عطری هست که به رنگ شیشه ان هست.بنفش پررنگ چون بیشترین چیزی که می شود حس کرد بلک بری هست.مثل دسری هست از مارمالاد بلک بری و خامه و یک گیلاس شراب گرون قیمت تو یه رستوران فنسی با جنتلمتی که شما رو شب بذده انجا و نثل یه ملکه باهاتون رفتار میکنه.این عطر هم برای یک ملکه سکسی هست نه یک شازده خانوم کوچولو.اولش بوی ترش و شیرین مارمالاد بلک بری و یه شات کوچیک شراب را میشه حس کرد اما بعد یاس و مریم بویی شبیه خامه سفید ایجاد می کنن و شدت شیرینی عطر کمتر میشه بعد هم مقدار کمی نعنای هندی.من هیچ پرتقال یا وانیلی حس نمی کنم.این عطر خیلی خیلی خوشبو و جذاب هست.ماندگاری خیلی خوبی هم دارد اما مشکل پخش دارد.هرموقع جایی که عطر زدم را بو می کنم می بینم هنوز بویی کاملا قوی و مشخص دارد ولی وقتی بیرون هستم اصلا حس نمی کنم بوی عطر از من برخاسته.ولی دوستانم میگن که حتی وقتی از جایی بیرون میری تا مدتعا رد عطرت پیداست پخش شاید پخشش هم کم نباشه.این عطر گرم و شیرین هست و اصلا مناسب تابستان نیست

Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"It's the first time I'm trying it on my skin and I find it sweet,delightful,luxurious,classy,seductive,charming and feminine in a mature way
If you're not into sweet scents it's not for you.it opens sweet with fruit notes/black berry and becomes even more syrupy sweet as it dries down thanks to the boozy vanilla and caramel.but there's enough florals to give it a mature,ladylike vibe and a hint of patchouli,sandalwood and rum to give it depth
It's not a childish candy but a sensual delicious confection
I can't compare it with original jeu d'amour because I've just tried that one on paper but elixir version seems to be less floral, warmer,sweeter,a tad darker and all in all more likable for me,so I chose it over original and I think I'm gonna use it alot in these fall and winter nights
It's an hour I've applied it and it's just as strong as first minute.it seems to have a good sillage(which is more important for me than Longevity) I really like this one
Edit:
After a couple of full wears I can say that I'm very glad with my purchase,not anything ground breaking but still it's delicious,sexy and classy. and I may repurchase it whenever my 50 mil tester bottle finishes.it's rich,seductive and delicious.I'm loving this lovely combination of black berry,caramel, tuberose and boozy vanilla, so deep and sweet and stays easily on my skin for +8 hours with a good projection.it smells just like the color of bottle
If you're a gourmand lover and you're +25 give it a try
P.s:I agree about similarities with signorina misteriosa but this one has more syrupy/caramelized sweetness and is a tad richer,all in all I prefer Kenzo but I may consider buying ferragamo instead of repurchasing kenzo just to experience a new one
It also reminds me of Loewe Quizas Seduction which I love but that one is a lot more floral/tuberose dominant

از اونجا ک کنزو ژوغ د امور رو فقط روی بلاتر تست کردم نمیتونم مقایسه دقیقی بین اون و ورژن الکسیر انجام بدم فقط چیزی ک من بطور کلی حس کردم این بود ک الکسیر کمتر گلی هست همینطور گرمتر،شیرین،کمی تیره تر و درکل برای من دوست داشتنی تر و درضمن بیشتر مناسب فصل سرماست، بهمین خاطر بین این دوتا ژوغ د امور الکسیر رو درحال حاضر انتخاب کردم(هرچند هنوز چشمم دنبال ژوغ د امور اولیه هم هست)
کنزو ژوغ د امور الکسیر یه عطر گرم و شیرینه پس اگه دوستدار عطرهای شیرین نیستید بعیده بپسندینش.. شروع عطر با رایحه شیرین و غلیظ توت سیاه همراهه ک رایحه غالب عطر هست و تا آخر عمر عطر حضور داره، این عطر به تدریج با حضور کارامل و وانیل آغشته به رام،شیرینتر هم میشه منتها به لطف مریم ک بعنوان امضای ژوغ د امور تو قلب عطر حضور داره،رایحه خانومانه ای به خودش میگیره..پچولی و صندل و رام(عرق نیشکر)تو بیس عطر فقط نقش عمیقتر و غنی تر کردن عطر رو بعهده دارن وگرنه بازیگر اصلی رو پوست من شراب توت سیاه هست با شیرینی غلیظ و شربت مانند کارامل و مقدار خیلی ناچیزی روایح خامه ای و نرم گلی و چوبی..رایحه کاملا خوشمزه ای داره ک به هیچ وجه بچگونه نیست.کاملا شیک و زنانه و جذابه و اگه دوستدار عطرهای خوشمزه هستید و بالای 25 سال دارید و دنبال یه گزینه بالغ،ژوغ د امور الکسیر انتخاب خوبی میتونه باشه
موندگاری بالای 8 ساعت و پخش خوبی داره و بعنوان عطر مجلسی و قرارهای عصرانه و شبانه عالیه
راجع ب شباهتش ب سینیورینا میستریوزا هم موافقم ولی شیرینی کنزو چسبناکتر و کاراملی تر هست و درمجموع من این عطر کنزو رو به همتای فراگاموی خودش ترجیح میدم
درمجموع بااینکه عطر خاصی نیست خیلی دوسش دارم",11/16/16 12:26,Soofiya

Caramel , rum and mandarine is also detectable and it all goes so well together that I can't get enough of it. It manages to smell fresh ! Sweet fresh ! The patchouli is there but stubble , just enough to keep it earthy and grounded. Complete winner ! I bought this on my trip to Aruba and I can't find it here in Canada yet. I hope it gets here soon as I am half way done my bottle !
My husband loves it , he says it reminds him of poison. In fact he thought I was wearing poison when I wear this. This is definitely the same family and similar notes as poison but it's more modern and fresher with no incense. I prefer it to poison !",05/19/16 04:15,Germany

Jeu d'Amour l'Elixir Kenzo,"This is one of the most bizarre perfumes I've ever tried. I had a few spritzes on my arm and thought that it took a really long time for the alcohol to evaporate. After half an hour, I could only detect a super faint floral blackberry, with a bit of very soft vanilla lingering through and then it completely dissapeared on me after the two hour mark. I had another spritz on the back of my hand where it seemed to last a bit longer, but the sillage stayed very very soft. For some uncomprehensible reason, my nose seems incapable of detecting this scent. I find that it stays quite sharp and boozy, maybe because of the rum notes?

Not sold on this one, I much prefer the original Jeu d'Amour. The fact that they named this one elixir confuses me, because the original has a lot more intensity and a stronger sillage.",01/20/16 00:37,chiara.candaele

Pian piano si sviluppa il bouquet avvolgente,solare,voluttuoso,fatto di contrasti amari e dolci.
Il suo mese migliore è dicembre,l'atmosfera natalizia,il freddo fuori e le luci colorate trovano il migliore momento per questo profumo.
Mi suona strano che ancora oggi si parli di prestazioni ""bestia"" di questo profumo dal momento che oggi sono tutti intrugli chimici che puzzano a kilomettri di distanza, (gli oudh e la vie est belle regnano sovrani),questo ha una normale potenza,sviluppa in modo abbastanza intenso ma niente di tragico. Si sente per molto tempo la scia di eliotropio,vaniglia e cashmeran. Ma per me resta un buon profumo.",11/09/25 04:27,massimilianoinquieto
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This is a spicy but sweet perfume which is perfect for winter weather. The opening has bitter cloves and cumin in the top notes but as it settles it becomes sweeter softer and the florals become more noticeable. It is essentially a vanilla and amber fragrance with lovely aspects of fragrant spices; the cardamon is especially lovely. The performance is good but it is certainly not room filling like the reviews would have you believe. The bottle is the clunkiest and most uncomfortable bottle to hold ever, and the cap weighs a ton and is difficult to remove. It is easy to find in discount stores at a good price and is well worth the money.",10/29/25 09:41,onebadbaby

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I have been obsessing over this for over a year even thinking of blind buying it. I finally tested it in store and it was an experience for sure... When I first sprayed it I loved it! It smelled modern and intricate. Spicy and woody, a bit sweet a bit bitter and at the same time complex and playful. However as it developed on my skin it turned sweeter and more feminine and it also started reminding me of something... it smells exactly like my 60 year old aunt and must be her signature perfume I'm planning to ask her. I like my aunt a lot and she's a kind, lovely and beautiful woman but for some reason this association puts me off for some reason. But the worst thing for me is how sweet and feminine it got. On the small paper it still has the same character it had on the first spray. Needless to say I'm very disappointed... I really wanted this to work for me. My advice is to test it in store and leave it on for as many hours as possible before you make up your mind.",10/24/25 20:49,demiegel
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Considering repurchasing a bottle this winter, for nostalgia. This was my first big girl (or so I thought) perfume, I managed to snag it from my mom before leaving home for university. It made me feel all grown up, and put together and most importantly, strong. God, I was anxious studying in a country where I barely understood the language but this was my magic cloak every morning.

Thinking back I realize, this perfume taught me three things. I remember a colleague in a class sat next to me and yelled in agony: Omg, is that Kenzo Jungle?! You bet it is. So, I learned quickly, I absolutely do not care what people think! I like it, I wear it with pleasure. Second, it taught me everything, even good things, are best in moderation. :) And third, god how I LOVE spicy perfumes.

And the bottle is an absolute icon!!!",10/24/25 11:38,L.rist

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Theres some note I’m not quite on board with with this one. I like 90% of this fragrance but that 10% just smells off and not in a way I can readily describe. Might be the cumin. Im hoping it will chill out. I’ll come back and edit this if the dry down gets any better.

Its chilled out into something thats more tolerable. Not as Indian food. I love Indian food but I don’t want to wear it as a scent. Now it’s just dry spices. That first twenty minutes was something to get through though. Will just have to note if I want to wear this to put it on at least a half hour before I leave.",10/08/25 20:36,NoisyNonsense
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Spices, spices and spices. Imagine smelling Christmas spices, but without the sweetness, just the spices.
Just take your spices out, take the clove, the cardamom, the cinnamon, the cumin and a tad bit of vanilla, mix them together and you'll have what this perfume is.
There are some florals in the beginning, too...which make this perfume smell a little outdated and old fashioned first (a la Aromatic Elixir or Youth Dew), but thankfully they actually disappear quite quickly and that old fashioned spicy floral becomes nothing but Christmas spices. So spicy that it hurts my nose a little whenever I smell it (I don't mean that in a negative way...it's just very powerful).

I find that it smells better an arm length away from your face. So don't spray it next to your face. As if you spray it around an arm length away from you then you can get occasional lovely whiffs of Christmas spices coming towards your way from time to time. I can imagine the same lovely effect happening when someone who wears Jungle Elephant walks past someone and that someone gets that lovely whiff of Christmas spices.

However from close up it's just a little too much. Just the same way as it would be too much to have your nose permanently in the spice container. It would just be too much.

So basically what I'm trying to say: This is not a skin scent. This is a scent which is made for projecting and filling out a room. So too close, when it is at its essence, it's simply too strong and burning, but it's amazing when it gets the chance to project and float around the air.
Probably best worn around the lower torso rather than upper torso, then one can enjoy it more.

I haven't tried layering it yet, but it should be amazing for layering as it's pure spices. It's like spicing up your other perfumes, make them more Christmas.

Not bad, super interesting.

I don't think that it smells like rice pudding or chai as it's not sweet enough for it. But it does smell like the spices you can put into a rice pudding or chai.

As it is so strong, the older it gets the better it smells...meaning that it will last you for several hours and each hour it will smell better and better.

Very fascinating scent. Not for the faint hearted, but super interesting and enjoyable.",10/04/25 05:31,Lebkuchen
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"i’m marrying this perfume y’all

to tell u i was so scared at first bc everyone went batsh8t crazy with the reviews saying “indian spice market, STRONG SILLAGE, BEAST PROJECTION, SPICY, SCARY, witchy” and all. Ofc with reviews like that, you’ll think you’ll smell like a spicy lunch but babes, no, I’m grateful that despite the “spicy” comments some people said chai latte (my favorite drink), pumpkin spice, carrot cake, candles, and cookies—which gave me a spark of hope that maybe this beast is just a gentle giant.

god where do i even begin bc i’m sniffing my wrists every second. I love you l’elephant.

OKKKAYYYYYYYYY

it’s crazy how I smelled this from the package when it came (kinda pissed that i got spoiled for that surprise umph)

L’elephant is everything I wish for in a spiced gourmand fragrance, it filled that void I’ve been longing for which khamrah never gave, teriaq just left me disappointed with a chicken fried rice accord, nomade naturelle was a tad bit too fruity with a disappointing longevity, and lalique le parfum was more spiced cola than spiced vanilla. To put it simply, I’ve been on the hunt for a perfect sweet-spiced vanilla and the search is over !!

I was a bit hesistant of L’elephant at first bc of the mango note bc BABES I DON’T ENJOY FRUITY NOTESSSSS 😭 BUT NOOOO MANGO WAS NON-EXISTENT, MANGO WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. THANK GOODNESS. It’s also probably bc it’s extremely macerated like it should be lightly golden but mine came in DARK BROWN VANILLA ESSENCE SHADE 🪵 like a richly macerated kayali vanilla 28

L’elephant starts off with the sweet and slightly mentholated aroma of cinnamon sweets that instantly reminded me of cinnamon gum, omg GUMDROPSSSS!!! and crushed hot tamales candy, after which, it quickly develops into a sweet, Sweet, SWEEET, ambery, caramelized cinnamon-sugar and cardamom dessert or basically any spicy-sweet food and drinks.

I’m talking: eggnog, chai, pumpkin spice, carrot cake, horchata, gingersnaps, snickerdoodle, gingerbread, banana bread, pecan pie, fruit cake with dates, and other more lovely, festive, homey, comforting and autumn + winter desserts.

There’s also this lovely, thick, and honey-like aroma in the mid dry-down, quite waxy and balmy, which adds more to that warm-hug-like comforting feeling.

Lastly, the dry-down ties it all up to perfection. Once you’ve indulged all the spiced desserts you can think of, l’elephant washes it all down with a cup of milk and slightly woody licorice.

I totally get why people call it a beast because it indeed has a beast performance, but scent-wise? It’s a tamed beast, it’s not as scary as how people are making it look like.

TOTALLY NOT OLD-FASHIONED OR RETRO DESPITE IT BEING A FRAGRANCE FROM THE 90s. It’s a lovely spiced gourmand that’s impossible to dislike, otherwise it would be denial, if not, you lack appreciation. (jk ur preference is urs whatever i’m just biased LMAO)

I know people would totally hate scents like this at specific time, occasions, and seasons but I AM SO READY TO BE OBNOXIOUS AND WEAR THIS IN MY DAILY ROTATION.

because who wouldn’t wanna feel like a little gingerbread princess wearing a spicy gumdrop scented perfume !! 🍪

It needs more love and appreciation, this is a misunderstood beast. And I mean by VERY misunderstood. PLEASE STOP SAYING L’ELEPHANT IS SCARY BC SHE IS LOVELY 😡

GOURMAND LOVERS BETTER GET THIS BC PEOPLE PROBABLY SAY IT’S SCARY TO GATEKEEP IT FROM YALL. I REPEAT, GOURMAND LOVERS BETTER GET THIS !!",09/30/25 00:47,bunnificentte
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This is worth every penny! There are more expensive perfumes out there that are nowhere near as original and strong as this one! So far, I have 3 of Kenzo's masterpieces - this beauty, ""World Power"" and ""Ikebana Indigo"". I may be a fan already. They have some of the best bottles in my opinion.

Even without the cap (mine is a tester), the bottle is pretty. A little difficult to hold, but I love the curved shape. The scent inside, however, is the real star. Milky spice cabinet it is. It slightly reminds me of Omnia by Bvlgari (the 2003 release in the auburn bottle). The latter is a spicy nutty tea while the former is a spicy milk. The clove note is super strong and, to my surprise, I really like it. The cumin, cardamom and whatever else is inside provide more spiciness. The vanilla and ylang-ylang make the fragrance wearable by creating a creamy base for the spices. There is a subtle touch of patchouli in there as well. Much like Omnia, it has unisex potential. Not a typically feminine scent. Guys should also treat themselves to a bottle of this gorgeous perfume if they are into this scent category. It performs like a beast. 2 sprays on my nape and 2 on my chest give me more than 7 hours of decent sillage. I have more expensive bottles that cannot even touch this performance. The scent can survive a washing machine and is almost difficult to wash off your body. Be careful when applying it! Other than that, ""Jungle l'elephant"" is an impressive spicy perfume. It is ideal for autumn and winter, and not that expensive for its high quality! I love the cozy feeling it gives me.",09/22/25 00:52,FragranceLover00
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,Go for the bottle with the very gold metal cap vs the one with the more silver cap. The difference in strength is tremendous. The reformulation here is absolutely pitiful.,09/19/25 22:56,MilesDevin
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Man oh man! So when I got this about a year ago, I really liked it but was NOT all that Impressed with the longevity/performance. Well I must say that the ""Maturation Process"" has struck again! Whereas initially I was having to spray about 6 times to get good performance, now after that year of ""Maturation"" has made L'Elephant much more potent and nuanced. Now I cant do more that 2 spritzes on my shirt and 2 on my neck and thats probably too much!

Now, it probably did t take a whole year for this scent to reach it's peak performance, but it being as hot in Florida as it is, I'd stored it away and finally pulled it back out after about 7 or 8 months of not wearing it (Since January 2025) so it probably reached it peak performance before wearing it again yesterday and today.


Also, YES! Im sure this fragrance has been reformulated and is a bit weaker than it was initially, buuuuut it is STIL ehat if consider a ""Beastmode fragrance"" and well worth the purchase ESPECIALLY if ya have patience and let this thing Maturate. Its super beautiful, unisex and so much better than Spice Bomb or Spice Bomb Extreme in my book! I compare these bc imo the spices wear a bit similar, except that L'Elephant had Mango and is just PHENOMENAL! A 9 outta 10 spicey BEAUTY!",09/19/25 13:27,Morenoetrata
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This fragrance was recommended to me online based on other scents I love. I was especially drawn to the name and bottle design as elephants are my ""spirit animal."" I hastily and blindly bought a full bottle. Unfortunately, this was an instant scrubber for me. On my skin, it takes on a nauseating, dirty animal, rotting hay, zoo vibe that is both overtly masculine and offensive. It's so pungent and musty that I scrubbed numerous times. It's as if they captured the aroma of an overly frequented elephant bathroom in the jungle. I keep the bottle in my guest powder room with my other elephant themed decorations. I would never wear this.",09/18/25 23:54,Jenica L Dale
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"FULL BOTTLE WORTHY. My first blind-buy purchase of this perfume was a very adorable mini. Admittedly, due in part to the bottle (read: cap). But after one wear I knew I wanted a full bottle. In the biggest size. It’s right up my alley. Brings one of my favorites to mind: JHAG Moon Dance. The two aren’t entirely the same; I’d say if Moon Dance was sourdough bread, Jungle could be its starter mix. Jungle is somewhat floral seeming, just not a high-octane floral like Moon Dance is. Jungle is fruitier, more exotic. They’re similarly vintage-chypre - which is like catnip to me. Jungle is a bold, sumptuous, intoxicating, warm, sweet, spicy-vanilla. Enormous, heavenly spices. A hint tropical. Masterfully balanced, beautifully blended. An incensey cashmeran drydown. BEST drydown of them all. It’s exceptional! A multi-faceted, everlasting, beastmode gem.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"The opening was a bit scary, but let 40 minutes pass and now I see why people like it. It's definitely unique and one of those perfumes that sends a message, so your personality must be a fit to make it work. It's super strong, too!

It smells like a mix of teas, or a Christmas candle (I can't believe cinnamon isn't listed!), like someone else mentioned. Or perhaps a type of spicy candy? However, it is a not juvenile sweetness at all. In fact, I picture a 30+ y.o. elegant woman rocking this, one who wears colorful clothes & bold accesories, who is not afraid to stand out.",09/11/25 05:26,SinSemilla
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Very realistic and natural smelling - the opening is an overpowering, photorealistic clove. If you don’t love cloves, this is NOT for you.

I bet the drydown is what makes so many people love this scent, though. The cloves are still there, but the vanilla and amber along with some floral notes peek through. The amber is not like a modern screechy amber, it is more of a smooth and waxy amber. I think it is absolutely gorgeous, but I don't know if I would wear this often enough to justify a full bottle.",09/10/25 04:46,Kaleidosaur

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"A love, will always be in my top 10 for creative genius, alone. There is something intriguing and addictive about Kenzo L’Elephant. There’s simply no fragrance quite like it. Powerful yet gentle, multifaceted, contradictory yet integrated and rich.

Firstly, there are perfectly measured spices with anise - blending and transitioning with/into creamy gardenia, heliotrope with what my nose detects as a dirty, raw ylang-ylang combining with green mango. All this on a bed of barely gourmand vanilla, masterfully balanced with amber and what I smell, as a slightly metallic, damp earthy note (must be the patchouli).

L’Elephant is more than a soothing, spiced pudding fragrance though. More a whole escapade and journey. She is coarse and rough around the edges, without being disjointed or vulgar. Taking you through winding, rugged terrain with dry, dusty clouds of dirt, interspersed with damp earth and fallen banana leaves afoot.

The journey is impressively smooth, given the environment she’s treading in. Flexing her incredible strength and gentle, stoic nature.
A perfume balancing her yin-yang feminine and masculine energies with effortless grace and dexterity. She could be perceived as androgynous to some. She refuses to conform to restricting labels that don’t define her. Bold, intuitive and unapologetic for who she is.
She gets that some don’t get her and remains totally unbothered by anyone’s opinion. She quietly considers she was born ahead of her time and that, well after all the seasonal changes, she’ll still remain valid, enduring and talked about. A masterpiece.

2 sprays is all the wearer needs to get fair demonstration of her endurance and enveloping sillage, as the journey weaves on. Vintage lasts til the next day, albeit as a skin scent on me. Latest formulation has been reigned in considerably but still gorgeous to wear.
I also love to wear a dupe perfume oil of this with a touch of Dior Addict. L’Elephant’s spices adds another facet and the vanilla in both beast-mode faves, marries harmoniously. I hope this iconic perfume is never discontinued like Tiger was. My Mum used to wear this, then I began wearing since late 90’s and my daughter also loves this scent. That’s 3 generations already💕",08/04/25 04:09,Name Discontinued

Where you normally get a blast of alcohol in that initial 3 seconds when you smell a perfume-this is replaced by a sour/balsamic tinge.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"One of the first scents in my fragrance journey that made me go wow!

A single spray evelopes you in a heavy and rich cloud which lifts you up into a higher sunny golden realm. Certainly requires the right personality to love this. The sillage is enormous, the scent is thick. If you can't take it you'll want to try and hide yourself in the room.

The scent transforms over time into something a lite bit less spicy. It gets too round for my liking, settling into vanilla and amber. At this point I'm missing something to provide more contrast.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"We have been dealing with home renovations here and I was feeling sorry for myself because of the disruptions to my routine, so I splurged on Kenzo Jungle Elephant. It arrived yesterday and I just spritzed some on, un-showered, still in pajamas.

I am Elephant! Hear me roar! This fragrance is me. It might be more me than I have ever been. On first sniff, Kenzo is spicy and there is a bite of patchouli. The patchouli seems to burn off within the first 30 minutes or so. I smell cinnamon, clove, vanilla and amber. There is an almost smoky accord that reminds me of Shalimar EDP. I can see myself wearing this scent a lot this fall and winter to parties, formal dinners, holiday celebrations ... and anywhere I want to give folks the message: stand back and do not hug me. (Not a hugger. It's very invasive if you don't like to be hugged). However, I also plan to enjoy it inside in air conditioning while I am sitting at my desk, working, or even just puttering around, reading, or watching tv.

Please don't put your fancy bottles away, ladies, or save them for special occasions. Tomorrow isn't promised to any of us. Wear them. Own them. Be audacious. Let them hear you ROAR!

If you would like to try Kenzo Elephant, I found it for a great price on Ebay. I paid under $60 US including shipping.

Yes, this is a bold scent but right now it is available relatively inexpensively. If you like Obsession (the original), Youth Dew, Shalimar, Cinnabar, Opium, or Estee Lauder's Spellbound (which has a lot of clove also), I believe you will find a spot in your heart for this Elephant. The bottle is beautiful too.",07/02/25 04:00,ChloeReads
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I desperately wanted to love this one.
I'm so glad I didn't not blind buy it, however I was very close to doing it after seeing multiple YT reviews and everyone saying it's super spicy, it's the ""elephant in the room"" kindda fragrance.

Sadly, to me it's only an 80s men's aftershave cologne/splash. I got a chance to test it out today at a department store that had one last bottle of it left with them. I'm so glad I tested it. The first 10 minutes I got spicy masala chai scent (I'm Indian and I know what I'm talking about, we've this spicy variation of spiced ginger chai) it smelled warm and cozy. Nothing that blew my mind or stopped me in my tracks. Just meh. Then 20 minutes in and it turned into a weird men's cologne (something I feel my father used to wear, like Faberge Brut Classic).

This should serve me as a good lesson for future when I'm tempted to blind buy perfumes based on reviews. No hate on anyone who loves this, trust me I wanted to love it too. But the elephant isn't for me sadly. No elephant ride for me, I'll just walk away...",07/01/25 13:04,samira29

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Not sure what possessed me to purchase this perfume. I think I was trolling Fragrantica and a few other perfume blogs/websites and I spotted information about Kenzo ""Jungle L'Elephant."" I remember this fragrance being controversial, back in the day. Waaaaaay before niche perfumery was the thing, there were a few houses like Kenzo. The fragrance has been in production for nearly 30 years! I decided to blind-purchase a full bottle 'cause the price was under $30 USD for a new 100ml bottle.

So, this stuff is different. But I actually like the fragrance a whole lot!! It's welcome reprieve from my current, go-to fragrances.

To my nose, Jungle L'Elephant is a SPICE BOMB. Definitely opens with a strong cumin note, which can read a bit skanky. But somehow, the cumin morphs with the cardamom, caraway, black licorice, clove and other spicy notes making for a really nice balance of spice notes and accords. And somehow, it all works.

I do detect some ylang-ylang in the mid-development. I think I also detect ginger, which is not listed as a note. Fortunately, the spices quickly balance out that tropical banana, sour ylang-ylang (a note I detest). With time, the fragrance develops as a spicy, semi-tropical, mixed-spice bomb with evident cardamom, caraway, cumin, clove, some vanilla, amber I suppose.

I LOVE the brushed gold cap but I find the bottle impossible to handle (I have small hands). So, I'm going to decant the liquid into a more user friendly perfume bottle with a vaporizer.

It's certainly not one of the known or popular perfumes, neither with the young people nor the community of more niche-oriented perfume enthusiasts I know.

However I wish that any lover of softly spicy gourmands would check this out. To my nose it's a warm bitter-almond cookie with soft chai spices, very similar to Italica by Xerjoff (really expensive) and also reminiscent of the eggnog inspired Lush perfume Yog Nog.

Somehow this is both reminiscent of frangipani sunscreen in the summer and Christmas cookies in winter. A lovely gourmand, somewhat tropical to my nose. I cannot recommend this enough, it is a fantastic scent and not ""vintage"" smelling at all.",05/03/25 12:33,paneradfisk
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I really get a ton of clove, licorice, and vanilla in this. It’s mainly a clove fragrance that’s warm, slightly sweet with a slight powdery dry down. I don’t get much fruit at all.

If you like fragrance’s like this that are warm, spicy, sweet, and you love Cardamom with a splash of citrus you might like Rima XI Carter Barcelona. It doesn’t smell the same but it’s the same sort of genre or vibe.",05/01/25 12:32,Rosemary14
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"wWOW! Not for me. I like a strong fragrance that smacks you round the head but this was too much for me. I got frangipane and coconut a few minutes after the initial boozy opening, although neither is listed. I love both these notes but there was something extra that got in the way for me. Some kind of nasty oily thing going on. I have a perfectly formed 5ml sample bottle in its original box up for grabs if anyone in the UK wants it, DM me!",04/30/25 05:03,Loumaskatron
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This is what Jane wore while living with Tarzan in the jungle. This is a bewildering scent, a kind of a non-poisonous snake lingering around your neck, a little bit scary at first but when acquainted eventually becomes your closest friend. This is a aromatic, green and earthy scent: a mix of mud, mould, exotic fruits, green leaves, spices and flowers. This is not as powerful as I was expecting, instead of a full grown elephant this more like a youngling. Little bit disappointed with that. Longevity with one spray is approx. eight hours. The bottle is name fitting, well balanced combo between smartness and ornamentality.

I wear it to the gym. I wear it to work. I freaking love it. The initial spray is strongly cloves. But as someone who casually smoked clove cigarettes in the 90s before they made smoking indoors illegal, it’s strangely satisfying because I never made a habit of it - a true guilty pleasure. I use neutrogena body oil which has a distinctive fragrance and it blends perfectly, extending it and allowing me to enjoy the middle and base notes. The ylang is present but not overwhelming, and the patchouli makes the base notes feel completely different than a gourmand fragrance like those popular right now. 15/10.

I bought this based on reviews I read here while looking for a niche gourmand fragrance with a spicy edge that stands out among the usual suspects. I guess Jungle L'Elephant probably IS that... the problem is I don't like it. Layered with other stuff to add some chocolate and cognac notes, yes. But on its own there is something loud and screechy in the opening that never really goes away for me. I can't put my finger on it. Like a sharp, medicinal licorice smell which doesn't blend with whatever else this is trying to do.

I've got 98% of a bottle I'd trade for something that is more my style. Til then it's an occasional mixer with other fragrances when I'm in the mood for spicy sweets. You win some, you lose some...",02/06/25 19:44,AdventuresInTheFreeWorld

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"this perfume is a bit harder to stomach. It is very oriental, very heavy, very spicy and boy is it strong. It might be a good scent for a big crowded event, in case you get lost, your friend or partner will easily sniff you out. I understand some people can absolutely hate it. I don’t, I enjoy it a lot, but I wouldn’t say I love it yet. I had it few years ago but I was early pregnant so it was too harsh for me at that time, and now I bought it again. I remembered the smell pretty well, it doesn’t remind me of anything else in the whole perfume world, it is still quite harsh so it wasn’t just the pregnancy nose. It’s straight up cloves and cardamom in the opening. Later as it warms up, I smell something almost waxy, so I get the resemblance to a candle. It is well blended, it’s hard for me to detect anything else and put my finger on a specific note, but it is much more complex than just the initial cloves and cardamom. I will continue to observe this scent as it is very interesting. I will avoid wearing this on days I will spend some time in a car, because I suspect that could actually make me nauseous. Even sitting in the office this might not be a very good idea. But in the outside or some more open spaces absolutely yes. You will make yourself known and remembered with this. btw I’m legitimately afraid of spraying it on my neck, and that’s something coming from me.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,Omg. No offence to anyone who loves this but how? It is disgusting.. it smells like a glass full of cat piss mixed with spices.,01/21/25 07:52,LunaTeddy22
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"A well-known classic that I finally got to try thanks to a friend!
First of all, not too sure about this being a ""beast mode"" scent. It is strong, but not uncomfortably long-lasting and does disappear completely after about 12 hours - on my skin, anyway.
The scent itself really does almost paint a picture of an arid savanna at sunset, silhouettes of elephants swaying in the distance. But I also get where the Christmas association comes from.

The spices are definitely the most prominent thing about this fragrance - especially the cardamom and cloves, which I smell throughout the scent's entire transformation. The patchouli is also very noticeable pretty much the entire time. It starts out as aromatic, unisex spicy with a citrusy tang, which seems to be the part that evokes the most winter holiday associations - then becomes sweeter and fruitier as ylang-ylang gives it that tropical feel, and mango seems to contribute to a zingy greenish note, almost like mango peels as opposed to the pulp. As it settles, it gets softer and sweeter until it dries down into the vanilla-amber base with the spiciness and patchouli still present.

It's definitely ahead of its time, and definitely not for everyone. If you don't like strong spices in anything, you're not going to like them here as well. This is now my ""happy"" scent - I'm not a fan of fruit-only fragrances and the fact they're so commonly recommended for an elevated mood, so Elephant is a perfect option for me when I'm feeling optimistic. Love it!",01/16/25 10:54,cawico7

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I was sooo excited to get my bottle of Jungle L'Elephant, it's my first blind buy (that isn't a cheapie)!!!

The bottle is gorgeous and it has notes that I absolutely love like Cardamom, Licorice, Mango and Patchouli. Unfortunately, I didn't detect any of them :(

At first L'Elephant smells like a sweet fruity powdery scent. I immediately felt something powdery and creamy, I think it's the Heliotrope. I usually hate powdery fragrances but this one is not too powdery like Jasmine. I like the smoothness and airiness of Heliotrope.
I also smelled the powdery Gardenia right away.
Ylang-Ylang is by far the most dominant note, and it stays that way from beginning to end. To me Ylang-Ylang always smells like a fruity bubblegum, so that was a great addition. It makes L'Elephant more wearable and also more unisex.
There's slight Amber underneath, and also something woody.
The only woody note is Licorice but again, I wouldn't say this smells like Licorice at all, so I don't know where else the woody note came from (my bf also smelled it).
I smelled a tiny hint of Cloves, I wish I could smell more of it.
After a couple of hours I could smell Rhubarb too.
I smell no Mandarin Orange, Caraway, Cumin, or Vanilla.
This perfume is STRONG, insane sillage and longevity. Half a spray (I aimed wrong and only half got on my wrist) and you could spot me at any room through the smell. Lasted over 12 hours.

In short: Mainly a powdery Ylang-Ylang fragrance. Up close you can smell Amber and some woodiness, with a bit of Clove. BEAST MODE. I would recommend it to people who like this scent profile bc even though I never like (I really hate powdery perfumes) I did like it in L'Elephant - except for smokers. It doesn't blend well with smoke.

I don't regret blind buying it because the bottle is still gorgeous and this is discontinued so I might sell it in the future.",01/13/25 09:21,Wendy Whaleams

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"looks like I only comment for the ultimates: either absolute bests or total abominations.

Having fallen in love with it in a fragrance, on my pursuit of finding cardamom-dominant fragrances I came across this. I immediately remembered seeing the bottle of it somewhere in a list and feeling sad because of the categorization in the ""female"" section, thinking it was just another lady perfume. I checked neither the notes, nor the perfumer, I sprayed on my arm and took a sniff. There's no denying that there are definitely some things in this world you can't comprehend until the moment you try it or it happens to you firsthand. My sweet child., here I am, again struggling to find appropriate vocabulary to explain this ethereal beauty without being repetitive. Utterly unbelievable fragrance, a masterful craftsmanship, exquisite blend, fantastic composition. Mr. Ropion is a bizarre magician for sure. I love this so much that I want to hug and kiss it as long as it's with me but of course, I am awkwardly hugging myself instead. It's so splendid that you can even see or peep to the glimpse of the meaning of life for a short period of time.

I believe that during its launch, there was no such a big deal as 'unisex"", and as for the florals, it had to be put in the women's fragrances. Men can easily pull this off with confidence not only because of the piquant spices , but also because there is nothing to imply that. Maybe a little bit exaggerating, but I am so happy that I was able to experience this invigorating piece of art in this short lifespan of a human.",01/06/25 15:04,felixification
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,@FuzzyRush Cardabomb is right! Geeeez when does it stop smelling???,01/03/25 14:51,vrock1729
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I blind bought this after reading rhapsodic reviews on here. I'm a hopeless romantic when it comes to perfume and always looking for ""The One."" Seeing that so many of you found true love with this, I had to try it. Full disclosure - it only arrived this morning so I'm only in a position to share first impressions and 3 hours' wear. I'm still not sure how I feel about it so far... First off, it's a cardamom bomb (a 'cardabomb'...sorry!) then the clove does start to make itself known (loudly). Am I crazy or is this somehwat reminiscent of Eden and/or Lou Lou by Cacherel?!
I know from the reviews that warming up or even maceration is crucial with this one, so I'm going to dig deep with the patience and hope that it becomes my darling the way it has for so many of you. Much has been made of its elephantine (again, sorry!) projection and sillage so I sprayed lightly and it is wafting, inoffensively, at arm's length. I imagine that overspraying this before being amongst people could be considered an act of aggression and is best avoided. I genuinely do not wish to offend the many admirers (and this is only a first impression!) but there is just a vestigial hint of public restroom upon walking into the room where it was sprayed earlier. I also concur with the comparisons to expensive Christmas candles. Presently it smells better on fabric than skin. I'm trying to talk myself out of disappointment by remembering that many have mentioned how it improves over time, but so far, the search for that special smell continues..

**Edit**
Ok, I now love this! 6 months of maceration has entirely changed this scent for me. Because of the spice, I had assumed that this fragrance would be best worn in Winter, but the sun really coaxes some magic out of it. Soft, almost powdery elements are now perceptible and the staying power and projection are impressive, but not obnoxious. Comforting and warm - this is a keeper.",01/03/25 06:43,FuzzyRush
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I must have had the OG beast. OMG, very few perfumes nauseate me, but this one did. If you remember the Glade Apple cinnamon candle when they first came out & everyone was burning them, that is exactly what it smelled like on me. STRONG. Now, I loved that candle & mayyyybe still would (I havent bought one in years) but it smelled so close to that, and so strong & I could not get away from it, it almost made me sick. That smell was great for the house & you knew it was a candle, but it was horrible to smell ON me. If I actually bought that candle now, I may have to throw it away, that is how bad this perfume grossed me out. I cannot explain why this happened, other than by association, I didnt want to smell like that candle. UGH. I cant even think about it.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"If this be the beast, than I am the self proclaimed beauty that goes along with it hand in hand. This is such a unique fragrance. I initially bought a new tester of Kenzo's Jungle expecting to be engulfed with a powerful punch of scent, but it was not the case. You see, I was going by the reviews on here that many were refering to it as a powerhouse scent. But alas, no powerhouse, no punch, but I could smell the potential lurking just around the corner that it did have. So I did what any scent love minded individual would do and bought a vintage version. Oh my, here was the beast the others were talking about. Here was the most obvious elephant in the room I had been on the prowl for. At first spritz, you are enveloped in the warmth of cardamom, clove, and cumin, than the magnolia, licorice, and ylang ylang make center stage so alive and wild. Finally, with this exotic blend of spices comes the earthy patchouli and musk that just lingers keeping the whole rigmaroll forever planted in the minds of everyone around you. It's been about 2 hours now since I last sprayed Kenzo's Jungle Elephant and it still smells as though I just sprayed it. I am absolutely pleased with this purchase. I do want to add, as others have said, there is something so merry and bright about it. Yes, it's not wrong in saying, this is Christmas in a bottle. It's as alive as the Yuletide. When I first got a whiff of it, nostalgia hit me. I was 5 again holding one of those vintage candles that are frosted on the outside with a white glitter substance, I was sniffing in with all my might the absolute deliousness of the holiday. I definitely get the same cardamom, vanilla, clove and other spices coming through. It's so awesome that Dominique Ropion has been able to capture so much in this prolific perfume. A wild beast, an elephant in an earthy jungle of vibrant exotic scents as well as an in depth olfactory snapshot of many peoples favorite holiday season.",12/12/24 11:16,chesheyercat
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"What an absolute beast of a fragrance 💗 Lasts forever, projects to fill a room.
I keep getting comments and compliments on it - ""you smell like Christmas"" followed by a deep inhale is the most common one!

Mostly cardamom and cloves to my nose. Initial spray is quite spicy, dry down goes powdery and sweet, but not clawing. Harmoniously woven through the whole thing is vanilla.

Definitely NOT a safe blind buy. It's unusual, distinctive and potent. Try before you buy.

Very much to my taste, so would heartily recommend. Especially for cold weather.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Category: Spicy, powdery, vanilla

Notes: Sprays on smelling only of vanilla and mandarin orange, but very quickly develops into a strong mix of clove and cardamom. The vanilla remains in the background, along with a powdery, honey-esque heliotrope and amber in supporting roles. This gets less spicy and more powdery the longer it stays on. After 7+ hours of wear this turns into a wonderful, boozy vanilla.

Vibe: Autumn. Old couch. Peach cobbler. Cinnamon sticks. Rowanberry branch. Cocktails. White trash TV. Boardroom. Extramarital affair.

Sillage: 8/10. Punchy and present without being too loud. I could easily smell it off my wrist while resting my hand in my lap.

Longevity: 7/10. Pretty decent longevity, will definitely last you at least a good 6 hours in cooler weather. It does become pretty much a skin scent after 4-5 hours, but it's still there.

Wear: Could work for daytime wear but I think it's probably more suitable for evening. The spiciness of this scent, particularly clove, makes this an undeniable fall and winter scent to me.

Overall rating: 4/10. Got this sample in a trade from the lovely @Aren. What a weird fragrance… do I like it? Do I hate it? At first I thought I really liked it, but everytime I came back to it I liked it less and less each time. I think it's because it got more and more powdery with time, and I don't really fw powdery. But then it changed up on me again after about 7 hours of wear, and the powdery character disappeared and it turned into this gorgeous, almost boozy, very rich vanilla. Smells just like the bourbon vanilla extract paste I have for baking. This is my second clove forward scent I've tried on (Nina Ricci L’air du Temps being the first) and this is definitely a huge upgrade from my previous experience. Quite pleasantly spicy, a little sweet and very powdery. I'm very happy about the fact that I'm not even slightly picking up on the caraway since I think caraway reeks. What stands out most is the clove, followed by cardamom. There's a hint of licorice root, and the scent is carried by an undercurrent of vanilla and very powdery heliotrope and amber. It's a powerhouse scent for a powerhouse of a woman. While I don't hate this I think I'm just not a fan of clove forward scents… It’s a little too spicy for my tastes, kind of stings your nose when you go into sniff it, and way too powdery for me to stand. While I adore where it ends up after several hours, it's not worth the wait. I think this might be signature scent worthy for someone else - truly a unique and interesting scent even though it wasn't my personal taste or style.

Who would wear it?: Rene Russo.",11/16/24 22:59,JaneBond
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Jungle l'Éléphant is a magnificent spicy perfume whose smell is quite astonishing!

To smell its final scent, you have to wait a few minutes, because the opening is extremely strong and destabilizing. But when it's all put together, it's delicious, typically everything I like; a melody of intoxicating and heady spices, vanilla and ylang-ylang.

Why did I choose the neutral smiley in this case? Because an after smell that I can't isolate bothers me. I think it might be the cumin ans its sweaty smell (quite light here but still there).

I was on the verge of love at first sight; without this after smell, not only would I have bought it but it could have become my new signature to replace my current discontinued one. Sad :(",11/11/24 02:46,Saveria
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"EDIT: (MACERATION IS A MUST!) So I recieved my bottle of Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant on 09/06/2024, I was honestly quite dissapointed when Id initially sprayed it on because it smelled almost 1 to 1 like Cacharel's Eden which I love, but already own. L'Elephant had virtually NO spice and smelled almost one to one like Eden by Cacharel, the predominant Mango note is pretty much used in the same way in both which made them smell almost identical. Also, the spices were way, WAY too subdued in L'Elephant, and after having heard/read so many reviews stating that this was a very spicey fragrances (which is why I wanted L'Elephant to begin with) I was VERY dissapointed to say the least.

Fast forward 6 weeks or so, after letting this sit and ""macerate"", during that time, Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant has DRASTICALLY CHANGED for the better, I now see what everyone was talking about when they said this was uber spicey. Also, the performance has gone from good 6-7 hours to ""Beast Mode"". For example, I'd done about 4-5 sprays before bed last night, and then this morning, after I'd just woken up, my niece's mother visited me and said ""wWOWw you smell gooood, whatchoo wearin'!?"". This fragrance and a couple of others have made me a total believer in the maceration process! It's kinda crazy bc Id never noticed a fragrance do that before I started really getting into collecting. Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant is still a great buy, and YES! It still has that beautiful METAL, heavy cap, so don't believe some sources that claim the cap is now a cheap plastic! Id also like to mention that this fragrance was quite feminine leaning when I'd first tried it back in September, but with the strong spices opening up like they did, this fragrance is now 100% unisex/genderless imo, and I don't get why ANYONE would be bothered by that ""OPINION"".. Anyhow, Go get ya'll dis Kenzo L'Elephant before it gets horribly reformulated or worse... DISCINTINUED😮!...

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"first time blind buying a perfume based on the notes, i was not expecting the clove to be so abundant 😭 the way this dries down is so gorgeous and cozy, ive been trying to get into more mature scents and this is perfect. the scent did overwhelm me at first, but the dry down smells like the best mix of spicy and sweet perfect for fall.",10/30/24 19:03,starflying
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Kenzo Jungle sigh. My first true head over heels, heart racing, can't stop thinking about. Love. I can't even describe how much I loved this perfume and for so many years.
Until I got asked by my then fiance to please stop wearing it, because it was making all his clothes smell like it - it was getting all over the house. He liked the smell. But it was ' too much'. I quit wearing it as per his request, but years and years on this fragrance haunts me like a ghost. I tried to find more subdued versions. But nothing, but nothing matches Kenzo Jungle. The most complex and misunderstood masterpiece that ever existed. Bold, warm, inviting, sultry, sweet, spicy, tropical. Yes tropical. Best in heat, summer nights. 'Tropical the island breeze

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Perfumes have no sex, but some of them have a very loud gender!

I got very irritated when I saw Jungle E. classified as unisex or even to the point of being more masculine, and the truth is that even a person with parosmia would agree that it is an epitome of a feminine archetype!!!
I'm a man and I wear Jungle E. when I want to be close to my anima, but I would never say that there is anything masculine about it!
Guys, there's nothing wrong with wearing feminine perfumes, but please stop calling them unisex in order to excuse yourself!
Probably the first woman on Earth (before a man was born) smelled on Jungle E.!
A masterpiece that will never be surpassed!!!
These were perfumes!",10/22/24 13:44,Balas
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I bought a 2ml sample of this when I was exploring Dominique Ropion's earlier works. I love a lot of his creations, but not this one. On skin it was giving me overripe fruit and a chaotic melange of spice. I smelled like an unfortunate fall candle that no one wanted. It wasn't quite a scrubber, but I was thankful that I was due for a shower a few hours after putting it on my body.",10/21/24 09:39,BreatheInBreatheOutRepeat
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"When I was like 12 I smelled it on my arts teacher and I asked her what perfume she was wearing, she told me kenzo jungle and we could only buy it from the airport since we didn't have it in stores, so I asked my dad to buy it for me and he did! It smelled amazing on her but it was too mature for me to wear it and like it on me.
I'm thinking of repurchasing it, I think I'll like it on me now. Memories!",10/16/24 00:32,Lourdes.mansour
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"So sad . . . I really wanted to like this fragrance. I purchased a bottle as a blind buy after watching and reading a few reviews. This is not a beast . . . it is an Elephant! This is extremely strong and heavy, and for me, it overwhelmed me quickly giving me a nauseating headache. But it is a nice fragrance just way, way, way too much. I tested it twice. The first time, after a couple of hours I had to take another shower. The second time, I only sprayed it once on one wrist, then spread that little bit around my other wrist. It still was overpowering. I have a few ""beastmode"" perfumes, but this is beyond them all.",10/14/24 19:36,DrDG
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Based on other people's reviews I was expecting something incredibly strong and borderline offensive, but come on people, this is in fact pretty tame. It opens with a flash of invigorating spice, but that subsides quickly, and I find it to be quite wearable. It's soft and unisex. Yes, it is for people who like spices, ahem, look at the notes, but it's well blended and slightly creamy. It feels like it was inspired by India. I think this will be nice for the cooler weather; I find it unique and comforting. When it fades, it does smell more like patchouli, so if you hate patchouli, you've been warned. Oh and it does not smell like a fall/Christmas candle. Coming from someone who typically hates scented candles, it's better than that! Overall, a nice scent. Kenzo you've done it again.",10/04/24 12:00,perfumaphile
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Sensual, dirty and hedonistic. Wear this in hot humid weather and make others uncomfortably question their sexuality.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I've been wearing Elephant layered with Vanilla by Alyssa Ashley, which boosts up the vanilla accord a little bit, and my partner who never comments on my perfumes, has already complimented me twice on separate occasions. I find it funny, but I also understand him, because this is such a warm, elegant and delicious scent. Still, I love that it's not venturing too far into sweet gourmand territory.
Works well in heat and in cold weather. Just be careful not to overspray. A single spray is enough with this one, and it literally lasts all day.",10/02/24 01:23,Salkavalka
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I loved the clove and licorice notes here, but unfortunately the cumin note turned musty on my skin as I initially feared it would. It, along with the patchouli and cardamom notes, wound up drowning out most of the other notes. This would be too heavy for hot weather, but I could see it making the perfect Jack-of-all trades scent for cooler weather.",09/22/24 18:23,Mona708
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I have been wanting to test this one for the longest time.
This is a very powerful array of spices. It smells like visiting an older relative during the holidays, and entering the kitchen where cinnamon toffees and decorative candles are placed all over the hardwood furniture covered in fluffy, warm toned covers and doilies, as they are looking through their pantry while they are telling you the story of each spice and herb from their massively varied collection, before engaging in another baking session. You're settled down on a chair, enjoying homemade vanilla rice pudding, and a bunch of dried leaves and tiny branches are sitting inside an ornate bowl on the same table you're eating at.
Even the tv has some kind of porcelain figurine on top of it, your relative's stories kind of make your head spin, but you're ultimately comfortable and warm.",09/22/24 06:41,lemon_lyric
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"It's a very nice and unique scent, I haven't personally smelled any perfume like this but a thousand Christmas and fall candles, nothing wrong with it. I am not complaining I would definitely wear it around those days.

I bought it because everyone says it smells like chai and it does but if you add a lot of liquor to it, not bad tho but not what I was expecting.",09/18/24 19:14,Homebird
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"It's a spice bomb. Reminds me of eucalyptus, aftershave, chai tea, and black licorice. It's good if you're looking for a unique fragrance. You have to appreciate clove, nutmeg, anise types of scents. A nice change from smelling like fruit or candy. I can see someone pairing this with a cinnamon fragrance for colder seasons.",09/14/24 13:42,Lady Mae
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Just wanted to give a quick tip, if you got a new bottle, let it sit and macerate, don’t give up on it.

At first, it was all wrong and I hated it (the juice was a light yellow)

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Been eyeing Kenzo L'Elephant for a few months now, but didnt wanna pull the trigger and spend $70 on blind buying a frag that may lean way too feminine, most of my frags are unisex, and I use some feminine leaning scents, just not completely feminine leaning.

After the initial purchase, but before I'd recieved it, I'd read somewhere that it'd been reformulated (much weaker) and that the cap was now plastic, I became so upset as so many brands do that crap and then I find out the hard way. And YES, presentation does matter to me, most frags I blind buy are bc of notes list and the beautiful bottles at times. L'Elephant is one of those instances.

I'm happy to report that the cap is still metal and beautifully detailed, but while the opening is still quite potent, Im not too sure about the longevity or sillage, I sprayed some on my shirt and while I can still smell it a good amount a few hours later, Its REALLY calmed down quite a bit, so according to many reviews here on fragrantica, I have to wonder if ""the reformulation monster"" got to this? Bc I just wouldn't call this ""beast mode"" like described here on fragrantica.

Im hoping the fragrance just needs to open up some more after air is introduced into the bottle like it happens with so many of my new frags. Also, I was REALLY surprised at how much L'Elephant smells a lot like Cacharel's Eden, another, floral/fruity (mango) 90's powerhouse, except L'Elephant has a (little bit) of added spicyness. And Eden has no spice as far as I can tell.

Beautiful, fruity, spicey fragrance, and I definately say it's more feminine than masculine, yet confident men can still pull off wearing L'Elephant due to the slight spicyness... 8 outta 10 scent and Im so stoked that I hadn't yet read that bs about reformulations and re-packaging as I would never have gotten it...... Thanks to whomever took the time to read my review!
----------------UPDATE------------------
So, my bottle of L'Elephant has been maturing for about 6 weeks, and WOAH! Now I get what they mean by ""Strong Cinnamon and Clove"" what a CRAZY difference! This ""maceration"" thing is no myth I guess huh? I've now had a few different fragrances change after letting them sit for a spell, but this one had a pretty drastic change. This just went from ""unisex leaning feminine"" to straight up UNISEX bc of the very strong spiciness. yYAYy!😁 I LOVE spicey frags! Oh, and that strong Mango note that made this smell just like Cacharel's Eden, has now been tempered by the delicious spices which make Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant it's own thing!.. Smells really yummy now! But, If wearing this thing to work or office setting, maybe 2-3 sprays max now fo sho!",09/06/24 19:41,Morenoetrata
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This to me is Instant headache and nausea in a bottle. Only Angel by Thierry mugler does this as well. It just smells like a sweaty priest after swinging the cencer for an hour. When someone wears this I have to leave the room.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"In the air it smells nostalgic like a hair salon growing up, or the smell of blow drying your hair, and hair grease. When I put my nose to skin it smells like an almost savoury spice mix with not much discernible sweetness. It almost feels like my nose is drying out. I’m not sure how wearable it is because of its association with hair grease and blow dryer heat. It’s very musky, dry and dense like a dust cloud. It’s not that wearable to me because of its strong associations with freshly blow dried hair (not bad but not expected in a perfume) I’ll give this one a wearing later on to see how it goes
Update: I’m surprised by how much I love this one. it’s colder now and decided to give it another go and honestly I’ve changed my mind about this one. Maybe because I’ve let it sit and the temperature is cooler but it’s a lot more enjoyable. There’s a little dry sweetness and I get a lot of liquorice, indistinguishable ‘spices’ and a sweet vanilla. I have a nice little bubble around me in a sweet soft spicy way. I smell like cinnamon chewing gum in a good way and reached for it a lot this winter. This one will last ages since you don’t need much but I feel like I replace this even it (eventually) runs out. Just goes to show, don’t just things too fast!",08/31/24 05:03,DEX1901

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Straight up spicy banger! The cinnamon and cloves are strong and energizing. This smells identical to Lush's old classic soap, Red Rooster.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Honestly super disappointed in this one. I absolutely love spicy scents, and I've heard this is a great one. Many of the notes are some of my all time favs including cardamom, cloves, licorice, patchouli, and vanilla. Unfortunately, I get none of that. It just reminds me of the nemat nag champa perfume oil (which doesn't have any of the woody spice of actual nag champa incense). On paper it dries down to a nice spicy aroma that I somewhat enjoy, but it just never seems to get there on my skin. Just a sweet and very rounded out scent with zero edge to it. Smells like earthy, musky mango and ylang-ylang. So much ylang-ylang. I'm going to keep testing it to see if my opinion changes, but really isn't the sexy spiced scent I was anticipating.

update: After about 5+ hours I start to get a little of those spices and vanilla coming through. It's ok but not worth dealing with the top notes for most of the day just to get to a faded version of something I like. Honestly, a really suffocating one-note fruity floral for me, I've grown to hate it.",07/20/24 14:52,spiderbrains
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"A couple of years ago (around 2016) I tried L'Elephant and that was some experience for sure! I loved the vanilla base but, at that time, I couldn't handle the strong clove note. It was very strong and the sleeve of my coat smelled of it for at least 4 weeks... What a beast!! I am into strong perfumes but this was too much for me.
Fast forward to 2024. For some reason cloves really grew on me to the point I find myself loving the smell. I really like (vintage) CoCo and (vintage) Chamade. So I had to try this Elephant again. And now, it is gorgeous!! Probably thank to those horrific reformulations, it is softer, sillage is moderate instead of strong/enormous and longevity is a decent 10 hours (after about 5-6 hours it is a skin scent of lovely vanilla). I can smell mandarin orange and a very noticable 'dirt and wet leaves' patchouli, cloves obviously, cardamom , some licorice and lots of vanilla. It's sweet, soft, 'milky'. The other notes don't play a big role on my skin. I am describing my, according to the batchcode, august 2023 bottle. So, in short, it's lovely and actually suitable for office wear. But, it is not a beast anymore. So I did order an older formula from eBay. Because now that I can appreciate cloves, I want the real deal of an Elephant stomping across the room! And I'll save my 2023 bottle for the office :-)

Edit: I have been wearing the 2023 version for a couple of days in a row now and sillage is definately intimate. I sprayed at least 8 times but I did not turn into a perfume cloud(bomb) and my husband could only smell it up close. It does last all day.",07/09/24 04:48,kristelg
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"You must like spicy aromatic fragrances to enjoy this one. The spices and warmness actually reminds of of a cozy festive scent you'd want to wear during the winter holidays. Smells festive. I think it's discontinued, but can still be found on discounter sites. I don't normally enjoy cumin, but all of the other spices cover up most of the cumin note (at least to my nose). Unisex in my opinion. Price isn't too bad, but still wouldn't recommend blind buying.",07/07/24 01:18,dj71

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"My friends mum and nana used to wear this when I was around 14/15 and I’ve loved it ever since. You either love it or hate it. In the beginning when you first spray it it’s instantly mature/old lady but give it a minute once that’s gone it’s the most unique beautiful scent, to me it smells like you’re walking through an Indian spice market, you get the cumin and cardamom with a sweet warm creaminess like a hot pan of milk with fresh vanilla pods simmering and i can smell it all the way through, in the dry down I start to smell the liquorice and mango a sweetness with cinnamon, turmeric and patchouli. The longevity is beast mode it lasts for days on your clothes and the aroma radiates throughout any room you walk through. It gives incense, hippie, bohemian, Moroccan, it’s so comforting and warm and dreamy. I love it! 😻",07/04/24 20:19,vintagerosa

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Cloves and cardamon on a bed of vanilla and patchouli. Very unique scent, I agree this is nothing short of a masterpiece. I also see why some wouldn't like it: it's quite cloying and very potent. The chai latte comparisons make sense given how spice heavy the frag is, but it's not a latonic or a caramely scent.

I love to spray myself all over with perfume and even for me one spray of Jungle Elephant is enough. Two sprays and you might start giving your co- workers a headache.

Used to be my signature decades ago. I still like it now I am revisiting it, but at the moment I prefer scents that have slightly less going on? I also notice cumin/some bitterness much more than I used to.",06/25/24 05:19,Frymbles

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"If we must make a top perfumes check, this absolute masterpiece by Ropion, would be definitely, probably in first 10 or less.
This is in every aspect of parfumery art one big masterpiece. Big. Like elephant. This perfume behaves like elephant.
It enters the place like elephant, loud, crushing, clumsy, charming, dangerous and serious. Once you smell it you NEVER forget it. It's like thunder. Why kick down the door when you can just tear down the wall right away? Real Elephant. That is the force of this perfume.

It's well know. The Dream by Henri Rousseau inspired Kenzo Takada for his Jungle boutique. But did you ever look at that painting? Because commercial for this scent could be just that. Extremely provocative but realistically truthful to Kenzo ideas.
This perfume is a scent of Jungle goddess. Lying nude on the stones, after waterfall shower, while birds and the rest of fauna worships her. Forest water penetrating her skin. Humid air closing her eyes in half...
""This artistic vision also impacted the distinctive packaging and is the outcome of a tight collaboration of the French designer Joël Desgrippes and Marc Gobé with Kenzo Takada. Aimed to communicate the essence of both Paris-based fashion designer’s colorful, vibrant personality and his aesthetic vision, self-described as exotic, luxurious, surprising and sensual, the bottle for Elephant setting the pure lines of the glass against the figural metal cap marked also a shift in the visual expression from flora to fauna, with Le Tigre and a masculine Zebra completing in the Jungle trilogy. The box was the real groundbreaking element setting a precedent in the perfume industry for the connection to the catwalks and the iconic “Jungle Jap” boutique in Galerie Vivienne, Paris featuring naïve jungle interiors Kenzo painted himself in the 1970s. The same way the original box was meant to fold out like an origami creating a miniature stage set for the animal.""(cafleurebon.com)

That's how this perfume opens.

It's the strongest, most aggressive (not in a bad way), can really punch you in the face unless you're careful and know how to handle it properly. It's unique, no question about that, especially in the sea of today's generic fruity and sticky-sweet scented waters. This one puts them all to shame. Now the notes. I find cumin and cardamom to be most prominent, and after a while, ylang-ylang comes to play, but like a young kid that joins some older kids on the playground, it's there, but barely noticeable and while the bigger kids run after the ball, the little one runs around a bit confused, not daring to approach the bigger kids and try and kick that ball. I don't detect clove, I guess cumin overpowers it. I can't think of the right adjective to describe it entirely, but it is definitely special and I like smelling it, it can be both unpleasant and pleasant at the same time (pleasantly unpleasant?), a class of its own, truly a masterpiece.",06/13/24 10:07,doya

Back in the late 90s when I first got her, I remember that it was summer so to this day it reminds me of late nights and hot mornings, lazy afternoons, full moon, laughter, wine...
A few years later, I let her rest a bit and got Opium. Again, no matter how much I loved Opium, Kenzo remained my one and only.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Very original and interesting: the different spices take a different place in the nose according to their level of ""heat"", which gives the impression of having your nose filled with each sniff, but still managing to distinguish them all!

Greatly resembles the smell of chai tea latte, so very comforting and gourmand, but too realistic to be worn on the skin in my opinion, especially as the projection is very strong so risks disturbing others 😕

There's also a risk of nausea/headaches if worn in hot weather, but it must be very nice in winter.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"holy spice bomb! I smell like a Christmas market wearing this, and I love it!

I don’t sense any floral notes and barely any fruit besides a vague orange in the opening. it’s basically 90% spices and 10% vanilla. sometimes I layer it with other vanilla perfumes to amp up the sweetness and tone down the spice.

I don’t really get the people calling this scent sexy or dirty, for me it’s the ultimate comfort scent. it smells like how wearing fluffy sweaters and fuzzy socks feels. though I’m curious if wearing it in high heat/humidity would change my mind.",04/05/24 07:17,addangel
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I was recommended to purchase this fragrance by someone on Fragantica.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I love this scent. I love the warm, spicy fragrance with a bit of bright orange and the floral that emerges after the first hour or so.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Dear Jungle L'Elefant,

(Edit, adding: I had sealed some tissues I had sprayed with samples. After some days I made a blind check if the characters are still there and if I can recognise which sample is what.
You are the one that stinks. Fecal. Never again!)


A whole long work day you have spent wafting on and around me - and many others - with an enormousness and lasting power I have never experienced before in a perfume.
(I had sprayed you at 7am and now it it 8 pm, and there is still so much of you left of these two spritzers on my forearms.)
And since I had found out that that you annoy me pretty soon after, I have been craving to come home to wash you off and change my clothes for many hours. Your intensity of the cloves is suffocating me!

However, you might have done me the favour of underlining a core character trait of mine: confidence and assertiveness. In a meeting with decision makers, you may even have helped me to feel strong, to feel unique and to make me feel ""I'm allowed to have that opinion"".

You are a powerful scent, and you can be appealing by your spicy sweet muddy uniqueness. You are certainly not elegant, nor clean.

If you were less intense in the cloves - and overall -, I could like you.",03/26/24 11:57,needed_a_new_obsession
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Got this one several years ago as a blind buy, tried it a few times and found the cumin went too strong and funky on me. I really love cumin as a seasoning, but it wasn't sitting well on me, getting a BO type of vibe from it.
Well I revisited it today, and I'm getting a different read. There's more of a sweet (candy but deep) note that seems to be balancing out the cumin better. This one might be growing on me.",03/22/24 00:16,indiglo

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I ❤ Kenzo Labsolue, so obviously I expect I will like other Kenzo fragrances. I often read Fragrantica reviews, positive and negative. But nothing prepared me for this experience.
First I felt an explosion of spices, especially cumin. I had to open a window, it was so strong. Then it changed into cinnamon. But not the Khamrah cinnamon, but strong in your face cinnamon. I felt it till lunch and I had to change my Tshirt, as it was so strong.
I love cinnamon, but this was too much. It´s a no from me. Do try it before buying.",03/01/24 06:36,loves2read
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Got this for my girlfriend as a blind buy for her birthday. She's been wanting it for a while. Got it for a great price on FragranceNet, $45. It smells like a Christmas scented, spiced, incense stick. In a good way. Very warm with a sweetness to it like candy. Love at first sniff.

It's also very unisex. I sprayed some on me and it smelled a little more masculine mixing with my body scent. Smells great, very spicy, some cinnamon, cardamom, I think nutmeg maybe? I'm not smelling that clove top note everyone talks about. But the drydown is amazing. Still retains that Christmas spice but takes on a patchouli bottom note over time that reminds me of incense.

The bottle is very high quality. It's a little cumbersome, very wide. But a solid glass bottle a heavy aluminum cap is very nice to have these days.

I think they might've reformulated it over time because it doesn't have that insane longevity and projection other people talk about. It definitely radiates, I'll admit that. As for filling entire floors of buildings with scent like some people claim? Definitely not. It fills a room for the first few hours for sure, but nothing crazy.

The longevity is a bit lacking as well. Coming from someone who uses performance beasts like Y EDP and Savauge elixir, I expected a lot more after seeing the ratings here. It still lasts for a good part of the day, and projects decently enough... That's a lot better than 90% of women's perfume. But I was expecting something like Y EDP that you can tell on clothes after they wash and on your skin after you shower.

All in all, Kenzo has a great fragrance here. A timeless classic that I hope never gets discontinued. If you want to smell like a Christmas scented incense stick, this one's for you.",02/26/24 17:47,Leland.smith19
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I ordered a sample because I was just too curious... It really is a POWERFUL spice bomb. I can smell cloves and cardamom after spraying it 2 hours ago, and my 2 ml sample is closed in a plastic bag which is closed in a drawer. Definitely unique, not unpleasant but I find it hard to consider this a fragrance meant to be worn.

Addictive scent.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"My signature, my favourite, my endless love.
Since the moment l first smelled this perfume l fell in love. Its intoxicating.
This perfume is a savage beast it takes no prisoners.
This perfume is not for everyone.
This perfume is not subtle at all.
This perfume will wake up your senses and blow your damn socks off!
It's a powerhouse scent.
This is probably one of the most powerful potions ever made, it's concentration is outstanding. She stands alone. There is no other like her. Literally no other. Maybe Estee Lauder Cinnabar or Youth dew comes the closest out of any other on the market or in history but they are more bitter scratchy spicy where this is creamy spicy.
I get why this perfume was given the Elephant as its animal. If you imagine a fragrance as a jungle animal the elephant is the largest and most awe inspiring force there is. Everything runs from the stampeding elephant its a force to be reckoned with like this perfume.
This oriental spicy dream is so strong l advise you test it on something you can throw away if you dont like it. If you spray its powerful scent on your skin be prepared for it to stick around for at least 24hrs even after a bath and on your clothes even after they've been washed. Oh and don't spray it on your neck straight after a bath, it's so strong it burns, not literally, but stings so bad your skin feels like it's burning! Many a time I've forgotten this rule in a rush and ran for the bathroom to fill my facecloth with cold water to hold against my throat and been left with bright red skin for an hour.
A paper trial is a must for a first time tester.
It's the middle east in a bottle, like walking through a spice market and all the spice fragrances pull your senses from one direction to another. The cloves are like a throat punch and the cumin and cardamom are prominent. The heliotrope Amber vanilla and floral composition turn the spice harshness to a soft sweet creamy spicy.
I've heard others describe it as a ""Christmas candle scent"" erm its quite a bit more complex and exciting than that huns! Way to turn a beautiful world class groundbreaking scent into a basic bitch. 😆 🤣 😂
As I've heard many say its one of those perfumes where even if you're not into heavy or spicy scents you can't help but like this. For many it's instant love.
I must praise the master / genius who created this Mr Dominic Ropion. I thank you sir for my favourite perfume. God bless you and your amazing nose and will to take risks potency and scentwise. Also to Kenzo for marketing it as it was and not asking Ropion to make it weaker to appeal to more sensitive noses. ❤️
This perfume will make you stand out from every other fruity flowery sweet and powdery woman around you. It's unique, nobody will know what it is and everyone will ask you. I've had strangers chase me down the street to ask what it is I'm wearing and where can they get it from? Only 1 person in 30 yrs has ever guessed what it was because their wife used to wear it. When you know, you know!
I will never be without a bottle of this ever, in fact l may demand that I'm sprayed with it for my funeral. I bet strangers will be gathered round my grave enjoying the Kenzo Jungle waft coming up through the soil and filling the air years after ive gone. 😆 🤣 😂
I used to wear this to college in the 90's and the students would know when I was in the building as soon as they walked into the place. They could smell this in the reception area all the way up the stairs and up 3 floors all the way down the corridors getting stronger the closer they got to our class, and l used to arrive much earlier than them. Its that strong.
Sooo... in conclusion this is amazing, if your not afraid of a savage beast perfume. It's also a beautiful bottle and it lasts a long time because with this, one spray really is enough. I use way more though, because I'm fearless like that. 😆 It gets sprayed all over my neck, shoulders, hair, wrists, clothes, l spray heavy because its so awesome and l dont care if it spices peoples brains out. I like to be wrapped in a cloud of expensive perfume and for those around me to smell a trail of my perfume, or what the hell am l spending all this money for, so l can hardly even smell myself? Hell no! I never understand why people think it's such a bad thing to have a trail of lovely perfume left in a room after you've left it. It's better than smelling people's farts, breath, dirty hair and sweaty bodies.
Yes indeed smell me London, inhale my fabulousness, you're welcome. 😆 🤣 😂

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This was a blind buy for me and I was so hoping it would come to be a replacement for my beloved Cinnabar. I guess I don't understand the whole concept with this fragrance. The bottle is cumbersome and a strange shape, I don't think there is anything jungle-ish about it and I don't understand the elephant unless it's to indicate the scent's strength which to me is not that great.
It is not a beast to me, at least not in a good way. It isn't very spicy and seems sweet and creamy to me-very unlike the Cinnabar notes that I was hoping for which is clove, cinnamon, etc.
I do agree with others that it is reminiscent of a Christmas candle, albeit not an expensive one. I'll wear it on the weekends until it's gone, but I don't love it that's for sure.

Edit:
It's growing on me! I was even so bold as to overspray it today and I am getting it. I have tried a lot of new (to me) fragrances over the past couple of months and it is refreshing to put one on without the big, savory amber/ambroxen dry down that really bothers me. Thank god this is on my shelf. I'm sorry I was such a brat about it at first.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I had this five years ago, but sold it; shifting tastes caused me to seek it out again, and I’m glad I did! Jungle l’Elephant used to strike me as a “Christmas candle” scent with an ultra-heavy ambroxan base gluing it down instead of grounding it. These days, I get a fascinating mix of cinnamon-camphor warmth (reminiscent of Tiger Balm), nutty cardamom, creamy tropical florals, and milky vanilla. I couldn’t detect anything floral in it before, and now I notice golden, syrupy ylang-ylang playing hide and seek with all the spices. Yet the biggest difference I notice now versus then is the presence of a fractalized patchouli note, smelling of wet potato skins, right after spraying. Earthy, creamy, warm-spicy. I’d wear this in warm weather as well, though it’s an obvious cold-weather grab. Facets of it remind me of both YSL Cinema and Initio Parfums Psychedelic Love. Always interesting, I don’t get tired of wearing this.",12/18/23 12:59,ingrid.superstar
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight.

But the elephant NEVER sleeps.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant is aptly named. This is the elephant in the room. The most powerful of nature's beasts. This isn't a spice bomb. This is a spice tank. A juggernaut of warm, dry, spicy notes. It's a Christmas candle on the forest floor; the spice rack distilled in fluid form. It fills the radius with the wintry, pungent and earthy aroma of cumin, clove, cardamom and caraway, leaving a trail in its wake. It imprints its scent on everything it touches, with a half-life of hours, days, even weeks on both skin and fabric. Vanilla, the powerful queen of the perfume notes, is no match–she bows in submission, and her floral entourage soon follows. The fruity notes of mango and orange are content to be but mere participants in the elephant's majestic procession. Like its trumpeting cry as it echoes for miles, Jungle L'Elephant announces its presence–and that of its wearer–long before either can be seen.

The elephant is powerful. It can be ridden, but it cannot be tamed. It requires a strong rider. And alas, I am not worthy. I find that I cannot ride the beast. Perhaps it is something in my skin chemistry, or maybe it is my timid temperament. But alas, I do not ride the elephant. The elephant rides me. One spray and I was overpowered. I was overwhelmed, weighed down as though trampled upon by the mighty creature. Spicy notes are already tricky on my skin, and my own chemistry rendered them dirty, pungent and wild. But I cannot hate Jungle L'Elephant. You cannot hate an animal for doing what nature has intended. I am content to respect this magnificent beast, and admire it from afar.

Apply a light and gentle hand, lest the elephant go on a rampage.",12/14/23 21:27,HannahRosesAreRed

I have since learned to not blind buy.",12/04/23 14:47,Neverapeoplepleaser
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This just arrived and I’m so stoked! It’s been on my wish list forever! I knew that I enjoyed this scent a long time ago when trying it in store not too long after it came out (!), at the time it was a bit too mature and powerful to my taste. These days it’s not widely available in physical stores here, so it was a semi blind buy. I knew I would likely enjoy it, as I adore spicy scents, but it was still a bit of a gamble. I found it online for under €60 for 100ml, which is more expensive than my usual maximum price for blind buys of €35-€40, but a solid deal in a fragrance family that is safe for my tastes.

Let me start with the bottle. Since I haven’t really looked at this bottle since the late 90s or early 00s, I didn’t really remember what the bottle looks like exactly. From pictures I assumed that the glass bottle was a simple rectangle, but this is not the case. The bottle makes a beautiful, subtle wave, making it more playful and elegant. The matte gold cap is made of real metal and it’s quite heavy. It fits very tightly on the bottle. I think the design is stylish and elegant, but to nee the matte gold makes it look like it’s plastic when it’s not. I think brushed gold, brushed stainless steel or silver/chrome might have made it look more sophisticated, although it’s possible that they’ve tripped those options and the matte gold worked best with this design.

**THE JUICE**

As soon as I spray it, I recognise the scent, I don’t know from who or where, but I know I’ve smelled it many times before, and I instantly love it.

The opening mainly revolves around cardamom supported by cloves and cumin. It transports me to markets in India, with the scent of spices in the air. I don’t perceive it as particularly christmassy or wintery, probably because there’s no cinnamon, which is the main holiday spice imo.

In the heart the ylang and heliotrope come forward along with the licorice and the scent becomes softer. The longer it develops on my skin the more the vanilla and amber come forward as well, making it softer and softer. This is not sweet, but it’s warm and soft. It’s like the hug of an Indian aunt who spends most of the day cooking all kinds of wonderful Indian dishes. It doesn’t smell so much as a perfume, but as an experience. It takes you to a place, an Indian spice market.

While not listed in the notes I keep thinking I smell Anise, which I think is an illusion of the liquorice mixing with the other spices. It also has an incense-like quality. Not a smoky incense, but something like nag champa sticks fresh from the box, also triggering visions of India.

While this scent is wonderful for fall and winter, I believe it can easily be worn in summer too. To me this scent is more reminiscent of the hot bustling spice markets in India or the Middle East, than of the holiday season, and because there’s very little sweetness, it’s not as likely to become cloying as some other scents.

I’ve only received this about two hours ago, so this truly is my very first impression. I might come back to expand on this review if my opinion changes (or the scent once it settles a bit), or when I’m testing it in different seasons/weather (it is winter now).

ETA: The scent is not nearly as powerful as I expected, I’ve applied twice now to experience the opening again, and it’s not overwhelming at all. However I believe this is because the bottle was very cold when I received it earlier today. I suspect the scent will become much stronger once the bottle settles and warms up more.

Other things I’ve noticed.. the vanilla and spices together remind me of cookies once the vanilla comes through more.. not your typical sweet gourmand perfume cookies, but some sort of more hearty spicy cookie that only has a hint of sweetness. The vanilla is quite fluffy and very creamy, and really fills your nose, similar to the vanilla note in Mancera Vanille Exclusive (just the vanilla not the perfume), albeit less prominent and slightly less dense.

When I breathe in and out on the wrist I’ve applied this on it releases more of the mango and green notes, which does give it more of a jungle vibe. I am guessing that with added humidity and warmth in summer it may well turn into a simmering subtropical rainforest. There’s also something pine like and herbal this way.

ETA2:
After reapplying liberally multiple times, and turning up the heating more in the evening, I finally get the holiday season connotations. It now smells like gingerbread! I’m not sure if other people overspray, of if the juice will become a lot more intense over time, but this was definitely not a one spray result. I also still feel like the scent is more exotic rather than Christmassy, but the gingerbread is there. I’m surprised at how gourmand this actually is. While I did expect it to smell spicy, I didn’t expect it to smell this edible. I expected a spicy oriental in a seductive and sexy way rather than a soft, fluffy, comforting way.",12/04/23 04:58,Amber Plokchouli
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I blind bought this and I regret it so much. From the notes, I thought I was going to love this. I love sweet and spciy perfumes but this is not one. Sweet yes, but where the spice is I couldn't tell you.
White powdery toilet cleaner with a sweet, rotting mango underneath. Very like early Estée Lauder perfumes, like Cinnabar. 60s toilette and not in a good way. Dusty. Bitter palm leaf smell in the dry down, like rotting leaves.

I wouldn't even clean my house with something that smelt like this? HAd to scrub it off my wrist because the compost smell was too much for me.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I used to love Jungle l'elephant, long time ago, I bought recently a bottle of a new version, is possible something went wrong with this bottle because the fragrance
smells very alcoholic, sour and acid at the same time. What a pity...",11/12/23 05:57,Titti Claren
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Whoa! This is intense! I sprayed the back of one hand just once, and I can smell this coming off me in great thundering gallumphing sense-memory-inducing monsoons! A few minutes after I sprayed it, I felt transported back to my childhood, wandering the aisles of Pier One while my parents searched for hippie home accessories and the like. Along with the 1970s-era Pier One smell, those resinous woods and mysterious unguents, I smell something I never experienced back then but would have loved I'm sure: a vanilla-chai latte. Behind all that is a sharp, almost piney-aromatic smell that feels sort of Christmas candle, but not in a bad way. I smell the cardamom and love it; the creaminess also. The musks don't read at all animalic to me, but I don't have a vintage formulation, only the current one from a Fragrance Net decant, so I can't say. This reminds me a little bit of Le Parfum by Lalique, except where that one has bay leaf for the aromatic, this one has something woodier and more piercing. It's also a lot sweeter and creamier than Le Parfum, which is on the crisp, nongourmand side of the vanilla spectrum. I like it a lot so far, but I could see this being oppressive if oversprayed, especially in the heat. As it develops, the gardenia comes through, and it's intoxicating.

I find myself thinking, in a circular, unsatisfying way, about the perfume's name. I understand the allusion to Jungle, of course, but it's still a strange and far from obvious choice. As Kenzo was surely aware, the elephant isn't celebrated nearly as often as the big cats in the perfume world. Elephants don't strike most people as sexy. And yet they are noble, beautiful, intelligent, and highly empathic animals--and increasingly in danger of extinction. Maybe Kenzo meant to draw our attention to their rarity, a rarity reflected in this strange and enormous, intelligent, refined, and LOUD af perfume.",11/10/23 13:19,rene.saller
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Opens with heavy headache inducing spices fighting for attention, with cloves and cardamom standing on top. Then in the background an animalic musk holds everything together. Ultimately the cardamom reigns supreme with the animalic musk standing right behind.
As it dries down, it becomes more creamy, almost lactonic, with vanilla giving it a decent sweetness, reminiscent of Indian kulfi ice cream.
This is a very unique and artistic composition. Not for the faint at heart and definitely not blind buy safe. Exquisite and niche quality, but also quite a polarizing scent.
I can't really recommend this for any particular occasion, maybe winter holidays? Just make sure to go easy on the sprays if you will be indoors! This is powerful stuff!
Definitely not a scent for everyone, but I think every fragrance enthusiast should try this at least once.",11/09/23 06:20,John C. Duboiz
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This is a strong like for me. The opening was an old-school clove and amber, then some slightly chocolate-y patchouli; well-composed, but nothing I haven't smelled before where spicy fragrances are concerned. Then, it didn't exactly change character, but it grew into a lush and slightly fruity warm spicy-- much less clove and very little patchouli, but more of a perfectly balanced cinnamon, cardamom and fragile mango scent. I tested this in cold weather, but I would love to see what happens when heat and humidity press down on the level spiciness just to encounter what note pops out. I can imagine it would turn very luscious, since it proved unexpectedly transformational and pleasantly surprising on first test. That said, I can see how it could fairly be compared to a ""holiday candle""; the evenness of the notes and the lack of a real muskiness to it can call to mind a house scent rather than skin scent.",11/01/23 20:34,thegoob
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Wow this is really stunning. I read so many reviews before buying and it was nothing like I expected.
First I’ll say this really evolves a lot and I don’t mean to say it’s bad at first it’s just not what the final smell will be. So I can see how a lot of people hate it at first smell. You need a chance to understand the full evolution of the perfume before deciding.
The opening is extremely green smell which I think I’m perceiving from the clove and cardamom, but even more I’d say it smells like fresh cinnamon sticks. Yes, I agree it smells like an expensive soap likely from the Heliotrope. Very clean smelling to my nose.
As it evolves I get this beautiful licorice smell coming through, then finally the vanilla comes.
It’s a very concentrated vanilla, not sickly sweet.
When it finally dries the clove becomes sweeter and I can see how people say it smells like a Christmas Candle, but there is something very sexy about it. It’s hard to describe. It smells like the inside of an expensive candle store. You can pick up the main notes, but there are other things there I can’t quite place. Sometimes the drydown reminds me of the quality of angel by mugler due to the strong cinnamon/vanilla & patchouli combo. Very unisex to me!

It really starts to get sweet in the end. It just smells expensive and spicy/sweet like a Christmas decoration store.

Superconcentrated. Half a drop on the skin is enough to last all day. Any more will be cloying. Once it opens up on the skin - a compliment getter.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I used to hate this perfume because the weird smell, however lately i found nowadays this kind of rare quality scent would be more appreciated than new launch fragrances that smell quite mass. If i could describe, Jungle L'Elephant is giving imagination journey to exotic places like Thailand where you can smell the essence of exotic plants and fruit with touch of incense. This is not for everyone, would suggest you to try it first before you buy",10/20/23 02:07,sycomore85
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Questo è un profumo meraviglioso, caldo, confortante,esotico e invernale.
Mi ha incantato dalla prima volta che lo ho provato nel 1996.
Ho confrontato una versione del 96 con una del 2010, la prima aveva un bouquet più denso,l'apertura mostrava liquirizia e spezie indiane che si sentivano da subito,la seconda invece ha un'apertura fredda e verde,canforata,seguita da chiodi di garofano che prevalgono su tutto il resto. Il profumo sembra più sfumato,meno denso. Nella prima il cuore risulta più cremoso,la speziatura resta sul bouquet e permane la liquirizia amara.il sottofondo mandorlato emerge dopo un bel po',la fragranza ha uno sviluppo più lento e graduale. Nella seconda si sente ancora il chiodo di garofano mentre il sottofondo si percepisce a malapena,si sente che c'è qualcosa di morbido e dolce ma è meno distinguibile.
Direi che sono buone entrambe ,ma ovviamente preferisco la prima,che dopo tempo è ancora cremosa e speziata.",10/14/23 14:03,massimilianoinquieto
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I have that type of cursed body chemistry that just eats fragrances. Within 3 hours, nearly every fragrance I’ve tried is gone. Not skin scent. Gone.

But Jungle l’Elephant is the rare outlier that sticks with me. To the point where I need to think carefully about the environments I’m going to find myself in while wearing it, lest I overwhelm people with my fragrance. Two modest sprays is the absolute max I’d use, and even then only if I was going to be somewhere outdoors. I can spray this in the morning, and come evening, it’s still there, softer and closer to be sure, but still commanding a presence.

The smell is a spicy oriental. I don’t get any of the floral others have noticed. Lots of clove and cardamom. Patchouli at the end. A vintage smell to my nose- none of the sugary hyper girlish notes that so many modern fragrances give off to me. This is a fragrance has presence and commands respect- in the way being around an elephant does, I imagine.

This is a great fall/winter scent. Spicy, warm, and interesting enough to keep your attention during long dark winter days.",10/11/23 06:51,SwampHag
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Perfect fall fragrance. I hate to be that girl but it really makes me think of pumpkin pie or a chai latte, it has those cozy, delicious spices that make you smell edible but it still has some grounded florals to keep it smelling designer and nuanced. It’s not exactly spicy and powerful in the empowering designer way, but it’s unusual and smile-inducing once it’s dries down a bit.

Makes me think of a dreamy fall day at a pumpkin patch with your best friend, running through a corn maze and drinking hot cider while sitting on a haystack. It’s even better when you feel the wind rush through your hair and you can smell the chai-latte, vanilla like scent. Comforting, warm, and memory invoking. If you love spicy vanilla scents you won’t regret this once!!

And I personally love the bottle. Cute little elephant :)",10/07/23 18:16,Azisai-

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Thinking ahead to the colder days, I got my elephant bottle in the summer. I shyly dabbled in it as couldn't wait and already liked it back then. I mostly picked up a lot of licorice and more of the fresh spice. But then autumn arrived, the temperature dropped, my throat got a little scratchy and I was craving something warm and uplifting. Oh my goodness, I got just that and more. After sitting for a while, the scent got softer, warmer, rounder and it just sits beautifully on my skin and around me all day (2-3 sprays). It is powerfully enveloping, but not harsh or intruding. As much as I love my candles, I wouldn't compare it to one. For me, it's a gorgeous fairy dust of an amazing spice blend with just the right amount of sweetness.",10/01/23 02:15,Gypsy G
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"As a teenager I worked in a small local perfume shop. Any time a customer tried Elephant I got a horrible headache that didn’t leave until the next day. While I don’t necessarily hate this perfume, this perfume sure hates me.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,Very spicey with some brown sugar. A bit plain and not too complex. I liked it in the 90s as it was a novelty back then to be so spicey and sweet.,09/23/23 10:31,Eve_evolution
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,It smells like a medicinal tea with a bit of brown sugar in it. I feel a lot of cumin and cardamom when I smell this and there's something about this that makes it nauseating for me. I think it might be the licorice undertone that I honestly don't like at all. I appreciate the novelty and the bottle is beautiful but not my cup of tea.,09/16/23 02:41,lauravladelena
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Christmas candle was a good description, and I do mean that in a positive way. I love Christmas candles. I ordered L'Elephant early this summer, smelled it, and promptly put it up on the shelf to save for a colder day.
I'll probably come back and add more thoughts after I've worn this more than once, but all I can say for now is WOW: this shit smells like gourmet vegan Smarties from a hippie supplement shop. Spicy, tart, fruity, sweet - I think it's the cardamom that makes it feel so edible, that and the vanilla. I wish I'd just gone ahead and gotten a big bottle instead of a miniature. I love it already.",09/08/23 18:11,scatteredshowers
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"What a beautiful perfume to wear it at home. Yes, it is beautiful, but its strength and notes are not suitable for this day and age. I still wear it, but only when I am alone, or going out on a snowy, cold winter day.",09/02/23 00:10,seventh
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I love this.It's addictive.Although it does have that air freshner Christmas candle and a bit of fermented sausage smell to it,its very sweet warm and spicy oriental that still makes it very pleasant.
Longevity and projection is lacking on me unfortunately.Its not extreme as others describe it.
However it is wearable and I will show it love this time since I repurchased it.I had decluttered it in the past.",08/30/23 00:29,Fruit-chan
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Absolute bomb of an opening. This is a powerful and spicy scent. It may just be the power of suggestion, but I definitely get the ""gentle giant"" vibe they are going for, from the strong spices contrasting with the soft flowers and wood. Wearing this, I feel like I should be sitting in the middle of a forest grove, communing with nature. I love this but have no idea when I would wear it. It's the sort of thing I would wear at home when the mood strikes, but not out and about. Well-executed concept.",08/21/23 04:22,Tembacat
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This makes me smell like a spicy marshmallow and I love it.

Delighted that I don’t get any cumin.
Not getting any patchouli, either, but it’s vintage and who knows how it was stored, etc.",08/20/23 17:46,Bangabanga
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"What an interesting and beautiful scent. I'd been putting off trying this bc I was worried it might be too in-your-face, overwhelming, and suffocating, but after finally taking the plunge, I'm so happy I got this. This is way softer and more graceful than I was imagining. And the evolution of it is so fun!

Upon first spray, I immediately get spicy, creamy white flowers. Like gardenias on a hot summer day, with someone smoking a clove cigarette in the background. As it develops, the clove comes forward, and its presence brings with it the mango, mandarin, and ylang-ylang. It's gives off a lovely ""Christmas spices mulling on the stovetop"" vibe. In the drydown, the clove fades into harmony with the other notes and settles nicely into a blend of warm vanilla, clove, gardenia, a hint of simmered orange, and a whisper of powdery ylang-ylang.

I definitely see why it's called L'elephant. This might be the ""roundest"" perfume I've ever come across. Absolutely no sharpness here, and it has a commanding-yet-gentle presence. The scent picture brings to mind the magic of spotting a majestic elephant while on a hike thru the lush jungle (as opposed to seeing a rampaging elephant tear thru the brush while on a safari tour, like I was originally picturing). To me, Kenzo Jungle L'elephant is quite in line with many of the 90's classics and their style of sweet, fluffy glamour, and I'm so glad we still have this in circulation.",08/11/23 12:37,Foxzilla
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Very strong and very spicy aura. Not for everyone.
I get most of the spice and strong patchouli when I sniff closely. Is very sharp when you bring your nose closer. You can't get any fruit or flower with a close distance.
When you move your body, some dry fruit scent do appear but very mild.
0 sweetness, is very dry and powdery scent.

This can be great for layering your perfume.
I tried to layer with Crystal Noir EDP, smell gorgeous with the L'elephant.
Might try a few option to match this. Can be very interesting.

About the bottle, the juice color and the elephant cap bottle is stunning.
Too bad this match with a square bulky body glass. Body glass shape can be better.",08/11/23 07:35,jocing

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"I am French Caribbean and this fragrance feels like home. It reminds me of the kind of dessert we serve in Martinique and Guadeloupe. This is thick, warm.

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Christmas in a bottle! Stunning scent with great performance. Right in the middle unisex. This definitely will pierce through the cold, but I also think it can be worn during the hotter days. The fleeting tropical fruity and floral scent comes out between the different spicies makes it spring and summer appropriate. The sweetness is light, too. Dominique Ropion has done it again and again. Side note, Kenzo and Cartier are probably the most underrated designer houses out there.",07/29/23 13:07,dexilio
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Unique and captivating! All these spices enhanced with fruity and vanilla notes seduce me. The bottle is pretty, but bulky. I was reluctant about the cumin and caraway, but it's skillfully balanced with cardamom and floral notes. What originality!!! The first dominant note is really that of clove.",07/26/23 14:38,Joss007
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Performs like a spicy niche on a budget price.

I have a lot of love for this 90s spicy powerhouse. Luckily it smells similar to how I remember it & performs reasonably well. In a blind sniffing I would believe it was high end & it is definitely a love it or loathe it scent.

It is ALL kinds of spice. Deep, vibrant, resinous & in your face. The cloves take centre stage but it’s not your average Christmas scent. It is unique & chaotic & absolutely fabulous. Even the dry down is a deliciously bonkers cardamom vanilla. There is warmth, but low, mellow sweetness. There is dry spice tempered with rich, dried peel. This is the kind of fruit cheese or chutney you’d pair with a particularly funky blue cheese. It’s bold, unabashed a real trip.

Bland is boring. Elephant is bold & bonkers. Absolutely adore it.",07/15/23 10:38,sky76sky
Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"This is such a classic! I discovered this fragrance trough my mom, since she owned the original bottle in the 90s. I am usually fond of oriental, sweet and gourmand fragrances, so I knew I would love this one as well. This perfume was LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT! When you first spray this fragrance you instantly get hit with this sweet, almost honey-sweet cumin and cardamom note. It almost reminds me of those spiced Christmas cakes you eat during holidays. The smell slowly progresses into a fruity mandarin note which is so nicely blended with the spices. I also get just a hint of mango in there. The drydown is a classic vanilla scent. This is definitely a love or hate type of perfume, not for the faint of heart. The price is reasonable in my opinion. This scent leans more feminine. If you are a fan of sweet and spicy oriental perfumes, you should definitely try this out!",07/02/23 08:52,RoxannaVonD

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"What an interesting fragrance. It smells like Christmas but would be equally appropriate for hot, balmy weather. It opens sweet with the orange, but dries down spicier. One time I wore it, I got tons of cinnamon and clove (like cinnamon gum). Another time the cumin was overtly strong and it gave it a savory food smell. It's exotic, unique, and like no other fragrance I've encountered before. It's also incredibly strong - both in projection and longevity. Great powerhouse and really is underpriced for what it is, it feels very niche.",06/27/23 07:08,GabrielleeeeeW

Kenzo Jungle L'Elephant Kenzo,"Whole Lotto Ylang-Ylang, but more: like i'm in --yes-- a jungle, but down on the forest floor with my nose under a tree root where someone stashed their spice collection.

Rêve Lotus Kenzo,"My nose reads the opening as more cucumber-fresh than lotus on my skin – probably because I encounter cucumbers more often than real lotus. The mimosa’s honeyed sweetness rises slowly and softly, cushioned by a clean white-musk veil. The touch of sandalwood and ambroxan is so restrained that nothing sticks out; it simply adds body to that ""refreshing sweetness"".

It’s minimalist, intimate, and zen – but not flat or strictly linear. A calm, contemplative skin-scent that fits Kenzo’s ethos beautifully.",08/02/25 19:19,cz_Lukas
Rêve Lotus Kenzo,"For those who remember the Kenzoki line from the mid-2000s, there's no need to explain what this fragrance smells like. It's impossible to forget the soft, slightly powdery, ""rice-like"" scent of their body and face creams. I got them around 2003 and thought, ""What a great scent, I want a mist with this!"" And a couple of years later, they actually came out – I happily bought them: Rice, Lotus, Bamboo.

Holding those jars and bottles was a separate aesthetic pleasure; they felt like velvet to the touch, and the creams melted on the skin, leaving that light haze and aura :)

In fact, I'm very glad that the company decided to continue this idea a decade later (it's been about 10 years, hasn't it?) and slightly reinterpret these fragrances – they're worth it.

By the way, they have a magical property – when needed, they can calm your nerves at night, and when needed, they can energize you in the morning after a shower and workout.

The modern version is slightly more long-lasting than that mist, but overall, it's the same thing.

Recommendation: definitely worth trying!",05/09/25 00:30,Daretobedecadent
Rêve Lotus Kenzo,"As someone who is into quite powdery clean smells and does not like overly floral or sweet notes, I really like this perfume. It gives me an instant feeling of cleanness and freshness. I have to say, I do not smell “lotus” in it — It has a very soapy/shapooey smell, in my opinion. But it is an expensive natural soapy smell mixed with a breath of fresh air after rain, which I love. The first perfume after Chloe Love (which was discontinued) that gives me similar vibes. But unlike Chloe, it is more calm and neutral. Not overpowering or irritating, very delicate. Settles in a musky smell. It lasts a good amount of time and does not get “heavy” as it fades. It is quite a pricy perfume, but I never regretted buying it.",01/11/25 10:18,Leskin

To me, it's smell of air after rain in the early autumn (you get it, right?) mixed with a hint of something sweet/floral. Dries down to a beautiful musky woody base, surprisingly deep and creamy for an aquatic/ozonic perfume. Sometimes sandalwood takes the lead in the composition which I don't mind too, as I love its smell. Mimosa is quite prominent but it's balanced so well by the lotus and woody notes, it's not at all straightforward. I am really in love with the scent. Works best in rainy/foggy weather.",01/12/24 01:33,nordlanderin

Later on lotus starts to be more prominent, giving the scent aquatic Kenzo vibe, reminding the familiar DNA.
Projection is not big, just like with the original. But it's a lovely, citrusy summer scent.

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"Incredible, powdery, sweet, but never cloying, the smell is absolutely addictive, and I’ve been addicted for years. If I knew that it was discontinued when I was buying my last bottle — I would have cleared out the store shelves. I was prepared to wear this for the next hundred years. It’s the only perfume that I never get tired of, or bored with, it never caused a headache or burned my nose (I am overly sensitive). I would go into debt to bankroll an Inception-style heist to plant an idea into Alberto Morillas’ head (or Kenzo CEO) to get this perfume into their regular non-limited edition production. I am using the last bottle extremely sparingly, good thing this perfume lasts forever on dresses, scarves, and coats.
L’Elixir came close, but this is the scent I will forever hallucinate about. The powderiness of it is perfect — I have never ever encountered anything similar, and I’ve been hunting powdery scents. It blends with my skin chemistry in a way I’ve never encountered before or after. I will genuinely be devastated when I will spray the last drop. I’m not sure I will be able to throw out the bottle.

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"I bought a very old bottle, has to be 2003 not 2013 given the state of the box and research I've done. The bottle having been sealed up for so many years remained unscathed and the juice inside pristine. Unbelievable juice from Kenzo. The best of Flower hands down. It smells niche by today's standards, there is nothing ""designer"" about this stuff, especially not in 2021. I can't believe my nose, this fragrance was way ahead of it's time. If you wanted Lipstick, this would have been your girl. It reminds me a little bit of Drole De Rose, with the violet and rose, almond, musk. But Le Parfum is denser and smells of higher quality. It's more Lipstick-y than Drole with less powder, more creaminess and a subtle waxy sweetness.

I'm not a big fan of Alberto Morillas' work, but this is exceptional. It's to die for. I have the 50 mL parfum spray, but would like to try Just A Drop and Satin Spray some day. L'Elxir is a completely different scent. Le Parfum is far and away the winner of the two, for me. Being a parfum, it stays closer to the body but lasts extremely well. I'm very thankful to have been able to acquire this beauty. I love everything about it. It was snowing today and Le Parfum was an absolute dream.",11/18/21 19:13,Swedelish
Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"I naively sold my bottle years ago, before I knew of it's discontinuation......and now of course you can't find it anywhere.

Smooth, delicious powdery vanilla almond violet. A lot better that the OG in my opinion. Stupid young me though it was 'too heavy' for day wear and I'd never finish it, as all we wore were fruity florals back then. If only I had known that perfumes of this type don't really turn, especially not in an opaque bottle......

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"I have had both Kenzo Flower in the sheer bottle w/ lovely poppy flower decoration- and this one, in the vibrant red bottle.
I like them both, but Le Parfum (created in 2003) is rounder, deeper and more sophisticated than its predecessor (born in 2000).
Kenzo Flower Le Parfum is a powdery iris/violet/ vanilla/amber mix.
So, cuddly, elegant, warm, soft...reminds me of my childhood.
You get this huge was of baby powder (iris and violet).
The base is a soft, almost gourmand vanilla musk accord, but the amber makes is so cozy and wintry.
Definetely a winter fragrance to me, evokes a soft warm blanket.
It's easy to wear, does not need to much thinking or exotic occasions to be worn.
A little treasure!

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"Fragrance Review For Flower Le Parfum By Kenzo

Notes: Almond Violet Rose Amber Vanilla Musk

This is one of the flankers for the original Flower and has a sweet powdery but tragically short life, just like a real flower! I detected the rose but I've smelled better rose fragrances. Soft delicate rose with powdery attar. The violet is what most jumps out at me. For whatever reason I always immediately pick up on violet notes. The floral scent is very nice but I wish it lasted longer. The dry down is vanilla and amber very much a soap scent clean and uncomplicated. There is a touch of musk but I found it to be very light. An inoffensive, easy to wear, any occasion perfume.",04/25/16 04:18,Gigi The Fashionista
Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"This perfume is very pretty, romantic, classy and sweet. It's very much a Valentines Day fragrance. For women who love roses and want to smell good for their man. I detect a slight similarity to Elizabeth Taylor's Diamonds and Rubies, but this one is less floral. The rose and violet notes really stand out and they're sweetened by almonds and vanilla. An enchanting seductive scent of powder wafts up now and then a bit like rose powder. Sweet and soft, subtle, elegant and less floral than you'd expect even with a name like Flower. This should be called Vanilla Rose. I love fragrances like this and at the end you get blissful amber. Perfection.",03/07/16 19:55,Southern Blonde

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"I find it interesting that no one is stating which formulation of this one they have: Satin Spray (75ml), Natural Spray (50ml) or Just a Drop (15ml). I think that makes a different in application, and possibly in how the scent will wear on the skin. I have the 15ml ""Just a drop"" formulation, which goes on as a thick liquid gel in drop form when you spray (as opposed to a spritz on the skin). I think this formulation gave me decent longevity (8 hours now, mostly a faint skinscent on me but still there, a bit).

That being said, I am disappointed in this one. I had hoped the almond note would show up on me in some way, shape, or form, but it made absolutely NO appearance. From first spritz to drydown, all I got was powdery violet (really heavy baby powder) and heavy white musk. There may have been a tiny whiff of rose, but it was very much overpowered by the baby powder and white musk on my skin. This is very sad indeed, as this one is getting harder to find and I had really hoped it would be a gem. All I can say is, it's a lovely scent if you love powdery violet and musk. For me, it's heading to the swap list, it just doesn't wow me otherwise.",02/09/15 15:16,Lipglossjunkee

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"Every time I wear a new Kenzo, I fall more in love with the house. This is the only house who seems to get a lot of fun out of taking chances with gourmand notes, and all with an Asian flair. If you've never worn Flower, you should know that it's the perfumers interpretation of a poppy flower. Poppies don't have any scent, so the entire composition is made up, and it does smell unlike any flower I've smelled, which is why I like it - because it doesn't have any discernible floral notes, however, you CAN smell the gourmand notes and I love it for that too. It gives me the sensation of dreaming while my eyes are open.

I was hesitant to wear this parfum version even though I've had it for a few years, because I LOVE the original Flower, so thank God I finally tried it because I love it.

The Kenzos have amazing longevity. This is the parfum satinant version in the original formulation with the all red bottle. It's been nearly 3 hours and the top notes are just beginning to settle. I was afraid this version would be too heavy in this super hot weather, and I am glad I was wrong. This is actually much lighter than the original and it has a halo effect - meaning, I can't smell it when I press my nose to my wrist, but I smell a halo of fragrance all around me.

It started very very powdery, but with an underlying current of warm resinous vanilla and almond. It is - at the same time - lighter and more airy than the original, but also fuller and warmer. Luca Turin gave it 3 stars and calls it a coffee vanilla and I completely agree. I make a chocolate coffee pudding sometimes when I have leftover coffee because it makes the chocolate more chocolatey and the same is true of this perfume. The coffee note made the vanilla and almond more vanilla-ish, more custardy, rounder, and heavier as a base. The floral notes are lighter and more airy than the original too. This is the perfect scent for hot weather, whereas the original Flower is better in cold weather. It's somewhat linear, but has insane longevity. I love it.",06/27/14 11:05,Jitterbug Perfume Lover

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"I have it in Just A Drop (15ml).

Le Parfum is sensational. Literally. I bought this a few weeks ago. Normally when I buy a new bottle I will have eyes for nothing else for about a week and I'll keep sniffing and spritzing. New love, you know? But with Flower Le Parfum, OH MY GOSH. I cannot get over this. I put it on and every time I feel like... it's magical, honestly. This is vanilla-powder-floral HEAVEN. Not much development on me, it's just vanilla and powder and violet on me for the most part, but I notice that when I'm warmer it gets a little bit deeper, like there's a nutty quality (roasted almond to me) that deepens when it's warm. Ugh I adore this stuff.

The bottle is wonderful - it's opaque so I can put it on my dresser without worrying about light ruining it - yay! And it's tiny enough to throw in a purse - not that you would need to, since this stuff lasts FOR.EVER. I kid you not. It is so longlasting I can put it on in the morning and wear it all day and come home and shower... and it'll still be there on my wrists IN THE MORNING. Let's just praise God for this for one second :D

The consistency of the perfume is so new to me - I love it! Almost like a perfume gel? They should do more of these. Oh and when they say, just a drop, they mean just a drop. One drop of the gel is easily dabbable between wrists and on the neck. And I pat my cleavage with my wrists as well, where it warms up nicely and drifts up to my nose intermittently throughout the day - just to say hi :) ONE DROP.

This is... I don't know, I feel like I need to buy ALL THE BOTTLES that are left in te world, because I will never ever EVER be able to be without this. Winner.",04/29/14 05:01,angel has a problem

I really like how it smells grown up and simple. They smell related to me, but they do not smell like the same perfume. I really like the woodsy notes that cast this in a more mature light for me.

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"I love this perfume, but I only like Flower. On me they are quite different. The opening of Flower is like when you've thrown too much powder on baby and it's gone up your nose, and you look down to find you are all white. The violet comes a little later, and although the drydown is nice I'm never 100% sure. Le Parfum smells like Birds custard powder instead. It's calmer, less pungent, sweet creamy and yellow with a little rose, whereas Flower is white brittle and dry with a little violet. Hard to find, and a sad shame it is because I'll cry when mine runs out.",03/10/14 09:23,MrsLetterO
Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"This smells very similar to the regular Flower - powdery, creamy, violetty, vanillic, woody.

I have the bottle from 2004 and from 2012 and the juice is quite different.
The old one has definitely more vanilla, becomes more powdery and is more concentrated as Hadassa mentioned.
The new one is brighter in the opening (I may even say fresher) and I don't get that much of vanilla-milky notes. It's not so strong and powdery as the old one.

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"This is the best powdery perfume I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot, as I am a certified powder freak ;)

I dislike the original Flower to be honest; it's too bland. And this one... I am just crazy about it!

As a mother I know how addictive and beloved your baby's skin scent might be. And FLOWER LE PARFUM, to my nose, is the closest representation of it. It's a soft, tender, clean, milky, sweet scent of the velvety skin. It makes me swoon!

The only problem is that when I wear it I cannot concentrate, I keep sniffing my wrists all the time!

Someone said here that it reminds her of breastfeeding. It does! For me, breastfeeding is the fondest expression of love between mother and child, the most natural and touching. This perfume certainly reminds me of this kind of feeling.

I am a happy owner of two bottles, one made in 2005, another brand new (2012). I have to say that the older one seems to be more dense and concentrated, probably it has changed over time.

I highly recommend to catch it while you can.

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"Flower Le Parfum opens with the incense-like sharpness as the original Flower. For the first hours, I can detect a slight play-doh scent due to vanilla + almond. At this stage it's like hiding Hypnotic Poison under the signature sharpness of Flower. Towards the drydown, it smells very close to the original to my nose, just more intensive and a little warmer due to the presence of amber.

I totally agree with bhean_sidhe that the original Flower is ""ghostly"", always there but never in a solid form. However, Flower le Parfum, though more intense, is still ""ghostly"" IMO. Although I love Flower, thus love Flower le Parfum, I have to admit that these two are too similar to own both, unless you're a die-hard fan or you got a bargain.",06/26/13 13:10,StellaDiverFlynn

Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum Kenzo,"I had the bottle. At first I had a sample though and I liked it so I thought about buying a whole bottle. When I finally found it and bought it, I noticed that the scent is simply too tiring for me.

The scent is a bit similar to Kenzo Amour Le Parfum, I mean both scents have something ""holy"" - opponax doesn't figure in a list of ingredients here but I suppose I read somewhere it is in the fragrance and it gives the ""holy"" feeling. Also in the end the scent becomes milky - it's nice but holy milk reminds me about breastfeeding ;) and a high pressure of breastfeeding in my country so no, thank you... Actually opponax, almonds and milk comes into play on me the most - but opponax is the most intensive making the scent so ""holy"" that I feel uncomfortable. Holy earth, holy milk...

The fragrance is thick and oily, lasting power is a killer really, in my opinion lasts longer than Elephant because when a drop of the fragrance is put on something (I was preparing a small sample and a drop was left on a desk), it lasts and lasts for almost one month!. The bottle is pretty, it's even prettier in reality than in a photo, it really looks pretty on the shelf. All in all, it's not my kind of fragrance but it's a very good one, I have to admit.

This perfume inspired by the spring festivities celebrated in India and Nepal full of color, brings us an enhanced version of Amour here the floral notes are the absolute protagonists, enhancing much more the note of cherry blossom and the characteristic frangipani (flower present in the entire line) together with the vanilla here not so creamy but rather warm accompanied by the notes of incense and sandalwood, the opening of this flanker is much powerful and projects very well for an hour or two which undoubtedly was an improvement compared to the original, but unfortunately it loses that creamy note of rice pudding that I love from the original, here after the first hour and a half the fragrance calms down little by little and I find that delicious rice-vanilla DNA which is not It feels so creamy and powdery because it is not accompanied by the note of tea, but is seasoned with red berries and pink pepper which gives this composition much more warmth and joy.

It's a very feminine scent, with a soft projection but lasting durability, and it's suitable for most occasions. I can't compare it to the normal Amour, though, as I haven't tested it yet, but this is certainly for someone demure who wants just a bit of spice.

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,From the moment I sprayed this gem I was amused. At first it seemed too much. Within 20 minutes it was playful.

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"This is such a beautiful scent. I love it. So comforting, yet fresh. I mainly get rice steam and soft florals against a cuddly vanilla backdrop. The vanilla leans powdery-clean and creamy, rather than sticky-sweet. If only it were more easily available. It's unique and sensual without being imposing, and makes for a perfect signature or day to day scent. It also lasts a good amount of time on me (7 hours) and has a moderate but gentle projection. I can wear this one all year round, but it's especially lovely in spring and fall. I don't care much for original Amour, but I love this one, and I also adore Amour le parfum, that one is better suited for cold months.",04/27/18 04:15,marialena888m
Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"I am fond of the original Kenzo Amour and even more so of Kenzo Amour Le Parfum. I am currently wearing Amour Indian Holi on the crook of my left arm and the original Amour on the crook of my right arm, Le Parfum only existing as a memory due to the admirable speed with which I finished my 5 ml decant months ago.

The main accords listed here on Fragrantica go Vanilla-Floral-Fresh for the original and Floral-Fresh-Vanilla for Indian Holi. Seems about right to me.

On my skin, the original Amour is all about the vanillic rice pudding on a backdrop of soft, vaguely floral fabric softener. It is round, enticing and slightly sweet. Indian Holi definitely tones down the rice in favor of a floral character that is sharp upon initial application and mellows with time into a fresh, pink breeze of subdued vanilla, red berries and cherry blossom, retaining the character I would still describe as fabric softener. Amour is wider, Indian Holi is straight-forward, if that makes sense. Le Parfum draws on the original more than it does Indian Holi.",09/20/17 01:18,Madrona
Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"Soapy spring florals at first spray, but they begin to warm up as the vanilla, incense and sandalwood come through.
Whats left is a gorgeous creamy and powdery oriental scent.
Its very pretty and comforting and for some reason reminds me of my childhood.
This scent is also surprisingly strong, one spray goes a long way.
Im not familiar with the smell of rice in perfume but i notice it here, it really brings together the whole perfume and gives it a special quality that makes this perfume unique.
I think its perfect for this Autumn",03/07/17 16:19,Edemay
Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"Kenzo amour was my signature scent years ago but I need a fresh test of it,so I can compare these two,I'm gonna edit when I do so
This Indian holi flanker is lovely
It's an oriental floral or oriental vanilla in my book not a floral woody musk..
This is very soothing, cozy,cuddly and fresh the same time, and I love such a freshness
There is a dominant creamy vanilla,flavored by cherry blossom and a nice,delicious rice steam,little amount of musk and sandalwood to make it deeper and more unique and a touch of frangipani and some other florals to make it more youthful and likable.. Honestly I don't get mentioned notes individually but I can feel their presence,all I get is soft floral vanilla,wrapped in rice steam and some musky sandalwood.I don't detect incense and I don't miss it. It's creamy,fluffy, warm and fresh as mentioned and one of most beautiful creamy vanillas..everything is blended artistically and result is this adorable, delightful,calming scent..sweetness is not sickening,it's not like any other perfume I know except original amour,they both share amour signature gene
I wish it was stronger, Longevity is moderate on me.it radiates softly but noticeably for people around you for an hour or two, then it's almost a skinscent,still I'm happy to wrap myself in this soothing heaven
Edit:
I compared it side by side with original amour and as I thought they share a similar skeleton but Indian holi has more fresh flowers with a slight fruity undertone while the original is more heavy in vanilla-rice pouding.the original is a bit sweeter,warmer and more cozy.has a few hours more longevity and better sillage.indian holy has a slight fruity tartness in opening and has a bit of sharpness comparing to well-rounded, creamy original.
Indian holi is exactly what we can name a day/warm weather version of original amour though it's wearable year round not just in spring and summer.
It's difficult to choose which one I prefer.I really enjoy both of them but if I have to choose one,it would be the original amour because it packs more punch and I love creamy, sweet,vanilla scents but now that I have both I can choose each of them in different situations. I'm still a hardcore fan of Kenzo Amour but Indian holi is so good that I've already used up my 30mil and purchased a 100mil of it.I love how fresh it is while being a vanilla scent and I love it's floral freshness, I prefer it to aquatic, ozonic or citrus freshness .this is a heavenly floral-vanilla scent that you may love even if you usually hate florals or vanilla scents
Now I'd really love to have a bottle of Kenzo l'eau amour for these hot summer days and a bottle of discontinued Kenzo Amour le parfum for the future winter",08/01/16 21:52,Soofiya

Longivity and sillage are not so bad on my skin, soft but always in my nose for several hours.
Frangipani offers after a while in a very nice way.

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"My daughter owns this and was wearing it today. I actually thought she had snuck into my stash and borrowed my Ellen Tracy Bronze perfume...the dry downs are that similar...floral, balsamic, powdery & perfect in the warm late Spring temperatures which seem to bring out its warm notes in the most perfect, balancing way. If the $100+ Kenzo price tags are a bit steep for your budget, I suggest you try ETB...it is very similar & an affordable scent which is easily accessible & found in many discount US stores (Ross, Marshall's, TJMaxx).

I switched it with a friend and she gave me the chilling Organza on it's place. Veeeery annoying and boring.",01/01/14 18:54,Aline Ribeiro

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"Heavenly. I searched for a very long time for a perfume that would make me weak in the knees. I found exactly that and more in Indian Holi.

It is lovely, much better than the classic version - it still has the soapiness, vanilla hint and rice-incense note of Kenzo Amour EDP, but the note of cherry blossom makes it just soo soft, like pink, cashmere pullover :)
I don't find it sexy, or bold, but I cannot belive that someone might not like it at all - it's save - for dinner at grandma's, for playing with little baby, for party with friends, and even for nice date in the winter evening.",09/28/13 16:08,Gia713

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"There is something in this flanker and the original Kenzo Amour that just doesn't work with my chemistry. I half suspect that the rice note has a lot to do with it, maybe even the peony too.

I love the name and I love the bottle, but unfortunately the scent doesn't love me. It becomes quite sharp and rubbery on my skin, with a musky cherry blossom accord mixed with some harsh, smoky incense. I really don't think I'll be re-applying Kenzo Amour Indian Holi anytime soon.

I'd be lying if I didn't say I was disappointed. I really thought I would enjoy this flanker. It would have been nice to smell Kenzo Amour Indian Holi on someone else, especially one with the right skin chemistry. That cherry blossom, vanilla and rice blend must be divine.

Despite this fragrance's incompatibility with my skin, it did last a good six or more hours and projected quite strongly. I would wear it during Autumn and Winter.

Thankfully Kenzo Amour Le Parfum worked for me, so if there are any other unfortunate people who struggle to wear both this flanker and the original, do try the exclusive Kenzo Amour Le Parfum.",08/06/13 22:28,missk

As for the fragrance, I actually pick up some rose in this. It appears that other reviewers haven't noticed it on themselves, but on me it is subtle, but there.

I'm mostly getting cherry blossom, creamy vanilla and rice. This is sweet without being over-the-top and it's well-blended into a lovely and very feminine fragrance. It lasts for hours, but it's not a silliage bomb on me.

This gentle, mysterious, powdery-sweet-spicey blend was immediatley delightful, and had settled down to a soft,delicate incense-like prettiness by the time I realized that the store had discontinued selling it :-(
I jumped online and found it easily :-) That was 2 days ago, and as I write I am listening hopefully for the delivery truck!
The scent lingered all day when I tried it, seeming to mingle with my own skin in a most flattering way. Even after showering it was detectable, thankfully! Not in a bullyish way, more like I'd adopted it and it was happy to live with me!

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"I finally received this after craving it for a year. Let me start by saying I have an obsession with India and Asian cultures, so when I first saw it on the shelves I knew that I will fall in love with it. The perfume accents a lot of important ingredients and scents that you would smell visiting India and the cherry blossom you would smell visiting Japan as well. The scent bursts with juicy red berries that quickly gives its place to spicy creamy cherry blossom. The floral heart emerge itself after that turns it into a romantic journey by itself. The incense is always there but it's not suffocating incense neither in your face, in contrary the incense only adds a smokey mysterious allure to this fragrance.The pink pepper and the spices tickle your nose as it goes to its dry down which has a woodsy vanilla creamy texture complimented by the long lasting cherry blossom that lingers.
The fragrance staying power is excellent 6 to 8 hours on my skin, sillage isn't so strong it would only project itself around half of meter radius around you and the sillage last for 2 hours then it turns to a skin scent that evolves by the time spent on your skin.

My man was surprised by how romantic, sensual and feminine ( his exact words) so it's definitely a scent that would suit a romantic date, a night of passion and anytime you feel like you want to smell divine.

Its suitable to all seasons, night and day. It can take you from an office setting to a romantic date. I tried it before in the summer and the only difference that the vanilla and incense were more prominent with the heat but nothing unbearable or headache inducing (for me and others).

As for myself I will be wearing this while enjoying a homemade Indian curry dinner with my husband.

If you love cherry blossom this is a must have.

Its what I imagine living in a rainbow filled world would feel like! This scent absolutely makes you feel like that...so free spirited, a happy go lucky type of personality who falls in love carelessly. A new fave! I cant believe I never tried this one before.

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"Kenzo Amour Indian Holi starts out soft, sweet, and warm, with flowers, rice milk, and red fruits over a base of incense and the littlest bit of spice. At times, Indian Holi smells like peach cobbler a la mode; at others, it smells like rice pudding with saffron; and at yet others, like incense and vanilla.

Despite its name, there's very little spice to be found here; if you're looking for a perfume with those gorgeous Indian chai spices, you'll have to look elsewhere. The name Indian Holi refers not the spiciness of Indian cuisine, but the bright, colorful nature of Holi, a holiday in India where people throw rainbow colored pigments on each other in celebration.

It's odd, but Amour Indian Holi smells reminiscent of Burberry Brit EDP, although I can't really pick any single notes that they share in abundance other than vanilla. They both have that ""peach cobbler a la mode"" smell despite both lacking peach, although Brit is more fruity and bold than the soft incense of Indian Holi.

I'm not yet sure if I want to invest in a bottle of Indian Holi when I've got a full bottle of Brit hanging around for those peach cobbler-craving days, but that rice pudding and incense is so delicious that I might just go out of my way to grab a bottle of this as well.",12/24/11 18:19,luxatron

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"I am in love! This is sweet but not syrup-y gourmand IMO. I get spices like cinnamon and cardamom, beautiful sandalwood, a bit of incense, dry vanilla.

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"This is lovely, youthful incense infused scent. I absolutely love it. The cherry blossom is nicely balanced by the smokiness, and the spice is very light, just giving the sweetness an edge.",07/17/11 20:19,pinkxlulu
Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"A charming little thing. The first impression was ”oh no, another fruit syrup”. Yes, it is extremely sweet, but the combo cherry blossom - spices is a lucky one. I’m not fond of gourmand sweet fragrances, but should I pick up one, I would take Amour Indian Holi.",07/15/11 02:48,marymargret
Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"This is a beautiful, exotic floral scent. By far the best cherry-blossom scent I've encountered yet.

The sweet cherry-blossom is the star of this perfume, along with the fresh rice steam, rose (not listed above), incense, and vanilla. It is warm and fresh at the same time. This certainly isn't loud or over-the top. It is gorgeous and soft, and would work as an everyday scent any time of the year.

The bottle is stunning, and captures the fragrance inside well - colourful, beautiful and cheery!",07/07/11 16:14,orchid_84
Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"I adore it - the incense adds just the right amount of smokiness to the sweetness of the cherry blossom. It imbues it with a slightly mystical, exotic air that is perfectly in keeping with the name. That said, it has absolutely no staying power, at least on me. I sprayed it on my wrist, and it was all but gone an hour later. Divine, but unfortunately, very short-lived. Like being taken up to heaven and then unceremoniously kicked out, all in one afternoon.",06/07/11 09:29,MsRachael

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"I had this one and it was the version of Amour I liked most. It had a bit of spice and raunchyness to it. But even here the original Amour note was so strong and getting on my nerves with the drydown - because the spicyness and raunchyness faded away then. If you are looking for these kind of spices in a stronger way, have a look at Tova and ""Nirvana"". It's also a scent inspired by India - and Indian Holi for me was like a light version of ""Nirvana"".",05/20/11 05:33,Habanita

Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"I just tried Amour Indian Holi. I havent ever smelt the regular amour, but this one is quite delicious, however it doesnt last very long.
The initial sent was lively but slightly mysterious. after only a few minutes my wrist had turned into a field of lush, flavorful flowers after a fresh rainfall, only, it had rained a crisp citrus that is lingering on the leaves and petals of the red and orange hued flowers. sadly this doesnt last much more than 15 minutes before the scene fades and subtle spices begin to saunter by, and as this leisurely parade strolls past, it begins to slowly pull a soapy, astringent scent with them, with hints of soft white flowers.
I've only been wearing this perfume for about a half hour now, and it seems to be almost completely gone.
It is an admirable piece, although it comes and goes much too quickly.",12/02/10 10:03,kayface

The two share many similarities but Indian Holi is definetely more kicking and bright. Sillage is nice and lasting power is good.
I blame the synthetic vanilla for headache or maybe the rice note, who know? I know that many of the latest Kenzo give me this problem.

It does get spicier the longer it is on but I prefer the exciting pink opening myself.

Unfortunately, this is a very weak potion & I don't really get a lot out of it. It also stimulates brain hurt (you know, when you smell something & there is that squeezing pain behind your eyes) so it is a no for me. Maybe Armour will work better for me.",06/23/10 16:56,Catbiscuit
Kenzo Amour Indian Holi Kenzo,"Love this - there's just something about it I can't stop sniffing. Definitely in the right category, a floral woody musk! I prefer it to the original Kenzo Amour. Reminds me a bit of Betsy Johnson, which has similar notes, but I like this one much better, it's much better balanced! The top notes listed don't pop out for me so much; I get peony, vanilla and musk the most. Sweet florals, very warm and creamy smelling, with a hint of spiciness and a bit of powder from the sandalwood. It's pretty linear, not much change on me over time. Snatch it up while you can!",06/15/10 09:00,Carnelian

I tried the most popular on Amour and smelled playdoh. But this one is a pleasant surprise. Its so...interesting. I smell the spices and the sandalwood right off the bat mix with the rice pudding. It does have power. And as it dries down I smell the cherry blossom stepping forward. Leaving just a pretty floral. Wow. didn't expect this. Sensual is the perfect word.

It really smells exotic to me, as standing in a fair, next to the flower and candy stands.

Its a weel balence fragrance, between floral and woody, with a touch of sweet.I don't get any musk or incense of it.

I love the Rice steam and Cherry blossom, wrapped in peony and pink peper.

On me it last all day long. I put some on the back of my neck and when i turned my head I got a fresh whaff of it. Really easy to wear, a kind of sweet freshness that uptlifted my spirit.

Air Kenzo,"This is a beautiful fragrance done in a very Japanese fashion. It is extremely subtle. It gives me a scent of freshness that's like wearing no scent at all, and I think that's the intent of the designer. Many Japanese designers attempt this feat.

I have good news for people who want to smell this but don't want to buy an entire bottle of a discontinued fragrance. I have a bottle of this and got a sample of Comme des Garcons Zero. To my nose and on my skin, they are identical. When my bottle of Kenzo Air runs out, I will buy Zero.

Maybe the bottle was too expensive to manufacture I don't know.
It's like a small sculpture.",10/29/22 02:17,Filosykos
Air Kenzo,"This is another of those hyped vintage scents I hunted for a long time. Scored a 50ml. It's soft, anise-forward with a backbone of just IsoE. Maybe it was interesting in 2003 but, considering it got discontinued pre-2010, I think, I doubt it sold well. IsoE-dominant scents are so common now that Air just felt like a poorly/simply constructed scent, to me. Anise + Vetiver + Cedar is essentially all this is. Very much like Encre Noir Sport + anise but even lighter than ENS.

Longevity is super poor, especially if you struggle with IsoE. I got 2-3 hours of noticeable smell, with less than 30 minutes of projection.

A 6.5/10. Nostalgia hype has led me to some great buys and some really bad ones. This falls into the bad category.",10/22/22 18:31,maxpowerboston

Air Kenzo,"It has a certain spicy but almost buttery sweetness to it. I don't know whether it's because of the anise and vetiver pairing or maybe some amber but it's nice enough. There's also some woods present but nothing harsh. But the anise in here is actually blended very well. It doesn't remind me of a licorice or fennel aroma at all. It's a fairly simple scent but for any anise lovers, even though long discontinued, perhaps an interesting composition. Performance is soft and quite frankly horrible. Fun to sample should you get a chance.

7/10",09/25/20 09:32,Djedi
Air Kenzo,"What Kenzo Air definitely possesses is this aforementioned ozonic quality to it. However, it is not a static fragrance that settles down once you apply it and then just reveals its layers continually. Rather, I like to say it has to be in that constant swirl with your movements. You need to be active to really smell this scent real potential.


Now, right after sharp yet quick angelica opening it almost instantly sets its soft velvety anise/caraway tone which is staying for long time present, accompanied by woody base and just a slight link of citrusy bergamot hints, those more so add a bravado of freshness to frail anise. Once anise weakens its presence, its character is transformed with licorice that protrudes to my nose mostly. Sweet licorice that resembles lacquered mahogany wood and well fits to minimalist urban chic aesthetics. Staying power is long enough, while projection is slightly ephemeral. One second it seems like you almost lost it and then in next moment it starts to gain its initial intensity back, though this time without any sign of angelica around.


Best to apply during the day whilst it gets warmer in its character as hours pass. Approximately after six-seven hours it is still well detectable. There is no definite end to Kenzo Air if you ask on sillage, for every time you do a sudden movement it reappears. And just how refined is that comeback - even sharper, more complex, embedded and locked in your skin pH!


Airy as proclaimed, spring breezy day or summer noon emitting subtle grey noise from swinging tree branches and birds flying high above is accurate to accessorize your being with Kenzo Air. Wind will bring this haziness right up to your nose. Gently.",07/16/20 06:53,murovian

Air Kenzo,"Another discontinued gem. Luckily, I was able to get a 50ml bottle at a good price.

I get anise, vetiver and some licorice and citrus. The scent is light and 'airy', as the name would suggest. Very refreshing, not overly sweet or cloying and excellent for warmer weather.

The scent is light and projection is minimal. I would say it is a skin scent after about 10-15 minutes however longevity is not bad.

Overall, a great discontinued scent which is perfect for summer.

Air Kenzo,"Finally! I was lucky enough to find and grab a bottle for a good price! Here are my two cents.

It is very sad to see nowadays boring releases from designer houses, stacking the shelves with ""sport"" versions and nonsense flankers, and then looking to all these great discontinued fragrances makes you want to go hunt them. This is one of those incredible fragrances.

The concept of ""Air"" here is different, it is not that fresh and transparent feel, but rather a soft spicy, ozonic vibe. When first sprayed (about the first 10 seconds) it is a blast of anise and licorice, after a while the licorice becomes almost invisible, and vetiver and cedar take place. Truly one of the best and most interesting fragrances I've smelled. For those who haven't had the opportunity of smelling it, the most literal description I can make IMHO (so that you can imagine it) is that it is a merge between Au Masculin, Encre Noire and cedar, with that ozonic vibe I can't really explain, but that's what my nose gets. Longevity is good but sits close to the skin, which is not a problem at all since the scent itself will be a marvelous journey for your nose.",08/17/18 17:27,Alive

Air Kenzo,"It my was everyday scent for years. Too bad it was discontinued. Really smells like a breath of fresh air, it is sooooooo refreshing....I gave it as a present to my dad, and tried on my skin, ever since it became my favorite along with Light Blue from Dolce and Gabbana, for everyday usage. Because it doesn't seem, to me, a male scent. It is the kind of perfume that makes you smell clean all day, and every time you smell a hint of it it feels like a breeze. Also, I would say it reminds me of something I could call an icy fragrance. Somewhat like Armani Code Ice, but way more subtle, not as woody, which is why I think it fits the unissex category. Its silage is soft, and it lasts for 4h on my skin. For women that like fragrances such as Thé Blanc from Bulgari, Light blue, it's a must have. Really, it is a pity that it was discontinued.",06/09/17 09:17,ballerina77

Kenzo Air is anise, vetiver, licorice bomb and absolutely smells like a Rakı for me.(there is to much anise in it)
Now you can think what kind of comparison is that scent and Alcoholic beverage ?
I have to remind you, there are to many of those kind of scent ;) and i think this one inspired from RAKI, if you did not try yet you have to drink as soon as possible ;)

About scent like i said harmony of anise-vetiver-licorice. Fresh, clean and aromatic perfect for summer. This guy is ONE LEVEL scent.
Sillage and longevity not good but ok.

Overall

Sillage 6/10
Longevity 6/10
Scent 10/10 for me :)",06/05/17 00:24,Toogle
Air Kenzo,"I sniffed this for the first time yesterday my uncle has this fragrance. Let me tell you that this anise/vetiver scent is very nice and very very unqiue. It's very unfortunate that this has been discontinued. The vetiver reminds me of the dirty vetiver in encre noir. I will not pay 100 dollars for this scent. But a local discounter has many of these in stock for 40 dollars. Will be picking up a couple of bottles and wear it through out this coming summer.

Scent: 8/10

Air Kenzo,"Beautiful fragrance, it could easily become a signature scent for me. Nice vetiver brightened with anise, then has a nice soft drydown.

Air Kenzo,"This has been my everyday fragrance when I was a student in the university. Apart from the happy memories this is an excellent fragrance composed by one of the greats, Maurice Roucel. Basically it is a friendly, peppery-fresh vetiver, heavy on Iso-E Super and with anise on top. Surely synthetic but unlike other modern niche fragrances that are equally synthetic and rely on marketing, this actually hides inspiration in its composition. In other words, you can happen to buy it simply because it smells good and not because of the fanfare surrounding it. In two words joyful and unpretentious. For a modern update check L'Homme De Coeur by Divine.",03/25/15 10:27,Little Prince

Air Kenzo,"I just got the 50ml in a set with the shower gel. Love it - much woodier than kenzo woody (the brown bottle). Like others have said, this starts off a little aniseed-y. About an hour or so later a very light version of encre noir comes through.

I've never even considered aniseed as as a fragrance ingredient i would be interested in, but this frag has been a subtle nose opener.",05/12/14 09:09,paulzork
Air Kenzo,"The last flask I bought was in 2011, in a website I can´t remember. It came to me from Israel. Before it arrives here in Brazil I already know it would be alterated in its scent, coz it was discontinuated long time ago. And was exactly that what happened. It had a terrible scent of tobaco/urine... what a pitty...
Please, let´s send Kenzo lots of mails asking them to return this masterpiece... I can´t find kenzo´s e-mail anywhere.. Somebody can help me?",04/17/14 05:08,leomat2008

Air Kenzo,"I've been looking for this fragrance and I decided to stop by at local fragrance hut store. And luckily, they happen to have the tester and I tested it. From initial spray, I smell strong alcohol, and as it dried down it started to smell like terre d'hermes. If the original kenzo air isn't supposed to smell like that, please let me know.",02/10/14 14:12,jaylim87
Air Kenzo,"Alafrom is right, if ever you have the chance to layer Etro anice with Encre noire the result is unmistakably ----------> kenzoAIR! So remarkably similar when layered but both are so very unlike kenzoAIR on their own.

I further agree that there is little or no difference in the original and intense variations. Intense has a slight blue tint to it where original is clear. Furthermore the intense versions box is identical to the original except it has a glaring sun on it. The intense versions bottle is not frosted but rather a clear plastic.

Lastly, so far to my experience I have yet to buy a bottle that comes filled with more than 50-60% juice. They all say 90ml but the reality is you are getting around 60ml. It's may be due to leakage or evap or just manufacturing limitations. But with such a special scent I suspect it's discontinuation had more to do with packaging than anything else!

**NOTE** never ship a bottle of kenzoAIR or its intense counterpart via airmail. There is a very very high likelyHood the bottle will burst under pressure and you will receive a cracked bottle or worse a leaky mess!

9/10. A staple of my collection!!!",09/16/13 01:32,walkdogg
Air Kenzo,Recently bought it ... So there are still stocks of the old production. Fragrance makes happy after a long search!,09/02/13 04:16,igorakhsanov
Air Kenzo,"This is a light and airy fragrance, maybe one of the best Kenzo's I've ever tried. It does bother me that it's gone after about 2 hours. It's projection also could've been better, but I suppose that would tear down the core concept of the fragrance; air.

Like Taskphorce said, you can easily detect the Iso E Super. Considering this fragrances perfume is 48% Iso E Super and Encre Noir's is 45% Iso E Super, it's also not really a shock they have similarities. I found them close enough at times to vote for a reminder of the other fragrance, but only in their drydown.

/edit: When smelling them side by side they seem more different than I had thought them to be. It's strange, because the first few times when I smelled Encre Noir it made me think of Air, but it had been nearly 8 years since I had smelled that. And when I recently put on Air again for the first time in those 8 years, it made me think of a lighter Encre Noir.

Air has the added licorice and anise notes, which really complement each other and together with Iso E Super they form a great team. I guess they have the Iso E Super and vetiver in common, but that is pretty much it. Comparing them side by side after about 30 minutes, they share similarities but Air is a lot lighter than Encre Noir. I guess it's the Iso E Super that keeps popping up every once in a while.

So in conclusion. Are they the same? No. Do they have similarities? Yes. In the end, I think Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver would be closer related to Encre Noir than Kenzo Air is. Grey Vetiver could be it's younger and lighter summertime brother, while Air is more of a nephew.",08/20/13 05:49,Deefit

Air Kenzo,"I really love this one on my boyfriend, it smells warm, confident and sexy ! for me, it's one of the best masculine fragrances out there.",04/26/13 14:11,gelsomina
Air Kenzo,"After many reviews, of good and bad this fragrance is, also on the bottle design, some love it, some hate it... I bought one anyway.

The fragrance opens with soft anise-caraway accord tamed by the woody notes, and it lingers in such a nice way. You may think this might smell spicy due to the aromatics used, but it is not!

I do find this fragrance has a moderate lasting power, with a good silage. I wonder if this has been discontinued, because I couldn't find this at any fragrance store let alone the Kenzo perfume counter.",01/28/13 19:03,HORRIDFRAG
Air Kenzo,"Oh, no this is gone? I really liked this one! Vetiver can be soooo overpowering, but this was a light, airy version, with hints of smoke and only the faintest traces of anise or bergamot. Just a gorgeous almost incense-wafting-in-fresh-air fragrance. Maurice Roucel does it again!",10/01/12 16:43,tessture
Air Kenzo,"I know it's quite late in the day, given that this is no longer produced but this was and probably remains my favourite scent to date and the one that made me interested, properly, in scent in the first place.

Air Kenzo,"Kenzo Air, its simplicity is its strength; irresistible aromatic freshness with a hint of liquorice in the background, is the scent that makes you rediscover nature that you thought you had lost, the horizon that brings you free and clear to follow a kite in the sky ... it's the air of freedom and the great outdoors ... this time Kenzo has hit the mark.
To be missed.",07/07/11 14:34,oxm
Air Kenzo,"This is a strong scent in my opinion, with a nice vetiver drydown. Even though it's versatile enough to be used in any season, Kenzoair makes a welcome change for me from the usual aquatics in summer.

@ravjan: The blue colour inside the bottle is not that of the juice, but instead a (sneaky) blue plastic insert - I took my bottle apart (don't ask me why) - and the juice is simply a typically common yellowish colour.",06/27/11 23:02,iconoclast
Air Kenzo,"Actually this is not airing or uplifting like it looks!
Like any other fragrance from Kenzo, this has some signature note from the house (this is why I love Kenzo), something like pepper or incense.
I like it, but not so sure about a purchase in future.

P.S: The bottle is a masterpiece",05/20/11 02:35,Lance
Air Kenzo,"An underrated gem.

It happened by accident that I layered two fragrances. I was testing Encre Noir to write my final review and instead of spraying it on an unscented smelling strip, I sprayed it on a piece of paper on which I previously tested Etro's Anice.
What a suprise to smell the anisic aspect of vetiver amphasized by the real anise note. Especially in the drydown when the two perfumes blended perfectly together.

Well, I found Kenzo Air Intense / Kenzo Air to have a very similar vibe to the above scenario and despites probably not being as praised as Encre Noir, it still has a great charme. Peppery, anisic, funny. Chemical? Yes, most definitely, but very well blended. Does great in warm weather.

If you're wondering about the differencies between the ""intense"" version and the original, well, I haven't found a substantial one. The ""intense"" is exactly like the original version but a little bit stronger, that's it.

Air Kenzo,It's feminine enough for me and I enjoy wearing it every once in a while when the weather gets warm. It is indeed light and airy and what I can smell the most are the citrus notes. What I could do without is the caraway note - I don't like it in food and it turns out that it's just as unsavory in perfume.,03/28/11 11:43,ngreeny

Air Kenzo,"Yay! My 3rd Kenzo is finally here. Kenzo Air is not a very strong scent. I spritz it twice on my wrist and I have a hard time smelling it, perhaps my skin is too dry.
For the scent, there is nothing fruity or floral here at all, but just woods. I only smell this wet woody vetiver with fresh cedar + licorice combo. The scent is wet and cold; like a wet forest or driftwood by the river bank or even a haystack. Somehow, I still find it fresh and quite unique. It's never too hard nor even appear to be herbal.
In my opinion, this is not a very usual fragrance, and it's a must try, especially for those who are interested in an interesting woody scent, and the blocky bottle is quite a collectible item.",08/20/10 09:18,nattonline

KenzoKi Rice Steam (Sensual) Kenzo,"I bought this from Kenzo website, when it was released. It was purchased based on the notes. For reference, fragrances on my skin usually wears true to notes described. To my disappointment, the soft lactonic note last about five minutes on my skin., then transitions to a unisex skin scent. I gave it a couple more chances during different seasons, same result. When I decide to downsize my collection, it would go. I think it could be quite nice on a man.",12/24/21 15:03,Ensconce-in-Bloom
KenzoKi Rice Steam (Sensual) Kenzo,"I have the newer bottle of this. I believe both versions are discontinued (in the US, anyway), and I’m not sure if the bottle change also meant a reformulation. Either way, I do really like this scent. It was a blind buy years ago, and I almost swapped it away. It’s very simple. It’s a lactonic rice note with perhaps the most subtle floral in the background. However, it did grow on me and I’m glad to have it. It’s very calming and smells a bit like skin, with does give it just a hint of “sensual” vibes - but it’s incredibly subdued. Imagine you put on a fragranced lotion before bed. This is your skin when you wake up. Very beautifully done.",06/04/21 00:30,kateapple
KenzoKi Rice Steam (Sensual) Kenzo,"Mixed bag here. If you are looking for a rice ""soliflore"" after falling in love with the note? This is not your holy grail (edit: Poesie Soft - you're welcome). That is a woefully incomplete notes list (or lack therof) and you will be dissapointed. (as I was with my most expensive blind buy ever) BUT, it is quite lovely, it is soft, very light florals (possibly lotus and just a touch of orange blossom?), a bit lotion-creamy, the rice is definitely there and very nice. Would make a wonderful daily scent for someone in a health care field or other profession that requires a very discrete and comforting scent only.

Coeur Azuki Kenzo,"Taking into account how powdery and creamy the Memoir collection is, and the listed rice note, I feel this perfume is sharper than expected.
Don't get me wrong, this perfume is quite nice. But the I was expecting something with that unique powder note that brings rice and I got almost only black currant, with that sharp and almost citrusy scent. It is pretty, tho. It is sweet but have some savory vibe that makes it not vanilla or tonka sweet, but as most gourmands, but a more realistic sweet.

I think it has slightly better performance. It's still not an amazing performer.

Like the original, Hyper Wave evokes a relaxing day by the pool more than the raw, untamed sea.

Fresh, likeable, youthful, breezy... simple and inconsequential in the best sense of the word, like a summer breeze.

Great for sweltering summer days.",06/18/22 05:41,kingderella
L'Eau Kenzo Pour Homme Hyper Wave Kenzo,"I think the current rating is too low - 3.74 ... Personally I would give it 4.5 rating.

It's fresher smoother, more white floral/watery version of Versace pour homme.
It's like 70% similiar to Versace pour homme but this is summer only whereas I find Versace more versatile.

It smells very simple and quite generic yes, but it's also very very nice.",05/13/22 03:32,Monke go brr
L'Eau Kenzo Pour Homme Hyper Wave Kenzo,"So simple but good! Opens with a burst of seawater and mandarin. Just showers you in it, almost feels like being hit by a... Hyper Wave? Then that aromatic segment of mandarin mixes with the moss to create a juicy almost candy like mandarin smell. To me it almost smells gourmandy, like a mandarin orange just waiting to be bitten into but it does this almost completely without sweetness.",04/10/22 08:32,GMOPotato
L'Eau Kenzo Pour Homme Hyper Wave Kenzo,"I treated myself to this recently. I am a huge sucker for the Kenzo house and aquatics in general. My first thought is it's...very nice! The last flanker I bought was L'eau Par Kenzo Colours which I found a little bland and dated. This is much fresher, modern, and vibrant. The scent is not loud at all and stays close to the skin but it is at least still there after 5-6 hours. Overall an improvement on the previous flankers. Fresh, invigorating, and breezy. Don't expect beast mode and if you can find it for a good price you could do a lot worse for a summer freshie. I have tried Hyper Wave Pour Femme in store and that is much 'juicer' and has a more interesting note combo. Update on the Pour Homme version: The performance is actually better than I first thought, with pleasant green sillage hitting my nose even after a few hours. A really pleasant green aquatic which I do not regret buying.",07/18/21 16:48,CoffeeAddict1
L'Eau Kenzo Pour Homme Hyper Wave Kenzo,"It's better than the original, mostly because it's more simple. There is this sweet and fresh opening that reminds on paper like shower gel, but on skin more like a youthful smell. It's unisex, not that it's feminine or masculine, but because it's so inoffensive and easy to like.

Currently totally digging it.",03/09/21 01:54,arielX
L'Eau Kenzo Pour Homme Hyper Wave Kenzo,"This is a citrussy take on the original Kenzo L'eau. The review below me is spot on, starts with strong citrus and dries down to a slight mossy scent. I don't think the performance is as strong as the original L'eau, which radiated for hours in the summer. This is fine for a light citrus aquatic, as it's not that complex.",12/06/20 20:09,Eau De Treasure
L'Eau Kenzo Pour Homme Hyper Wave Kenzo,It starts with the slightly oceanic tangerine note. For the first minutes it is the light aqua aroma but then it turns to the complex connection between sea notes and moss. I do not like this transition. But 30 minutes later it stops being intense and becomes mild fragrance. I advise to use this aroma men 18-34 years old.,11/26/20 06:50,ValdiMiroMercury

Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Smells like a spring day, dipping your head in a bouquet of flowers. Or going out into nature in full bloom. Never knew violets could smell so heavenly!

Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Flower Lumiere is my best from the Flower's collection. It's a violet and musk bomb with a very strong projection.

The scent is ideal for cool spring days",03/03/24 08:59,Fragrant Lily
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Although Kenzo Lumiere is EDT , it has a beast projection and it lasts a whole day on me. For me it is quite similar to LˇAbsolue, however, Lumiere is fruity and flowery. I could not depict these notes in L´Absolue. Lumiere has also got musk, but it is softer than in l´absolue and it is mixed with flowers and fruit notes.
I loved them both and I could not decide, which is better. They are both much the same and yet much different.",02/29/24 05:05,loves2read
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"this opens with a very strong violet with musk. it smells like violet candies. i think the currant is adding a hint of greenness here as well. it's a springtime floral. heliotrope comes in about 5 minutes in, softening things up a bit and adding a bit of a powdery element (but nowhere near as powdery as i remember the original to be.) the violet remains quite strong on me...while i like it, i wish the violet was more toned down as i think my skin is really amping it up.",11/06/23 22:29,mirrorghost
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"A jasmine bomb! Very strong, beast mode, headache inducing jasmine. All that from only just ONE spray.

However when I hit 2 months with this perfume, it started to grow very nausea and headache-inducing on me.

I now dread wearing this perfume and passed it onto my mom.",11/20/22 23:26,banillavean
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Guys, I might even be going crazy, but on my skin the Eau de Lumière version here was crazy bomb, and I liked being able to discover another greatness of this Flower's Collection that carry a DNA of powder from madam about to retire! The bottles, at least for me, are a Katana in their entirety! [laughs]...

I like the citrus and greenish mix that it reveals right when sprayed, it looks like the sun has arrived and with its rays it brings that unexpected feeling of heat, but it's not scary for having a lemonade and a lot of tropical, citrus fruits in the mix.

In the heart, Jasmine's dirty footprint is very evident, but this note is oily, aromatic and evident for good, due to Ylang Ylang; here the fruitiness does not refer to fresh peach, but dissected peach, placed in the sun and bright as the name of the fragrance suggests. I remember the Flower by Kenzo matrix here, the crazy but measured talc, fine powder, classy, eminently decided.

In the ""goodbye"" of it, I feel a balsamic touch, which involves a characteristic sweetness of Vanilla bean, but that doesn't bother, all added to the sharp characteristic that Violet and its leaves are able to transmit. Musk to sensualize and seal the illuminated proposal of Eau de Lumière, by Kenzo!",10/08/22 15:23,Jernê Knowles
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"fresh and clean. i can describe this one as jasmine-peach with a powdery violet base.

I think because of the peach and violets, i feel this is leaning sweetish. this is not like the original Flower at all, even though it does share the powder base.

On me, it blooms more when sprayed on skin vs on clothes. The sweetness-acidic nature of peaches is slightly more prominent too on skin.",07/04/22 23:52,Tee
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Very powdery. The flowery scent only last a couple minutes than it was just powdery. Not a bad powdery smell, still kinda nice but it is just too powdery for my taste. It last forever because of that though, sometimes I can still smell it even though I already took a bath. The only occasion I think is suitable for this perfume is a cold sunny day in spring. Other than that, I feel like this perfume would be too overwhelming.",12/12/21 16:40,rerecca
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Review is for my own reference - I actually like this floral! I think this would make a really nice relaxing bubble bath for a daytime bath. It smells like grammy's bath cube salts but in a nice way. I wouldn't buy this, but I might keep if gifted. But again I'd use it as a bubble bath. Smells like a clean, fancy, yet humble older woman :) Deifinelty a daytime scent. It seems like the silage might be an arms-length or bigger. and so far it seems like it would last long. A pleasant floral, I keep smelling my wrist :) The powdery note is noticeable, kind of reminds me of scented carpet soda or a foot powder, but in a nice way.

Edit: as this dries down I am liking it more, it's becoming sweeter. It reminds me of how Sears used to smell. Def keeping my sample of this!
It doesn't last as long as I would like it to :(
Flower and Flower Eau de Lumière Kenzo do NOT smell similar!",07/28/21 12:49,natasha28
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Beautiful. To me it’s like they found and bottled one single beautiful smell rather than multiple scents, chemicals, and ingredients. Like this smell in its complete form was gifted to the brand from on high. It’s very well blended and I have no desire to prise from it the individual notes. I had no idea what was listed when I first smelled this but I immediately got the impression of mimosa. I could hazard a guess that it’s the ylang ylang and heliotrope, but I won’t. In my mind, I’m in mimosa heaven and there I will stay.",06/12/21 19:01,SalinasL

I made the decision based on the first 15 mins on my skin, should've waited longer! When I got home, original Flower smelled better than Eau de Lumière. When I sprayed Eau de Lumière the smell was great at first, such a bright flower explosion! But dry down was simply musky soap/laundry. It's not bad, just not the kind of summer scent I was looking for.",07/25/20 13:26,ms_koo
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"I must say that I had been imagining the notes for a long time before this perfume came into my hands. And I was not disappointed. It has a very sparkling floral and fruity output.
I am not a fan of the aroma of peach or peach but in this case it does not bother, since it is balanced with notes of violet, rose and jasmine. In summary, it is a citrus-floral start perfume with hints of peach and violets that give it that powdery powdery soft background. Very feminine and used more spring, I am using it in winter on cold days and it is quite nice too. Of moderate wake and duration over 5 hours on my skin.",07/23/20 20:28,Mont_Blue

Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"This one is a very unique...well...there is original Kenzo flowed DNA in it, but not a lot and you can detect Kenzo flower but little hints of it.

Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"So, I'm originally a big fan of Kenzo Flower EDP. I'd gotten low on the bottle I had, hadn't sprayed it in months, so I gave it to my cousin who had been begging for it for forever. Thought I'd try a different variation, and this is very pretty. Problem for me is, it's too floral. I like a bit more warm / powdery scent. Once it dried down for nearly 24hrs on my business card, I like it, but I don't want to wait forever to like a scent on my skin. I have a full 1.7 oz bottle up for trade if anyone's interested, I'll stick with my regular Flower.",12/11/19 19:05,MsLittlejohn

Sweet, gentle floral, almost delicious smell, puffing dreamily from my arm, anytime I moved or there was a breeze around me. I am only dissapointed that I got a 50ml instead of 100ml, will probably buy another one soon to make up for this lol. I just can't get enough of it, the Drydown has me taking deeper more frequent breaths through my nose just to try to inhale the intoxicating aroma coming from my own skin. I have been searching for something soft but that projects around me, and I daresay this does. I can smell it when my arm isn't near my face, and it lasts for hours. It has become a skin scent now but this is like, over 6 hours since I sprayed it on. Happy I got it,:)",05/04/19 05:00,Twilight_princess
Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"To me, Flower smells like violets on a rainy Summer day, and Flower Eau de Lumière is violets on a sunny day. Because past the first 30 minutes dominated by bergamot and quite close to J'Adore EdT, Eau de Lumière turns almost exactly like original Flower on my skin. A bit more citrus, and quite a bit more musky, but a couple of hours after spraying, I can barely tell the difference. Its longevity is clearly superior to the original though. It stays all day long. I also like the stronger musky notes, but I'm a fan of musky floral fragrances.

Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"Kenzo eau de lumiere sneakingly creeped it's way into my fragrance collection when I stumbled across it during the holidays. This perfume has quickly reached my top 5. Blooming with radiance, this perfume is perfect for spring and summer. I personally use fragrances all year around. However, if I really like a fragrance I just limit or increase the amount of perfume spritzed according to season. Flower eau de lumiere illuminates with sensuality and elegance. With notes of jasmine, bergamot, peach, white musk, and Bulgarian rose, this fragrance is ultra feminine and sure to grab you lots of compliments. If you enjoy the original flower fragrance, imagine it but with a touch of light liquid gold that illuminates and has you shining. I like kenzo, but I LOVE eau de lumiere. You can tell the two belong to the same family group, but they smell completely different.

Flower by Kenzo Eau de Lumière Kenzo,"This perfume smells nothing like the legendary Kenzo Flower created in 2000 by Morillas and I'm really grateful about it. Truth is, the classic Flower has never been my ''type'' of perfume, my cup of tea and I've tested it several times, but no, it never trigged my love for it. I love florals but Flower was just too much - too much sweet and powdery to the point I started to dislike it even on other people. Everytime I smelt it on other women I got sick and nauseated also helped by the fact that the perfume has a very considerable sillage (smelling it on the bus it made me search for some fresh air and made my stomach turn). That's the reason why I banned Flower and all its infinite flankers from ever smelling them .

When I SA this year made me test Eau Lumière as a new release I was kind of allarmed because I thought it would be another very similar scent to Flower. But when I smelt the paper strip all of my fears dissipated and I was smelling one of the most lovely perfumes. It has got nothing to do with the original Flower thank God and it was love at first smell for me. Eau Lumière is sweet but not overly sweet, it's a very beautiful blend between flower notes, white musk and fruit notes. The name is so adequate in my opinion- the fragrance is really luminous, joyful, young, full of spirit, shining. It may not be a perfume masterpiece or an extraordinary one woth to be remembered in the Hall of fame of perfumes but it's nonetheless an uplifting and joyous fragrance for everyday use, not complicated or sophisticated that can be worn in everytime of year. It's a perfume that you wear for your own happiness, without making a statement but just to make you feel good.",11/09/17 03:15,lulami

I prefer the opening to the dry down, it gets bland after about an hour. Overall it's good and has that distinct kenzo signature that I've come to love and expect.

Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"Back in the day, somewhere in the mid-80s, I (along with a lot of girls my age) had Kenzo Kenzo. It was the era of Lou Lou and Anaïs Anaïs, and Kenzo Kenzo (in a beautiful light green, traditional Japanese box) was somewhere between those two iconic scents. Not as heavy and strong as Lou Lou, but not as soft and flowery as Anaïs Anaïs. A unique and aromatic, slightly bitter scent with a lot of ingredients, which could give you a bad headache if you weren't feeling well.

After Kenzo Kenzo, the house released Ça Sent Beau, inspired by its predecessor, but less heavy and complex. I was able to get my hands on a bottle of Ça Sent Beau via Vinted as part of my nostalgia. The scent is still sold - mainly online - but no longer in stores. Just for the beautiful bottle alone, something you want to have, and since I am a real fan of Kenzo fragrances, I was super happy with this acquisition. I had not smelled my ‘old’ Kenzo Kenzo for years, so I was super curious how I would experience the scent again.

My first reaction was WOW. They don’t make fragrances like that anymore! Whether that is good or bad, of course depends on taste. After the first fresh notes of mandarin and bergamot disappear into the background, I immediately recognize the soft, aromatic bitterness! The prominent patchouli from the top notes flows beautifully together with the bouquet of white flowers in the middle notes: jasmine, gardenia, tuberose and orange blossom. In the further drydown, the ylang ylang comes in, together with the coriander and the peach - which makes the whole thing a bit softer and more powdery and blends beautifully with the amber, vanilla and vetiver in the base. A beautiful composition, fortunately not as intoxicating as its predecessor, which is certainly still recognizable - albeit in a smooth 'less is more' version.

For an eau de toilette, Ça Sent Beau has a nice longevity and a lot of sillage. Glad I was able to get my hands on a bottle! Let's see if I can find a bottle of Eau d'Eté somewhere!",04/19/25 01:48,Ilsevdw

Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"I’m slightly annoyed by people in reviews saying this is reformulation of Kenzo by Kenzo, it’s not, it’s completely different perfume. I remember this one from 90s. If I remember it right there was Kenzo by Kenzo in pale minty green box, Ca Sent Beau in bright green box and Le Monde Est Beau in bright yellow box. All had the same beautiful glass bottle. Seems like Kenzo was discontinued, and Ca Sent Beau and Le Monde reformulated to new standards, sometimes I see them in differing boxes now. Kenzo was similar to elephant, slightly oriental, Le Monde beautiful spicy realistic mandarins with fresh soapy dry down. If I remember it right CaSent Beau was somewhere in the middle of those two/ mix of those two. UPDATE: I actually bought it from FragranceNet (white box with flower-reformulated), I knew I’m not going to love it but I sort of like all vintage and Kenzo frags, so out of nostalgia. Oh well😣, I’m in shock. This is not how Kenzo smells like (young and hip), it’s more like old discontinued Chanel scent, I mean Chanel no.5 could be cousin. It’s sort of authoritarian, classy, old smell, first who came to my mind was Queen Elizabeth, lately my husband wanted to smell it but I refused it to put it on my skin so he sprayed his hand and I realized it’s sort of unisex, even Soros or some other senile, old, rich guy could smell like this. I don’t understand notes in here, I love all mentioned above. I guess it’s too rich on patchouli, too woody, old soapy dry down. Its not that it smells bad, it’s just too mature and serious fragrance, doesn’t vibe with my artistic free casual spirit. I sold it on eBay immediately , so no harm.",03/18/23 17:55,Jordan 99
Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"Ca fragrance Beau is a sweet, sparkling, soapy, and floral fragrance with an airy, silky, and spicy undertone. Tuberose, Coriander, Patchouli, Peach, Amber, and Vanilla are the notes I detect on my skin. Timeless and stunning. I think best in the spring and fall. It is a very beautiful and spiritual aroma that offers me serenity and tranquility. To add to its allure, the staying power is amazing, and the silage is exceptional.

This is patchuli...Kenzo Jungle Elephant vibe. Maybe I mixed it up with Kenzo Le Mond est beau....I really don´t know where is mistake. Or I have bad skin chemistry when I am stressed. I really don´t know.
So I layer it with Elephant and it´s quite ok.

Some days, I feel like I have to find a very soft/darkish caramelly kind of scent to put under it, since that is what is missing, and some days it is just ok by itself.

Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"Aquarius_moon, I love your review. Since you have just started wearing Ca sent beau for the first time, you are probably smelling a reformulation, which does have the smell of, as you described, a air-freshener version. The same thing happened to Kenzo's beautiful Parfum d'ete. It is now just a watered down shell of it's former glory. The original Ca sent beau was much closer to Kenzo by Kenzo and you could notice it in the drydown. I'm sure it's all because of the oakmoss changes that occurred, but you're right, it is still awesome and I love to pull it out to wear this time of year. Men don't be afraid, Luca Turin recommended it as a fruity, barbershop fougere for men!",05/12/17 07:49,Tlund
Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"Ca Sent Beau was a replacement for the discontinued Kenzo by Kenzo, and because I didn’t want Kenzo replaced, I avoided it till now. But finally the level in my last bottle of Kenzo grew low, Ca Sent Beau itself became hard to find, and I panicked and got a bottle. So how does it compare? Well, to a nose accustomed to the first Kenzo, Ca Sent Beau smells a bit like the air-freshener version. Like a rough sketch, recognizable but simplistic, as though a gifted cartoonist dashed off a caricature of a famous painting.

That said, the ‘caricature’ itself is pretty amazing, and there are plenty of reasons to be delighted it’s still around. For one, if you’ve heard much about the first Kenzo and want to know how it smells, you needn’t pay an extortionist price for a vintage bottle. Get Ca Sent Beau, and you’ll get a perfectly accurate idea, even if it will be deprived of the full depth and nuance. Likewise, if you loved the first perfume, you’ll certainly notice the differences, but considering that there’s nothing else that smells remotely alike, such a close relative is a treasure.

And if you’re a casual buyer? Well, if the notes sound good to you, and if you’d like a highly original, impeccably crafted, easy to wear perfume for casual occasions, give it a try without worries that it might be dated. Unless you’re thoroughly committed to the esthetics of Iso E transparency, Ca Sent Beau is unlikely to strike you as ‘old.’ It’s more full-bodied than diaphanous, but it’s not dense, opaque, powdery, perfumey, aldehydic, flamboyantly baroque, or any of the other features usually thought of as old. In fact, despite its wonderfully unique refusal to conform to a category—one wants to call it a green-fruity-oriental-chypre and more—a quick and dirty classification would probably land it close to a modern fruitchouli. Take something like the current Miss Dior, make a couple of mental upgrades, and you’ll come close.

Instead of Miss Dior’s fermented citruses, the fruity top note in Ca Sent Beau is sweet, succulent, and delicious. At times, it comes across as neither mandarin nor bergamot but a juicy, fresh pineapple. In the middle, where Miss Dior goes almost tooth-paste mentholated, Ca Sent Beau has much more going on. Its patchouli is camphoraceous and seasoned with a savory coriander-cumin note; it's possibly the fragrance's most distinctive pleasure. The fruity note morphs, just as it says on the tin, into peach laced with ylang; and non-screechy white flowers appear, most notably, a tuberose, so lovely it will haunt you even if you’ve known more famous tuberose scents.

The drydown is where Ca Sent Beau suffers the most from the comparison with the first Kenzo. Rich in sandalwood and oakmoss, the first perfume possessed a whole additional emotional register, suited even to the dressiest occasions. But by today’s standards, when so many drydowns go for naked musk/naked vanilla/simple cessation, Ca Sent Beau does more than enough to keep one's interest and, once again, leaves the likes of Miss Dior in the dust.

On the whole, it’s a youthful but not juvenile scent, playful and intelligent, well-mannered yet distinctive, and after searching for something similar for ages, I can confidently say it doesn’t exist. (Eden, which I had long ago, bears no real resemblance.)",05/12/17 07:28,aquarius_moon
Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"I am wearing this for the first time today and, 4-5 hours from spraying, it does remind me of Eden from Cacharel. A much nicer, friendlier and quieter Eden. This perfume does smell beautiful, the name is very becoming. It wraps you in a warm, delicate and peaceful cloud of beautiful flowers. There's nothing ""loud"" in this scent on my skin, no animalic note, no aggressive patchouli, just beautiful white flowers and slight fruity note. The crisp in the opening fades away and it becomes a harmonious ensemble. I'm glad I bought this, after reading about it here, and I will probably buy again. Longevity is great on me; office friendly and, in my opinion, a perfect spring scent. Definitely recommended!",04/19/17 03:24,colibri_classique

Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"THAT SMELLS BEAUTIFUL CA SENT BEAU

This fragrance captivated my nose because it's the green notes and the patchouli that you pick up on almost immediately. The citric scents of bergamot and orange are there but they're clearly playing second fiddle to the patchouli. This patchouli is green and rather like incense but not too smoky. There's also spicy notes, coriander and vetiver which although at the base my nose could immediately detect. So this is a green spicy floral scent with the flowers serving as background chorus girls to the patchouli singing his song. The flowers, however, are the dramatic white flowers that are to be taken as seriously as the patchouli: gardenia, jasmine, tuberose and African orange flower. This really does smell beautiful but if it had been either sweeter or stronger, it would have smelled bad. On me this smells perfectly balanced. It evokes a green garden with white flowers and green plants. There's a slight resemblance to Eden by Cacharel. Vanilla and amber is there to help the fragrance smell just as it's name indicates good. Sweet, but not too sweet not too gourmand either. Really nice. Fragrances like this are getting harder to find. I love to wear this in spring and summer and recommend it. It's available on such sites as Fragrance Net Fragrance X Beauty Spin and Amazon.com. If you like Kenzo fragrances and floral fragrances you'll love this one. But also keep in mind that the patchouli is also a big player so you have to be into patchouli. O la la!

It has changed a bit since I remember it. I don't consider this to be fruity any more; I don't get any at all. Innocent? No! It's an intense steamy floriental that needs to be approached with care!

Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"I do feel sorry that I am going to bring this one a few points down, but the point of reviewing on MUA is to tell ""truth and nothing but the truth"", and my truth about this scent is that it failed to work with my nose and my chemistry, and I am saying that after having used up 2 bottles: that's how much I wanted to like it! I absolutely love the bottle, and I was looking for such a long time for a crispy white/yellow/green summer scent that would make me feel like a nymph in an afternoon forest. Perhaps it all has to do with expectations set too high. I bought both bottles unsniffed because I had never ever disliked a Kenzo scent before - all of them appealed to me in different ways somehow. But the 1st sniff I took had me breaking into sweat: oh no, this has gone BAD! Or is it a fake?!! Or is it so old that I. living in a new century, simply don't get it? It was like a cologne-soaked elderly woman's undies! So chemical and so artificially pungent!! I, wanting to get my money#s worth out of it anyway, still wore it for month, starting each day with the thought:"" Ok, maybe I will like it now"" and being let down again and again. Since I was staying in the countryside that summer I didn't really care how I smelled, and wanted to wear basically anything that was more than just skinscent. Alas, I did end up with my own scent, because this perfume evaporated after half an hour and never, not once, did it leave a trail of ever being sprayed! The 2nd bottle I have used up as an air freshener: the angry acid did seem to eat up any bad smell around, so still grateful for that.

Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"There are situations, you want to smell bombastic good, fresh, but somehow serious and chic and not sexy a lot. For example going for an interview for a job or just do it your work properly and fast.

Here is the perfect fragrance for it and I am so glad about it. I tested it about month and today stocked up with 2 bottles more, because it is just so delicious serious. It does not make sense to describe the smell, because I have no idea, what it is, but if you have good eyes and can read the lousy small ingredients list, you may see: Oakmoss extract and tree moss extract.

I think, this is one of the small amount of fragrances dealing with naturally raw stuff. Even if applied this loud and intensive perfume with heavy hand over and over you, I do not get headache, which is very practical, if you have to work hard.

Sillage about one-two hours, longevity 7-8 hours (EdT!!) When the perfume is dying, it smells a bit like Dune from Dior.",07/11/12 13:25,Fizzy
Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"Intriguing essence in a Japanese style without a 1989 feeling. Liked it at first sniff, maybe due to my favourite orange blossom, but separate notes here are “out of the coverage”, as well as its fragrant group: don’t count on something fruity floral. A stylishly intellectual abstract composition with mentally seductive personality. Like Eau Indigo's mother is playing chess, Oops!.. - Sudoku. I imagine that for casual style it could be a bit serious, also is not the one to veg out with, but for the right time and place it could be a hit. Rather unique successful blend on the modern market. Yes, Yamamoto tried to follow this path with Yohji Yamamoto pour Femme (2004) - similar coriander edge, in YY it seems rough and unfriendly - but Ca Sent Beau is more smoothly balanced and much more interesting as if meant for women who get better with age. :)

Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"This is technically a fruity-floral. It is a plummy orange/tangerine draped with tuberose and orange blossom. But I suppose this is a floriental. I mean it’s white flowers resting on a comfortable amber. And I reckon it’s a fougère since it seems to have a dark, nutty coumarin base. Chypre? Yeah, there’s bergamot and oakmoss.

I’m not even joking. What the hell is this? Fruit? No question. Perhaps orange, more likely tangerine. It’s definitely floral. A bit of steamy orange blossom and a bucket of green, creamy tuberose. Amber for days (literally) spiked with patchouli. And the darkness---coumarin? oakmoss? Mix it up with a good measure of musk and you wind up with a languid slurry of a perfume. In tone, Ça Sent Beau is like a grand queen about 2 martinis into holding court with a gathering audience. A little tipsy, talking fast, one opinion to the next. An increasing flourish and emphasis that don’t quite cover up the slurred speech. Mesmerizing.

And while this is a cousin to Prescriptives Calyx---tasty fruity chypre--- Ça Sent Beau replaces the straight-forward oakmoss base with a narcotic cough syrup base made of what seems like oakmoss and coumarin.

CSB’s components are not so much potent as heavy, but the balance is perfect. Rather than calibrate the heavy with lighter elements, the cough syrup base adds some shadow to the density and makes it feel sultry.

I can think of four definitively syrupy perfumes that I like. Serge Lutens’s Cedre (mothball syrup.) Lutens's Arabie (spice cabinet syrup.) Badgley Mischka’s Badgley Mischka (simple syrup.) And Ça Sent Beau. I think cough syrup is my favorite.",09/29/11 23:51,jtd
Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"At last I got a chance to test Ca Sent Beau (thanks Tankgirl!). What a delicious fragrance! It opens up juicy and slightly peppery with mandarin orange and orange flower with a hint of tubrose whispering in the background. Somehow it reminds me of ginger in this stage.

After a while it becomes more floral, and warmer and sweeter from amber and just a tiny touch of patchouli. The fragrance has a mote of saltiness that I find very appealng. I don't find it animalistic as some do, but it's not a crowdpleaser either. It's a complex fragrace that I would like to wear a warm summer day. Sillage and longevity medium.",09/21/11 10:48,mymlan

At this stage, I could confuse it with a body odour.",04/02/10 13:29,selinum28
Ça Sent Beau Kenzo,"The notes listed in the scent pyramid seem to me to be incomplete and arranged oddly. Elsewhere I found the following list of notes, which conform better to my impression of the scent:

Top: coriander, mandarin, tangerine
Heart: orange blossom, tuberose
Base: patchouli, amber, vetiver

I experience some uplifting citrus in the opening, followed by crisp herbs. Later, Ca Sent Beau (""That Smells Beautiful,"" in French) leans just a tad toward the masculine with orange blossom and vetiver, and the tuberose is very quiet. It stays cool and refreshing for about four hours on my skin, and never develops a deep warm base that one might expect with the patchouli and amber. They're there, but faintly, and the drydown is mostly vetiver.

Not as feminine as I usually prefer, but doesn't make me feel uncomfortably androgynous. A lovely, pleasant smell indeed. Incidentally, I would not classify this one as a floral fruity, as it seems primarily a vetiver fragrance in my opinion. I'd call it aromatic instead.",05/19/09 13:08,Mals86

Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"very beautiful light & airy perfume..........very elegant & peaceful..........im not sure what buckwheat tea smells like lol but the tuberose & cherry blossom are the highlight & it continues throughout or at least on me it does.........and i love sandlewood & vetiver in dry downs so thats a plus for me & for the perfume lol...............dries down smooth & soft...........

perfect for day or night & any season but i would lean towards fall & winter - but light enough to wear spring or summer ( im wearing it tonite & its warm & humid & smells lovely )

i just love the flower line.........and this does not disappoint :) and i love the bottles !!!

and longevity moderate & silage closer to skin - its not a beast perfume - its classicly elegant",07/19/25 22:12,violetstorm

Sadly on skin that beautiful floral/tea opening doesn't last and becomes more generic as it settles for a few hours. I still recommend it, I would definitely spray it on maybe an article of clothing instead. Still it is quite beautiful and very unique, I would recommend as a blind buy if it's on sale. 8/10.

Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"I received this is as a sample from Sephora despite being a man, I received women's samples of Kenzo Poppy Bouquet and the Ikebana. Ikebana is lovely from spray to dry down. It strikes a nice balance between sweet and woody. The floral heart is beautiful and gives the perfume a lovely sillage. Closer and the creamy sandalwood and cedar with the touch of fresh vetiver is alluring and a tad sexy. I love to smell this on my SO. The price point makes it a great value.",02/23/25 01:43,JoshMonkey
Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"I wonder why so few people admire the note of buckwheat tea in this fragrance... Maybe because it's quite unknown for most of us? The thing is that it's quite similar to roasted buckwheat that one can cook wonderful, comforting porrige of. And the best thing for me in this fragrance is just that! It may be a new trend, a couple of months ago I purchased a shower gel from Yves Rocher that smells oat and buckwheat (I don't appreciate their perfumes but sometimes I just adore the scents of their other products). It's literary like washing yourself with sweet buckwheat porrige :) I know it may sound insane but it's very enjoyable. And my point here is that the shower experience helped me to hear the note of buckwheat in Kenzo Flower Ikebana -- the fact is that I enjoy it more that the rest of the composition. It's a pity it doesn't last for long as it's a top note... The flower notes that last I find a little annoying. So it's a dilemma for me.",01/09/25 07:03,softshell
Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"I think it's one of the best mainstream perfume launches lately!!! It's the first one I'm testing from the new Ikebana line. And I started with the right one, I can't wait to smell the others. Sakura is spring-like, airy and light like cherry blossom petals floating on the wings of the wind. It has a sweet tuberose, bubblegummy, similar to the one in My Way. But the protagonists are the cherry blossoms. Realistic and naturally rendered. You perceive them with the same intensity from the first spray to the last hints from the subtly woody base. . It projects moderately, with a slightly above average longevity, similar to Kenzo perfumes. Congratulations, you did an excellent job!!!",01/07/25 02:49,VeroMikaela

Once it dries, it becomes this almost woody soicy sent, and I’m really digging it.
Alas I spoke too soon! Has an almost medicinal note on the dry down that I am not the biggest fan. I still really like it though.",01/03/25 20:22,Lykopa

Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"I didn't like Jeu d'Amour and I profoundly dislike tuberose - or so I thought. I do find this mostly pleasant, however.

For the most part it is a sweet, creamy, powdery floral, very meek and tame. I do pick the ""bubblegummy"" accord in the opening but it stays only for those very first few minutes (similar to Toy 2 Bubble Gum's and just as short-lived), and then it goes on to evolve into a more classic Kenzo scent with the signature ricey Kenzo powder (if you've tried several Kenzo pefumes for women you might be getting what I mean.) But the longer it stays the less excited I feel about wearing it as it gets progressively less sweet and flowery and more woody and yes, musky. The musk with woods (I'm guessing cedar specifically) smells somewhat bitter and medicinal but that undertone is hardly as strong as the metallic accord in BR40 for instance, so for me it doesn't completely ruin my enjoyment of the fragrance. I just wish it would take a different direction and stay closer to the opening scent which I absolutely do love. Past that point it's just alright.

Started reminding me of Shakira S a few hours in but even then, Ikebana Sakura uses better ingredients and has overall more personality with occasional subtle powdery sweetness coming in even when the scent no longer screams tuberose. Performance is disappointing although I'm using a sample so take it with a grain of salt.

Feminine, versatile, simple without being simplistic. If you *think* you dislike tuberose, this one might have you two getting along as it did with me. Blind buying is not advised because of extremely musky drydown.",09/24/24 17:56,kittenpawz
Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"I wanted to like this one so bad! Why? Probably the memory of kenzo perfume ads on TV in the early 2000s, nostalgia made me want to own a kenzo fragrance? I tried it and it was a ""meh"" for me. I guess I am not meant for this one: the longevity and sillage are too delicate to me. It is a spring flowery, pretty and airy fragrance, it depicts the delicate cherry blossoms with beautiful and light strokes. I did not get any tuberose on my skin at all",09/16/24 20:58,nelluzza.alali

Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"Very soft and feminine perfume. It's sweet with woody touch which is not overpowering. I thought I could smell something almond-y which seemed almost gourmand, but apparently I mistook the cherry blossom note for that. I love tuberose and I can make it out here but it's nothing like fruitchouli/floral gourmands in which you can usually find it. It has the overall Kenzo DNA I adore and it's not too generic.",06/16/24 10:59,nordlanderin
Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"This one caught me by surprise, an interesting take on cherry blossom. Normally, I associate cherry blossom with fresh-bubbly air fresheners. I find that it’s rather rare in perfumes, and even then, it’s usually incorporated into quite lighthearted, girly, fruity-fresh constellations that highlight its tartness.

In Flower Ikebana Sakura, however, I experience a more sensual, womanly, and calm take on the note. The fragrance is quite linear, and more dense and rich than I assumed based on the packaging and the marketed focus on cherry blossom. In fact, while definitely noticeable, this isn’t a decided cherry blossom perfume to me. It’s nicely balanced with the other notes and people around you will probably not even perceive you to smell „like cherry blossom.“ Kenzo also briefly mentioned Jasmine in the heart on their website, which somehow is rarely listed in descriptions of this fragrance. I’m also surprised there isn’t any vanilla listed anywhere; I couldn’t find a review talking about that either. To me, there is quite a pronounced vanillic quality to this. Maybe it’s just a VERY creamy-soft sandalwood, but I also showed a fellow fragrance enthusiast, and he smelled vanilla as well. So for what it’s worth, to us, there is some vanilla, and the cherry blossom is rather tame. Those and the rest of the notes blend nicely into a very smooth, warm, cozy, sweet, slightly earthy floral that is also a tiny bit yummy. It‘s very feminine and sensual, can be worn anytime in any season. Due to the cherry blossom and the tea note, it’s rather unique. Ikebana Sakura is not very complex or challenging, but simply pleasant and inviting. I personally love it and will likely buy a bottle. :)",05/22/24 04:22,livprn
Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"Smelled it on store (on a blotter) and loved it. After a few weeks, I got it as a sample and decided to use it to go out for a lunch date with friends (which went on for most of the afternoon).
I’m very glad I got it at a sample and didn’t buy it. The smell on my skin was totally different from the blotter and the drydown was absolutely nausea/migraine inducing (to the point that I immediately jumped in the shower when I got home). A good reminder to always try on perfumes on my skin before buying. :(",05/19/24 19:57,ddara93

When I sprayed it on, at first, nothing. My husband made a joke that it is a very weak tea.

Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"Okay so I have a box that I put all my perfume samples in. When I first received Flower Ikebana I was disgusted and absolutely hated it. 🙈 I don’t remember what I even thought it smelled like. I’m just glad I didn’t throw it away!

Today I found out My Way will have another flanker… It pushed me over the edge. I am so over brands churning out a scent profile to death and ticking off the boxes for every single trend they can possibly be apart of. I could go on and on.

So I pull out my sample box, dig around and find Ikebana. It’s been at least 2 months since I tried it, probably more. I go with one spray on my arm… Omg! So good! How could I have hated this?! I’m not really seeing good reviews for it. I implore those reviewers to try it again if they can, test it with one spray.

Me personally I am sick to death of gourmands, sick of designers just making variations of the same scent profiles. I want originality, I want something that isn’t catering to the masses. Something that would be missed for all its nuances and uniqueness should it be discontinued. I am so happy I was able to refresh my feelings with Flower Ikebana. I was starting to feel burnt out with the fragrances that are within my budget.

The initial spray actually very quickly reminded me of Marc Jacobs Daisy. You know how Tuberose be smelling purple like the Daisy violets. But it’s more dense, not refreshing. It’s the perfect in-between of grape Jolly Rancher and floral, but don’t be scared!!! It’s not grape cough syrup or “old lady” or mature. It’s adult and sexy. I’m 32 and obsessing!!!

I adore that this fragrance is strong and long lasting. It’s been 4 hours since I first sprayed it and it’s muscling through! 💪 😎 I have a feeling this will easily last my desired 6 hour mark, and on and on.

The drydown definitely smells of sandalwood, but it’s not obnoxious. It’s blended perfectly with something else. The Sobacha Tea or the Sakura Blossom? I’m not sure as I’m not familiar with either. I’d say it’s a very light flower petal scent with the sandalwood so Sakura Blossom? The drool-worthy Tuberose, I still get wafts of it if I don’t pay attention. 😍

If you’re like me and enjoy grape candy-like Tuberose, scents like My Way Intense, My Way Parfum, or L’interdit Rouge… but maybe you too are tired of smelling super sweet all the time… want something DIFFERENT, you’re good with sandalwood, and love beast mode scents… then get yourself a sample of Flower Ikebana!

I’ve done had my gourmand phase. I wanna smell grown and sexy. I’d say I’m in my sweet floral phase but I don’t want to categorize FI and dissuade anyone from trying it. Believe me this one is special!!!",02/04/24 01:20,girldeadbug
Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"These are the true notes according to the website:

FLOWER IKEBANA, a floral woody fragrance for women, is composed like an ikebana, inspired by the Japanese art of flower arrangement, with a balance resting on three notes: Sobacha Tea with its roasted accents, delicate Sakura blossom enhanced by Indian Tuberose absolute, and the precious warmth of Australian Sandalwood essence.",02/04/24 00:14,girldeadbug

Flower Ikebana Sakura Kenzo,"I've blind bought it because I read that was similar to L'interdit and it was a huge mistake. There is no resemblance to L'Interdit in my opinion. It is quite heavy and cloying, it is a tuberose bomb - maybe the woods make it louder? - a monster silage and projection that causes discomfort, nausea and it is headache inducing. But to be fair, but it could be an excellent option for those who adore tuberose. For me, particularly, was a disaster.
The drydown is quite woody, not in a masculine way but not pleasant as well.
Got the 75 ml bottle on sale, which tells me that being a 2023 launch it may be out of market quite soon. I do advise test before buying it.

The beginning of this fragrance is really beautiful and surprising after reading few reviews. People described it as a pleasant almost boring and nothing special. I can smell the tea notes, something floral and also woodsy.
The fragrance is really intimate, after while I forgot I even sprayed it. So the sillage is intimate to moderate, best suited for spring or summer.
I was enjoying it but in the end it became unpleasant. I was trying to sleep and position my arm away from my face, so I would not be able to smell this fragrance. The drydown is unpleasant to me and I can smell it even after 10+ hours.",11/05/23 04:12,Macabria

It was perfect for spring but it is also suitable for the hotter temperatures of these days (end of May in Italy), and I'm curious to find out how it will perform in the middle of summer and in winter. Sakura blossoms don't have a strong scent so this is not a realistic sakura fragrance, but I think it represents the delicate and comforting splendor of hanami well.

a fresh scent, long lasting...even though i bought the Dubai Grade AAA version. what's more to say about the original version?
nothing really spectacular, reminds me of teenage days when i used to have that Avon unisex perfume.

Update: the more i wear it i think the more interesting it gets. the opening was a real sharp citrusy smell but instantly evaporates to a more floral tone, which then left a soft smell to the skin. because of the spicy notes so spraying direct onto skin will get some of the burning sensation (this turns me off during the few 1st try) but then wait for a few minutes to enjoy the drydown...it's just cool & refreshing! no sticky feeling wearing this unlike the sweet heavy perfumes out there. try it!

Ok, i really wish they would stop doing all this to Kenzo fragrances. Endless flankers i mean. Just how many ""amour"" and ""flower"" flankets are out thete alreafy???
This is another meaningless flanker/limited edition. Nothing outstanding at all. Quite watery, airy and also sickenly sweet to my nose. Somehow it really reminds me of a pear flavored candy or even more a pear scented soda i was drinking as a child. The opening reminds me of it at least, but the middle stage is just plain sugar, pear and jasmine. As simple as this.
Kisses of butterflies? Come on, why can't beautiful butterflies smell beautiful??!! If i could compare it to smething, it would be more of the scen for jellyfishes. Plain, simple and almost invisible. Even the colour of the bottle and the design reminds me of jelly fish. And I don' t find it creamy at all.

Please do not remove this comment, since others might find it useful. Not every review should be positive, so people like me wanted to make a blind buy might find it very informative. Thanks.",06/14/13 14:08,passionata20

L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"There was a lot of pear and lemon in the opening..which I liked but not loved(I'm not a fan of fruity scents)..but the heart of L'eau2 is a mild sweet rose;with a touch of creamy lotus giving it an aquatic aspect just like pink roses in rain and just a touch of citrus to brighten it up...I LOVE;LOVE and again love this fresh smell of pink wet roses
It has nothing to do with org l'eau.the org one was more aquatic and less feminine but this one is just like a sweet dream.so light..so pure..a refreshing spring and summer scent
When it dries down I can feel musk and something like green tea
Longevity and sillage are moderate/good..more than what I expected for such a mild n lovely scent
Edit:after using it a couple of times,now I can smell pear from the start til the end,not fresh and so light as i felt before
I still like this pear,rose,lemon combo but I prefer to use it during spring,rather than hot summers

L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"Light and bright, floral, pleasant, soft sillage.

The scent really kicks in in its best, ultimate form after a couple of hours. It is like a tender spring or summer dream. It would probably be a bit contradictory to wear it in the winter season; or why not if you want to give off some cute energy like a little elf?

The lotus and rose combine very harmoniously and the subtle citrus balances the floweriness by brightening it up.

L'Eau 2 makes me think of flowers with raindrops on them. Beautiful. If this fragrance were a material and you could touch it it would be silk.",05/11/15 10:39,GinWeed

L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"Kenzo L'Eau 2 pour Femme doesn't change much on me: a soft lemony floral scent. The lemon here has nothing astrigent, its gentle tartness adds a zesty, invigorating zing to the flowers. The core of the floral part of L'Eau 2 seems to be a mild rose, with a touch of lotus bringing in a slight aquatic aspect, and a soupcon of freesia for a green touch. The overall effect is cool and breezy, girly and carefree. In the late drydown, I also find there is a slight honey note enhancing the floral sweetness.

L'Eau 2 has a soft sillage and its longevity on me is about 8 hours. As a citrus pink floral scent, there are probably other more interesting and memorable choices out there. That being said, L'Eau 2 is not bad on its own: refreshing, approachable, without being overly synthetic or saccharine. I'd recommend it to those who are looking for a lighthearted citrus floral fragrance for spring and summer.",03/19/14 10:54,StellaDiverFlynn

Just noticed that there's the tea note missing from the base notes, definitely check that out, when first released it.was noted as the tthird base note. Every time I wear this I get the sweet pear and roses, which also.are.no longer listed, and the creamyness of the lotus, different to the sharp dry lotus.from the.original.l'eau. Sweet freesia and then a little cedar and the tea note (which may get noticed as patchouli- i know i thought it.was.patchouli, but lo and behold it was tea on the drydown)
Inmense lasting power, medium to excellent projection/sillage depending on the day - especially climate related (ex. When it's very humid the sillage is monstruous, you will.be emmiting waves of this stuff, and it only gets stronger with time, stays fresh always. On drier days sillage is average, longevity is still good, tends more towards a woodier fruity fragrance than fresh and sweet)",05/18/13 20:31,fiouu
L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"This perfume has changed my perception about citrus, and I thank Kenzo for that. I never liked any citrus scent before. Until a seller kindly include 2 vials of this along with my purchase, I was immediately in love, and so were my friends. I checked out the notes and was surprised to know it has lemon as the main notes! I love it. Smells so fresh and suits for everyday use.",03/31/13 07:30,bebekesasar

En äkta vår/sommardoft! Upplyftande med massor av citron i toppnoten. När den lugnat sig så känner jag även ros, musk, päron och cederträ. Lite för söt för min smak men superhärlig varje-dag-doft för alla kvinnor - Tidlös.",01/07/13 05:23,Mooniq

L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"Kenzo always make unique fragrances, but actually, this new L'Eau is not quite like that. It smells like so many other fresh and clean perfumes out there. It's those kind of perfumes that it's difficult to dislike, it's pretty, easy to wear and perfect for when you just want to smell good and ""safe"". It also doesn't have anything to do with the original L'Eau, which smells much more aquatic and kind of unissex.

The pyramid says it all: It starts very citrusy and fruity, and the heart is floral, sweet and very feminine. This transition reminds me a little bit of Scarlett from Cacharel, maybe because of the pear, but much fresher. You can definitely smell each note of L'Eau 2. For me, lotus, pear and rose are the most prominent. As you can expect, this is very girly girl kind of perfume, which surprises me because Kenzo doesn't make stuff like that.

The longevity and sillage are quite poor on my skin, unfortunately, and I have to reapply many times during the day. I think it works for all seasons, but it would be lovely for Spring and Summer.

Kenzo lovers like me may be a little bit dissappointed with L'Eau 2, but if you like fresh and clean, feminine and charming fragrances, you should give it a try! It's cute, and it's cheaper than other high end brands.",10/18/12 12:21,PinkyStuff
L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"I really like it,fresh, light with a little sweetness. Perfect for summer, but i could wear it anytime. I hope i can buy it soon.",07/14/12 13:43,kitti002
L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"I'm really impressed with this L'eau par Kenzo flanker. Although an aquatic, L'eau 2 Kenzo for Her has a sweet juicy quality which smells really fun and invigorating on the skin.

There aren't many similarities between this flanker and the original. I'm really enjoying the sweet bursts of lemon and pear, followed by some gloriously feminine florals. Freesia provides a clean base, while the rose and lotus, in turn, create an element of girlish charm.

L'eau 2 Kenzo for Her is the perfect choice for Spring and Summer, and will be a sure hit with the younger segment of the population. To be completely honest, I didn't expect too much prior to testing this flanker, so I have been more than pleasantly surprised. I would most certainly wear this.

Due to its flirtatious and candied sweetness, some may consider this fragrance a tooth-ache. I actually don't mind it, and that's partly because this fragrance settles in a way that is soft and discreet, rather than loud.

The drydown is a subtle blend of sweetened florals, white musk and cedar. I think the composition as a whole, has been well executed. Even the sales assistants have been raving over the new L'eau 2 Kenzo for Her.

In terms of longevity, I'd have to say that it really does last, a lot longer than you may expect. I assume that this could be a limited edition, or even the 2012 answer to a Summer release. Either way, snap it up now or be sorry.",07/07/12 06:57,missk
L'Eau 2 Kenzo pour Femme Kenzo,"A great mix of citrus and sweet at the beginning but the drydown is too musky in my opinion, what surprised me because white musk usually is very fresh and hardly noticeable. I was a little disappointed.",06/28/12 10:24,Paulascs

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"I'm revisiting this one years after I first got it and I must say it's turned out to be one of my most successful blind buys. I love how the mint and spices in the opening contrast with the woody base and keep it from being too earthy or dry. It's a green and woody fragrance for sure but has an invigorating quality to it. I enjoy wearing it on my evening walks during the summer and fall.

These older Kenzo fragrances from the 2000s and 2010s all had so much character, it's too bad they all got discontinued. The new line created by Quentin Bisch gets generally good reviews but got boring to me pretty quickly.",08/31/25 18:30,Vapor Trail
Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"I remember this one from years ago. It was my dad's cologne but I used to ""borrow it"" and rock it for the high-school myself so it was one of the first fragrances I ever wore.

Very green, peppery and sharp vetiver. That sharp, peppery basil note made it quite unique. Was quite strong aswell. Good days.",04/27/25 07:34,SundyPace
Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Kenzo Homme Boisée opens with a sharp, almost spicy kick—I was sure there was anise in the top notes before checking, but it seems to be mint and basil adding that twist. The first spray is bold, but as it dries down, it settles into a peppery vetiver, fresh yet grounded.

The Kenzo DNA is still here—clean, fresh, and easy to wear. If you like vetiver with a green, slightly spicy touch, this one is a solid choice.",01/01/25 14:27,AndrewZb
Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"A heavy vetyver fragrance with basil, mint and cedar mixed with some rosemary. But, heavy vetyver! It's almost as heavy as Gueralin Vetyver. Someone did mention Sandalwood and I agree. I'm getting the same creamy sandalwood note after the top notes.

The notes in this fragrance play well together. Definitely a warm weather freshie, but it can be equally used in cool autumn months too.

On my skin, longevity isn't so great, maybe 5-6 hours and the sillage is about 1-2 feet. Still, a nice scent. Mine is a 2010 bottle with the embossed bamboo stem and leaves. I paid about $40. I wouldn't pay more than that.",03/19/24 21:07,websterdaniel
Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Kenzo Homme Boisee is a great fresh summer option that doesn't rely on aquatics, citrus, or ambroxan for it's lift. With enough depth to work year round, I think it's a super versatile option, and was a steal at $30-$40. Hard to recommend at inflated prices, due to it's discontinuation, but under $50 it's worth the price 100%.

It's a very simple blend, with brief unsweetened mint, and the rosemary and basil giving it a bit of a camphorous, herbal, and anisic edge, but overall a non-descript and enjoyable green feeling with woody browns underneath. The vetiver lands somewhere between fresh green, and earthy brown. There is a bristly and prickly feel to this when sniffed up close, but in the air, it's nice, smooth, and fairly one dimensional. I think the beauty here lies in the simplicity.

It splits a difference between completely natural feeling, and synthetic feeling as it arrives somewhere in the middle and feels modern, yet not muddled for it. The aromachemical feel gives it enough airy lift where it doesn't feel heavy or muddy like an essential oil blend would.

I'd call this the Kenzo designer equivalent to Aesop Tacit for sure, with Tacit being far more natural feeling with a photorealistic basil and very beautiful vetiver. This Kenzo is like the streetwear version to Aesop's yoga studio and cushy boutique hotel vibe. They are 2 sides of the same coin, with each suiting their respective brands overall look and feel.

The performance and feeling of this one trends toward middle of the road, yet it still stands out as unique to me. Not knock your socks off unique, but unique in a quiet and confident non-shouty way. It tip toes between natural and synthetic (not a diss here) and clean and earthy in a satisfying way, and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly if you can come across for a bargain.",01/27/24 13:47,MaxMellows

Edit: having now used Encre Noire, I think that's what Kenzo was trying to copy, dry down is 80% same, with Lalique being the superior scent of the two in my opinion, though some might appreciate more the hint of freshness with Kenzo's basil.",05/09/22 13:58,Bedtimestory

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Kenzo Homme Boisee has just the right balance of nutty rooty vetiver and green herbs without getting overly dirty or too old school.

A few I have that I can compare this to:
Lagerfeld Bois de Vetiver: brighter sweeter citrus geranium Ambroxan
Guerlain Homme L’Eau
D&G Masculine (spicier from the clary sage & caraway)
Tom Ford Grey Vetiver that I much less prefer due to its smoky spicy undertone

I find Givenchy Very Irresistible Fresh Attitude Summer Cocktail to be a good layering partner.

Performance is an issue for me. As the opening fades this fragrance sits very close to the skin. I can barely smell it after 4 hours, which is a real shame, because this is good stuff; it just doesn't jump off the skin like I'd want it to.

Relaxing, albeit safe (and a bit boring). I am essentially ambivalent toward this scent. I wouldn't mind wearing it, but it isn't particularly attractive in any way either. And I don't find it as comforting as others...It's kind of like clear as a color.

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"I came across Kenzo Boisee accidentally whilst browsing eBay. A 30ml bottle for £12 inclusive of postage so I couldn't resist the temptation to purchase the bottle.

From the moment I sprayed it, it reminded me of another fragrance that I adore.... Eureka!

Tacit by Aesop, the green minty luscious green scent they both give off is unmistakably similar. I would not say they are 100% identical though. Tacit's ingredients are more realistic but KB does not do a bad job.

The mint in both does not give off the notorious 'mouthwash' note, thank god! KB transports me to a green humid jungle in a way similar to Selva de Brasil by Berdoues.
Tacit is an EDP and KB is an EDT which explains the difference in the performance between the two.

Tacit retails at £70 for the 50ml bottle and it rarely is available at a discount price although I, fortunately, happened to find it at a much lower price on eBay. KB can be readily found at nearly half the price on eBay.

All in all, Kenzo Boisee is nothing groundbreaking but is definitely a very good fragrance and a keeper for me.

It is an easy first adventure into woodier scents for those less familiar, as both the spices (basil, mint, rosemary) and cedar notes used here are safe and complimentary to a lot of skin tones. If memory serves - it's been a few years since I've run out of this one, sadly - silage and longevity are comfortably powerful without being too domineering. This is an incredibly ""manly"" scent in the bearded lumberjack sort of way.",12/27/16 22:14,Jag02010

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Very nice juice from Kenzo house.

It shares a lot in common in the presentation of vetiver and herbal/green vibe with Guerlain Homme l'Eau Boisee.

Guerlain Boisee is one of my favorite vetiver cologne for summer formal/casual days, but after I got this Kenzo and it just grew on me. Consider the year of production, I may refer the Guerlain one as Kenzo Homme Boisee Sport/Fraiche/Eau.

The difference between those two Boisees lays on the selection of herbal ingredients, the Guerlain uses grass as accompaniment to vetiver and makes it a bit unisex and energetic, but the Kenzo chooses brasil and is thus more masculine and low-profile somehow.

Both Boisees are definately gorgeous juices, but which one to grab should depend on your preference. If you are not in a budget constraint, you can get them both into your wardrobe with no doubt or hesitation.

Rating: 7.0/10

After wearing it a week, I found out this is definately not as good as Guerlain l'Eau Boisee in terms of materials quality, but still a nice perfume.",07/20/16 23:02,ralopa

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Really like this one. Starts off with citrus, herbs and woods which comes across as a little busy within the first few minutes, but it starts to meld nicely after that. Ultimately it dries down to a vetiver and light citrus mint combo which is very nice. As a comparison to other scents, I would say it is a combination of Guerlain's Vetiver Extreme with the mint note of YSL's Live Jazz. Two fragrances I really enjoy and which aren't particularly common.",10/20/15 00:35,grug
Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Kenzo Homme Woody (also called Kenzo Boisée in some countries) was released in 2010, inspired by the look and the connection of the man with the energy of the earth and the immensity of the sky, as if he was the tallest tree, in a path with no limits.

It is almost unknown and poorly commented. But it is a masterpiece of perfumery that, unfortunately, is no longer manufactured.
It has notes of mint and basil, in the output; Rosemary and pepper from Madagascar, in the heart; Haiti vetiver and Atlas cedar, in the base.

When it touches the skin is minty and sweet. This freshness merges with a completely aromatic nuance, dotted by a touch of pepper. The base is woody, with greater presence of cedar and its camphorated and balsamic nuances. To me, it seems that the vetiver doesn't even exist.

During the evolution, it can makes you remember many other creations. In my case, I think of Burberry The Beat.
The bottle kept the visual identity, in a mix of gray and amber colors, which resembles wood.

In my opinion, is one of those fragrances without defects: is versatile, is elegant, exudes well, has great durability and, furthermore, was made by Olivier Polge.",06/18/15 15:00,Cassiano

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Sophisticated, professional, and alluring – an underrated gem and everything you want in a fragrance at an affordable price. Whoa – this morning I was reminded how much I like Kenzo’s Homme Boisee edition. This is a beautiful composition of herbal, floral, and woodsy notes that provides a clean and fresh feeling most of the day. While the sillage sets close to skin level, Boisee is a compliment getter and crowd pleaser. Additionally, given the fact that it remains close to skin level, Boisee offers great flexibility to be worn in any environment and for most occasions. The gentleness of the woodsy and herbal notes also allows for wear across seasons. The real beauty of Boisee is the price – a 1.7 ounce or 50 ml bottle can easily be found for around $25 USD. For this price range, Boisee is highly underrated. My only concern is regarding performance – I found that Boisee lasted comfortably around 4 hours on me and a bit longer on clothing. Yes – it was disappointing. All things considered, to include the lackluster performance, my final tally for Kenzo’s Boisee is 4.1 stars out of 5 stars. For the price, it is hard to beat. It is a beautiful fragrance that I recommend adding to any collection. Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…",05/20/15 14:25,OCNBreeze7

The composition is good, comforting, safe to wear, earthy fresh but woody and would be good to wear indoors and outdoors, fall and summer afternoons.

I mostly get an inexpensive and antiseptic (and i think others here may have said Soapy instead) vibe from it. Its possible on my skin the woodiness and more earthy tones are absorbed quickly and I don't pick them up (unlike other colognes).

Reminds me of Tam Dao as well. Stays close to the skin but not weak by any means. I don't get much ""green"" unless one means ""grassy"" or maybe earthy. Like hay. No way does it have any similarity to Eau Sauvage in my humble opinion, and no offense to any of my fellow perfumistas. I have been wearing ES for over 25 years, always owned a bottle and had one in my collection. Yes it is something that is so pleasant and unassuming that it could be worn any time, anywhere, at any time of the year. In that respect then it is very much like Eau Sauvage.

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Lovely vetyver based fragrance, I love it in the spring and rainy days.

The opening it's green, minty, citric (bergamot or lime) and a just a bit soapy. And is strong, the first hour I get beast projection with 4 sprays.

In the dry down woody notes are stronger, the vetyver it's the dominant note now. It's remind me of Grey Vetiver and Guerlain Homme Intense(without the rum note).

It's very easy to wear and gets some compliments also. Great longevity and overall quality. I think it's the best flanker of Kenzo Homme.

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"I bought this blind about a year ago, thinking if it had bois in the title it would surely be a winner. Erm, no...

I felt compelled to review after having acquired kenzo air, which to my nose smells much more agreeable.

I don't know what kind of a wood it is supposed to smell like, but I've never come across any wood or vegetation which has ever smelled like this.

I am getting a VERY soapy smell, like imperial leather soap, or those novelty gift soaps you get. A mix between soap and citrussy furniture polish.

If you want a fresh woody scent, better go for guerlain eau boisee, or stick to kenzo air.

I have grey vetiver, and although I dont have it on my top shelf, that does vetiver MUCH better than this one

Clinique chemistry for men can come across as soapy, but not soapy to the max like this disappointing kenzo frag. The title does not match the contents in my opinion.",05/12/14 12:30,paulzork

Starts out with a blow of basil and sweet mint, which is replaced by a more peppery note within the first 15-20 minutes and after some time the vetiver kicks in and stays around with a woody note. A very fresh scent, but strangely doesn't come across as soapy. Very pleasant and versatile for use in spring and summer.

The opening combines mint, basil, and a citrus note. I'm not sure what the note is (maybe bergamot) but in any case I don't love it in this fragrance. It brings an element of sharpness that takes away from the herbal and slightly sweet aromas that both mint and basil have. But even still the opening is good. After that, the herbs stay put and team up with a spicy woody accord. There is also something in the drydown that reminds me of lavendar, which gives it a nice clean vibe.

Not particularly unique, but an enjoyable smell. I think people who like the smell of basil should check this out as the note is pretty pronounced.",02/26/14 20:11,onechopchevy

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,I get the basil and mint at first. After about 15 minutes the basil is replaced by a light hint of pepper. The dry down starts about 20 minutes in and is mint and cedar. This lasts as a relatively close skin scent for about 8 or 9 hours. I enjoy the scent. I haven't smelled anything like it. They just started selling it today at ulta and i picked it up.

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Good gosh, hit me on the backside of the head! This is everything I wanted Bvlgari MAN to smell like!

Bvlgari MAN has this screeching floral citrus top that's hard to get around, not to mention base notes that are barely there, but remarkable.

Kenzo Boisee, to summarize on the whole, is a citrus woody scent with a generous helping of soapy-musk nuances. Apart from the citrus at the top, there's also spicy but not sharp notes, and a tinge of a green medicinal aromatic smell.

A European woody-soapy clean. I LOVE THIS! Good longevity. A must try.

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Update,
To sum up this amazing frag, after it settles you have a woodsy/spicy LUXURIOUS aroma. This juice a high quality herbal aromatic scent...a very fresh, clean scent...A TRUE GEM!!!!!★★★★★

I never found Kenzo's cologne for men to generic or common. Most of their cologne's have a long staying power. I did find that most of them dry back nicely !!!!!!!!
Kenzo Homme Woody Edt Boisée is no exception, it has a well blend aroma of herbs, Basel, Rosemary to give it a herbal or a green aroma. The woodsy (Cedar) as well as Vetiver combined with black pepper really spice's it up and makes it the best of Kenzo frag in opinion.
For me Kenzo Homme Edt Boisée has a real masculine aroma as well as it being a very mystical scent from the Orient. This cologne is really rich in a warm woodsy scent also being very aromatic which comes off as an attractive scent also perfect during the summer/fall day's.
Longevity is well past 10 hour's
Sillage is beyond most fragrance's, with your body temperature it radiates further them most colognes.
Overall, I don't find this cologne boring or plain...instead I find that it evokes or opens your senses to a far away land where the aroma is fresh and pure. This cologne gives you that clean fresh and spicy scent. 10/10",06/12/13 23:15,aqua_de_la_vita

It is a joyful blend of basil and sweet mint, with bonfire and sizziling woods in the background. Kenzo Boisee contains a very friendly vetiver, it is not overly grassy or sour. But does add a bit of warm smoke and soaks up the wateriness of the sweet herbs.

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Boisee is by far my favorite scent from Kenzo's collection marketed to men. I purposefully used the verb ""marketed"", as I find it pretty universal i.e. very unisex really. The smell is absolutely natural to me - woody, herbal, spicy and earthy notes are my types of scents and I never saw anything particularly masculine in them.

This EDT is a powerhorse when it comes to sillage and longevity - just a few sprays in the morning carry me strongly throughout the day. I simply love this concoction of prominent earthy vetiver, enticing and a bit savoury black pepper, and cooling mint and basil.

Strangely, while wearing it, I feel like a young samurai, practicing the sword fight deep in the woods or better, flying through the trees, like the characters in the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" movie, even though they were not Japanese ;)

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"A vibrant spicey modern frag with a huge soapy opening, which is strong, but gets too smoky in the end..

I applied 6 heavy sprays


0- 30 secs. Alcohol, nothing much, modern, non-descript

30 secs - 1 hour 1.5 foot projection, very good! This is a strong acidic, spicy, citrus frag with a niche immense soapy twist!! Very masculine and distinctive. Ages 28-50. If you forget the soapy twist then this could be like a watered down version of Terre D Hermes. Night time frag, quite sexy.

1- 2 hours. 1 foot projection. Strong smokiness comes in. The niche soapy twist goes towards the end of the 2 hours and it is now very similar to Salvatore Ferragamo F in Black Pour Homme

2-3 hours. 8 inch projection. Incredibly smoky, too much so..it has lost its character of the 1st hour

3 - 5.5 hours - 3.5 inch projection. Same as above

5.5 hours - 7 hours - 1.5 inch projection

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"This fragrance launched at mid 2010, and known in some countries as ""Kenzo Homme Eau de Toilette Woody"" corresponds to a new perfume that is based on the classic lines of Kenzo Homme in 1991, but the similarities only to this point as it changes the original marine scent a strand woody spicy inspired by a tree and the idea of a man getting his energy from the earth while looking towards the infinite sky grow without limits, which is reflected in the names "" Boisée ""and"" Woody ""which translates from French and English as"" woody "".

In mid-stage dry the green group about the idea of spiced water, lowering the mint and vetiver increasing feeling enhanced by the herbs, rosemary and basil integrated into this line as support without shine independently. Within 40 minutes of applied stress begins to pepper derived from the idea of water species, giving features ginger rub dry with earthy and very soft wood in the background. About 1 hour is more pepper applied on a background rudeness continues to remind ginger earthy but fairly bright points provided by a composite herbal, with hints of cardamom spiced with bitter orange in this Declaration by Cartier. At 3 hours the dry portions of spiced lean toward the woods, giving an impression of cedar at 4 hours patchouli mixed with a more visible and on par with the wood, followed by pepper and spice representative of the first part and vetiver passing shade of bush now tending to be absorbed by the wood, all over a body of water aniseed spices that supports and helps make a good trail and projection to these notes. It feels a little green grass but it seems to become independent and not become a complement to the rest of the notes remaining always in the background. At about 8 hours stay alive spicy, fragrant, light amber, with a fresh pepper showing a flashy not annoying itching or bitter, accompanied by notes such high green bushes next to a dusty wooden pepper are complemented by helping project it. In the final phase is less spicy and more spicy vetiver presence of bushy, with more inclination to nutmeg giving an impression even slightly sweet herbal mint reminiscent of a screw.

The fragrance has the advantage of reminding other perfume mixtures above but structuring these notes of a novel and striking, which projects while maintaining a style that is between the classic and young causing a good memory effect in a manner similar to that got La Nuit de L'Homme YSL line of tobacco wood and vanilla. On the point of pepper fragrance has a penchant for cool winters in daily use, expanding to intermediate stations and hot summers in interior, present clean and ideally semiformal social rudeness, even accepting some degree of sporty dynamics. In office the amount of wood species gives the idea of a return of the classic line elegant suit and tie, executive presence and seriousness, perhaps moments pepper providing relaxed casual tone at times, mild winters also focused indoors and outdoors. In the night scene pepper stands quite marked difference from their peers without being intrusive, much like the effect achieved by similar aromas and Light Blue pour Homme D & G in the summer and The Beat Man by Burberry, adding a layer of wood gives reliability and cleanliness preventing the pepper go to the side of the sage or deodorants. On the romantic side is well balanced pepper and other spices layers that give a touch of clove and anise, adding notes sexiest warm wood, perhaps adding a recommendation that over-application can play against the note of pepper out of control and numbing the nose. Age range between 25 and 50 years, with a slight preference for seriousness and elegance over 30 years.",11/01/11 17:08,TERREDUHERMES
Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Previous reviewers got it very well: I also submit to the fresh-aromatic vetiver feeling with additions of black pepper at middle and soft cedarwood at dry down.
I perceived it as a combination of the smooth vetiver of Lalique Encre Noir's drydown with the spicy pepper of Burberry The Beat and some strong mint/basil fresh feeling thrown in it.

Nothing to do in my opinion with the original Kenzo pour Homme so strikingly different from the rest, independent and one-of-a-kind. It is good but would fit me more in a Lacoste line of scents rather than Kenzo.",06/27/11 11:52,minimalist
Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Vetiver will hit you from start to dry down.

At first the vetiver is accompanied by a pinch of tingling mint that gives Kenzo Boisse enough dose of freshness.

That phase is quickly gone and replaced by a more intense version of vetiver, bit creamier, heavier.

On dry down the star remains the same, but this time with cedar dancing in the background, pulling the vetiver into a more shy and earthy version, playing itself out to skin scent phase.

If you love vetiver, try it out. If you hate it, you won't find this appealing.

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"I'm surprised not to find anise in the scent pyramid, because that's what it smells like to me.

I'd say it smells at least as much, if not more, herbal than it does smell woody; not so much green, more like dried spices. It lasts quite a long time. Personally, I like it, but I don't love it. Not having a huge variety of fragrances stored in my head, I find it to be pretty unique and as such all the more a thing of personal taste.

Out of the original Kenzo Homme, the Fresh version and the Boisée version, I like this one best. I think it's unmistakably a Kenzo Homme fragrance, but I find it to be more closely related to Fresh (which also has this prominent anise note) than to the original (which, while also being aromatic, is more creamy-aquatic than its brothers).",03/09/11 04:45,Rob Frost

Middle notes that evolve over that feeling of dry wood dust to light touch sweets, dry wood dominate. Notes a bit more woody base, losing all sense of fragrance powder.

A fairly mature aroma, I think is perfect for a formal meeting, or romantic events in people 30 and older. Not recommend it for anyone under 30 years. The season of use may be universal, only required to be used at night, is perfect for a dark suit. Mildly recommended.",11/13/10 07:29,andrevarx

Kenzo Homme Boisee Kenzo,"Kenzo + Polge = Success.
Kenzo made it again!. ""Kenzo pour homme boisee"" is an aromatic/spicy and soft, woody gorgeous scent.
This new fragrance is supposed to be a flanker to the 1991′s ""KenzoHomme""
They have nothing at all in common (the only real similarity being the shape of the bottle and a salty trail). That doesn't mean that it will be a big dissapointment for all the original ""KenzoHomme"" lovers like me, as long as they don't expect something as unique as the 1991's original.


It starts fresh and slightly spicy.
There is a lively explosion of a salty refined vetiver, sexy mint and a background of spicy basil. The herbal side of mint and basil is fresh and brilliantly light yet intens. Even though, it never becomes overpowering.
Being honest, at this stage, I was afraid, as the opening really blew my mind and I was scared, presuming that it could react as ""Tokyo"", when, after the top notes, the whole perfume lost all the character.
This is not happening in ""Kenzo Boisée"": the mint accompained by the glorious vetiver shows their presence all the way through, so the perfume becomes rather linear but deliciously addictive.

During the heart and the drydown, the linear formula changes a little with the soft, airy, light cedar accord. Here, the wood seems almost secondary, where the previous notes from earlier reign above all.
So this is not a deep woody perfume as it has been advertised (Thank God).
If you are looking for a real, light wood scent, you better go and sample the CDG ""Wonderwood"".


""Kenzo pour Homme boisée"" is a magnificent, well put together fragrance.
Yes, it is salty but not as the original one, and also it is spicy and woody but nothing like ""Jungle Homme"".
It has the perfect balanced amount of very carefully (and intelligently) chosen ingredients By Polge.
Some people will compare it with the original and it will probably receive bad reviews without justice because they may find it a little mainstream compared to any other of the Kenzo's fragrance line.
I have to agree, but also, I'm happy to say that this new launch will have success in terms of being the best mainstream launch of this year for two simple reasons:

1. Polge always made great perfumes and this one is not an exception.

2. It leads us eventually to the woodiness side that everyone expects, making the scented trip really memorable.

""Boiséé"" is not as loud as ""KenzoHomme"" and not as quiet as ""Power"". It has its own place in the middle, having a distinctive projection and a really good lasting power.",09/14/10 12:56,batabidd

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I got this because I wanted a perfume with the rice note. It definitely not what I was expecting. I personally think this feels like staying in your duvet after putting on body cream and showering with a borotalco body wash. I think the rice is probably more in the background which is the note, together with the vanilla, that gives a bit more “fullness” and “roundness” to the frangipiani, I have Jo malone’s Frangipiani cologne and I can detect the frangipiani in both, but in Jo malone it is more light, watery and flowery, whereas in Amour it is like a more cream like and slightly powdery. I would say it’s a neutral scent (not warm nor cold), that has a certain coziness and it’s slightly reminiscent of borotalco smell without the strong powdriness. It’s a likeable fragrance that feels nice to spray when going to bad or if you want to smell nice but you don’t want a strong perfume. It’s called amour, it kinda feels like hugging another person under your freshly changed duvet.",11/08/25 06:45,Noah1308
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I purchased Amour after reading an article here recently about Olivier Cresp (who originally formulated my signature, Angel). I'm exploring a few of his frags, and I love tea notes so Amour made the cut (plus the bottle is really cool!).

I've only sprayed this on paper so far, but I suspect Amour needs body heat to really shine. The rice/tea opening is lovely and recognizable. If you're exploring either note, this is a fine example of either. After about 15 mins, Amour smells much akin to Guerlain L'Instant...like honey and powder. It's a touch spicier and a bit more floral, but they're definitely siblings. It's fall where I am so it's the perfect season, I think, to test it on skin. I'll update once I wear it this week.",10/19/25 09:17,Rcates78

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I know I had tried this on, a long time ago, but I never bought it - until now. I guess I didn’t have money enough to buy a lot of fragrances back then, when my kids still were kids.
So, now I took the plunge and bought myself a 50 ml bottle. But the scent is so, so weak!! I hope that I just have a day of being anosmic to it - it has happened to me once before, with my signature fragrance - Narciso Rodriguez Narciso Rouge!
I immediately thought that was THE most beautiful fragrance I had ever smelled at the time - apart from Cacharel LouLou and Love, Chloe’. And of course another from Kenzo - Flower!
But Rouge disappeared so quickly, I thought, and I almost could not sense it! But THANKFULLY, it changed, and I can now percieve it perfectly well.
And - it is one of my most complimented fragrances, ever.
So, I just hope that this one will come along, too!!
Because it is very beautiful. I love soft fragrances, but I want to be able to smell it on myself!
So for now, since it is so weak on me, I will only give it a ”like” - otherwise it would get a ”love”.

A little later: my husband could smell it, when he came in from his fishing tour, however… ”You have sprayed something here!” Well, I guess I might have overdone it, after all. I will spray less tomorrow.

Next day: strange phenomenon, this. Today, I feel the fragrance a lot more! Maybe it is because now I know it better?? Anyway, it is still very soft. But obviously, it is not a good idea to put on 12 sprays. 😜",07/31/25 08:35,Miasha

There’s something about the warmth that makes it melt into the skin beautifully, becoming even more addictive. At the same time, it’s cozy and enveloping enough to be perfect in winter too.

Ironically, given the “Asian-inspired” marketing campaign, it’s maybe the ultimate in lactonic (milky) scents that put dairy front and center.

Despite my well-known distaste for sweet gourmands, I find Amour surprisingly lovable; the milkiness is comforting, and the powdery heliotropin makes it stop short a half notch from the over-rich dessert zone and remind you it’s a perfume.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"All the notes should add up to something lovely for me, but there's an odd heaviness to this one once it settles down on the skin. The aura around me while wearing it is nice, very kind and gentle. I definitely feel the romantic story it's trying to tell - fluffy and innocent yet grown-up. I wish there was something fizzy or citrus to lift it up a bit, but that's just my taste. The overall effect is very cuddly, I have to be in the right mood for it.

As others have mentioned, there is a very slight Play-Doh vibe in the vanilla, similar to Hypnotic Poison. If you're vanilla-skeptic as I am, this won't be one to convert you. However, the florals waft around nicely; I only get the waxy lipstick smell when I smell my wrist up close.

The cherry blossom accord is dominant. If you've smelled any ""Sakura"" body mist or hand soap, you know the drill. Not too inspiring, but it's cradled nicely by the fuzzy notes around it.

The incense at the base gives it a tiny bit of smoky edge, just enough to keep it from going fully saccharine.

Giving it a ""like"" as I wear it on this sunny winter day, where the crispness of the air carries the sweetness well. To my husband, it smells like an SPF chapstick he used religiously in the Alps; he loves it for the scent memory. Well, I'll take the compliment :-)",02/16/25 01:24,lilliana01

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I am pretty sure my mom had this fragrance at some point when I was younger. I was also pretty sure I knew exactly how it smells. Turns out I kinda didn't.

Upon spraying: mostly flowery, sweetish orchids and heliotrope - can't tell if I get any rice or tea, they probably get too blended in with the rest. Also pretty intense and a little cloying. Then it settles into its ""true form"", which I'll agree is an extremely powdery, play-do vanilla. It's not entirely unpleasant or uninteresting, though - there's this elusive sharp, almost slightly masculine note, which I assume is either the wood or incense; and in general it's a pretty non-standard fragrance profile for this day and age.

I always thought this was a sweeter vanilla with a lot more tea and rice, almost like a spa scent, instead I get 90s office vibes from it. I do kinda like it, though, but for now I'm going to put it in the ""ok"" category until it grows on me - I feel like it will.",01/16/25 05:36,cawico7
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Upon first wear I rated it as a dislike. Given the legendary status of the scent I expected special effects but I barely felt it on me - just a rice pudding steam. Years have passed and it turned out I started to miss this cosy scent and asked for it to be a gift for this Christmas. Now I am changing this gentle beauty rating to like. It has a moderate sillage and is very clean and warm. Wintertime I feel musk and rice the most, with a beautiful heart of cherry blossom - heliotrope notes. Frangipani adds certain milky waxiness. The scent is calm and enveloping. I especially envision a shy woman to like its gentle and encouraging aura that works like a safety blankett. The scent is memorable. I think it is the best for wintertime, as it might be too warm in different weather, or rather the scented blanket it creates wont be needed. In warmer weather vanilla feels the most prominent. During wear it becomes creamy and cosmetic powder-like. It is gentle yet long lasting. It's 9,5 hours already and I still clearly feel the scent on myself.

It smells dated. And it's not nice and comfortable, it feels like an outdated office scent, not like a comforting date smell as I wish it to be.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"In one word-- Meh.
I cannot believe the rave reviews...it's okay...a powdery vanilla-ish somewhat Play-Doh scent. Smells much better on the skin than on clothes. The drydown is the best part of the scent, a hint of wood mixed with Play-Doh vanilla, not bad. How this won awards is beyond me, though.
It is a pleasant enough scent, non offensive, perfect for an office setting. It's doesn't perform overly well, even when applied with a heavy hand...but if you like a very gentle perfume, you might like it. No one will ever ask you what you're wearing, but no one will run from you with a headache either. 🤷 If you want to blend in, smell pleasant, not stand out, you will like this.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I am in love!

This smells like a dream to me. It's everything I want from an everyday perfume. It's sweet and vanilla-y, and powdery in a way that is not dusty, it's powdery because of the rice. It is not gourmand though, it has a very clean smell, to the verge of being soapy. Smells like a beautiful body cream: snuggly, sexy, airy, and sweet, but in a perfume form.

It has everything I like about powdery vanilla scents when executed correctly. It is pure, innocent, and clean but also sweet and very sexy.

Great Longevity and decent sillage, at least on me. The only thing is, give it 5-10 seconds, because the first spay is for some reason, very sharp and synthetic. But after some seconds when all the alcohol is gone, it's DIVINE.

Small Edit: In no way shape or form, this is similar to Hypnotic Poison. I have HP, I really like HP, and I can see someone liking both of them, but HP is way more, not obnoxious exactly, more in your face. HP is more of a night perfume and I think it's way more polarizing than this one. But if you like HP, and want a day alternative, I would say give it a shot.",11/07/24 04:15,VasPet
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I can't believe that I haven't heard more about this, it's sooo good! A beautifully done ""your skin but better"" perfume: somewhat musky, non-gourmand vanilla and almond scent - velvet smooth, not particularly sweet, a little starchy. My nose perceives it as dry and airy, like paper and clean sheets, rather than powdery. It smells like a hug from a calm, kind person that loves you. Longevity and sillage aren't great on my skin, but okay for the price. I generally fall for bolder, sweeter, weirder scents, so this is not quite a love, but I like it a lot and will happily use it up.",11/04/24 09:57,violaodorata

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I don't like this unfortunately. It smells dated to me, a little sour. I prefer Hypnotic Poison by a lot. I don't get rice pudding, I don't find this gourmand really.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I get why everyone is saying this smells like rice pudding, though I find there is something more powdery and almost dusty about this. It certainly isn't a creamy rice pudding. I bought this in hopes it would be a good dupe for The Different Company's Pure eVe. On paper they do smell strikingly similar, but I was quite disappointed by how they smell on me. Pure eVe is fresh air, almonds, a little baby powder, vanilla extract. It's just so comforting and lovely, and I got whiffs of it off my shirt all day. This is powdery rice pudding and is gone in under four hours. Not at all what I was hoping for.",08/04/24 10:35,booklover27
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Mmmm…

This perfume is so beautiful. It gives a similar air to Dulce by RJ or Vanilla Musk.

It smells like deliciously sensual rice pudding. Odd, I know.

This perfume is so ladylike and sweet. It smells modest, almost.

I love it so much. It smells delicious and lactonic, yet sweet and powdery, all while smelling gourmand. I don’t really pick up on any florals, but I get this beautiful milky / rice vanilla scent. I’m almost positive there are rice notes in this fragrance.

Wear Amor if you want to smell sweet and flirty, but still mysterious. You’ll smell like the sweetest girl in the room, without being obvious.

I hands down, 100% endorse this perfume. It is ladylike, gourmand, modest, and not at all cloying. It is so discreetly flirty. I promise people will want to hug you or ask you for your number. Hahaha kidding. But seriously, this perfume is gorgeous! That is undeniable.

I smelled this perfume once and immediately went to go purchase the biggest size they sold. I LOVE KENZO AMOR.",07/22/24 21:15,Lbustos2

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I bought a decant of this as I'm trying not to blind buy full bottles, so unfortunately I cannot comment as to how old the formulation is or how it was stored, or it might be from a modern bottle.

From a distance I get the creamy rice pudding element of this and it's quite pleasant and cosy. However when I get in closer for a stronger sniff it has a chemical undertone which reminds me of Windex. Maybe this is what others describe as playdough?

I don't hate it, don't love it. Very glad I didn't buy a full bottle. I am learning my lessons.

Overall it has taught me that perhaps creamy lactonic scents aren't for me? Or maybe I've not yet found ""the one""?

EDIT: the dry down is a pleasant powdered vanilla. Quite generic and I think you could easily find this in an alternative. It's quite pricey and hard to find where I am so I wouldn't recommend paying over the odds for this",06/18/24 03:03,rachelzrzr

For me it doesn't have the faintest resemblance at all - thankfully, as I cannot stand HP!
Kenzo Amour is a thing of beauty, it's a cozy comfort for a cold autumn day (or night), a gorgeous rice and frangipani notes, that makes me feel like i'm wearing the softest cashmere sweater, staying home with my beloved ones... It's not sexy, but very sensual and mellow....
It is hygge in perfume form

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I am seeing such fantastic deals online for 50 ml and 100 ml bottles of this but I'm really torn on whether to buy. I love the accord of rice but I'm not enjoying sweet vanilla accords as much as I used to. I think this perfume could have been less play-doughy if they left out the vanilla. I already own Jo Malone's Scarlet Poppy Intense which has a nice heliotrope note, and a few rice accord perfumes so I'm not sure I need this. I love the smell of steamed rice (very Zen and calming) but I don't like rice pudding at all.

I won't lie, the other notes besides vanilla are gorgeous.

It annoys me when people try to compare an artfully blended perfume like this one to fast fashion crap like Zara. This is much more complex and tasteful and made of quality materials than Gleam of the Moon. Just because the same rice and vanilla accords are listed doesn't mean it's even remotely the same.

It smells like a grandma covered in sun tan lotion and lots of lots of old powder from the 80's 😬 and I don't mean baby powder but makeup powder and to that a splash of musk.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I love this so much! I have found a new signature, most of my favourite perfumes are rare or discontinued, thank god I find a perfume that's not hard to find.

I have a soft spot for powdery, lactonic perfumes especially with vanilla and rice. It's refreshing to find a vanilla perfume isn't tooth rotting candy sweet but it's still yummy. This is silky, airy and comforting - it's smells almost angelic tbh. It smells a little like baby powder. If someone else wore this, I would want to hug them. It reminds me of Luminae and Silken Tent by Alkemia, especially the latter because it has rice notes and an Asian dessert smell.

Great sillage and longevity. Beautiful ❤️",12/29/23 08:36,km1266
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I love this so much. It was my signature scent from when I was 14 years old to my early twenties, and I returned to it at 29 (I am now in my thirties).

It is important to note that the former version (2005) is very different from the current version. I currently have a bottle of each and was able to experiment with both in the same weather and conditions.

The old version, as I remembered, has much more pronounced rice, incense and white tea notes. It is softer. Sillage is more discreet. It feels like hugging someone you love in a peaceful wooden house in a forest during spring (which is pretty much like the old ad used to portrait it). Truly a oriental perfume that is extremely unique, there is nothing quite like it.

The current version has way more sillage and a strong tangy side to it. It now has more vanilla-powdery and it is more floral as well. It feels way less unique and I don't enjoy the tanginess, which is why I decided to purchase the older one. Even with these down sides, however, for me, it remains a great perfume in both versions. I will keep purchasing it as long as it is available.",12/11/23 19:55,pomd
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is temperamental on my skin chemistry and depending on the weather. Sometimes it's an addictive, delectable, not-too-sweet gourmand rice pudding, other times it just comes off as stale playdoh mixed with that weird base smell that's in most clear gel antiperspirants.

That said, when it's good, its goood and smells warm, like the steam coming off of rice. A classic for a reason.

The longevity is good, too. I wish the smell worked on me all the time.",11/27/23 16:58,cl195238
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I really like this, as others have said it’s a warm and cosy rice pudding, comforting, soft, and sweet. I mostly get the vanilla and rice notes, with hints of heliotrope and musk.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"After years of wanting to try it, I finally did a blind buy.

Yeah, I can see where the comparisons to Dior Hypnotic Poison are coming from. The opening to Kenzo Amour is SO almond-forward that it almost smells exactly like Hypnotic Poison to my nose. It smells good, don't get me wrong, but as someone who already owns Hypnotic Poison, I was a little let down at first. Then, the drydown happened.

30 minutes after spraying, this fragrance turns into what many people have described as a ""lightly powdery rice pudding scent,"" and I couldn't agree with that more. I wouldn't call this a sexy scent ... In fact, I would almost call it matronly (which I don't mean as a bad thing-- I'm a mother myself). It's very soft, kinda sweet, cozy, and comforting. It's nice. If I were to continue to compare this to Hypnotic Poison, then I guess I would call Kenzo Amour the ""daytime"" or the ""innocent"" version of it.

If you enjoy sweeter scents but don't want something that is too abrasive and loud, then I highly recommend this perfume. It's very wearable and well-constructed.",09/23/23 17:21,spiderleenie

At first it *vaguely* reminds me of BBW japanese cherry blossom, so I guess the cherry blossom is pretty noticeable on me? It settles into a gorgeous, comforting powdery vanilla. More floral than foody/vanilla extract. This is my second choice for a comforting fragrance (first place being mon guerlain). My bottle is pretty old; my formulation lasts about 10 to 12 hours on me and has heavy sillage with two sprays. To me, it does not share any similarities to hypnotic poison, which is more doughy/almond.",09/02/23 16:09,VioletScented

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I adore this scent. I really get the clean, calming notes of rice and white tea. In my opinion the savory rice alongside the woody base makes this fragrance conceivably unisex. I love it as a woman but I think it would work perfectly well for a man looking for a soft fragrance option. The sweetness from the vanilla and florals is muted and powdery, not gourmand. To me it resembles the type of natural sweetness you get from anise or almonds. I can't imagine it ever becoming cloying, regardless of weather. I also get a slight saltiness, like sea air, that reminds me of my long discontinued love, Gap Close.

Overall Kenzo Amour is a great choice if you're looking for something cozy, lightly sweet, and inoffensive. If you're a lover of gourmand, deep, syrupy vanillas, this may not be the fragrance for you. This is for the type of vanilla fan who prefers a soft, lactonic, gentle vanilla musk.

I find the sillage very faint and it doesn't last long on my skin. That being said I only have a sample so hopefully when I have a full bottle, I can douse myself and my clothes thoroughly and get more performance out of this.

Also, I'm really surprised to see how many people online recommend Amour as a dupe for Hypnotic Poison.

Every time I wear it in public I receive at least two compliments, and I cannot even smell it anymore myself after 2-3 hours, but rest assured: it's there, and it's magic.
That rice note is to die for.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is a weird one. At first spray I get a very sweet vanilla faintly resembling Dior Hypnotic poison. Sadly, this last for all but maybe 2 minutes, then the vanilla takes a step back and the rice and tea step forward and stay. It’s not as gourmand as I’d thought it would be. It has a vintage, woodsy, plastic-y, sour vibe. It’s a nice fragrance but not something mind blowing, it’s just ‘nice’ and maybe even a little ‘meh’ (for me at least) Glad I only bought a decant, before buying a full bottle. Definitely won’t be buying it now.",08/06/23 19:34,assoula17

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"It's only befitting that my first review on this website should be of Kenzo Amour, the fragrance so dear to my heart. I'm not the one who fancies dissecting a perfume on notes, I prefer to describe a feeling, an image, an emotion or mood. Then in Kenzo Amour's case the feeling is to be wrapped in arms of a partner who loves you securely. Without ups and down or any sort of rollercoaster. If I venture into talking about notes, then I guess it is a comfort of rice and calm of tea on top of fragrant (not so much gourmand) vanilla. My bottle is from 2010, when I bought a few and savoured them ever since.",07/27/23 08:09,charlie9700

It smell like falling in love in the most innocent and pure way, and it’s one of the most comforting fragrances I’ve smelt so far.

It’s pretty weak on me (most fragrances are, unfortunately), but it’s also very hot right now where I live so maybe it will do better during the colder months. I definitely can’t wait to try it then!

It reminds me of Silken Tent by Alchemia - they’re not dupes, but to me they have the same vibe. Again, very comforting. Like a mom hugging her kids.",07/23/23 05:38,eelii

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I love powdery scents. Amour is a very special one. It’s difficult to think of a powdery scent that demonstrates restraint, but that’s exactly part of Amour’s beauty. Nothing about it is overdone. I absolutely love it. Kenzo perfumes are designed and constructed to highlight some unusual choices, each appearing and carrying different parts of the journey. The vanilla is not typical because it is more like a flower scent than flavoring vanilla. I also find a touch of anise in the drydown that is gorgeous with the powderiness. The longevity is 10-12 hours, with armlength sillage, but if oversprayed, this would easily fill a couple of rooms. To me Kenzo perfumes are masterfully blended, brilliant, and unique. Amour is truly love. It’s not for everyone, but I wear it for myself. The final stage of Amour’s journey on me is a transparent, fresh vanilla note alone that lasts more than an hour. Just gorgeous.",05/02/23 05:57,SweetJhane

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"One of my only fragrances that will follow me or announce me. This one usually goes one spray under my shirt and one shared between my inner elbows. Mix island flowers and vanilla with fluffy jasmine rice and push it outwards with a cloud of super fluffy white musk, you can almost taste the powder as if someone actually puffed baby powder into the air! Or more like vanilla instant pudding powder :) that’s closer. It’s pretty loud and pushing on people for a good four hours then calms down. Add Hawaiian flowers and Indian incense (not church incense) and you’ve got Amour Indian Holi. Both some of the loudest perfumes in my wardrobe but I don’t care. People notice this one! I wear these spring and early fall.",03/09/23 05:29,Mammajamma
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"A fragrance my mother generously let me borrow from her during most of my high school years.
It is very pretty, soft, sweet. The vanilla in Amour is not like the Guerlain one, for example; it's rather different. Not as deep, not as vanillic, if you will, but lovely nevertheless - lighter, more floral, lactonic. Frangipani and other flowers are not overbearing, yet they bring this sensual exotic touch to the composition, perhaps along with some very subtle incense. No rough edges and no play-dough, at least to my nose. There's nothing fresh about it either, yet it's not a heavy perfume and I wore it in all seasons. Got me many compliments, too.

Beautiful, soft and feminine, with an enveloping, milky sweetness. In my opinion, a potential modern classic that will stand the test of time (if reformulations don't distort it too much, that is).

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,In my opinion Amour is a warm & cozy scent. It’s a light scent than I find is best worn for home but it can also wear in a office since it’s not cloying. I enjoy this scent a lot and I will wear this indoors during the cold weather.,02/23/23 10:07,Peaches&Cream
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,I wasn't a huge fan of it at first but my girlfriend wears it a lot and it has grown on me immensely. I find myself wanting to smell it constantly due to that link.,02/14/23 10:21,Yisslvr
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Lovely, demure, feminine, intimate... I imagine it to be a fragrance that could be worn by a woman during the Regency period.",02/08/23 19:08,Maurizia4
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Soft, sweet, creamy vanilla scent. This is very similar to Dior Hypnotic Poison which I also have & love. But Kenzo Amour is creamier, softer & more pleasant so I love it more. When I tested its longevity on an unworn shirt, the scent last 3 days!",02/03/23 17:27,goldearth
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Before last year, Kenzo was a fragrance house I did not have too much experience with. Since Amour is always so well-loved, and since I began craving comforting fragrances more and more during the pandemic, I decided to try this one first. It is a lovely soft, creamy vanilla with a correspondingly soft musky skin scent on me after a few hours. At first it does project more and it has more of the floral aspects of vanilla. I like both of the phases but drydown is what keeps me coming back. It is simple and also enchanting, which in my opinion love (amour) should be. This is a scent that feels like home. It isn't the most dynamic or ""interesting"" scent I have in my collection, but by god it is one of the best for doing what fragrance should--making you feel something.",02/01/23 13:37,silverlocusts
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"God, this really is so comforting. Instant blast of vanilla and rice pudding, creamy and warm, with prominent cherry blossom. As it dries down, it also becomes a bit more powdery with the heliotrope. A firm top 5 all time favourite of mine. The vanilla creaminess remains throughout the entire wear on my skin. The longevity is very good, 8 hours easily, while projection starts moderate and more intimate after a few hours. Not an overwhelming scent, nor is it that sweet. It’s just beautiful, a cuddle in a bottle.

When I first got this bottle, I couldn’t smell anything after spraying it. I sprayed it a few times and let it sit and now I can finally enjoy this perfume. Just putting this here incase anyone else has the same issue, don’t worry, just let it sit for a bit!

PS: I already bought a backup bottle, that’s how much I love it

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,This truly does smell like playdoh! Not how I want to smell. Very strange fragrance.,01/11/23 15:42,Mrs.Caves
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This smells exactly like play-doh to me which isn't necessarily bad but just not quite what I want to smell like as a young woman. Just a bit too juvenile, like a kindergarten classroom.",01/09/23 13:21,avery_68
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Joining the chorus of loves on this one! Many reviewers below have already said exactly what I would say about this fragrance. For me, this one is easy to love on day 1! I agree with all comments with words like ""comforting"", ""cozy"", etc. Yes to makeup, lipstick and play-doh, too.

On me I smell paperwhite narcissus right on top, which I assume is the frangipani coming through. Paperwhites are gorgeous but if you've ever been in a room with a whole bunch of them blooming at Christmastime, it can be overwhelming. Kenzo Amour doesn't get overwhelming to me, so don't let that description scare you - it's very controlled. This morning I did 5 full sprays and the scent is perfectly within bounds. It lasts pretty well on me, but yesterday I reapplied twice to keep it going.

Something I especially love is how perfect this is for everyday wear. I don't feel like I'm wasting it for a stay-at-home Sunday doing chores - it's just right and not too ""much"". This can be every day, day or night, in or out, wherever you go. The bottle is really cool, and right in line with feeling like you can enjoy it absolutely anytime.

I get the comparisons to Hypnotic Poison too. That one didn't do it for me, but Kenzo Amour totally does. If you like warm, lipsticky, vanilla notes, I highly recommend checking it out! If you are more in the clean / fresh / floral / aquatic camp, this really might not be your thing. I'm sure this one is not for everyone. But you never know!",01/08/23 07:40,barbiegirl
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,Reminds me of how I secretly and curiously rummaged in mom's make-up bag as a child. THE lipstick scent! Cuddly vanilla musk.,01/07/23 09:15,Youlerie
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I have tried this on a few occasions and had previously read it merely as a light vanilla. Somehow only now, opening a fresh bottle, I get the rich almondy vibes. It does dry down into a drier powdery scent, somewhat reminiscent of Flower, but remains sweeter. It's comforting and delicious and very daytime appropriate. Almost bathtime cosy but not boring or totally sexless. Perhaps Amour is the correct name, it's appealing in the way of a long-time partner. Like something you get used to and could even mistakenly take for granted until she's away for the weekend and you constantly miss how her hair smells or something. It's a wholesome scent. Like I'm not completely sure if it smells good or if it just smells good to me because I'm gratefully in love.",01/03/23 22:26,hexed
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Had to buy …. At the airport about to fly to Finland I had a little spray of this in the duty free. It’s a creamy light rice and vanilla scent.very comforting. Anyway …. enjoyed a trip to Finland for a day trip to enjoy the magical Lapland experience.unfortunately we got stranded at the airport on the way home unable to fly because of weather conditions.with a family of four and my son who is 8 needless to say we were getting tired and stressed. We had gotten up that morning at 3:30 and had a fun filled whirlwind of a day.eventually we got sent to a hotel at 5 am the next morning to be up again and ready to go for 10. Long trips in coaches,-25 degrees weather and hardly any sleep needless to say we were extremely relieved to finally be in the air on our way home 24 hours later. Anyway what I’m trying to say is that on the plane while drifting in and out of sleep I smelled my wrist and there it was … still there after 24 hours. It now has a place in my heart and will be buying this as it now reminds me of a magical trip to Lapland and making it through a challenging 24 hours to fly home. ♥️",12/30/22 00:01,Alice611
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,Not hyped about this. It’s not bad but just unmemorable. Interesting bottle.,12/27/22 14:11,Andy224
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"stunning! this one is a crowd pleaser for sure as well as an all-rounder. although the scent lends itself really well to colder temperatures, i could see myself wearing this during any season and any occasion. upon first spray i'm immediately getting a blast of yummy vanilla rice pudding (as well as nivea for some reason? lol), all of the actual notes are lost on me even after extended wear. which is fine - i love this perfume for what it is and how cozy it makes me feel. truly the cuddliest of them all.",12/21/22 06:21,kkarina
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I await in anticipation for my newly purchase. Kenzo Amour will arrive tomorow via mail and I'm excited.
I got a taste of amour while visiting a friend. She wears it all the time and she always smells Devine. The thing I enjoy whenever she wears it, is that it's never too much. It's never too sweet or too loud, too hush hush. It's always just right. It's very delicate en powdery. Very innocent and very comforting. I wanted to try it because it makes me feel safe and I would love to carry that feeling around. (Even though I am nowhere near as innocent) I sprayed some in my hoody, my hair and the nape of my neck. All day I was enveloped within a warm powdery hug. I purchased a bottle online right then and there (2 more bottles for my friend too because she likes to stack up). I also blind purchased a bottle of kenzo jungle l'elephant. I am looking forward to that one let me tell you!",12/05/22 01:30,miewtje
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Damn, this juice is extraordinary! Just after the first spray, you wonder what is happening, is she there? A waterfall of rice water outpours between two cherry trees in full bloom and she manifests from the essence of the burning incense slowly revealing her soul.
You ceremoniously roll tea leaves on blonde wood plaques and the cherry tree responds by releasing its blossoms to rain upon you in a comforting embrace.
Sweetness touches your lips and you now feel her, you are transported to your mother's breast, and infinite love. A cacoon of powdery acceptance shrouds you as you reach the precipice of realization.
You arrive as a child with all the knowledge of the past. What will you do now? Which bearing will you choose? Forever acceptance or confidence in the knowledge? Take her hand and push forth!",12/03/22 09:49,hausofdarlingperfumier
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I don't get the similarities with Hypnotic Poison which is woodsy root beer. Amour is more heliotrope powdery flowers with powdery sandalwood (Thanaka), vanilla and musk. It almost reminds me more of a more powdery Allure type with less rose and vetiver.",11/16/22 11:32,cats_eye
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Секси и екзотичен. Уникален! Определено ""любов"" от първото впръскване 😍",11/15/22 11:58,Krem4e363
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is lovely soft intimate scent. My skin lends well to musk and powder so this perfume smells as it's supposed to on me. The initial spray was a little astringent and I'm not sure why because the dry down is lovely. I get the vanilla and the powder from the rice with a delicate slight floral scent. Together it's not too sweet and reminds me a little of rice crispie squares without the marshmallow. Definitely a comforting gourmand oriental scent.

Edit: I've come back to say that this fragrance has really grown on me. It is so delicately comforting. The milky and dusty rice pudding notes, delicate tea and floral, with the vanilla is just beautiful and perfectly balanced so it isn't too sweet. Soft and warming. Just love it. Has become a favourite!",10/23/22 14:30,Bebeck
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I loved this. Truly, I did.
But something changed.
My perception began to differ once I noticed a certain element of it that caused a curl to the corner of my nostril.
It has a tart, harsh, tangy wood note, or a floral note, or maybe the musk, that just doesn't harmonize. It sits, jagged edged and it tinges the overall tone. It almost seems to be there to soften the sweetness, reel it in, but instead it makes the scent more sickly.
Since I noticed it, I find the scent somewhat sickening.
Though beneath that I can see what I once loved, I can't delve deep enough to eradicate what sits above. It's just too much for me to handle.
It's a real shame. Because I don't know if I can bring myself to part with my bottles of this, but I think it's about time... I must.... maybe... part ways with my Kenzo Amour.

What went wrong?

Seeing recent reviews - has this been changed dramatically? People who smell NO VANILLA here, people who smell RASPBERRY? Was it reformulated beyond recognition in the past couple of years? I'm curious to find out.",09/25/22 05:33,chimidoro
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I have been wearing this scent as my day time go to for years. It is so creamy and light. I find the rice water smell very appealing. It's comforting and familiar - like curling up in a cozy blanket on an overcast day with a chai latte and my favorite book. Someone else described it as warm rice pudding and I agree, but with a powdery, floral note. The sillage is good, very personal...not overwhelming. Great office scent.
It does not disappoint, so I will continue to wear it consistently. I hope that I can continue to find it because I love it!",09/23/22 12:29,roseNbloom

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I have both a vintage and reformulated version of Amour, and though the current version is nice, something in it (probably the musk) causes nose fatigue after a few hours. The pre-reformulated version is much smoother, well-balanced, and longer lasting and the incense note is just divine. Both versions are a warm and comforting hug, but if you love this fragrance and you can get your hands on a vintage version for a reasonable price, it's totally worth the investment.",09/19/22 23:27,singlehandedbeauty
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I love it so much! It's my cozy, relaxing, happy, home-like and soothing fragrance. I wear it to bed, for having nice time with my family and friends, reading and watching movies alone... So good and yummi !",09/07/22 16:23,Croatian.Girl
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is a beautiful, rich, multi-layered and very long-lasting perfume. It smells cozy, warm and sweet (not sugary sweet but sweet like a beautiful flower). I only wish it didn't have the musky note, but that's just a personal preference as I dislike musk in general. The pretty, artistic bottle and the name match the perfume very well :-)
Edit: I have been wearing Kenzo Amour for a few days now, and the muskiness is overwhelmingly strong to the point that I don't enjoy this perfume any more.",09/04/22 01:15,celestial
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I love this perfume because it conjures up nostalgic memories for me, but because I used to wear it often (I had a mini bottle that sadly the cap broke and all the perfume evaporated out) but because, quite simply, it’s Bali in a bottle. I lived in Indonesia for almost 8 years so my family used to travel to Bali often, and I can tell you that the rice, the frangipani flowers, the tea, the incense all depict Bali perfectly. If I didn’t know, someone could tell me this perfume was called Bali Dream and I would believe them lol. I must get my hands on another bottle ❤️",08/30/22 21:12,Beckylynn8881
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Oh, Kenzo Amour...

I remember getting a sample at our local perfumery. Wore it religiously while I was dating my first boyfriend. It was 2010 and everything seemed so perfect...
Well... the reformulation of Amour broke my heart as hard as that boy did.

Rice, vanilla, gentle notes of flowers and musk make it soft and inviting while incense gives that sensual note. The name Amour fits perfectly.

Projection, sillage and longevity are moderate. You can wear it anytime no matter the season but I usually reach for it during summer days.
I usually don't overspray my fragrances but I do it with this one as I feel it's very light. So far nobody complained so my impression is that it's likeable and inoffensive.

It's still a beautiful fragrance that attracts compliments but to me, it feels diluted compared to what it was years ago. Just like Hypnotic Poison EDP has its diluted EDT version.
Speaking of... If you like Hypnotic Poison edt, Juliette Has a Gun Mmmm..., Profumum Roma Confetto etc. then it's highly possible that you'll love this one.",08/30/22 13:43,TihanaB
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Very sweet and vanilla, but the rice note gives it a different touch. I agree it’s more for winter times, it’s a warm, modest perfume. This is what I like about (most) Kenzo fragrances, they are refined and stand out, without being loud or weird.",08/15/22 07:06,Milena94
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Sort of resembles La Rive Sweet Hope.
In my nose. La Rive smells cold. Kenzo Amour smells warm.
Despite Kenzo is 4x pricier than La Rive (in my country), the longevity is the same.
I hate the first 15 minutes scent. Smells like car perfume.
Afterwards, ok.",08/04/22 00:14,linoleum
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"i mostly get cherry blossom and a little bit of raspberry. floral & nice. i didn't get the rice, but i smelled this without looking at the notes so I also wasn't expecting it at all.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Even cupped in my hands I can barely smell this - sort of very lightly reminiscent of a fresh clean diaper straight out of the package. That sort of faint vanilla + plastic.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"There is something maternal about this fragrance. I could see this as being someones signature during pregnancy or even through the early years of their child's life. It ticks all the boxes as it's both milky and baby powdery so I imagine it blending in seamlessly. Although there is something strange in this that gives off a Play-Doh note. For me this is a deal breaker which ultimately stops me from getting into the fragrance entirely. While it may not be for me, I can't deny it's mark as a pillar within the fragrance world.

It's really nice for an easy grab summer fragrance. It lacks depth but it's gentle, comforting and just pleasant.",06/28/22 22:42,ilaria903
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is a such a comforting, pleasant, and slightly musky-sweet perfume. A soft, lactonic cloud of milky vanilla leaving a fleeting, misty trail of steamed rice. It sits quite close to the skin. I know this is meant for colder weather but it is fine in the heat as it is neither cloying nor too sweet. I just wish this fragrance lasted longer. I stop smelling this after 4 hours; only very faintly at my wrists. Wish I could get my hands on one of the older bottles as I've heard they last much longer but they are barely available :( Nice scent otherwise and I like wearing it everywhere- running errands, shopping at the mall, going out with friends and family, and I even like spraying it before bedtime. If anyone has any recommendations on making this last longer without altering the composition please let me know! 😩",06/28/22 14:54,Perfume_Lover99
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This feels like a fragrance you create memories with. Maybe your mother wore this when you grew up and therefore it's a very nostagic and comforting scent, or maybe it reminds you of that backpacking trip to Asia you did after college. I can't decide how I personally feel about it and if I want to actually wear it. I feel comforted by it, but I guess I wanted it to be a bit more gourmand leaning and more exciting. But it's such a beautiful and timeless scent. I guess what I'll do is to save this for the colder weather and pair it with Bath & body works ""Snowflakes & Cashmere"" (the tea note in this one matches perfectly with Amour). If I don't love it then I'll gift it to my mother.


Edit: I gave this to my grandma. On her it smells amazing. On me it just lacks that little extra sweetness that I crave.",06/23/22 01:05,Sodastream83
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I can see the comparison to Hypnotic Poison. However, Hypnotic Poison is more creamier and sweeter. Kenzo Amour is more of a musky close to the skin scent with a dash of vanilla, but not sweet. It's not my fave blind buy, but I'm not quite disappointed that I purchased it. Since it reminds me so much of Hypnotic Poison EDT, Kenzo Amour will be the PERFECT layering. So, it has its purpose in my growing wonderful collection!",06/22/22 06:44,LizDee007
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"When my wife showed me this fragrance, I fell in love with it. It's a fragrance she wore during the last couple of years and I brought her back to it. A good feminine winter scent (although it can be worn by anyone like I always say about fragrances) which is very soothing, relaxing, calming yet super sexy. A perfect counterpart to me wearing Tobacco Vanille, the pair works exceptionnally well together and makes us always smell like the sexiest couple in the world.",06/15/22 13:18,SprayLove
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"A perfect blend of citrus, fruits and sweetness. There is caramel, raspberry and enjoyable vibes of pretty, relaxing, soothing and enjoyable fragrance. Nostalgic and aldehydic vibe of it is truly mood uplifting and delightful. My boyfriend is mad for this fragrance. Whenever I wear it and we meet, he gets wild and falls for me all over again. This is what he always mentions. Love this superb fragrance that offers a gorgeous opening, gourmand heart and flowery dry-down. There are soft rose petals that are blended beautifully with raspberry while remaining natural. Longevity is good enough with the great silage. A perfect fragrance for the spring and summer however, I love to wear this one in winter as well. Cheerful! Delightful! Love it!",06/02/22 04:00,AriaLennon

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"it's a very soft vanilla perfume. but at the same time a little heavy as well (somehow). I think I'd call it ""intense"". very pleasing and a very intense creamy/powdery/vanilla perfume in my opinion. not sure if it's suitable for summer.",04/25/22 10:38,himeboshi
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"When I first smelled this on paper I thought I was going to love it more than I do. On paper it is lovely. On my skin it is tempermental, sometimes beautiful,sometimes nauseating.
When it works it is creamy/powdery, lightly sweet and a little starchy. It smells a bit like a rice pudding. Sometimes fluffy and powdery and at others heavy and creamy, the florals are powdery throughout. On my skin the opening has a very strong alcohol blast that takes a few minutes to disipate enough to enjoy the fragrance. It does disappear completely, thankfully. I find Amour doesn't work for me when it is worn too heavily or when worn in any heat. I can only wear this in winter and very lightly, one or two sprays) or it becomes cloying and rancid, reminiscent of spoiled milk.

I find the comparison the Hypnotic Poison subtle, they are in the same family of fragrances and there are some similarities. Both are powdery and sweet with a noticeable floral component, but they are each their own distinct scent. I much prefer HP because it performs much better on my skin and it's beautiful everytime I wear it. I can't say the same for Amour.

The performance is pretty good. It lasts for about 6 hours, but it only projects for a couple of hours. I find it projects a lot longer if it's sprayed a little heavier, but I can't stand how it smells when I apply more than a couple sprays. Because of that I wear this when I want a fairly light skin scent.

I find a couple of the flankers far more wearable and versatile than Amour. I get much more wear and enjoyment from Amour Le Parfum (gold bottle) and the Indian Holi flanker (red bottle). They both have the great parts of Amour without the problems and also their own little twist.

I have both the current fushia bottle and the original orange bottle. I don't smell any difference between the two and the performance is the same. I came across the orange bottle and picked it up hoping it would perform better on my skin than the more current, but they behave exactly the same for me.",04/25/22 07:01,takema
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,I've had this for about a day and already know this is going to be a favorite for bedtime! It really is like being wrapped in a fluffy warm blanket drinking milk. Such a soft fluffy feminine scent. Super happy I finally decided to give this a try.,03/27/22 16:40,WifeyPink
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"The new 50ml bottle is fuschia, not white, so at least you can tell if you have a new or old bottle….
Not sure how I feel about this, it takes a few minutes for the scent to develop on the skin, and then it is warm, powdery and yes, like slightly milky rice.
The florals are very soft and all just blend together.
And the incense is only a hint too.
This smells nothing like Amour parfum in the gold bottle, which I have, and which is stronger by a mile and has lots more incense and depth. But they have a similarity.I’d wear this during the day and top up with the parfum on a night and they’d compliment each other.

Edit: I just tested positive for covid an hour after writing this, and have now just about lost my smell altogether (2 hours since writing this), so I’m not sure how accurate this is, I’ll update if my smell comes back…!

Update. I think my smell is now actually better than before. I can smell aromachemicals I couldn’t smell before, very strange. Anyway, this is lovely, and dries with a lovely nuttiness, a bit woody too. Is AMAZING layered on top of Valentino Donna Noir (a happy accident!).",03/14/22 11:30,*loves_shoes*
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Very cozy, cuddly sent. Warm, sweet and motherly. It has a creamy, milk vibe, feels similar to when I just took a shower with one of those fragranced creamy nourishing Dove moisturizing gels, yet it's powdery at the same time. After it dries down, the flowers start to blossom a bit, which gives it just a touch of greenness because they're quite subdued. And yes, it does have some of the Hypnotic Poison DNA. Projection and lasting power are not that great, so this is ideal if you want to spray something uber cozy and comforting before bed, because it won't be too strong, and will evaporate by the time you have to get up and spray something new for the day. Excellent bedtime scent, or when you're wrapped up in a blankie keeping warm.",03/08/22 20:36,Rober7a

I do get a playdoh and then a rice pudding type of scent from this but I love that. This is a great mom fragrance as my daughter really loves this on me. Sadly, the performance was awful on me. I was lucky to get 1.5 hours out of it. I won't be purchasing a full bottle, plus the bottle is ugly, but I have a travel spray and I'll definitely use it

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Kenzo Amour has long been on my list to smell, and I think it is remarkable that it took me this long! I mostly get creamy vanilla and smooth musk with a hint of incense and flowers. It is light, but it has some personality to it. I like JHAG Vanilla Vibes but it feels at once too aggressive and a little bland, somehow, but the blend on Amour is reminiscent of Vanilla Vibes with a little more thoughtfulness put into it. After several hours it fades to a nice skin scent for me, like I've just had a vanilla-scented bubble bath. Amour isn't life changing, but it is very pretty and comforting. I could see it being a lovely bedtime scent. I don't get even a whiff of almond though, so it is nothing like Hypnotic Poison for me. All musk and vanilla with some background actors, none of whom are the least bit nutty.",01/19/22 10:47,pleasuretoburn
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is so freaking beautiful. It is another powdery, lactonic, almond-y fragrance but it’s so worth having because it’s also fresh and beautifully clean. It creates such lovely cloud around you. I smells the rice like a rice water and tea which create a zen feeling. The heliotrope, vanilla, and musk create a lightly, creamy, gentle sweetness. This is sooooo comforting and innocent like smelling an adorable babies head in the best way. I get the frangipani adding to the exotic zen appeal. That particular flower reminds me of tropical vacations. I can’t imagine this fragrance offending anyone.",01/09/22 14:50,Rosemary14
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"A blind buy based on the reviews here! I though this would be right up my street and I was right...kinda...
First spray is really pokey astringent alcohol. Quite off-putting but soon dies down. Then there are florals, tea, and warmth and sweetness. Frangipani creaminess with a touch of spice that is absolutely wonderful. Then it's gone. An hour later I'm left with a musky vanilla that isn't unpleasant but is not as beautiful as the middle section with an occasional waft of almost smoky leather - a very 'dry' dry down. So fleeting. It's a frequent re-sprayer just to capture the loveliness of that middle. A keeper but not the absolute belter I'd hoped.

UPDATE 12/1/22 - Ok so I was wrong. I have reached for nothing else in the 11 days since I wrote the review above :) it's such a happy, warm, everyday beautiful-but-not-generic scent. It lasts much better on clothes and hair. A gentle hug. Layered upon itself the sweet almondy frangipani does remain. I love it.",01/04/22 02:43,lillybethholmes
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I feel like this is practically a different scent on me! The florals overwhelm any tea or rice. The florals smell quite dry and mature to me (I’m 37).

There is a soft, warm, creamy undercurrent, but I can’t identify it as either tea or rice and it’s completely overtaken by the florals.

I’m not much of a fan of florals, so this is a hard no for me.",01/03/22 19:26,rapscallion
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is a blind buy for me. I initially thought it was going to be much sweeter but on my skin it almost smells like freshly done laundry. It’s warm, it’s creamy and comforting. The rice note is quite prominent. Reminds me of a motherly hug. A bit mature IMO.",12/15/21 13:58,Oliviechinese
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is soooo sooo good! Minimalist smooth vanilla with incense and rice. Gourmand but bot edible, always stylish yet comforting. Never sickly sweet. Always relevant. I have a bottle from ca 2011 that hasn’t turned, this perfume holds up well. It lasts until the next morning with good sillage.

Look for the formula where the different sizes had different colors, now they are all red. If you see a second hand white or orange bottle get it! Later formulas can still be good though, but may not be as long lasting.",11/26/21 12:50,Scentedalterego
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is a lovely and delicate frag! The more I wear it, the more familiar and addictive it becomes.
The opening has the tea note which seems a bit sharp for a moment, then it mellows out and I get the rice, frangipani, vanilla and heliotrope. The heliotrope is really lovely in this fragrance and blends beautifully with the other notes. This is definitely powdery and comforting. I find myself reaching for it for various times of the day, it makes me feel clean and feminine and I love this after a shower.
Definitely full bottle worthy and a lovely addition to my collection. 8.5/10 😘😍",11/19/21 21:01,Christinageor10
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I have to say, I am a bit disappointed with that one. It was kind of a blind buy, I remember smelling it in the shop as a teenager when it was just released and being so in love with it, I wanted to have it and I don't remember exactly why but I never got it, I did not have the money at that time and my parents did not want to buy it for me probably.

Anyway, fast forward 15 years, I had forgotten about it but came accross a good sale and the memories of this scent came rushing back.
I bought it without a second thought and it smells nice I am not going to lie, very cosy and soft but too soft for my taste I think, not ""parfumey"" enough, it smells like a good body lotion, it does not project much, it's very close to the skin and I got bored of it so quickly.
As for the notes I get a very powdery flowery scent first, the dry down is mostly vanilla and incense on my skin.",11/17/21 10:24,SophieGlnd
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This fragrance is somewhat hard to describe; it definitely is powdery, but it is executed in a way that makes it warm and rather cuddlesome. It has an almost lactonic feel to it, despite having no notes that directly correspond to creaminess. The overall effect is less of a ""perfume"" type vibe and more of a freshly washed, sweet smelling cuddlesome aura or cloud. It's a perfect ""not a perfume"" perfume. And, it's great for close encounters where you don't want to bowl someone over with a powerhouse scent.",11/12/21 12:27,ShannonIk
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,This is a great scent for when you dont want to be loud and obnoxious with your fragrance. I think it smells VERY similar to hypnotic poison but its better because there is more vanilla and no almond!,11/12/21 11:50,Samanthabdel
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Looking at the votes for notes on this fragrance makes me wonder if people don't know what heliotrope smells like. To me its the most dominant/noticeable note in the fragrance -- a good thing in my opinion. I picked this up because it was recommended as a chai tea fragrance. It does have a little of the spicy laconic vibe of chai tea, while not being at all gourmand. In any case its very comforting and I look forward to wearing it as a bedtime scent.",11/04/21 19:02,PKSMKE
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,This smells like a soapy more lotiony version of hypnotic poison. It literally smells like lotion. I like it. I can't really detect specific notes.. maybe the Incense. It kind of resembles baby wipes. But it's really pleasant and smooth. Kind of weak though.,10/29/21 20:07,MaxieF
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Thé bottle of this perfume is unique and the perfume is quite affordable . However , this perfume is very much a skin scent on me , the silliage is non existant . It lasts maybe 3 hours on me . The smell is soft and creamy but reminds me of gone off milk sort of with flowers mixed in , I don’t particularly plan to repurchase . The vibe of it reminds me of hypnotic poison",10/16/21 04:42,Atilola
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,Its cold here and finally I’m wearing Amour again. Its so smooth. Vanilla heavy but not cloying or sweet. Just perfectly balanced and cozy. I’ll buy this perfume forever.,10/12/21 06:18,iremis
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I have mixed feelings about Amour. On one hand, I LOVE the scent of this - smooth milky vanilla, steamed rice, and delicate white tea resting atop a light musk. It's everything that I look for in a comforting vanilla-based fragrance and the addition of a rice note was such a pleasant surprise! However, Amour is very light and doesn't last long on me at all, even when I overspray, which is an absolute shame since this is such a beautiful scent. For this reason, I will enjoy my current bottle, but I'll likely not be repurchasing.

I do think this could be great for those looking for a comforting skin scent, or something that could be sprayed before going to bed!",10/06/21 09:29,brandiallyn
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I'll be honest - I got my hopes up on this fragrance. As a vanilla lover, specifically Warm Vanilla Sugar by BBW, I hoped this would be a much needed upgrade for me. I've been starved for balanced rice and vanilla notes, which made me overlook the /glaringly/ obvious floral situation. I can attest that this is a long lasting scent with moderate projection. However, this is not a gourmand vanilla scent - at least not on my skin. In fact, this transformed into a totally floral, touch of ""sweet pea,"" and barely vanilla fragrance the moment it touched the air. I'll be mourning what could have been for a while...",09/25/21 21:56,tyeangelina
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Amour is too ethereal for my fragrance-eating skin. I get the Hypnotic Poison comparisons, but the sillage is much weaker. It actually reminds me of a bit of Love's True Bluish Light by Ava Luxe, as they both share similar gourmand qualities along with a hint of paper and ink. But where LTBL is warm and cozy, Amour has a dustiness that I can't quite put my finger on.",09/24/21 13:05,MabelSyrup

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Soft, vanillic, powdery, lactonic. Does resemble Hypnotic Poison but without the play doh. A hint of lovely cherry blossoms, it is all about the rice and vanilla. There is only a slight trail of incense, just to keep things more interesting. As powdery vanillas are easy to become boring and mainstream. One of my old time favourites.",09/05/21 14:58,bel.gravia

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is beautiful. Warm, inviting, femine, motherly. Like a hug. The rice note stands out and makes it so interesting. Unfortunately, it doesn't project on me and stays really close to the skin.",08/24/21 21:04,Mademoisellejaimie
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Cozy, milky, almond vanilla. The rice notes give it a toasty ness. Slight hint of cherry. This is similar to Dior hypnotic poison, but is more wearable on me. HP is a thicker, more heady scent. HP has more sex appeal, while amour is suitable for day to night.

Recently picked up Armani Terra di gioia, and find the drydown reminiscent of amour. However, the Armani is more of a skin scent, that just radiates with your body heat. It just melts into my skin, wear amour always feels like it’s just sitting on top. Armani is more velvety and fresh, and less powdery and creamy than amour. There’s an almost suede like quality, making the Armani a great sensual scent appropriate for the summer. I’ll be keeping both, and reserving amour for the winter time.",08/17/21 20:47,loliirain
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Powdery nutty vanilla. It's a soft, warm scent. Kind of romantic. To me, it smells nearly identical to Hypnotic Poison. I get bitter almond which isn't in the notes and I even get a bit of the ""root beer"" that's so strong in HP. I find it a weaker, watered-down version of Hypnotic Poison... Or to put a positive spin on it, this is a less ""in-your-face"" version. Projection and longevity are both poor compared to HP.",07/24/21 00:08,clairesque
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Wow, this is beautiful, creamy, powdery, sweet, soft, and elegant.
I do see why people compare it to hypnotic poison, they are different perfumes but they have a similar vibe.
They are both powdery, creamy, and sweet. Kenzo amour is a bit more floral and soft than hypnotic.",07/19/21 02:24,fairymeist
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I just received a 10ml decant of this, and the smell immediately took me back to my 20s. I couldn't figure it out at first, but soon I made the connection...this smells identical to Warm Vanilla Sugar from Bath and Body Works. And I mean IDENTICAL. I'm going to go into my local BBW to confirm this, but I know I'm right because back in the day, I wore that scent like it was going out of style. I'm glad I only have a small decant, because I would've been pissed if I had blind bought a full size of this. If you like this fragrance, just save your money and go to BBW. You can get a full size each of the Warm Vanilla Sugar fragrance mist, shower gel, and lotion for less than what you'd pay for a full size of Kenzo Amour. Trust me, you'd smell just the same.",07/17/21 09:24,jstevens94
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Kenzo amour is a gourmand floral fragrance that has a characteristic smell reminiscent of a rice pudding dessert with high doses of vanilla, but a not heavy but rather creamy vanilla that becomes a second skin.
This beautiful fragrance on its opening reminds a little of the Hypnotic poison edt without the coconut note and also a little of the Juliet has a gun Mmmm without the raspberry notes, I make this comparison for those who do not know the fragrances know that they will find, but this is only the opening, after 10 or 15 minutes of atomized this delicious burst goes down quickly and mutates into a more measured fragrance, dominated mainly by frangipani flower and sprinkled with cherry blossom, everything is accompanied by that exquisite note of rice that together with the vanilla and a soothing note of tea give it that creamy lactonic and slightly powdery touch that may remind you of the aforementioned dessert fresh from the oven and set on a table with a bouquet of frangipani flowers that perfume the room.
This fragrance has against in my opinion a very intimate projection close to the skin and although I have already tried with several sprays it lasts about 4 to 5 hours feeling very close to the skin as if giving it a satin veil, in clothes it has much longer duration.",06/24/21 20:17,Abry_81
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"kenzo Amour es de mis fragancias favoritas para días de otoño/invierno, cuando la agoto la vuelvo a repetir.

Usar este perfume me recrea la imagen de una tarde soleada pero fresca, al lado del fuego de un hogar y comiendo un arroz con leche.",06/18/21 16:50,Marian_11
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,Here lately I’ve been drawn to scents that have Frangipani in it. This one is no exception. I do sort of get the hypnotic poison vibe but more so Dior poison girl. Also reminds me of a much stronger Fancy Love by Jessica Simpson. It also puts me in the mind of Cassili by Parfums De Marly. Anyways I love it and the dry down is so creamy and sweet but not cloying.,06/08/21 20:28,Tekiya08
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Kenzo Amour is a good alternative if you are looking for a less expensive version of The Different Company's Pure Eve. Amour has the same sweet, creamy floral/vanilla notes at a fraction of the cost. Good sillage and longevity, too. It is a very feminine scent and it turns a bit powdery over time. I think it strikes a good balance between the floral, sweet, and musky notes. It's probably better suited for winter, fall, or a crisp spring day - that's when I wear mine. It might be a bit too much for summer.",06/03/21 21:42,tinadee
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"VERY interesting. I cannot say this is entirely like Hypnotic Poison, Forbidden Police or Sweet Hope (La Rive) aka the playdoh almond gang, but there is that nutty intense playdoh element here, reminiscent of all these. While I was wearing it today its projection in the wind made me feel as if I was wearing a nutty version of Pour Femme because I am also sensing something slightly bright and tart here, just like in Pour Femme,alot softer here of course and it must be the cherry blossom with the frangipani mimicking the tartness of mandarin/raspberry of the Pour Femme. I look them up and see their common notes are heliotrope, vanilla, and lets say woody notes there, sandalwood here. This doesnt come off powdery on me at all, but sweet/sour and nutty, with the softer Pour Femme element more prominent after 30 mins of wear. When I first spray this, I dont expect it to develop any tartness because the opening is so rounded, nutty and milky, but its drydown is pink/sweet/sour in my mind, quite like Pour Femme.

This is more sophisticated imo than Hypnotic Poison or Forbidden, because the playdoh element is not straight up almond overload. Im a crazy almond lover so the perfumes I just mentioned are my loves and winners in the almond game, but Kenzo Amour takes a different route. Instead here I detect something fresh, slightly herbal, the white tea perhaps, which I love. The incense is the one component of this beautiful nutty addicting scent similar to that of Alien Essence Absolue, which is hard to find nowadays and also contains incense - so my nose didnt trick me when I made that connection. Esp in the opening the nutty scent is intense yet soft. Alien Absolute with its orris root, cashmere and myrrh is alot heavier than this, but the jasmine there gives an intense minty/herbal vibe. I get something similar from Kenzo Amour, not minty, but fresh due to the tea. The tea note here tho is only present in the opening. I suspect the playdoh vibe stems from the combination of rice, vanilla, heliotrope and the incense, because like I said Essence Absolue smells so nutty to me and it has incense.
The heliotrope (and frangipani/cherry blossom) here must be the reason Im getting these Pour Femme vibes at the drydown, but when I stick my nose to my skin, I'm always smelling this alluring nutty scent even after 1 hour. Overall it's unique and beautiful and I consider it a different composition than Hypnotic Poison, a grown-up, less sugary sister to Pour Femme and a more youthful, pink, fresh cousin of Essence Absolue due to the intense incense which I love! Lasting power is not phenomenal but I love its different stages from opening to drydown and dont mind reapplying. Its opening and first 30 mins are my favorite because theyre milky and nutty.",05/19/21 21:08,sassa7
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I've been curious how different/similar this was to Dior Hypnotic Poison, as I like the idea of HP more than the reality of it. Where Dior is screechy and synthetic with the Play-Doh undertone, Amour is soft and lightly powdery, without the Play-Doh association. I think this is powdery enough to irk people that don’t like powdery, so that’s the trade off. I think it’s more wearable/less of a statement than Dior HP, bc it’s softer and sits closer to the skin.",05/19/21 16:56,MakeupNeverSleeps
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"i've been wanting to try this one for so long. it starts with a lot of vanilla and heliotrope with a hint of rice, then shortly after i get the cherry blossom. a little later i get some incense and a fair amount of musk, i think, and i do get a bit of frangipani later but this is primarily a heliotrope/vanilla scent. i find it really soft and comforting.",05/12/21 10:49,mirrorghost
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I am pleasantly surprised by Amour. Based on the reviews I have heard, I pictured it in my mind as an ultra powdery scent (which is not my favourite), but Amour turned out to be smooth, slightly sweet and quite floral (in a fresh green way). I can pick up the vanilla and the tea note, and surprisingly heliotrope is quite prominent to my nose and reminded me of Lancome Poeme (of course they do not smell alike). I checked and indeed both Amour and Poeme are listed as perfumes with prominent Heliotrope note. To me it does not smell like Hypnotic Poison - there is a bit of a greenness and freshness in Amour's powderiness, whereas Hypnotic Poison is much more creamier and almondy.

I am very familiar with rice (cooked and uncooked) but I cannot pick up much of a rice scent in Amour. Overall, I find Amour a good choice for all season (as long as it is not a hot day) and easy reach perfume - non-offensive and pleasant.",05/04/21 09:18,Murmur123123
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"Out of the nozzle, this smells like powdery cherry blossom! Once sprayed, the rice & heliotrope come out strong with a dose of a mango white tea. This is such an airy vanilla fragrance after a while with waves of various tender scents. Close to the skin. Sometimes I don't smell it at all, and I almost applied my entire 3 mL sample today. Maybe I drowned out my own senses, I don't know. I love it though! It makes sense to me why it's called ""Love"". Everything in the composition is quite tender, either physically, or in taste, and incense is usually used in close encounters, so I feel that there is a story both with how it plays out and also with the intended notes incorporated.

At times I get hints of the old Bath and Body Works Toasted Hazelnut. My mom actually has it still as it was mine & buried deep in her...quite full...closet. I found it last year and smelled it then, but that was my last encounter with it. When I was testing this out, it was killing me that I couldn't put my finger on the name of the fragrance from BBW, but I had the color of the bottle in mind and knew it was something ""toasted"" lol or ""roasted"" or something. Started Googling old BBW scents and found vintage ones, and that Toasted Hazelnut was in the same line, and it clicked so hard in my mind that I didn't even find a picture of it but Googled ""Toasted Hazelnut"" and there it was. It was like trying to remember a song based on a few...notes. Oh, wait. Anyway, this is more complex than Toasted Hazelnut and doesn't share much in common, but the combination, or something in both of them, ring similar to me.

Also, there's a compound or something in the beginning that's similar to Chloe Love. I just looked it up and saw ""Rice"" & ""Heliotrope"" are common notes, but I'm not sure if that's it specifically because YSL Parisienne has a bit of that same sharp scent that I'm trying to describe (to my nose). I weirdly enjoy it even though it can at times feel off putting before I go to smell it. Then I'm like hmmm oh yeah :). And then the sharpness takes a back seat and becomes a skin scent that gives off a little bit of a cozy, sweet, balsamic vibe. I like that people described it as rice pudding. Yes, it is that. A bit milky & kind of nutty scent, usually with cinnamon. I do see that incense is a note, so I can see that a bit because of the mellow smokiness beneath the sweet, powdery creaminess that can come off as cinnamony.

Similar to Bvlgari Black, the vanilla-amber-based scent has a tea note, which is something I get wafts of from this. It isn't similar to Bvlgari Black in that way specifically, but in the muskiness that projects off it along with the green notes ""beneath"" the core of the scent...if that makes sense? The combo of everything makes it like a fresh gourmand note. Amour Kenzo is so many things and that's why I love it! I think a green, nutty, vanilla is a good way to describe this scent (but lemme add on another adjective or descriptor making this even more difficult to imagine lol)

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"From the moment I got this one I really liked it. Amour was a blind buy of mine from a few months ago. It’s my signature bedtime chillin at home in the evening scent.

It has a foody, rice pudding smell to it. Sweet and warm, it makes me feel really comfortable and cozy. I don’t detect a lot of florals, soap, or incense. To me this is a unique gourmand. Creamy vanilla and rice are the star players on my skin. There’s a lactonic vibe that I love. I overspray it because it can be over sprayed and not be too overpowering. My boyfriend says I smell like maple syrup wearing it, and I love that. It’s a mood lifter, like cuddling while under a warm blanket. It has a slight play dough vibe to it but not in a bad way.

I straight up don’t like the bottle. The cap is jiggly and awkward, I don’t understand the thought process behind it. But it’s an art piece, and something I learned in art school is that art can be anything that makes you feel something. I feel confused by the bottle but I feel comforted with the juice. So I’ll take it for what it is. The bottle always gives me a funny feeling and the fragrance brings me peace.

I will definitely repurchase and plan to keep this in my bedtime fragrance wardrobe. The fun thing about fragrance is we all interpret them differently. Amour might not be for everyone but it’s definitely a fragrance for me. Cheers 💕",04/23/21 22:34,taylorcake1

Please do not waste your time or money on anything other than the original formulation. I recently purchased the new formulation with high hopes, but was definitely let down. Reformulations usually suck ass and that's a fact. Find yourself the orange, white, or fuchsia bottle where the box actually says ""fuschia edition"". This is the original, classic, sweet, milky, floral, incense scent that is a head turner....reformulation smells like cheap soap.

It’s also good for someone who is looking for a fragrance that’s similar to Confetto by Profumo Roma.

Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"After wearing this a few days, and trying to convince myself I like this perfume, here's what I have to say. I bought this thinking that I would love it, and at times I do, but most of the time, I really don't. It's not a bad perfume at all actually, it's just not for me. In fact, on the days when I like this scent, it is a soft, pretty, slightly mature leaning ""vanilla"" esque perfume that wears close to the skin but seems to radiate with warmth. Imagine the most expensive shower gel you've ever used, something luxurious and foamy and wonderful, and that's what you get on a good day.

However, Kenzoamour at times smells a little too much like laundry detergent, and a specific one I remember using from the mid 2010's that had this great soft-sweet scent I really loved. Also, I realized when wearing this that it reminded me a little too much of the early 2000's, not the good and fun parts, but the tacky parts everyone loves to forget about when reminiscing about that era. I remember that I used to smell this on people a lot, and I think a relative of mine wore this on occasion. It's obviously faded out of popularity, and I think there's a good reason for that. It's kind of dated. It's very powdery in a way that isn't pleasant, and has a weird, off putting ""baby wipes and Glade air freshener"" kind of chemical tinge to it that I don't like. It's not as sweet as a lot of people try to make it out to be either. I don't get any sweet rice pudding at all, which was a bummer for me. It's mainly white tea and musk with a touch of sugar.",04/05/21 12:43,sophiesmystery
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is the queen supreme of sweet rice scents. Amour is mainstream, but with its own uniquity. There’s a reason why this has remained so popular over the years. It’s perfectly balanced almondy vanilla, fruity sweetness, savory rice, and powdery musk. It’s tropical enough to wear in the summer, but has a warmth and spiciness that blooms in the winter as well. Although I may not reach for it often, I will always have it in my collection.",04/02/21 14:32,giakerr

A shame and truly a pity, they completely ruined a masterpiece. The same they did with so many others.",03/31/21 18:03,CateCate
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"I am on the fence about whether I am just OK with or dislike this perfume. Pulls super powdery on me, to the point that it's slightly off putting. Dry down is much better, as the almond and vanilla pulls through. Echoing others, this does become a skin scent but a long lasting one, especially when sprayed on clothing. I tried wearing this to work but I couldn't fall in love with it. Then my husband asked the dreaded ""What are you wearing?"" question when I went in to greet him which did not help my amour with Kenzo Amour.

While many compare this to Dior's HP, I can kind of see the resemblance but not really. I much prefer HP and believe it is a better perfume overall, sorry guys! I do think this and MAC's Creme D'Nude are much closer in scent profile and if you have one you don't need the either. The bottle is beautiful, like an abstract piece of artwork you can display on your coffee table.

It could be a change in my senses, but I'm finding it much more floral in the opening than i found previous and it because the smell of a new (high quality) plastic doll. Also it's silage is a lot smaller. Fortunately I like it still.",03/08/21 08:50,Cmed
Kenzo Amour Kenzo,"This is beautiful powdery fragrance but with added sweet almond and rice which makes it smell more ""airy"", more luxurious.

My complaint is that I'm not sure if it has been reformulated but it is extremely weak, no sillage, a skin scent at best. No whiffs of it unless I spray at least 10 spritzes. Lasting power maybe an hour or so.... either that or my nose is temporarily broken! It happens sometimes but I have been wearing it for 3 days now and am gutted about the strength of it.

Edit: my nose must have been broken, it has definitely stayed on all my clothes and stuck to them like nothing else. once I had a break from it and came back, I noticed its power so its all good :)",03/07/21 15:31,dorotaloveslifexoxo
