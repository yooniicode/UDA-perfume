Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Just gorgeous. Green, floral, powdery, woody. I have both EDP and EDT. I left a review on the EDT and it goes into the nuances of both. Simply stated, this was master perfumery at its best.",01/28/25 17:52,Wanderer75
Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Envy is really beautiful, and the name is perfect, because this fragrance is very green, and you will be envious of all who managed to retain a bottle in good condition; I understand they are rather hard to find now. But I don't feel envious, only glad that my friend Sarah sent me a sample of this to test. On skin it is giving me a distinct promise of spring (so I know it's a liar, but it's a sweet consoling little lie). The pineapple note popped immediately, and then I got the hyacinth and lily-of-the-valley. I trust the other notes will pop up as the fragrance develops; I can already smell the sandalwood, and I can tell that it is very good indeed.

I think Oil Perfumery or one of the other good dupe houses should do an impression of Envy, since it's discontinued now and obviously has many ardent fans. If any dupe-chemists are reading my reviews, get busy, then prepare yourself for an onslaught of gratitude (and perhaps envy from those who didn't think of it first).",02/07/24 10:44,rene.saller

Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci should have never, ever, ever, never, ever stopped making this fragrance. Never. It's one of their best. I held onto my bottle for as long as possible once I discovered this was discontinued.😢🤧",12/19/22 12:50,EmpressVision
Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"When I bought this many years ago, I loved it. I love green fragrances. However, there is something in it that makes me feel nauseous. (Vent Vert has the same affect on me) Hence why I still have a half bottle left of the bottle I bought when it first launched. I dug it out today because whilst wearing my latest green acquisition Frederic Malle's Synthetic Jungle (which I love) I t suddenly hit me that it reminded me of Gucci Envy. I tried on the Gucci and now it is overpowering everything, and I can not smell the Synthetic Jungle as a result. But I would say that if you loved Gucci Envy, try synthetic Jungle, It is lighter fresher, cleaner somehow (Yes it I know it is not an EDP, so hard to compare) I did notice that the Gucci Envy and the Vent Vert both have musk in them, which Synthetic Jungle does not, maybe that is what makes me feel nauseous.",09/13/22 06:35,suecasas
Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I just received this today, an eBay bargain. It is absolutely divine, to me it smells like a richer version of the edt, I’ve only had it on a short time so cannot judge longevity but sillage is impressive so far. So sad that Envy is discontinued, the edt was my signature scent about 15 years ago and I’ve never managed to find anything else quite like it, although my collection has grown significantly during the attempt!!",08/07/19 12:01,Rosariaa
Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"23. september 2015

I have been sorting out my bottles and a gorgeous black bottle of EDP just fell on the floor and an upper corner of it was broken, so devastating. I didn´t spill much of it, but at least while cleaning the bottle i finally had the chance to try this perfume which i owned for a while but never managed to test yet.

This is simply beautiful one, a very strong LOTV, jasmine and hyacint combo in a very good way. The LOTV is not like in DIorissimo or MiuMiu, but the very natural smelling, just like the real flower in the springtime. All the flowers are gorgeous and natural smelling, jasmine as well. I agree with others, who say it has kind of ""metallic"" vibe, but it does not distract me at all. In general the notes here are so well blended, that it is hard to pick more, than those i have mentioned before (well, the bergamot is sooo gorgeous here as well, i yet have to look for another so good smelling bergamot in a composigtion)
Gorgeous smell, i understand all the praises and totally agree!

P.S. I haven´t compared it to the EDT yet",09/23/15 06:37,passionata20

Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I like Envy Me and I wanted to try Envy. Before I found the EDT, I found this. I actually don't like it at all. I have since found the EDT and I LOVE it! I'm not sure why I don't like the EDP, there must be something in it that really doesn't suit...",01/23/15 23:31,lexi.malevolent
Gucci Envy Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I saved up a pretty penny to get myself this when I started working as I fell in love with the scent. Its green, slightly metallic and floral at the same time. Unfortunately, my mum liked it too and I had to surrender my bottle to her. Till today, I still can't find anything that smells like it. Now, the only available version of this scent is the EDT which is also becoming hard to find. :(",12/12/14 23:23,lkha37
Muschio Mineralis Gucci,"Intense personality in a bottle...

This fragrance is a personality! it resembles someone's essence! it's like the scent of Agent 006 ""Alec Trevelyan"", cheeky, masculine, & strong villain. It's musky with olibanum, cumin, and a touch of vanilla to softens the dark side just a little to trick you in order to fall in his web.

This is elegance animalic, def not for everyone. Beautiful in an excellence way.",10/11/25 01:36,Q80
Muschio Mineralis Gucci,"First Impression.
Living next to a Gucci boutique, I’ve had the chance to try nearly every Alchemist’s Garden release since the line debuted in 2019. So when I heard they were launching two musk fragrances, I was excited. This black musk leans darker and more masculine of the two, though I wouldn’t call it musk-dominant.

With nitro musks banned and polycyclics heavily restricted, what we get here is a couple of macro musks ""dirtied"" up with caraway. Personally, I think they’d have been better off leaning on materials like ambrette, civetone, muscone or hyrax — all of which can still be harvested responsibly and legally — to give the composition more character of a true black musk.

As it stands, this fragrance isn’t really musk-centered. Instead, it’s more of a caraway and incense affair, softened by a touch of vanilla and lifted by a faint mineral edge that fades in the drydown. If you’re into smoky incense and cumin-like spice, you may find this appealing. For me, it isn’t bad by any means, but it doesn’t feel purchase-worthy. I’ll keep testing and update accordingly.

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,Smells like the cheapest bar soap on the supermarket shelf. A shame.,11/10/25 06:17,felipebizarria.1
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"While I can smell the creminess, there's like a lid on top of it which smells kind of medicinal/green. After I let it dry down for 30-40 minutes or so is when I could enjoy the creamy floral notes",11/09/25 23:10,badapples
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"It is very, very nice. I think it is very close what I am looking for. I want sweet, but quite fresh, suitable for work, not too mature but not teenager with a celebrity perfume on either. I think it is sweet, better than the newest Gucci gourgeous gardenia intense which is VERY spicy (however my husband prefer that one and that one has enormous sillage as he could smell it from the second floor when I was wearing it down stairs in the kitchen ;D )
This one is much milder and vanish (for my nose, I have learned that just because I can't sense it myself it doesn't mean it is gone) pretty fast, within 2 hours.

I smell vanilla and subtle florals. Suitable for summer, definitely, however I would wear it in winter too because it is also cozy, just very mild.",10/30/25 06:18,The most freebies
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"if only this were more long lasting on my skin, then it would have been my favorite flora",10/28/25 04:38,vsemietaq1
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Oh my, this is delightful. Very powdery and soapy, with a hint of that coconut creaminess that somehow reminds me of an Elseve shampoo? Let me describe it better: an expensive floral lotion? Think of it as an evolved version of Flora Gorgeous Gardenia, that one smells too much like plain fabric softener it gets to a point. It's very pleasant and office safe, a perfect choice for everyday, even for the hottest places. The thing is, I can still get whiffs of it and it's been TWO days since I sprayed it. Two days, considering I showered and it should be impossible to still smell it. Interesting to mention that I smell it when I move around, and that's when I really pick at the berries, juicy berries. It somehow reminds me of the Rituals of Yozakura's body mist, so consider that one as an option to layer with this fragrance. My mum adores Magnolia it as much as I do, you'll sure get tons of compliments with it.",10/24/25 02:46,_chaekoo_
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Very surprising creamy coconut magnolia. I didn’t pick up the coconut at first but after spraying next to 4711 Magnolia (pure floral), this one was a lot more tropical and fruity. I like it",10/20/25 18:47,Erahnie
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Soap. In the opening it's a very pleasant magnolia soap, but its drydown is mature woman soap and I think headache-inducing. Meh...",10/11/25 11:48,Bella B
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"It smells like soap, I don't smell any sweetness there, a sharp scent of flowers and cleanliness. Not a trace of coconut. But it smells good to me, even though it's not my cup of coffee, I like it.",10/09/25 08:09,Višňa
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"There is definitely a red berry element in it, but never smelled dewberry before, so not sure about that. The coconut is there too, but this isn't a tropical fragrance at all. I am not a fond of musk, and luckily, in this one it nicely blends in and does not come to foreground too much even after hours of wear. On clothing it lasts days. Feminine, sweet, floral, neither too elengant nor too simple, suitable both for day and night wear. It is not groundbreakingly exciting, but a nice general fragrance.",10/08/25 06:05,csirip
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I first smelled Gucci’s Gorgeous Magnolia perfume in my dorm room after a roommate's friend sprayed it. From the first smell, I instantly fell in love with it and knew I needed to purchase it. The scent comes off floral, creamy, and powdery with a hint of musk underneath. It is incredibly sweet and feminine. I definitely tend to enjoy it for a night out in the spring and summer months.

Due to this, I find that the perfume lacks a super substantial or complex scent that other perfumes tend to have. However, I personally tend to enjoy airy, feminine scents, so this aspect attracted me rather than turned me off. This perfume tends to last far longer on clothing compared to skin (rarely lasts). I find myself reapplying a lot, which is a little frustrating for the price point. However, this is common for light floral perfumes.

Overall this has become my most repurchased and second favorite perfume that I wear.",09/21/25 15:37,lululuvsperfume
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Bought this for my mum and she liked it! I personally am not a fan of floral perfumes so I have mixed opinions, but I did like this one.

Didn't get any hint of coconut but a mix of florals at first. I realized lily of the valley doesn't fare well with my skin and that was a bit off-putting.

But on my mom the scent bloomed, she is blessed with a skin that amplifies any kind of perfumes and I am not even kidding! She smells divine, like fairy queen in the woods. Overall, a 7 out of 10 from me. I like the airy, powdery quality to it btw.",09/12/25 10:43,Seneya

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I expected a (Southern) Magnolia scent, but I see it's Magnolia alba in here (so ""white champaca"", totally different). It smells like a slightly spicy, creamy white floral blend and a lot of fruit/berry. This perfume is overall sweet and a little powdery. It was interesting for the first second because it was very clean and had a weird fresh clarity to it. Then it turns and there's a quality to this (and a lot of current day formulations) that performs ""off"" to me; it's too candied and hazy on my skin. Pass. Try if you like hazy, sweet soft florals.",09/03/25 19:34,Soli Deo Gloria
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Such a creamy, fluffy beauty. It's so juicy and fresh; I absolutely adore this fragrance. It's definitely my favourite from the line. This scent is lovely; however, it is really weak! There isn't much projection on this fragrance after about an hour, but it's still nice as a skin scent. I like to layer it with Signature by Montblanc :)",09/03/25 02:28,Lord of the game

I think is a safe buy, I also have the pink one, the Gardenia from the Flora line, this one is much better imo.",08/31/25 20:34,shdsh
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I sampled a variety of this line not expecting much, and I was surprised by how much I liked this one. It's fresh and clean, but not in an overly sterile or soapy way. Its definitely a crowd pleaser, very mass appealing and I could see myself safely gifting this to nearly any woman. I think I could see myself wearing this to work, as it has a very office safe quality to it. That being said if you already have a 'office safe, mass appealing floral' perfume, you probably don't need this in your collection.",08/31/25 09:21,reggund1

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I'M GONNA SUE GUCCI. This fragrance is gorgeous, juicy, delicious, and fresh. I'm gonna sue Gucci for advertising Gorgeous Gardenia in this series more Gorgeous Magnolia. Like seriously this one contains every pros of the other gorgeous floras series. It's delicious and gourmand like gorgeous orchid. Fresh like gorgeous jasmine and for sure sweet and delightful like gorgeous gardenia. It's good for both daily and occasional usage and it's crazy cus every single time I wear this someone compliments me and asks my perfume. You see it's a rich(or at least richer than others in this collection) and yet a minimalist fragrance and that's why it's delightful for everyone and suitable for everywhere. It starts with a juicy red berries scent and with a touch of delicate coconut that makes it feel like your eating Raspberry tart. It continues with red berries fading into background so can coconut can shine and as a matter of fact the soft floral scent is there from strat to the end.",08/18/25 05:01,Nimadai
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I can’t believe no one is comparing it to Flowerbomb! As of now, it is not in the ‘reminds me of’ section. I’m equally as surprised to see it compared to GIAW, RL Romance, Reb-l-Fleur, Viva la Juicy, etc.
This is like a softer, summery take on Flowerbomb. I agree that it isn’t strong (which for me is great for warmer weather with that scent profile), and doesn’t last long. But boy is she beautiful!",08/13/25 06:29,katiejon

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆

Not purely a magnolia, but its smoooooooooooooth.

On one hand, qualiity wise, I think its the best naturalistic floral composition in here. Probably most interesting out of the 4, and has a creamy texture similar to Bal d'Afrique or Guidance. It smells pleasant, creamy, like petals, like Dove soap. I can easily see people being very emotional over this scent as it it both intimate, creamy, dreamy and smells like pink magnolia petals on a clear water surface. Most beautiful in a serene way.

⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆

On the other hand, I can barely smell it and am also partially anosmic to it, so I tend to forget its there. However, since it does blend very, very beautifully with skin and provides an amazing smell texture. For this reason, I hearthily reccomend it for intimate encounters.

Quite a cuddly one.

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I have tested it in a perfume store, This fragrance is a balanced sweety coconut, dewberry in the top notes, dewberry here come like chocolate scent exactly, in the middle notes dewberry gradually transforming to similar scent of blueberries plus fresh Orange with pure white flowers and Ylang-Ylang, at the dry down, the scent will be exactly like middle notes in addition of balanced amount of Musk, Patchouli and Woods come from the background. This perfume is very pure balanced feminine easy to use and love.

If you didn't smell this perfume before, I advise that you can blind buy if you interest balanced Calm coconut fragrances, I think if you interest perfumes like; ""Yara from Lattafa"", ""Qaed Al Fursan Unlimited Lattafa"" or ""Alien Goddess Mugler"" you will like this perfume with exist of simple differences between perfumes notes.

This fragrance suitable to wear it during the day or at night, in all seasons, It lasts 4 - 6 hours on the leather and one day on the clothes.


لقد جربته في متجر للعطور، هذا العطر متوازن برائحة جوز الهند الحلوة والتوت في النوتات العليا، والتوت هنا يشبه رائحة الشوكولاتة تمامًا، في النفحات الوسطى يتحول التوت تدريجيًا إلى رائحة مشابهة للتوت الأزرق بالإضافة إلى البرتقال المنعش مع الزهور البيضاء النقية واليلانغ يلانغ. في القاعدة، ستكون الرائحة تمامًا مثل النفحات الوسطى بالإضافة إلى كمية متوازنة من المسك والباتشولي والأخشاب والتي تأتي من الخلفية. هذا العطر أنثوي نقي ومتوازن سهل الاستخدام وسهل أن تحبه.

إذا لم تشمِ هذا العطر من قبل، أنصحك بإمكانك شراؤه شراءً أعمى، إذا كنتِ تستمتعين بعطور جوز الهند المتوازنة والهادئة. أعتقد أنه إذا كنتِ شغوفة بعطور مثل ""يارا من لطافة"" أو ""قائد الفرسان أنليميتد من لطافة"" أو ""إلين غوديس من موغلر""، فسوف يعجبك هذا العطر مع وجود الاختلافات البسيطة في النوتات العطرية.

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This is the only one from this Gucci line that I have tested and I have to say I love it! I have the travel spray and I find it just so easy to wear and enjoy. It is lighthearted and happy, a mood-booster. Delightful! It's not a true gourmand for me but there is a richness to the flowers in this that is addicting, possibly from the coconut addition. I am a white floral lover so I am already the perfect audience for this. I don't love the bottle design so had not gravitated to this line, but the magnolia flanker called to my southern spirit, and I am so glad that I gave it a whirl. There are a lot of negative reviews on this, and I get that we're all different, but it's hard for me to understand what is not to like here! My husband rarely comments on my fragrances but he made a point of telling me I smelled lovely, which made me happy.

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,Now I think this is the best one in the series. Creamy floral and not overwhelming. Playful and sophisticated.,05/16/25 01:42,Umran
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This was a miss for me. Magnolia is noticeably heavier and muskier than Gardenia or Jasmine, and far too sweet for my taste. The dewberry note is definitely there, but not in a fresh or juicy way. It's drowned in sugar and musk, and the result is too syrupy and cloying.

There’s a hint of coconut too, which adds to the thickness rather than lightening it up. The overall effect is dense, sticky, and oddly muddled. I’m not someone who’s prone to headaches, but if I were, this would bring it on. Longevity and projection are weak like the rest of the Flora line, it performs more like a body spray than a perfume. And frankly, even the bottle doesn’t feel like it’s trying to be a serious fragrance.

I don’t mind magnolia as a note in general, I actually enjoy it when it’s fresh and clean (like in Issey Miyake's blend). But this version feels too heavy, almost dirty. Just not for me.",05/10/25 21:51,MetaMystic
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Oooh. Oh. Yes. This is a beautiful, creamy, floral coconut. Perfect for Spring and Summer though it has an inherent warmth to it that makes it suitable for year-round wear. It’s a glorious, feminine, deep, rich scent.

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"First word that came to my mind as I tested this was 'pleasant'. Also there's something really nostalgic about this, I've smelled somrthing like this in my childhood but I can't remember what it is. It's a pretty good perfume but not for me. Kinda has a nice aunt vibe to it, maybe one of my aunts has worn something similar and that's what I'm remembering...?",04/28/25 08:50,Suigintou
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I absolutely fell in love with this one, and it was completely unexpected, I never imagined I'd love it so much!

It's a luminous fragrance, built around what I perceive as coconut milk, ylang-ylang, and magnolia. It's smooth, creamy, sunny, and floral. There's also a hint of fruit in the background, most likely dewberry and orange. It's a ""happy scent"", yet also sensual and feminine.

Very pretty for the holidays, but not only; I can see it being suitable all year round too. My favorite of the range so far!",04/28/25 01:35,Saveria

As the fragrance develops the patchouli comes out giving it an earthy vibe. I think it smells like the color of the bottle, it gives hippie chic, love it. Longevity is pretty average like most gucci fragrances like 5-6 hours tops and it projects an arms lenght for the first hour.",04/19/25 12:09,bagaceirababy
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"one of the only florals i can stand - i think the berry/coconut helps with that in the opening, and then the woodiness towards the end. after about an hour or so it becomes very subtle - pretty much sits right on the skin, no projection unless maybe there’s a breeze to help it out.",04/14/25 13:47,xiahsshi

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Creamy Floral Woods with a Berry Accent...

I've tested this a few times now. It's an enjoyable wear, for sure. Opens with a burst of dewberry & coconut, but already the woods are pressing through. The coconut I get here isn't a toasted coconut, but more of a creamy coconut frosting. As it transitions to the heart, it gets creamy florals, with a hint of wax from the magnolia, all mixing with the blonde woods which gives me a banana Laffy Taffy dusted in powder with a berry top note. The berry top note stays for quite awhile, but eventually fades. There's definitely an illusion of tonka bean in the base, which has a stronger presence than patchouli to my nose.

Contrast to Reb'l Fleur Rihanna:
These are different, but there may be some similarites with coconut, patchouli & berries, but Reb'l Fleur is much fruitier with a more forward patchouli, while Flora Gorgeous Magnolia is much creamier & smoother. Both have good performance, but slightly better for Reb'l Fleur.

Overall: enjoyable creamy, sweet floral-woody scent with good performance. I look forward to testing this in summer to see if I can get more of a bloom from the magnolia. It's a love for me. Enjoy!",04/06/25 07:37,suzanne_ronald
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Got this in a gift sample set, this was the first one that stood out to me scent notes wise. Unfortunately for me, all this projected was a baby powder that smelt like flowers. Headache inducing :/",04/02/25 09:09,xoxana
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Okay, let me just say it- now that I finally managed to buy it, this perfume is everything. Out of all the colors this perfume is available in, the purple one is hands-down my favorite. It’s one of those perfumes that immediately makes you feel like your best self the second it hits your skin. It’s powerful in this elegant dreamy way, and honestly? It’s kind of addictive.

The scent is this perfect mix of sweet, floral, and warm. It opens with this juicy freshness of the coconut and berry in there, and then it melts into this gorgeous magnolia note that is creamy and rich without being too heavy. There's something about it that feels romantic and soft, but still confident and grown. It's not just “pretty”, it's literally captivating.

What I love most is how balanced it is. It's floral, yes, but not your typical powdery floral which I personally hate. There's depth and warmth to it, almost like vanilla or musk in the base, which makes it feel cozy and sensual at the same time. It's the kind of scent that wraps around you like a beautiful aura... and then you don't just smell good, you smell expensive and unforgettable.

The lasting power is amazing too! Personally I can still smell it on my clothes and wrists hours later, and it wears so beautifully throughout the day. Every time I wear it I catch myself randomly sniffing my wrist like a weirdo because I just can't get enough.

If I had to describe it in a feeling, it's like walking into a sunlit garden wearing a silk dress, feeling confident, magnetic, and soft all at once. It's a whole vibe.

11/10. My holy grail. Please never stop making this Gucci!",03/25/25 01:53,starfire_enthusiast

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I tested this one in Sephora Medina (SA) and at first whiff I was reminded of a coconut mist I used to like a lot maybe ten years ago or so and that's Waikiki Beach coconut!
I was expecting a floral fragrance featuring the Magnolia as prominent note hence the name, but unfortunately it smells nothing floral but rather coconut all the way. The sillage and longevity are huge but if you can get your hands on the old formulation of Waikiki, that will save you lots of money.",02/03/25 13:39,dina

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I usually don't post reviews, but I had to for this one..
At first and on paper, I loved this perfume.. I don't really get the coconut, but overall, it's (very) sweet, fruity (berries) and has a huge powdery vibe (which I love), so I bought it.

As soon as I got home and tried it on my skin, it started smelling incredibly mature. Now, don't get me wrong, I usually like perfumes that are labeled as ""mature"", but the powderiness started smelling a little like a ""house that has been closed for too long"". Unbelievably headache inducing.

After not even not 30minutes, I started picking up on the patchouli. I did see that this perfume had patchouli in the notes, but since no one mentioned it and since I didn't pick it up on paper either, I went ahead and bought it anyways (my bad for not testing in on skin first).

It all comes down to personal taste, but if you're sensitive to patchouli like me, pleeease try it on your skin before buying it.",01/06/25 05:33,snr

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"The opening is very “mall perfume counter,” but I mean that in a nice way. The dewberry is so juicy and mixes well with the magnolia … at least at first. Then it turned. So, here’s the thing … magnolia flowers are beautiful, but they don’t always smell nice. (IYKYK.) “Rotten” is the word that comes to mind, and that’s certainly the case here. Once that initial mingling with the dewberry settles down, the overly floral-creamy (like a facial cream, somehow), almost rotten magnolia comes forward. I didn’t recognize the coconut, but now that I see it in the pyramid, yes … I think it’s adding to the funk.

A scrubber for me but seemed to be pretty good for lasting.",01/01/25 19:07,supergirl9412
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I love this perfume, but I’m still learning how to work with it. Some days, it smells like the most delicious, slightly sour berry; on other days, it reminds me of a specific nail polish remover with a magnolia scent that we have in our country. Here are my observations so far:

-This perfume doesn’t layer well with other perfumes or scented products.
-The most compliments I’ve received while wearing this fragrance were when I applied it right after a shower, without any other scents.
-Interestingly, it seems to work especially well after I work out—it pairs surprisingly well with my sweat! I think this might actually be my favorite workout perfume.
-Avoid over spraying or applying it to your hair.
-This fragrance seems to thrive in heat and moisture, which really brings out its magic.",12/31/24 00:05,dilan.bukan
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I used to like and want this fragrance, but the other day when I smelled it, it felt so mature and aged. It reminded me of something an older woman would wear, and that really disappointed me. I’ll revisit it, though. I typically love white florals, and who can deny coconut?",12/30/24 16:37,Jaelzion
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"The perfume that sparked my recent love of scents (Especially female ones a man could pull off).

This smells like creamy blackberries in a way that fits amazingly into British Autumn.

Despite nothing about this scent being warming, it feels quite cosy and inviting in a way that just feels right for me.

It's very well blended, and smells both fresh and sticky somehow.

It does have a little bit of the ""fruity shampoo"" smell I don't typically enjoy, but in this scent the lactonic undertones make it feel more like a shower lotion or creame; I don't know why, but I like that much more.

About 6 months later into my fragrance journey, I can see the roots of my passion for powder and musk in this scent and think it will remain one of the few fruity scents I will pick over my growing menagerie of powdery smells (anais anais is on its way!).

I regret only buying 30ml at the time in a coy attempt to not comitt to a hobby that might not last, but I will certainly repurchase this in a larger bottle (or get a larger one in a great sale if that comes first).


Easily the best Gucci Gorgeous scent.",12/28/24 15:25,lalapope
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I am familiar with the scent of blooming magnolia, it is gorgeous, but flowers on the trees don't last long.
That it is difficult to distill magnolia, I am fully aware that I'll get a smidgen of it in perfume. That is the case with this. There is the jasmine as well.

The opening of fresh white florals is very pleasing without any chemical/alcohol blast. Fresh with some depth. I enjoy this clean composition.
Refreshing to the dry down. I get a bit of coconut.

I am happy with this, it delivers what it claims. So I am wearing this in December and thoroughly enjoying it. In Spring and Summer it will really bloom.",12/28/24 01:36,antihero
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"The opening reminded me of Katy Perry’s Meow (the pink cat bottle). Gorgeous Magnolia is nothing spectacular, but it is nice. Sillage and longevity are slightly better that the Gardenia one, so that’s a bonus. On the bottle it says that it has patchouli as a base note, which is nowhere to be found on my skin.
Overall, I think this is a decent fragrance but, again, nothing extraordinary - pleasant, sweet, feminine, good for everyday use.",12/25/24 23:21,marianapico_
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"nothing too crazy, nice simple white floral thats sweet and grounded. not that excited by it but i feel everyone needs a nice and easy white floral and this does the job very well! unoffensive and pleasant with enough complexity i’m not bored by it",12/25/24 09:09,bunlou
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Got a sample of this as part of my sephora birthday gift... notes like clary sage and sambac jasmine had me excited but frankly this scent hardly even qualifies as 'floral' in my opinion. It's incredibly sweet and sugary, to the point that it's almost headache-inducing. The coconut just completely overwhelms and smothers everything else :( Seems a little overpriced considering you can get a sweet coconut scent with similar longevity/projection out of something from say.... b&bw.

I feel like I'm being so mean but honestly I'm kind of shocked at how... one-dimensional this is compared to the other Gorgeous Flora scents I've tried so far. I can see why people like this, don't get me wrong, but I am just not one of those people, sadly.",12/19/24 16:41,sunchips
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I get creaminess, which must be from magnolia and coconut. I don’t detect coconut though. At the same time, there’s a bit of freshness or plant, greenness to it.

From this line, I like orchid and gardenia best. Magnolia is just not preferred scent profile.",12/18/24 17:05,saho93
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Absolutely adore this fragrance. I tried just about every perfume in the shop and this is the one I went home with. I wear it more than anything else and get compliments on it constantly. It’s not a complex scent, but the simplicity is part of what I love about it.


I love coconut scents but they’re often too sugary or immature for me, and they rarely last long. This one lasts all day! Bright, sweet but not overpowering, perfectly balanced.


The coconut lasts throughout and is probably the strongest element here, and I’d say it’s more fruity than floral. I do definitely notice the magnolia, which is a difficult scent to capture, but I think the jasmine is actually a little stronger — moreso than the Gucci jasmine, which has an overpowering aldehyde scent for me. The musk is subtle and creamy.

It’s not in the scent pyramid but I also notice a hint of vanilla. I don’t get the patchouli or blonde woods, nothing herbal or woodt in this one, but there’s just a touch of spice that strengthens in the dry down. Surprised this one isn’t higher rated. I’d call this a safe blind buy.",12/15/24 21:14,rmems

I could still smell it on my clothes 24 hours after spraying it! Lasted longer on clothes than my skin. I’m not sure how to describe it besides it smells how I believe the color purple would smell. Even though it has that coconut, it’s not too tropical and is a really good balance of sweet and floral.",11/26/24 21:30,Gabburrito
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"My favorite of the Gucci Sephora sampler we all got for our birthdays in November. Undoubtedly sweet but not sugary/juvenile like Gardenia, and more complex than the linear Jasmine, the dewberry (never tasted this, but can smell it) and jasmine in Magnolia combine to aromatically match the color of the bottle. I usually don’t care for coconut but here it adds a lactonic feel to balance what might otherwise be sharp white florals. I don’t know if I would reach for a full bottle, but of the three I’ve tried, this Gucci Flora Gorgeous at least gives me something to think about.",11/25/24 14:07,KaitM

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Gucci Flora Gorgeous Magnolia is a pleasant floral. Not complex, but easy to like and good.
It smells like flower nectar, white flowers, a little bit of blackberry, a little bit of coconut water. The blackberry note doesn't generate a pure, individual blackberry scent, it's there just to give some depth to the flower nectar scent.
The coconut note is not something I'm a fan of, but in this perfume, it's not bothering.",11/24/24 12:51,JuliaToothFairy
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Just got a sample of this as my Sephora bday gift and I must say that as a floral hater I actually love this scent!
I struggle to describe florals but this is creamy and slightly baby powdery. Maybe it's the coconut that's making it so smooth and pleasant. I get a fresh opening that's insignificant and then it dries and becomes this pretty girly everyday scent! If there's one floral scent that belongs in my collection it's this one! Fresh, creamy, smooth, feminine and baby powdery are the words I'd use to describe this scent.
Sillage is moderate and longevity is just over 4 ish hours. I spray it lightly as I only have a small sample and I'm rationing it to make it last but I definitely want to grab the full size eventually and give myself a proper spritz to test how it wears.",11/23/24 16:10,Dani D-va
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This was my favourite out of this line, until Orchid came out. This is really lovely. It gives me a hippy girl vibe for some reason. I can imagine a girl who drives around in a van, going to all the alternative dance raves and festivals wearing this. She's a very friendly and warm hearted girl, who is quick to make friends wherever the goes. Braids in her hair and strappy sandles on her feet. A mix of trinkets hanging from her rear vision mirror and an ""eat the rich"" bumper sticker. Really cool and feminine without being too girly. The coconut offers something you might not expect. It definitely gives some body to the fragrance.

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I just have a teeny tiny little sample of this but wow just wow it's so elegantly floral but that berry smell sticks its so beautiful it smells like you're walking through a field of flowers while picking blackberries at the same time, it has that sweet flare to it from the berry but that sweetness aspect it brings is so light it's barely there. This scent is heavenly! I applied a little on my wrists and now I can't stop smelling them every two seconds",10/15/24 01:06,illit
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I must be the only one not smelling coconut in this.... it just comes across as a weaker take on the Gorgeous Gardenia, which I think does the sweet aspect better.

Edit: Whoever is voting Taylor Swift Wonderstruck is right on.. EXCEPT this one smells more expensive and is better blended. A high-end version. So if you're a young Taylor Swift fan that missed out on Wonderstruck, this is a really good bet!",10/12/24 23:14,MichelleAntonia

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I purchased a travel-sized version and it consistently reminded me of a beloved fragrance. After much thought, I realized its scent profile closely resembles Khaltaat Al Arabia Royal Blends by Lattafa (2020). The similarity is striking. It raises the question: are original designers taking cues from clone makers? To clarify, I absolutely adore this scent profile. Gucci's rendition is subtly softer and more floral, while Khaltaat boasts greater sillage. I have yet to assess its longevity. Considering the cost, I am inclined to stick with Khaltaat.",08/29/24 17:54,MizzKitty

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This is by far my favorite release of 2023 and definitely in my top scents of all time. This scent is so bright and summery, elegant but youthful. The patchouli and dewberry work together so well, bringing out the best in each other and the star of the show, magnolia. The blend isn't as complicated as you'd expect a luxury fragrance to be, but I think the 'less is more' approach was executed perfectly with this scent. It carries a select variety of high quality notes that complement each other exceedingly well. The bottle itself is also so wonderful, the atomizer disperses so well and allows the fragrance to set beautifully on the skin, and the materials from which it is constructed look and feel so classy and luxurious. I will definitely carry this scent in my collection for years to come.",08/28/24 13:12,microwaveproofcat
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"On my skin, this scent began somewhat sweet and mildly fruity. The dewberry note was prominent upon the initial spray. As time went on, it turned into a powdery floral with patchouli. If you like floral/patchouli profiles and prefer scents that stay close to the skin (as opposed to projecting throughout an entire room), this one is for you.",08/26/24 15:05,stillkyos
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Tested Gucci Flora Gorgeous Magnolia in Macys briefly and it smelled like sweet berries. Darker berries not raspberry but also not bitter. Not tart or watery, but a nice, sweet fruity floral with purple berries. The magnolia made this creamy. Tested again a year later now in Sephora and I will say my initial thoughts were spot on. I will add that it smelled like a nostalgic hair conditioner, and then it hit me that it smells exactly like the Aussie moisturizing creamy conditioner for curly hair, also in a purple bottle. Well at least similar to how it smelled a decade ago, I can't attest to how it smells now. Gorgeous magnolia also lasted longer and projected more this time around into moderate zone.",08/25/24 00:18,jassca99
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"It’s a musky, sweet floral. Starts clean and creamy, but turns more musky every hour. It’s my favourite from the line, and it reminds me of La Nuit Danse by Chabaud. It’s like a musky crowdpleaser version. Perfomance is average, and for the price it’s alright.

If you want a similar scent in beast-mode, check out La Nuit Danse. The notes are different, but somehow they have a similar floral, creamy, musky sweetness.",08/22/24 10:22,Luilind
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Opening is mesmerizing. Coconut and berries smell too perfect. But it turns into a basic jasmine perfume in 20 minutes. Since I don't like jasmine, I wished for it was a magnolia perfume but unfortunately it is not. In the end of the day, perfume is still there but the smell is unbelievably sweet. Almost like a sugar note. Maybe it is about my skin but I feel so disappointed and I would not buy it",08/22/24 02:09,bsl.perfumes
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Sweet and the coconut adds a bit of creaminess, but overall it’s quite sharp and musky on me. The jasmine is wayyyy too strong and I sadly don’t get any dewberry. The patchouli isn’t too strong and the blonde woods only comes through after a few hours. Has minimal sillage and projects for about 3 hours before remaining as a skin scent for another 3 hours.",08/21/24 01:04,anamawsity
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Well, this isn't bad, but I'm not shaken up by it like many people seem to be. My socks are still on...so to speak :/

It's really *nice*, just like her sisters Gardenia and Jasmine. They're well-behaved, church girls if I were to personify anything (and I have the horrid and dramatic tendency to do so in my reviews).

This opens with pear to my nose, it's not a berry scent to me. Well, maybe slightly. Or, maybe dewberries smell like cocktail pear? Either way, it's pear in my mind.

It's a clean, musky white floral, but it's indistinct. I could tell the Gardenia fragrance was gardenia, and the Jasmine was jasmine, bur with this, it's more vague. Absolutely likable, polite and pleasantly floral, but rather nebulous and not at all a punchy floral.

It's softest in the drydown, and has the character and texture of coconut, whilst not necessarily smelling *of* coconut. It's slightly powdery and actually tricks me into smelling violet. Is that a synesthetic impression owing to the purple bottle? Hmmm...I honestly cannot tell.

It's nice, but I'll forget all about this in a month.",08/20/24 19:17,ShadowsofLight

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,I absolutely love this and want a full bottle but it’s just not long lasting enough for the price! I know it’s a a bit shampoo bubblegummy and juvenile but it’s just so yummy and delicious to me and makes me happy! Plus the coconut is soooo perfect I love a coconutty creamy floral! One of my absolute faves just wish it lasted longer :(,08/14/24 10:50,Ohnoni
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This reminds me a lot of the Narciso cubes, particularly the white one, but sweeter. I don't get the coconut at all

Also reminds me of Huda Easy Bake but not as tropical, and Lush's Sex Bomb - the actual bath bomb though cause the spray smells different",08/08/24 14:42,alyssarware
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,@DJ Potato - Unfortunately I have the same experiences as you with the sample vials vs. the versions of perfumes for sale. And no one wants to believe me.,08/07/24 13:55,FrkFors
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I have a sample of this and the first time I smelt it, I was ready to buy the full bottle. I exercised restraint though, saying that if I gravitate towards the sample over multiple days, this is worth a buy. Well, I finished the sample and can’t stop craving it. I am a person who hates creamy smells. I’m also not a big fan of coconut type tropical scents as I don’t go to the beach (despite living next to it). This fragrance though, it’s like they took the best part of the coconut flesh and blended it with an expensive floral scented shampoo. Like an upgraded herbal essences experience. I wanted to dismiss it for being shampoo-like but this is elevated shampoo. I want to smell like this. I just ordered the full 150ml bottle. I hope I don’t regret it.

This perfume turned into a longevity and sillage powerhouse after sitting for two weeks. The scent is beautiful. Highly recommend!",07/26/24 09:49,DJ Potato

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"A lot of people are saying this smells like soap when this doesn't....there is a huge difference between soap like for example a soapy vintage rose smell and then there is freshly washed hair with drug store shampoo smell(think tocca guiletta)and this is indeed that smell. It definitely smells like luxury shampoo and conditioner though but if you don't like that smell and you think it smells cheap then this may not be for you. I happen to love smelling like hair products and men really happen love that smell too ❤️ huge love for me especially because there is coconut in it. Discounters have it now, I paid $90 for the 3.3 ounce and I don't regret it at all!",07/23/24 12:49,Bondno9girl

Smells like a basic, sweet perfume, not the floral bouquet I was expecting. Patchouli is nowhere to be found. Bad performing sillage and longevity. Not terrible and the smell is quite cute, just not what I was expecting for the price and hype at all. Will not be purchasing this.",07/09/24 23:16,Evianthiel
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This is really an okay time. 😂 Is it the most original fragrance ever? No, but do you want to smell good? This will give you that experience. The dewberry gives this a nice kind of sweet fruity cross between grape or plum flavored smarties candy giving it a sweet/tart flavor. The texture is a little bit fizzy, and slightly powdery. The coconut gives a nice smooth creamy feeling along with some light florals. It’s all wrapped up in that kind of designer type of fragrance DNA. If I squint I could see how this could give shampoo vibes but a delicious smelling shampoo. A lot of people are complaining about the longevity of this but I had the opposite experience. Two sprays lasted 8 hours.",07/09/24 18:01,Rosemary14
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This is a really beautiful fragrance done well. Its not as sexy as Flora Jasmine who is the expensive bombshell mistress or a very sexy date that was too high maintainence.

She lingers in your imagination as a crush or she becomes your girlfriend or wife she is the perfect signature fragrance.",07/08/24 17:35,KristinaAlexis
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I had free samples that lasted really long and had a strong floral smell, I liked them so I got the full bottle gifted. BIG MISTAKE and it seems most people had the same experience:

The actual perfume doesn’t last AT ALL. I have tried other pulse points, with unscented lotion and vaseline, it doesn’t make a difference. On top of that, it also doesn’t smell either. Can’t discern any of the notes, at best it smells kind of fresh or like shampoo (as others have described when I asked them). When sprayed on clothing, it does get a bit better, it lasts more and you can actual distinguish the coconut and floral notes.

In conclusion: These Gucci lines all have the same issue, as I have tried the pink & green ones too, do yourself a favor and DON’T get these unless gifted or you want to smell like overpriced mart shampoo.",07/08/24 09:58,gothicus
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Honestly im disappointed with this 😑 and not because it doesn’t smell nice because it does, it smells gorgeous but because it lasts for all of 5 minutes and it’s gucci!!! The longevity is pathetic and for the price you’d expect it to last at least 8hours 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 it’s my first gucci perfume and my last.

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I've been looking for a creamy and sweet summer scent and I think this might be it! it smells like a sugary (but not too sweet) coconut whipped cream on me, yet it feels drinkable somehow, kind of like a thick cocktail. It gets even sweeter when it warms up, too! I don't like florals but this is perfect for me, get this if you want a cozy coconut scent!",06/07/24 12:19,Ennegramm
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This scent is beautiful! My friends and I got free samples from a Gucci ad. My friend who is a white floral lover reached out to say how amazing it was. I immediately tried on my sample and liked it too!

It’s white floral without being overwhelmingly so. I get a fruity berry opening with creamy elements. It feels fitting for spring/cooler summer/beginning of fall. If it’s too hot, the berry drowns out the other notes. It smells youthful in the opening.

I can’t help but detect a slight lavender almost lavender jasmine dryer sheet facet to this. I think it’s from the clary sage. If I had to change one thing, I’d dial down or remove that note.

There’s a bit of a vintage vibe in the drydown from the patchouli (which my friend claims to hate patchouli but did not recognize in this scent). She did say to spray it on skin because the scent when smelling the bottle itself feels “grandma”. Personally, I think it’s the best of the Flora line.",06/03/24 09:27,YourFragranceFriend
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Out of all the women’s fragrances I smelled today, this was my number 1. A tastefully sweet, floral fragrance with what I initially thought it was a lactonic backbone, but after looking at the notes I realized it was the coconut giving it that creamy/milky tone. I kept coming back to the bottle in the store because I found it so addictive. Had to purchase a bottle for my wife.",05/28/24 18:50,JakamoFiNaYe
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"This is a beautiful gem.

My favorite of the 3 in this line .

I get juicy Dewberry, creamy coconut milk, and that magnolia is so velvety. I don't know how magnolias smell in nature but this is so refreshing especially for the heat. I live in the tropics. It blends so wonderfully with other fragrances in my collection. I feel like it smells very clean as well. Like, freshly laundered clothing. The patchouli is not bothersome at all. I tend to avoid fragrances with patchouli in them.

I personally love this. It's one of my feel good fragrances",05/24/24 18:25,MareaCamacho
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"Not very floral at all. Just smells like a generic berry coconut sugar scent with a soft musk base and a little lemony pop. While it doesn't smell quite as cheap as the VS scents this reminds me of, it seems very overpriced. Nothing from the Flora line seems to match the names or concept. I'll probably just pass this over to my sister who loves sugar perfumes.",05/20/24 01:37,noctivagantlibertine

First spray is straightforward lovely white floral. One point off for longevity, everything else is perfect from this scent. Simple, elegant, and linear. Smells like sweet white florals. This is my favorite out of the three and I wouldn’t mind owning full size bottles of any of them. Lovely vintage purple bottle. Lasts on clothes much longer than on skin. I don’t get any coconut. Spouse says that it is sweeter than my other perfumes. To him it smells like the floral part of vanilla.

Wore this to Disney, running errands, and at home. Used up a 10ml travel size. Would purchase another travel or full size. Received a free 2ml sample from Macy’s.",05/16/24 01:35,thewho
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I smell the magnolia and a hint of patchouli on first spray. On dry down, I detect a hint of patchouli, musk and vanilla. I loved this on a strip. I even loved it when I spritzed it on in the store to test with my body chemistry. It won out over the the Flora Gorgeous Gardenia and the Flora Gorgeous Jasmine. So I purchased it. I am so disappointed. It is too close the skin and quite faint. It has absolutely no sillage. I have to find something to layer this with. I hate that I have to work this hard to get wear out of it. It sucks because it is such a lovely and feminine scent. Ugh.",05/05/24 11:03,Blue Orchid

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"It reminds me a lot of M by Mariah Carey minus the smokiness. They seem to only share one note in common which is patchouli. But it’s the same concept, gourmand and florals notes and patchouli in the background. The top notes smelled of raspeberry valentine candy hearts and sweet coconut ice cream.

Heavy white florals and way too much patchouli. I don't get any of the coconut that's listed! Bummer. It's really strong and really ""perfumey"" to my nose. I sprayed it about 5 hours ago and it's still extremely noticeable. So, longevity and sillage is there - for once I wish it weren't!

This is by far my least favorite of the three. Gorgeous Gardenia is probably the best, followed by Gorgeous Jasmine. I will be giving my sample of Magnolia away.",04/28/24 14:41,mermaidylady

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"I think would be hard for people to not to like this. It's very pretty and ""polite"" because it doesn't project heavily, but has creates a fluffy cloud-like aura around the wearer that lasts all day at the office. It's not terribly unique, but the blend is done in a way that while sweet and coconutty, it's not too childish; while woody, it's still feminine; while floral, it's not to overpowering. It leaves a creamy and watery mouthfeel if that makes sense? There is a decidedly sugary sweetness that doesn't seem to fit the listed notes. It feels like the more refined older sis to Cheirosa '59. I would never pay full retail for this perfume, but if I were to run out of other easy-reach fragrances in my collection, I can imagine seeking out a (1 oz) bottle of this on a discount website.

On my ""like"" scale of 1<5, it's a 3.",04/25/24 10:17,Dlittlegarden

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia Gucci,"A Fresh, feminine, bright, elegant, warm, softly sweet, creamy, slightly woodsy, subtly warm spicy floral. What a beautiful fragrance! I really like all 3 of these… Jasmine was 3rd, Gardenia 2nd, and Magnolia my favorite! I really don’t pick up on too much coconut, just a soft touch. I’m also surprised that the magnolia isn’t more prominent, but it’s still there and still a very lovely fragrance. There really is a whole beautiful journey with this fragrance. It’s a more bright and fresh floral with a soft sweetness and creaminess at first. As the fragrance evolves it becomes a more musky and woodsy floral. Then, it continues as a musky and woodsy floral that has a prominent patchouli scent.

I feel that I should mention that I don’t have a lot of floral fragrances that I love, but this is a really good one. Also, I can be hesitant about fragrances with patchouli, but can also really enjoy them if done well like this one. For reference, a few of my favorite florals (most containing patchouli) include: Coach Love (2012 version), Coach Poppy Blossom, Coach Poppy Wild Flower, Nest Sunkissed Hibiscus, Chloe Love Story, Flowerbomb, FB Ruby Orchid, FB Nectar, and FB Tiger Lily.

I get excellent performance with Gucci Flora Gorgeous Magnolia. The longevity is great, it lasts the entire day and I can still smell it the next morning. The projection is really nice too, it can be smelled from a few feet away.",04/18/24 00:11,Shimmer412

However, the dry down is a patchouly explosion, I was very very surprised about how this perfume evolved. I can see what people mean, when they say, it smells like Rihanna rebel fleur, I would say that they’re relating to the patchouly drydown of this fragrance, which is somewhat the opening of rebel fleur.

After experiencing the dry down I would say it’s not a safe blind buy, for those who are patchouly sensitive. I’m gonna keep trying and see how it goes.",03/31/24 20:26,Flexwithviv

And sure it doesnt last super long or fill a room, but the subtle projection is what makes the scent, it makes it more inviting and makes it more noticeable that it is you that smells so good when i smell you or your clothes up close, which i prefer to constantly smelling in the air, personally.",01/26/24 10:05,Realest Rater 47

I declared it as my work perfume as I am in a shared office and this will hardly offend anyone. A nice, pretty perfume. Creamy, coco-musky, fades to nothingness in an hour.

Muschio di Luce Gucci,"Creamy musk...

Beautiful creamy sandalwood that merges with musk to form a creamy musky blend with some vetiver, cedar. & ambrox. Later this mix kind of forms soapy effect alongside the musk.

It's an interesting take on musk. Beautiful.",10/11/25 01:41,Q80
Muschio di Luce Gucci,"This is a strong entry into the white musk space. In fact, Gucci’s first real attempt at a straight-up musk, after their underwhelming Black Musk. If you enjoy classics type musks like Blanc Kogane, Kiehl’s Original Musk, or Jovan Musk, this will feel familiar and approachable. What stands out is the lack of intrusive florals (jasmine, lily of the valley, etc.), which lets the musk stay clean and uninterrupted at the center.

That said, I’m not sure most people will justify the full Alchemist premium for the scent alone, or just want the bottle. Personally, I am a musk lover, so I admit some bias - but so far, I’m genuinely enjoying it.

Muschio di Luce Gucci,"It’s nice but it’s a little too masculine for me. Also it’s too heavy on the ambroxan for my personal taste but still it is a nice musk fragrance that I can see being a hit and I’m sure it will definitely get compliments! It smells better in the air than right up on skin. On my skin after it dries down I get mostly ambroxan and musk which does nothing for me, I enjoyed the opening way more. Also for me it smells better on clothes, somehow it’s creamier smelling on my shirt but on skin not so much. I wish it smelled more like that on my skin. It’s definitely a scent you will go nose blind to but others will notice it though. Easy reach and work safe type of scent.

I thought it might have some resemblance to Musk K by Ella K but it doesn’t. I prefer that one as I don’t get much of any ambroxan in it plus it has iris. Musk K is also much more fem. This is unisex enough but leans more to the masc side to my nose.

Edit: tried it again one more time the next day and yeah it’s just very heavy on the ambroxan, an ambroxan bomb honestly, ugh. If that note when amped up doesn’t bother you then try it out but for me I would have preferred it not have that or not so much of it at least. It drowns out the parts of the fragrance I do enjoy.",09/06/25 12:23,Vannamae__
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,Green fresh and fougere with aromatic herbs and ginger and a nice peppery woody base with a slight hint of citrus and amber. In my opinion it’s pretty mass anppealing and a great masculine scent for summer and spring. Performance is average but a great fragrance nonetheless.,06/07/25 01:09,xPikez

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,smells exactly like gucci guilty elixir but with a fresh citrus opening for the first 30 minutes. if you like gucci guilty elixir then just get this and save some money lol,01/10/25 05:58,Kellykiller
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,Gave me a headache right away. Cheap smelling but I dislike the male line. The ambroxan in the base is way to strong.,01/03/25 09:57,LSAUG
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Similar to the OG but with an herbal/vegetal twist in the opening. Nice change up, though may not be unique enough to warrant owning this and another from the Guilty line. Overall, very pleasant fragrance, especially in the dry down.",01/25/24 19:52,monsieur.moustache
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme is an aromatic, citrus, floral and woody fragrance.

Its opening is citrus and aromatic, where it is possible to perceive the freshness of some citrus fruits accompanied by fresh spicy notes such as pink pepper and rosemary, as well as floral notes such as lavender. As the minutes pass, a note of geranium is also noticeable, which gives it a slight metallic smell, until reaching the drying phase with some woods, particularly patchouli, although there is also something that gives it an earthy sensation, which I want to assume is due to vetiver. The smell in general retains part of the DNA of several fragrances from the Guilty Pour Homme line, being quite close to Guilty Black, where herbal elements predominate that bring it closer to an Aromatic Fougere.

This version of Gucci Guilty Pour Homme is fresh and aromatic, providing a very pleasant clean sensation, which makes it ideal for use during the day, in outdoor activities, office work, at school or even in closed spaces, since Its projection is discreet.

In terms of longevity, it lasts between 6 and 7 hours, and its sillage, as I mentioned, is discreet.

Guilty Love is an easy-to-wear and very nice fragrance, but since it is a limited edition I would only recommend it to those who like the DNA of the Guilty Pour Homme line, especially if they know Guilty Black",10/20/23 16:27,caifan
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme

Such a bright juicy zesty lovely opening from the ginger kumquat orange and spiciness from pink pepper.

Some of you may feel it's kinda generic amongst the freshie but it still smells really lovely, a little tard sweet yes but juicy sweet. The lovely opening goes off rather quickly and opens up to lavender and rosemary and drydown to more earthy and herbal.

Folks who is into designers and freshie will like this. Overall fresh juicy lovely soapy laundry vibe. This probably performs better in cooler conditions as it's performance is just about average settling becoming a skin scent rather quickly.",09/05/23 21:30,JasKiew
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"First 10min I get orange & ginger on top of a touch of Guilty Black in the background. The dry down of GGLove begin to turn synthetic & cologne-y.
I find Black to be more fresh & rounded w/ a cooling effect. Sexy ass Lavender & very clean patchouli dominate.

Black all day baby 💯 👑",08/06/23 17:25,DapperDon
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I really like the opening. If I had known this smelled like it did, I would have bought this over Gucci Guilty Black. The only difference I'm noticing is the opening. I love it, bright, spicy, citrusy. But it dries down so similar to Gucci Guilty Black that I'm having trouble convincing myself to buy a bottle especially at the current discontinued prices. Maybe if I can get a deal on a bottle, otherwise I'll just have to enjoy my decant until it's gone.

Opens like Coach for Men then goes to Gucci Guilty Black..

Edit: Finally got a full bottle, granted it's three years old. I really have to over spray this frag to get it to last but I'm ok with that. After so many high heat summer days with most of my colognes seeming to be suffocating, this is a welcomed change. I can wear it to smell nice and raise my confidence and not worry about being sick of it 8 hours later when it's gone stale because this just tapers off instead of transforming into a nasty hangover. I love how fresh it remains while still having character that's not based on musk.",05/06/23 17:12,Steve907
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Fresh and zesty ginger. Sophisticated, yet also quite sensual. Perfect for spring and summer. Lasted about three hours on my skin and seemed to project relatively well. A truly enjoyable scent.",11/21/22 21:07,McG1993

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I bought this for my husband at Christmas. In store, on the dabber, I really smelled the spicy ginger opening. On my husband's skin it smells much different. I really like it on him. It has a slightly sweet and aquatic smell yet still masculine. The notes do not point to this at all so maybe it is his skin chemistry changing this quite a bit. It is great for those times where you don't want a pungent, in-your-face men's cologne. He really likes it, too!",03/12/22 19:10,SusanTheTeach
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"This along with most of the Gucci Guilty line is made to be one thing: people pleasing and easy to wear scent. It excels at that, which is why it receives most of the hate that it does.

Is it generic and “boring”? Sure.
Is it meant for the people who throw shade at it for being those things? Nope.

This is something you grab when you wanna smell nice and get compliments. Whether you have 4 bottles or 400, it’ll still work the same.",03/12/22 18:32,millerje86
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"The fragrance itself is very one noted. When I spray it on myself it only smells of lime, which is strange as the only citrus in it is mandarin orange.

Glad you found something you like better though!",10/19/21 17:47,updog
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"When I first got into perfumes, I blind bought this and Gucci Guilty Black. I will say that these two were definite blind buy mistakes. I can’t help but find these as cheap smelling, and very juvenile. I don’t mean to sound so harsh, but after smelling some better quality scents...I just don’t even see the appeal in these besides the packaging and marketing. I sold both my bottles together for $40 cause even though I paid more, I don’t find them to be worth it.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"This fragrance describes "" LOVE"" as bright,+fresh from floral ,citrus and spices aromatic, This smell of love bring happiness to life for sure, (unless you are negative person.) In my opinion the bright side of this smell can be medicate for stress or mental health problems too. It will not make you calm but Happy and love the moment in your life. ❤",09/04/21 09:37,iamyourshy
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I’ve been binging on all the Guilty fragrances lately, and this one stands out as the lightest and most airy, and it’s more citrusy and crisp, less sweet. It feels like the Dior Homme Cologne of the Gucci Guilty line, where it differs quite significantly from the OG edt version and presents itself as a super casual, light, clean, totally inoffensive fresh citrus fragrance that you really can’t go wrong with in summer.

This excels in hot weather and gives a very refreshing and energizing vibe. The opening is gorgeous, it’s fairly bitter and a bit tart, which is what makes it work so well in hot weather… it stays fresh and never too sweet or cloying. The opening has moments where reminds me of Mr. Burberry EDT, just a sort of bright, tart, and crisp citrus with some bright green/floral elements mixed in. They both have patchouli, vetiver and lavender in common.

The green elements mix with the opening citrus and pepper and add a crisp kick to it, mixed with the warm, underlying floral notes and some very light resinous/woody vibes, but for the most part this feels like a purely citrus/green/floral concoction. Like I mentioned before, the opening has a note that really reminds me of Mr. Burberry EDT, and the heart and drydown reminds me of Dior Homme Cologne and Dior Homme Sport. This does almost feel like it could be a CK One inspired unisex scent at times especially with the floral notes in the drydown, but it’s never feminine and leans more masculine the whole time. Great scent, very refreshing, but as usual with the Gucci Guilty line, performance is not the best, be prepared to spray this one frequently. It’s not abysmal as far as performance but it doesn’t hold up as well as I’d hoped. My third favorite in the Gucci Guilty line behind the EDP and Eau, and a very solid and welcome addition to the line.",07/23/21 19:32,Bfreepro417
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"My sister works in the beauty industry and recently acquired a load of free perfume. This is one of the bottles that was offloaded to me. Been test driving it for a few days, and it is truly sub-par. You gotta love how the PR departments of these Sephora-shelf houses try to drum up interest and fantasy for their dime a dozen flankers. Kumquat??? Gimme a break, Coty. That’s not what I smell at all. This edition of Gucci Guilty opens with a top note of “middle class suburban man after his post-gym shower.” I can picture this man vividly (I hooked up with tons of them in high school): Eastern European parents, middle management at a bank or something, 30-ish, minimally decorated condo… and just as I get a sense of this man, he is gone without a trace! Two hours of wear, MAX.

This makes me feel like I’m 18 again. Would not recommend!",05/29/21 08:06,marco_m
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Delightful. Bright citrus notes at the top initially reminded me of a CkOne Summer release. And as pleasant as some of those are, they are typically linear and a bit boring. This one has much more depth than I anticipated. The juicy opening gives way to a subtle, drier freshness (evidently rosemary and lavender, though I don't pick up much of the former). The vetiver lays nicely against the patchouli, which, like in all other Guilty releases is very smooth. I don't get as much of a clean laundry vibe as others have described. But maybe... the outdoor terrace of a juice bar that is located directly adjacent to a laundromat. Yeah, I think that's the vibe I get from this. Very nice. Easy choice for spring or summer.",04/06/21 23:21,foreignshores
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Mmm, the opening is so great, but the dry down is hideous! Smells like straight-up body odor to me because of the strong patchouli and vetiver combination.",03/23/21 15:58,DarlingNikki
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"After a while with this fragrance I decided I like it! It's perfect for out of the shower, work, or laundry day. It's super fresh with a little spice. Pretty basic but I think the kumquat gives it a little bit of an edge.",02/10/21 19:12,sminster
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"A surprising fragrance: not your typical fresh citrus-intensive summer scent. A light mandarin is noticeable but soon transforms into a soapy delight. It smells very clean. I don't think is generic at all because is pretty distinct. Longevity is fine in the tune of 6-8 hours but after the first 1-2 hours it is more close to the skin.

The bottle is very nice too. Overall a masculine soapy fresh scent that is perfect for the office or everyday. 10/10.",09/29/20 01:56,commodore64
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I have to admit, I really enjoy this fragrance. ""Generic"" is not the right word for this. It is a safe, fresh, and great smelling scent. I enjoy it right through the opening to the deep dry-down. I own and also like Gucci Guilty Pour Homme and the Intense version, but this one adds a different level to the fragrance.

Definitely get that strong fresh aromatics from the kumquat and the mandarin in the opening and then plays down to a really nice dry-down with that nice earthy/herbal blend.

I got complimented right when I walked into the office, really refreshing and inoffensive.

Longevity: 5-6 hours (Average)
Projection: 1.5-2 hours (Average)
Scent: 9/10 (Love)

Would recommend if you like the aspects of the original Gucci Guilty Line.",04/17/20 15:01,Yeoubi
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,Smells great. Clean. Should do well in a variety of situations based on first sniff. Have to do a comparison but reminds me of the original. The problem I have currently is the performance. Seems to die down after 1 to 2 hrs.,03/21/20 20:43,fuentesa
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I love what Gucci has been doing recently with releases like Gucci Guilty Absolute, Cologne, Oud etc.. but this one is pretty disappointing.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I am not that big a fan of the ""Gucci Guilty"" line of fragrances but while I was at the store I saw the green bottle of this new flanker & decided to give it a sniff! This is just my first impression off of a paper strip.. Right away I could tell that this new ""Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme"" was very connected to the original Gucci Guilty fragrances! The most recent flankers for men ""Gucci Guilty Absolu, Gucci Guilty Cologne"" strayed quite far from the original Gucci Guilty DNA & are quite daring fragrances! This Gucci Guilty Love Edition takes it back to the original Gucci Guilty DNA & smells a whole lot like Gucci Guilty Black to my nose! Very fresh, very green, very soapy, very Gucci Guilty! I do have to say this may be the most pleasant Gucci Guilty fragrance I have smelled as it maintains that pleasing Guilty DNA while coming off a lot less synthetic & a lot smoother.. There is a really nice citrusy kumquat note in there along with a nice clean patchouli.. It's really pleasant! If you like the scent of Gucci Guilty or Gucci Guilty Black but want something a bit less synthetic smelling, this might be for you!",03/07/20 23:06,dolcethadon
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I first stumbled upon this fragrance while browsing in my local Sephora. My first sniff on the test strip I was instantly hooked! To my nose it smells quite unique for a designer fragrance. I initially got like a pine smell but very natural pine not synthetic which I guess is from the rosemary. It somewhat resembles the dna of former Gucci guilty releases but not to the point of imitation.

I noticed a lot of people on here said the longevity is weak at least on my skin I got a good 6 hours before it faded to a subtle skin scent. FYI that was with only 2 sprays on my forearm. Once I try it again I’ll make sure to not have another fragrance on so I can spray my usual amount on my neck and wrists. Can’t wait until after this weekend’s cold front when the weather is much warmer that way I’m sure it will prove to be it’s best performance in the Florida heat.

All in all, so far this new Gucci guilty release seems like it will be a welcome addition to my collection.",03/06/20 17:27,Jalu819

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I was walking around Ulta looking for something new for my husband, and this one was my favorite among the new ones I tested. It stuck out to me because it is very fresh & clean and not headache inducing or sickly sweet. I think it would be great (i.e. non-offensive) in hot weather, good for if you're looking to add variety to your Light Blue, etc. summer rotation. I didn't catch any one note in particular, to me it smells like a man that has good hygiene. I quite like it.",02/21/20 09:26,aura_therapy
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I think it's really nice ,it is different enough and just smells great. It's a great smelling scent ,that's the point right? Sorry to all the frag nerds that want to smell like a piece of wood that was shoved up a donkey's ass and then dosed with gasoline and dipped in garlic butter , I just want to smell good for different moods and occasions and this is a damn good smelling scent. I think it veers off a bit from guilty black into something that is a little better, and it actually performs pretty well if you give an extra couple sprays.

It just smells super clean, but different from other standard clean scents.

Its worth trying if you're a fan of the guilty line",02/08/20 23:37,Savatage79
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Decent balance between sweet and fresh, but feels very generic. Reminds me of other scents without having much of a character of its own.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Really enjoying all the moves that the Gucci Guilty line has been making lately. Gucci Guilty Love Edition smells even better than it's predecessors. Gucci Guilty Love Edition probably isn't going to appeal to newer noses, and may fall short within the niche/premium/indy group. Despite its niche-like quality and smell for for being a designer fragrance.

But wow, Love Edition would make for a lovely casual or office spring or summer fragrance. Definitely going to cop myself a bottle once it hits discounters.

Performance/Longevity are above average. Most people will achieve an easy 6-8 hours with 4-6 sprays.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I want to make note that I believe the advertising campaign actually hints at the general feel of this scent overall which is of fresh clean laundry, almost detergent-like but not unpleasant. As such, it presents itself far better on fabrics than skin, where I notice it can have a harsher edge when smelled close. I’d also like to add now that I’ve had it a couple weeks, my girl actually enjoys it and wears it herself occasionally as well. She enjoys lighter fragrances and this fits that in the fact that its very airy and fizzy but pleasant.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"Initial impressions, I feel fairly middle of the road about this- I don’t think it deserves the low rating of 3.1 that it currently has, but I definitely wouldn’t be giving this a “love” either. In the grand scheme of mall designer fragrances, you could definitely do worse than this (Original Gucci Guilty, Im looking at you), but is in not way groundbreaking. Solidly mainstream, inoffensive, and unobtrusive, but doesn’t always mean bad. Very light and aromatic, you get more from letting it waft to you than sniffing yourself like a mad person. Average, or slightly above.

Edit: After giving this a try for the evening, it’s a take on the very familar orange vetiver men’s fragrance with a slight floral feel from something that adds a softness but just the slightest heft, however it definitely remains very airy and almost fizzy at times. There is a dose of nostalgia also because it does remind me in the dry down to some familar 90s men’s fragrance that I can’t place. There was a chill in the air tonight which Im sure quashed it’s performance, but still fairly fleeting. Only at the very end to I get that ambrox bite in the dry down, it keeps the rest real light but still noticeable until the rest of the notes drop off.",01/06/20 17:21,rmf1112

Gucci brought it back home to the original while refining the edges and adding some new character. I was never a fan of the original guilty, but since Gucci’s new direction I’ve been becoming a bigger and bigger fan. Gucci Guilty love edition is very reminiscent of the original but it’s been modernized with unique and quality notes that makes it standout from its predecessor.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme Gucci,"I just sampled the new Gucci Guilty Love Pour Homme! I have it on a blotter, and my forearm. Very nice! I definitely get vetiver and ginger. The ginger kind of smells like that designer generic smell. There is a very relaxing floral quality to this. All in all, I like it! But I am on the fence to purchase it! I'm walking around the mall to see if I like it enough to purchase. It is a limited edition.

Edit: On the blotter, the citrus notes have a cold feeling to them when I smell it. But that's all I get. On skin, the fragrance actually transforms into a relatively spicy green scent which a touch of floral. It is refreshing, and certainly ideal for anyone looking for a great scent to add to their collection! The bottle alone is beautiful! (My favorite color also). There is a slight, *slight* sweetness which may be from the benzoin. It has faucets that are similar to the ""Cologne"" with the rosemary and patchouli. Also similar to the way the patchouli is used in Absolute. The dry down right now is definitely patchouli and benzoin.

For a first impression, this gets an easy 8.5/10.

Edit #2: So I sprayed this probably 7-8 hours ago, and while it is a skin scent now, I still detect it on my arm. Wow! It is not radiating, but still, I'm shocked to see it there still ever the slightest!",01/02/20 10:43,Gumbinator

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"My thing about men’s fragrance is that I never feel like they stand out enough, THIS ONE DOES. I often say I like things that “stink” and I’ve found that usually means I like those aggressive and slightly offensive scents that give 70s/80s grandma/grandpa vibes. Dated I guess lol, gotta be the orris. Out of the bottle this is so loud and assertive, but the dry down is a nice masculine and super herbal vanilla vibe. I was just really surprised by this and I didn’t think I’d ever NEED a Gucci scent but too many people have told me I smelled good today and it’s went to my head I fear. Also I love the bottle so bad.",11/05/25 13:07,Oregontrailblazer

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"oh you gotta love it

this has been a good driver for me during the August - October stretch in Boston right before it gets cold enough to wear my cold weather fragrances, the first spray gives you a mystical opening that people either passionately love on your body or deeply hate with a passion. they either believe your scent is wildly feminine (who cares?) or teeter-tottering on masculine.

its creamy, its powdery, its beautiful, its easy on the nose, it checks every single box on the checklist and its absolutely worth smelling if you get the chance. this has singlehandedly chanegd my mind on all gucci fragrances, and encouraged me to grab Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Homme. whatever they're doing over at gucci, they have to keep doing it, because they'll keep getting money out of me, thats a promise.",10/29/25 20:52,coltranetv
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Cringe, this fragrance is goated whether or not you are a ""perfume afficionado"".

10/10",10/27/25 02:18,FujiMoto
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Guilt is not something that us, perfume afficionados, should deal with in this hobby. We shouldn't feel any form of guilt for liking or not liking a certain fragrance that maybe is highly acclaimed in the community, by friends, family, etc. Tastes differ, and so do preferences. And in regard of Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme, one of my father's favorite fragrances, I hardly feel as impressed by the scent. But I do see why it garnered so much attention.

The opening is properly intoxicating, with an immediate blast of orange blossom floral prowess, with a clear bitter facet and a potent white floral/jasmine sweetness. Warm, spicy, even slightly cinnamon-like nutmeg and pimento aid in keeping that white floral potency in check. But to no avail; the orange blossom eventually wins the round.

At the heart, things turn interesting, but not exactly in a good way. Under the load of orange blossom, a prominent powdery orris appears with a creamy/buttery accent as well. Hints of violet are also detectable. The osmanthus does seem to add some sweet fruitiness to the blend, but it's still unable to dethrone the main protagonist. However, it's at this point that I get a pretty strong hair fixative spray vibe which mildly burns the back of my neck as I breathe in. It's got that sharpness and chemical attributes which instantly reminded me of hair fixative. And while it's not enough to ruin or overpower the whole scent altogether, it's not trying to hide either.

As we reach the base, that hair fixative vibe does diminish, but the orange blossom is still very much present. Some patchouli brings a generous dosage of muskiness, but also sort of a medicinal nudge and a sweet undertone attributed to patchouli. The vanilla and benzoin do not seem as strong, bringing just a mild ambery warmth and powderiness. All things considered, I'm not the biggest fan of the scent structure, but it does gain a few extra points for being more unique on the designer scene than most other modern day entries. The overall blending and quality are nothing extraordinary, derived primarily from that hair fixative vibe that I get, which to my nose, doesn't hint at excellent quality, but rather at intoxicating attention-garnering composition. But then again, maybe my nose is betraying me by being too sensible (skill issue).

Speaking of attention-garnering, you'll be getting plenty of that with Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme, just there's a 50/50 chance that you'll get positive reactions. On my skin, this fume lasted for well over 24 hours. On my second wear, it even surpassed 34 hours. And I see that great longevity is largely the case for most people with Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme. So no worries there - this has plenty of fixatives to offer that performance, which might also be responsible for that chemical hair fixative vibe that I get. In terms of projection, I got a very solid 3+ feet for the first hour, with a very noticeable sillage. It would slowly mellow down to 2 feet across 2-3 hours, and eventually it would settle on less than one foot of projection by hour 6-7, still noticeable if you got close enough, e.g. sitting next to me.

While Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme is definitely guilty of having a load of fixatives for increased performance and intruding people's noses, it's not guilty of being Swiss Army Knife-level versatile. And that's primarily because of that performance. The scent itself is also, as mentioned, a bit more polarizing/intoxicating than your average designer (mostly due to that sharp fixative facet), so it limits the number of sprays. As a leisure wear, for clubbing or for more formal events, this would fit just fine. For office or school, or any context where you don't want (need) to stick out, keep the sprays on the lower side.

Verdict, your honor? Guilty of intoxication through the usage of fixatives. That's largely the only thing I find Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme guilty of. Do I find it guilty of being an irresistible scent? No. Do I find it guilty of being a high-quality creation? No. Do I find it guilty of huge success? Well... yes, it appears so. Amongst designers, Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme does manage to stand out, and I believe its slightly more polarizing (but not challenging) nature, paired with the performance are what drive the sales of this juice (and, well, the brand name too, as always). Do I believe it is a good value fragrance? Not really, but it could've been worse. Do I recommend it? Not really. So, therefore, I sentence Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme to a lifetime in my ""decent at best"" category. But what say you, people of the jury?

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,Nah this lasted all day through sweat and a full day at work i mean im impressed. Masculine white florals does the same thing as Reflection Man by Amouage but added vanilla and honestly much better projection maybe more ambroxan than reflection too.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"The opening is powerful and masculine — it really grabs your attention and feels like it’s going to be something special. Unfortunately, that excitement doesn’t last long. Very quickly it slides into a drydown that’s overwhelmingly heavy, dominated by an almost suffocating synthetic amber (or something similar). A friend of mine even said it reminded him of burnt tyre, and honestly, I can see why.

Such a pity they wasted such a promising start. The unbalanced middle and base notes completely ruin what could have been a great release. I was this close to buying it after testing it on my skin, but the drydown made me give up instantly.",10/20/25 12:29,miconi

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,Smells like reflection man by amouage undeniably. Maybe added vanilla but yeah this stuff will get you compliments i’m not a huge fan on this whole orange blossom DNA but i think it’s mass appealing and uniquely masculine with the florals. I’ll give it very high rating for this also being a recent designer release that actually lasts. The elixirs have been mostly a joke but this has quality performance and nuance for a designer release. Bottle is hideous tho and feel that’s 85% of the reason this isn’t being hyped up by everybody.,10/07/25 15:23,daggersack
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Elixir done right

This elixir flanker has gone to a different direction and smells very different from its predecessors just like what Dior did to Sauvage Elixir. Gucci Guilty Elixir is dense, woody, resinous and masculine floral. Think of Amouage Reflection Man with added resins and vanilla. A very complex and unique fragrance. This is what an elixir should be. This is trespassing into niche territory so be sure to sample first.

Absolutely a beast mode frag so 4 sprays is the very max you want to go! honestly, maybe even just 2.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"The price tag was one of the reasons I was holding back on it, as it was difficult to find at discounters. When I eventually picked it up, I was breath taken, I love the powderiness in this, it's a monster in performance. Im 3/4 of the way finished with the bottle, and it hasn't been a year since i've gotten it. I will not lie tho, I was surprised, I did not expect it to be as good as it is, because the other gucci colognes are very meh, but this is perfection.",10/06/25 11:50,QuantumBurrito_
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci is a funny brand. Loads of really basic generic stuff and every now and then a genuine niche-standard top-quality number. Guilty absolute. Intense oud. Guilty elixir de parfum. These gems get panned at times for their association with the blander stuff - but it’s crazy unfair as few designers offer up such ground breaking and unique scents.

Guilty elixir is pure quality from start to finish. It’s different, it’s complex, it’s a stand out in the sea of forgettable designer releases. It’s also not as expensive as you might think - honestly 2 sprays of this is more than enough for anybody! For me therefore the 60ml bottle is essentially a 120ml as I’ll use 4 sprays minimum of most other frags. It’s worth every penny and if this was a PdM or Amouage it would be held up as a modern classic. Fair play Gucci - you’ve done it again and this takes it place alongside Absolute in my collection.",10/05/25 10:31,DrDesign
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,@akos515 I agree this comes off as something I wore in the early 2000s (Gaultier 2). Not bad but not something I would wear or pay the price for.,09/25/25 20:45,hc123
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"In the opening I take a few whiffs and I tell myself this smells like a more wearable version of Ganymede, I search this site and what do you know Bisch who made Ganymede, made this lol. It’s getting a bit ridiculous now that I smelled several of his fragrances which all either smell very similar to Bois Imperial or Ganymede. After about a couple of hours it does morph and then it’s more of a wearable version, less metallic Pegasus, I think just like the reviewer below that it is much better that Pegasus. Pegasus comes off an old woman/aunt scent to me with a Bengay/ Icy Hot undertone. Definitely closer to those two instead of Reflection in my opinion. It is kinda sweet too which is just not my jam but this would be great if you’re in your 20s. I think once you’ve hit your 30s it’s time to level up to something extremely better than this. 7/10 which I not a bad score here I’m just very tough on scoring but it is very solid I do think Gucci could made a tad better but lessening the sweetness.",09/25/25 18:14,franchizzy

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"I recently purchased this one. I’ve smelled it when it came out back in the day and I didn’t like it at all.. I don’t know if my nose changed or my taste or what exactly changed but now I love it. To me this is so fresh and clean and there is something green in it. I don’t know why but I don’t get the extremely strong vanilla at all. I think that hast to do with the fact that I’ve had Covid like 4 times and since than something changed. (For example I used to think SWY intensely by Armani is way too sweet and now I can’t smell it that much).
So anyways I get do get the sweetness that comes after 5 min but it’s more like honeyed orange blossom if that makes sense. Also I didn’t know what it reminded me of but than I got it.. there is something extremely linden blossom or linden tea or like lindeny about it. I know there is no linden in it and I know it’s not exactly linden blossom but it kinda reminds me of linden blossom a lot. But yeah hey my nose is pretty weird the last 1-2 years so who knows maybe I’m the only one getting that linden blossom in it.
Performance is really good and price wise I got mine for 79€ on discounter which is pretty good !
It definitely is not for everyone. Not a safe blind buy!
Not many at all. I’d say it’s kinda unisex leaning more feminine. At least to my nose. But I do love it exactly for that. I’m kind of a lover of powdery slightly feminine fragrances.

One more thing is I usually don’t like neroli at all I can stand a bit of orange blossom but in general I don’t like it at all.. but in this one I love it!",09/20/25 15:13,Epiphany_
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"I blind bought it, since there was nowhere to test in my area and after getting it I was quite disappointed given the hype it's getting.

For me it smells like 70% vanilla, 20% orange blossom and 10% powder.
The smell is quite soft, powdery and sweet. To be fair it leans more feminine, I don't see masculine man wearing this and I did not get anything masculine in the notes as well. If I smell it on the street I would guess it's a woman passing by.

Not sure why all reviewers are hyping it so much, it is actually quite boring scent. I would not call it generic, since I did not smell anything exactly the same, but I would call it basic, linear scent. It does not change much from the opening, you just get a bit more vanilla in the mid and synthetic woods in the drydown.

It also has nothing in common with the actual Gucci Guilty line, this is entirely new fragrance that should be it's own line.

As a positive I would say the performance is very strong in terms of longevity and projection. If you like the smell it would be positive, but after a few hours it started to be quite annoying for me even though I sprayed it on my hand and it remains after wash.

For me this is hard pass - not worth the price and hype. Test it before buying.",09/19/25 18:38,Metaflow
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"This does not smell like Reflection at all??? This is way better in my opinion. Has this really addictive saffron/oud note (not real oud but a clean ""western"" oud accord, pretty subtle and airy) that I love.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"I love it, but it’s polarizing for sure. The opening has this talcum-like pungent wall that is impossible to ignore. It sticks to the inside of your nose and colors everything you smell for the next hour, or so. This is actually the magic of what happens later. This stuff clings to clothes, for days. I had my flannel hanging on a hook near my bedroom door, and with my window open, I would get these wafts as a breeze would come in, and it was so intoxicating each time. All different scents and smells throughout the house, melded with the sillage from my hanging shirt was exciting. Dinner that was cooking, cookies and a cake in the oven, freshly mowed grass, whatever else was going on and combined with this fragrance was.. magical. Is it nice to smell from someone 3ft away? Sure. But this is the one that gets you like a tractor beam from across the room.",09/09/25 14:07,McFinley

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"This is quite an interesting one..

I got a decant of this with an order last year in the middle of winter, knew nothing about it, tried it on strip first and thought it must be a summer fragrance, just because it has this bright, floral quality it. Somehow a bit got onto my hand and I was amazed at how ridiculously strong it projected off of it. I went outside at night, it was freezing cold and I could detect it very distinctly just from that little bit on my hand. I ended up giving the sample away, because at the time I was only interested in very dark, woody stuff, but it certainly left an impression on me.

I ended up testing it, among other stuff, on skin and it still blows my mind how much stronger it is than everything else. It's loud, but not screechy, bright, but not abrasive, sweet, but not overly so, floral, but not too feminine. Some of it got on my shirt, when I sprayed in store over a week ago and it still projects off of it. It takes several showers to get it off my skin completely.

Sweet, buttery, slightly bubblegummy iris/orris with orange blossom and vanilla - that's what it mainly smells like to me. It smells like a memory of summer in the middle of winter.

In my opinion a must try for anyone who is into fragrances. I'll probably not buy a bottle, because it's just too strong for my personal liking, but it's definitely something I want to smell again in the future.",09/06/25 14:37,OudThisOudThat

It is completely different than 90% of ""designer"" frags, lasts long too and has a healthy sillage.

What I dislike? Well... is hard to explain, is the hospital disinfectant note, the bitter notes?! The fact that in airports it gave me an ""unwashed"" feeling lol like feeling dirty... probably that's where ""guilty"" comes from.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Elixir pour Homme is an orange blossom, osmanthus, warm, soft spicy, powdery vanilla based scent. When you first spray it on the skin it’s more sharp and slightly bitter, but within half an hour it warms up and rounds op beautifully on the skin. The nutmeg, pimento seeds and the patchouli create a equally balanced counterpart for the florals, the benzoin, the orris and the vanilla.

I love the way it’s performing, this is truly a long lasting, strong projector orange blossom forward scent! I think ambrofix took care of that, but also makes the juice smell a bit unnatural, if you get what I am saying…

I have bought this perfume because my husband loves it as well, so we’re using it together. When I wear Gucci Guilty Elixir pour Homme, I like to layer it with one of my more natural, realistic orange blossom scents, but those don’t last. So if you have any photorealistic orange blossom scents that perform poorly but smell heavenly and you want to prolong their wear, layer them with this. You’ll get the best of both worlds, trust me!!

I am wearing it today layered with Sana Jardin’s Venus of Verbena and dare I say, I smell intoxicating! I have worn it in the past mixed with Miller Harris’ Le Jasmin or Guerlain’s Nettare di Sole and it cuts down on the amount of ambrofix I detect and adds more of a real scent of orange blossoms flowers. I don’t mix it with other fragrances because I find it too masculine on its own, it’s really unisex IMO, I mix it with other perfumes because I like it to smell less ambrofix heavy…

Also, be aware that this scent comes in a 60 ml bottle only and it’s quite pricey. It’s strong and has beautiful radiance in the air, thanks to ambrofix probably, but it’s on the pricey side of designers end!

I can’t comment necessarily on similarities to Amouage’s Reflection Man because I have only tested that one once, about four months ago, but if it’s indeed very similar to Reflection Man, it makes me feel it’s better value for money, since Amouage perfumes are super expensive.

I have Pegasus though and I can tell that these two share the same vanilla base, but Gucci Guilty Elixir is an orange blossom vanilla forward perfume, while Pegasus is an almond vanilla forward perfume. It is not the same thing, because florals/spices don’t smell like almonds/nuts. So no, not really similar!",08/17/25 03:27,Maya lilac

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Nose Note #456

I could guess this is Quentin Bisch, it fits his ""weird"" line of fragrances, at least to me they are weird and niche - Ganymede, Encelade, Experimentum Crucis and this one fits in the line. This is 100% niche fragrance, nothing like the usual Gucci about it (actually, if you consider the clothing style this might actually work, but doesn't feel like a usual Gucci fragrance which are usually mass appealing).
Yes, this is ""medicinal, metallic"" gunpowder-like and very sweet. I badly want to try Amouage Reflection Man, but I pray that it's nothing like this... This is typical beastmode Quentin Bisch. Out of all things it reminds me a lot of Rosendo Mateu Nº 5 Floral, Amber, Sensual Musk - it has this same play-doh plastic smell.

UPD. Now that I've bought Milestone Mouj Affection I do get the slight resemblence to Amouage Reflection Man. It's a weird scent to me.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Blind buy review: Smells like a milf drunk driving a 7 series bimmy through a corn field, while listening to Lana del Rey AND chief keef. This is perfectly unisex and not leaning masculine. Ignore the ""leading masculine"" votes, my opinion is true.
Longevity and sillage: ETERNAL.
Smell: First, medicine, metallic, candy, granny like. Later it gets more creamy and floral. Somewhere between HORRIBLE and MASTERPIECE.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Elixir is so good in my opinion that it becomes a problem lol. From the first spray, you get that a blast that just grabs attention and that almost has a floral root beer float feel. It’s seductive very intoxicating in a good way like you know you smell good, and the people around you know it too.This turns heads every time I wear it. Women lean in near me. Guys also ask what I’m wearing.This works so well with my skin chemistery. This elixir is just pure attraction in a bottle.If you're looking for something LOUD that speaks sensual heat, and sex appeal, Gucci Guilty Elixir's got it.
Top 5 in my collection 11/10. PS: This stuff has nuclear firepower if you dont like strong perfumery this is not for you. Also test it on your skin on paper is a whole other story",07/24/25 07:49,Yourperfumebuddy
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Opens sweet and creamy, has a medicinal scent that resembles ""Calpol.""
It's kind of boozy, yet fresh. White floral notes are apparent from the off.
Lots of vanilla and Tonka, also smells nutty.
Powdery notes develop, iris. It's reminiscent of spicy, animalic orange blossom. Very floral.
Aromas turn green but it's still creamy and nutty. Overall smells deep and rich.
Vanilla is constant and it only gets sweeter. There's a note which smells like almond before it develops a modern musk accord.

Performance is nuclear! This will fill a room and lasts on skin 12hrs+. (It's too loud TBH.)

Good for evening wear year round and would work well on a date, however someone commented that it smelt like an ""old ladies perfume"" so try before you buy.

I think it's very pleasant and the quality is good.
To me it's closer to Le Male than any of the previous Guilty offerings and I feel this is actually what Le Male Elixir should have smelt like.",07/22/25 02:13,Fortyfree
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Finally got around to getting my nose on this yesterday at Doha Hamad airport while killing time on a layover.

Yikes, the ""Play-Doh"" mentions are real. Certain vanilla fragrances really do go that literal Play-Doh route in their dry downs. Prada Luna Rossa Black also suffers from the same thing.

This is very effeminate, which is fine, but as with Tom Ford Noir Extreme (another sweet sugar bomb), this definitely strikes me as a firmly unisex fragrance to my nose.

This is more for the ""manicured/shaped eyebrows, off the rack skinny fit suit"" type of guy, in my opinion. I'm actually a bit stumped here. Do most men genuinely want to smell like this? This is very close to something akin to ""wasted chick at a nightclub wearing a vanilla gourmand"". To the point where I swear I have actually smelled this same fragrance DNA on women passing by on Saturday nights out. I wish Gucci would bring back something more in line with their older, marketed-for-men offerings, e.g., Envy, Pour Homme 1, Pour Homme 2, etc. I'm not some jaded Gen X'er btw, I'm young Gen Y, but yeah this is just so god damn sweet and crass to my nose...

Not going to give this a rating. Much like Quentin Bisch himself, I find this extremely overrated, yet at the same time, I also don't think the composition of the fragrance itself is terrible or anything.",07/20/25 16:54,delancy

The first time I tried it in store, the tester was pretty much empty and I spritzed on the tiniest touch possible, while testing other fragrances on my other arm. Surprisingly this was the fragrance that kept coming to my nose, despite how little I was able to spritz on. And what a magical smell and feeling it was…
Making this a signature scent - I LOVE it!

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Guilty Elixir is sweet, spicy, and even has a bit of a Play-Doh vibe—in the best way possible.

This one is really strong. The orange blossom hits immediately with a sweet, creamy feel, and there’s some spice in the background. Some people say it smells a bit like Play-Doh, and honestly, I get that, but in a comforting, pleasant way.

It’s creamy, playful, and sweet, with just enough freshness to keep it interesting. It’s like someone told Gucci to make Amouage Reflection but more mass appealing, and they nailed it. The vanilla here smooths everything out, making it easier to wear for more people. Honestly, I prefer it over Reflection Man.

Performance is nuclear. One spray lasts for days on clothes and projects strongly off the skin. This isn’t a scent that stays close—it makes its presence known.

It’s definitely an all-rounder. You can wear it year-round, but if it’s warm outside, don’t go beyond one spray. This stuff is potent.

I’d give it an 8 out of 10. Bold, sweet, and way easier to wear than some niche options. One of the best Guilty flankers out there.

In short, creamy, spicy orange blossom with a sweet vanilla twist. Think Reflection Man but more mass appealing. Nuclear performance. One spray is all you need. Eight out of ten.

I regret having to say so, I usually keep quiet about scents I don’t like.

The orange blossom and pimento give this fragrance a sweet sharpness, while the vanilla and bonzoin make it well rounded and quite bouncy. For me, it is like someone took the classic Gucci Guilty, and turned up the saturation and volume on all the notes.

It performs well, but living in a hot country the only issue with this is that it falls apart in the heat, becoming quite sickly and headache inducing.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Elixir was a fragrance i was very curious about, especially amongst recent designer releases, thanks to the largely positive feedback it received. The fragrance is compared to Amouage Reflection Man, which itself is often compared to the original Le Male so i aproach the scent with this mindset. To further add to the string of comparitions, just days ago i tested the most recent iteration of Gucci Guilty Love Edition and that one also pops up firmly in the “reminds me of” section.

Before i even smelt the fragrance, in my mind i was already preparing a very positive impression and my wallet for a new purchase in the future. In an unexpected manner, i have to say that Gucci Guilty Elixir is not IT for me. Infact, i prefer all the above mentioned fragrances and i’ll explain why.

By order of which i mentioned each of them:
1. Amouage Reflection Man is the classiest of them all, its smooth, its regal and its the embodiment of quality when it comes to this scent direction. What i appreciate about Reflection is a sort of vintage aura that the fragrance gives off to me. Very Chanel, almost aldehydic type vintage. Fresh and bright done with high class, an aristocrat's day time scent.
2. Le Male is the most popular of them all, a trendsetter and generation definer. Le Male pointed the way towards the future of men’s perfumery by popularising traditionally non masculine notes in a men's fragrance. Maybe it wasn’t the first, but one of the first to do it on such a mass market scale.
3. Gucci Guilty Love Edition 2025 is the most modern of them all. Its that young man that has a genuinely kind heart and inviting smile. Equipped with all the up-to-date ingredients and aromachemicals, its a modern fougere that’s bright, pleasant and a good vibes fragrance.

Guilty Elixir is sharper then all three of them, more agressive, more synthetic and surprisingly less detailed. To my nose, it lacks the refinement of Reflection Man and it lacks the casual pleasantness of both Le Male and Gucci Love Edition. Its mainly a white floral and green scent but the accords are ""thorny"" and the soapy aspects are scratchy. Picture sticking your nose directly into a bottle of very concentrated floral fabric softener. Only after a good while does the vanilla move forward but its too little, too late. In the first phases, the vanilla doesn’t manage to roundout the fougere elements as it did in Le Male, because they are too sharp to my nose.

I believe it beats the trio in terms of performance but that is no longer the most important benchmark for me. Its a pass and im glad i didn’t blind-bought it.

P.S. My God, its done by Quentin Bisch. This guy just cannot catch a break from me. If i knew who created the scent before i wrote my notes, i would have questioned myself if its subconscious negative bias against him.",05/25/25 01:26,NoirMemoir
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"This is my first encounter with Gucci, at least on my own skin.
It's the kind of scent that makes you obsessed with smelling your wrist. I got a sample from my perfume shop and I couldn't help but buy a full bottle.
It has good persistence, not the best sillage but still good, and a smell that's unlike anything else that I've smelled. Still a designer smell though, so nothing super fancy. The price could be maybe 50% lower.",05/23/25 15:37,cypriant
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Another Bisch bomb. Unfortunately my own tastes still don’t line up with most of his work and the same is true here. I love Le Male, and I’m fond of Reflection Man, but this is very overpowering to my nose. It feels like every element is cranked up to the max, and it comes across as a very confusing soup of notes. Much too strong for me sadly but I can imagine it could smell nice in the sillage for a lot of people. 6.0/10",05/22/25 17:27,Scentered1997

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Surprisingly very nice. The best Gucci fragrance I've smelled (not a fan of most of them). It reminds me of a very familiar DNA, I've never smelled Pegasus or Reflection Man 45 so I mostly get pieces of Le Male here. It doesn't really remind me of MYSLF, maybe a tad in the dry down but this is way sweeter and more complex. It reminds me of a new car smell, it's very sweet with a lot of vanilla but it's still a very masculine smell. It has some nice spice and the white floral gives it a soothing, clean smell. The orris is not the star here, this is not a Dior Homme. It's just a background nuance.

Pleasantly surprised with this overall. I'd consider this about a 90% mass-appealing scent, some might find it cloying or a little strange but it's not gonna offend anyone. If you're a fan of any of the scents its compared to I'd reccomend trying it. This smells like how I'd imagine the inside of a millionaire's car would smell.

I bought a second bottle. Just for me.
So, Mr. Quintín, I owe you an apology. This fragrance is beautiful. Is... unique and if the price is fair is one of the best Elixirs ever.

Changes, stays, is discreet so overspraying is not needed because it STAYS.

Careful as it's easy to go noseblind to this.

9/10 and yes I will repurchase. Use it in colder weather, over 23 degrees Celsius it starts to lose its magic.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Elixir is an extremely strong, syrupy and spicy barbershop fragrance. It is not blind by safe, nor would I recommend it for summer heat. With that said, 1 single spray is perfect to last all day if you enjoy this power house.

I am pleased with my blind buy, but the strength definitely took me off guard at first.

FWIW I ordered because I love orange blossom, but it mostly reminds me of JPG right off the bat, then obviously Pegasus, followed by reflection. it is far more spicy on my skin than it is orange blossom. I would say GGE most closely aligns with Pegasus and certainly performs better than my PdM batch (which is lighter and more floral).",04/12/25 14:53,dudebro

Gave me rubbery, cardboard, & licorice vibes. The clerk at the counter even said.. “This one is an acquired taste. To me.. It’s really stinky” I will say the performance is amazing.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Upon spraying my sample, I was immediately reminded of Reflection Man. The opening of this is harsher, spicy, and not nearly as smooth. I could almost tell this was a Quentin Bisch creation. This even has the same sort of bubblegum sweetness I detect in Reflection. That being said, while I do enjoy this fragrance, I'm not sure who I'd recommend this to. It's far too expensive for what is essentially a dupe, and Reflection Man can be found for about the same price on discounters.

If you've never smelled Reflection Man, I highly recommend sampling it. It's superior in pretty much every way. Nevertheless, if this was much cheaper, I'd probably buy a bottle. This is a clean, sweet, and pillowy masculine floral fragrance. It's like an orange blossom fabric softener. Excellent performance and longevity; I can still smell this after showering.

Update: I detect a very synthetic, weird ""chemical"" note in here that is very disruptive. This only makes me want to own Reflection Man even more.",03/26/25 22:43,Zircon

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Ima big fan of Quentin Bisch so I try to buy or sample all of his work . Influencers been peddling this hard af. This got great reviews from the respectable reviewers with integrity who aren’t paid bots. #1 I was open minded and positive. #2 excited for anything Bisch and #3 I have the biggest sweet tooth when it comes to Parfum that I venture further into fem leaning unisex than most hetero cis American men will go (Arab men don’t genderize fragrances and will wear florals, Western heterosexual men won’t bc of cultural stigmas) BUT I will only go so far. And this BEYOND my limits , as there is nothing remotely unisex or potentially non feminine here. This smells like someone grandma from the 1920s. Maybe Bad Bunny in his skirt would wear this but I don’t see how any intact man with a hanging pair who is still producing semen would ever like this . (FYI : I often like quality fem parfums bc they are more interesting and creative that basic azz medicinal woods and barbershop axe fragrances ). Busch was trying to hard to be too edgy and too revolutionary, as this is rather revolting , putrid, jarring and obnoxious. Even if I had a bloody gash , I still wouldn’t wear this rubbish. What is this juice ? It seriously smells like someone’s 90 year old grandma who hasn’t showered in days and covers it up in cheap floral perfume she found 80 years ago at a garage sale. It also smells like burning plastic , I get a jergens cold cream accord . There’s also this cough syrup accord. Everything you would never want to smell like is present. I’m not too picky and can find beauty is almost anything but this has no redeemable qualities. What was the point of making this ? The ironic thing is , this is the best performing Parfum from any designer house I ever smelled released in the past 17 years. Of course it would be , it’s the most atrocious smell. While I only bought 3 Samples from Gucci , I realized that the best thing about this juice is that it can’t clear out any room you are in . So next time I go on a date and I’m not into the dumb fluzzy, I’m gonna start spraying this all over and start having a loose wrist. Or even better, when I want a seat on the train,or to have nobody sitting next to me, I’ll just douse myself in this and clear out the entire train court . So it seems there is in fact a purpose for this geriatric gash lubricant . I’m sure granny can really clear out all the cocoons , moths, and spiderwebs down there with this a-bomb!",03/17/25 23:53,Ambergriz
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"Honestly, this is interesting. Not because it is good but because it shows how quickly and easily you can massacre a masterpiece of a DNA. Take Reflection Man, add every single synthetic vanilla-benzoin sweetness you can find and you get this. Synthetic and overbearing and gives me headaches because of the sweetness and synthetic notes in there. Not good, do not believe any influencer that says you should perefer this over Reflection. Very bad, very dissapointing.

I think this is one of the scents that just phenomenally compliments my body chemistry. Easily one of my favorites. It's juicy, floral, and there's a slightly dirty element to it. Not dirty in the stinky element but think like aged suede in an older car that has a hint of vanilla soda or something sweet spilled on it. I can see the chemical element that others are commenting on and I feel like that is tied to the spiced element. It ages out as you wear. It's not really fresh at all and I actually dig it.

Presentation: sucks. A flimsy, lame bottle, small and light weight. Cap marked just on top ""Coochie"".
Atomizer is good, nice mist.

Edit: after used my bottle, this is geriatric cream, Bengay style creams, hotel disinfectant.
Only covered in some nasty synthetic flowery smell - yeah, nobody will get your ""you smell good"" = - minus aura points.

Smell: a snake, but a plastic like snake which was raised by Jared Letto. Something from Blade Runner. Plasticky flowers, sweet but very clean. Aggressive smelling, like a poopy diaper in the face lol

Performance under an ""elixir"", more EdP. Lasts longer on clothes.

Anemic, plastiky, flowery green little poopy snake raised by Jared Letto on a his magical island.

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"The opening is ruff harsh chemical garbo. Even smelling the atomizer is a little off-putting. After about 30 minutes you start to get the orange flower fresh powdery DNA known to most from Reflection Man. That opening is where I get the heavy synthetics which throws my nose off. Unlike other AkigalaBISCH creations that keep that energy until the dry down, this smooths out a lot. I've been wearing Space Juice Ganymede for the last week so this is nice and smooth for you, carbon-based life forms. I really dig this. You also get this nice vanilla that compliments the composition and syncs everything. If you can get this for about $120, its a great fragrance. Its not bischmode, but it was made to last and project like crazy. A few sprays go all day so that dinky little 60ml should last a country mile unless it's your signature. My viewpoint is skewed because Reflection Man EDP was that token ""grown-up work scent"". In contrast, I think this can be pulled off by younger guys as well as older men. Since the performance isn't a problem, this is an all-year, any situation scent. I think Bischypoo found a way to strike a happy medium between great performance and sacrificing your nose for the least amount of time. Sample worthy since you can find it at your local Macy's counter. Check discounters for deals. Do not pay $183 for this when it can be had for a generous discount.",01/23/25 14:39,Salohcin2148
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"I was surprised when I first sniffed this at a Notino store in Prague. It was love at first sight.

Since I heard it was similar to Reflection Man, I ordered a sample to compare. However, I prefer the Gucci fragrance - so I bought a bottle of it. Now I am comparing them side by side. Initially they are very similar, but as the fragrances settle on my skin there is a clear difference. Gucci goes in a sweeter direction and starts to smell like an icy, medicinal cherry-esque candy of some sort, while Amouage is more floral with woody and herbal hints. I would say that the Amouage fragrance is the cleaner of and brighter of the two, while the Gucci fragrance is heavier and sweeter. It is like a combination of Reflection Man and Guerlain l’Homme Ideal.

Performance is great. I sprayed like 1,5 sprays and could still smell it quite a lot 12 hours later.

I love wearing this. It is very versatile and I think many people enjoy smelling this in the air. 9,5/10.",01/23/25 09:16,Lukasssss

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme Gucci,"This juice wasn’t even on my radar. Honestly, I only bought it because I work with a younger girl who’s also into fragrances, and she just cannot stop raving about this one. Every single time I see her, she shoots me the question : “Have you tried it yet? Have you tried it yet?!” So, to preserve my sanity, I caved and blind-bought it.

The parcel arrived yesterday morning, and I’ve been wearing it non-stop since then. I’ll admit, based on the packaging and the look of the juice, I was expecting something…different. But hey, I’m not mad at it.
Is it a masterpiece? Hmm, the jury’s still out. Compared to the rest of my fragrance wardrobe, it hasn’t yet made me want to build it a shrine, but it’s definitely not bad.

I’ve decided to give it a proper test run—a full week straight—to see how we vibe. Who knows, maybe it’s one of those slow-burn relationships that gets even better with time.

I am shocked they discontinued this. I like the OG bloom too for its powdery cleanness, but you could call that boring, while this one is special, unique and interesting without being too odd or unpleasant.",05/14/25 10:21,RemyRedrum
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"Do ppl not like these type of fresh floral, green gardeny scents anymore?
Cuz this and Florabotanica are my absolute favorite spring/summer fragrances.
And they’re both discontinued! WTH
They’re both so pretty and so fresh and I always get compliments when I wear them.

You know that feeling when you’ve just taken a shower and you want to prolong that freshness but still want to smell posh? That’s basically what these two fragrances do for me.

Acqua Di Fiori smells nothing like the original Bloom. It’s so complex in a niche way but still gives the feeling of simplicity. It’s simply fresh, green, white floral with some clean white musk enhanced by Iso E Super.
What you get is an after rain, wet garden filled with Galbanum, Cassis and freesias.
There’s a slight pencil sharpener note that comes and goes that I usually don’t like in other fragrances. But in this one it kinda enhances the experience for me!

I like the fact that it’s an EDT so I can freshen up every now and then when I’m out and about.

But the fact that it’s an EDT means it has a weak to moderate longevity.
Silage is great for the first hour or so.
But then it turns into a beautiful skin scent which I don’t mind at all.",04/25/25 06:32,Jarrah

Well, I thought I made a big mistake first... the same green notes turned annoyingly sharp.

The initial fresh garden notes are beautiful: green, fresh, light and decadent at the same time. But it very quickly turns too musky on me, and the lovely green notes fade into the background. As a result it starts to smell fairly synthetic and soapy. Within an hour, it smells like a cabinet that people store all of the random lotion and potion and cream gift sets they receive at white elephant christmas parties, just an amalgam of generic musk with some floral notes.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This flanker strays the farthest from its parent frag -- it is the blonde son in a family of mostly brunette daughters. Cassis lends a leafy, lush, vegetal quality. The florals I get are mostly tuberose and honeysuckle with noticeable hints of lily of the valley and freesia. However, the galbanum and cassis are clearly the stars here. This flanker can easily be enjoyed by those who typically do not enjoy the basic white florals and/or green frags (living proof ✋🏻). The citrus notes are just enough to make this frag slightly juicy and sparkling, not sweet or ""fruity"" like other popular white florals. I get just a hint of sandalwood, and the slight musky-woodiness of Iso E Super is undetectable until after at least the first hour of wear (if at all).

A very lovely lady stranger was selling this 100ml bottle brand new (opened, unused) in box for $50 online. Came to read reviews here, saw the above.. BOOM. Sold. For $10 she said she would deliver it to me today. Take my money! I even got a hug from said Mrs when I admitted I use perfume as a distraction to get my mind out from drowning in grief. We just found out some news about my dad, so I'm preparing my perfume stockpile now. This is the perfect ""happy & content"" scent I needed and reading all your reviews will keep my mind occupied when required. So thank you to everyone who leaves reviews here. 🤍 Keep em coming!

Thank you Salaryman, if you ever read this.. Gucci Bloom Aqua di Fiori will absolutely be my new forest scent. I'll be going home to be with family and staying as long as I need to. Spring is coming and I'll be exploring the forest I adventured in daily all through my childhood and youth, into my teenage years. I'm 41 now, I hope those mountains welcome me as they always did. I'm looking forward to being amongst the trees and nature that were my family when things at home were rough.

It's really disappointing, it smells predominantly dusty middle-aged woman (not spicy enough to be considered 'old woman', for whatever a compliment that is...) And that's the majority smell - the other smell was like a leafy, wet petal-something, I can't even tell what kind of petal because it smelled more like damp herb if I'm honest. You'd smell weird and not particularly 'floral', fresh or green with this on.

This Aqua flanker is not for me and I kind of knew that going in smelling it because of the top note of galbanum, I'm not a big fan of it. Aqua uses galbanum w/ a very heavy hand and this smells very masculine to me because it is so green. If you love green florals and want something that mimics crushed plants and crushed flower stems this is a good one to sample. I agree w/ the reviewer below it has a very spa vibe but I hate spas, my sister is always trying to drag me to one but I can't stand that spa smell.

Edit: Later this evening. I personally find this scent very unisex, and it could be a white floral a man might like to wear if they enjoy white florals. Heck, I think it would be a major step up from the male fragrances I smelled today. No wonder I give my husband the unisex fragrances I sample that don't work out for me.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"〰✴A green and delicate bouquet✴〰

The name of this perfume literally means 'flower water', and I think it suits the fragrance very well. As you can tell from the notes it is a predominantly a floral fragrance, but also very fresh and green. I've noticed that a lot of people find the green note annoying, as if it smells like grass and nothing else, but I don't perceive it that way. I can't understand the single notes very well, but I can clearly smell flowers and leaves. Very youthful, elegant and discreet. Overall I find it a pleasant scent, but I have to say that I’m not particularly impressed, definitely. I find it nice, but not incredible or unforgettable. It smells good and the bottle design is amazing, but it's not enough to convince me to buy it. Also, I have to mention sillage and longevity are pretty low for the brand and the price.

Setting & feelings: You are having a picnic with your close friends in a park near a pond, having a good time. While talking you absent-mindedly pick up some flowers and blades of grass, playing and rolling them between your fingers.

Overall: 6/10

I love green freshies and I thought this would be the perfect addition to my collection. I got the travel size roller ball before pulling the trigger on a full bottle, and found it really pleasant.

But this was not nearly as 'natural' as I was looking for, if that makes sense. It smells like a perfectly manicured garden, rather than a natural meadow.
If you're looking for a perfectly manicured garden without being too sweet, this is perfect.
But I found myself wishing for a little more zing of morning dew / agarwood / aldehyde or even cedar / vetiver, to give it some more damp soil or wild burdock vibe. (think Miu Miu L'eau Bleue)

I enjoyed smelling it on my wrist, but it didn't last terribly long and wasn't anything 'special' in comparison to my other green freshies. So I wound up giving it to a friend.

It's really gentle and unobtrusive. Neutral enough to not offend anyone. I feel like you could wear this pretty much anywhere; Lunch date, office, church, at home on a rainy day... even the gym, if that's your thing!

If I had more disposable income, I'd consider buying another bottle just to have, because it IS nice, just not nice 'enough' to justify the purchase if it doesn't ""wow"" me.",06/15/21 09:23,VictoriaSmells

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"A few days ago I walked into Sephora and asked to test the original Bloom. I'd seen it everywhere and wanted to finally smell it for myself. It was nice enough, but very familiar and too linear for my taste. For whatever reason, the saleslady handed me a tester strip of Acqua di Fiori, too, and even with my mask on, I knew I was going to have to get it. I ordered a smaller bottle off eBay once I got home, and now that I've had the opportunity to smell it on myself, I wish I got the larger size! The best way to describe this scent would be ""lush.""

I've been looking for a green, floral fragrance that still manages to be fresh and bright, and Acqua di Fiori is all of that. It's not exactly aquatic, but there's a certain juicy tartness that permeates all of the greenery. While I do enjoy green fragrances that have notes of fresh-cut grass, this is not one of them. This smells like white flowers, stems and all, doused in dew and citrus. A very modern, lush green.",06/04/21 15:36,thinkblot
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"The opening....I get a citrus/galbanum vibe....then in the middle phase and dry down....all lily of the valley/freesia....

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"It is green and fresh and drys down aquatic on me. TF Mandarino di Amalfi Acqua is similar but the TF is spicier and is more masculine, using traditional terms.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"I was on the hunt for a green fragrance that reminded me of fresh cut grass and rain. When I came across the Bloom range in Ulta and first smelled Aqua di Fiori I knew I had to have it, it was exactly what I'd been looking for.
This fragrance opens with a bright, super green punch - a lush field of grasses, clovers, and wild flowers after a fresh rain.
It begins to settle into a slightly sweet, fresh white floral dream, maintaining a zingy freshness - like a green Aqua di Gioia.
I can really smell the Lily of the Valley on my skin, beautiful!
It retracts into a skin scent on the dry down that smells like fresh linens on the lawn, relaxing under a shaded tree on a cool spring afternoon.
It only lasts a few hours on my skin, but I love it so much I don't mind respraying. Plus, I prefer this one for daytime and like to switch to another fragrance for nighttime, so it works out. It's very feminine but could be worn by anyone! It could work nicely in an office as it's not overpowering, yet it's also a great spring/summer date fragrance and can even be worn on a run to the grocery store.
I can't stop wearing this!",05/12/21 13:15,Mrs.Kingsley99
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This is also my first Gucci and a blind buy which I strongly suggest you don’t do. It’s beautiful but on me it’s nothing but green green green, galbanum and a little sandalwood. I respect who likes these accords but it’s really not my taste, I thought I would get more florals, the jasmine and tuberose to be exact. Longevity and sillage are not good. After a few minutes you can feel it only close to the skin.",05/10/21 08:49,guimaraesalves
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This is comes out all galbanum on my skin! So different than Gocce di fiori from same line that truly adore for its all fresh blossoms and blooms with natural sweetness. None of the flowers show up for me in this one, maybe the slightest of honeysuckle if the semi bitter galbanum and cassis ever leave me!
This is good too though, reminiscent of the nicest chypres like Chanel n19 and Ralph Lauren Safari. It is like walking into a green meadow with knee high wild grass in morning fog. Just don’t expect an overly feminine fragrance as any of the other blooms.
I like the bottle and the greenery on it that sets it apart from all the pink, yellow and bordeaux of the other bloom bottles, consistent with the juice.",03/30/21 13:43,Scandipersian

I love that first opening,I feel like I'm in a cool forest of fresh green ferns. It's extremely addictive for me. I love it when I get a waft.

Bloom is beautiful,this is another level. I've have Eau Coriandre but this is a modern day version.",03/09/21 09:35,Ajaycheshire
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"Very different from Bloom, honestly the connection between the two is simply that both are floral, although this one is leaning heavily on the green side. It's wearable, but I'm not a fan of Lily of the valley and IsoE in general, so it's a pass for me. It could work for people who want something green, but milder green than Vent Vert, Chanel No. 19, etc. Sillage is minimal after the first 10-15 minute blast. Interestingly, at the beginning it made me think of Mugler's Womanity (I have no idea why, as they don't share any common notes) - somehow like a watered down Womanity, with floral notes and a good amount of conformity.",03/01/21 05:14,hnica
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This is my first Gucci and I blind bought it for my birthday.
It opens with a fresh, natural, white bouquet. Very comfortable, the kind of scent you feel when you crush fresh, green leaves. Then, it starts to develop to a woody skin scent, with a hint of something citrusy, with the white bouquet showing up here and there.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori is a fragrance that makes me happy, very uplifting. This is not for that days you want to feel sexy (in a conventional way) but the special moments you want to sit and read a book with a mug of tea, looking at your blooming garden, without make up and having your hair on a messy bun.

The ad with the actresses bathing in that lovely lake surrounded with flowers is pretty accurate to my experience, but in no way GBAF is an aquatic fragrance. I'm testing on a very hot summer season here in South America (sorry my english btw).

Bad thing is, it doesn't last that long and sillage is more intimate (which can be a good thing for some, myself included).",02/27/21 07:22,anidamasceno
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This was a blind buy and I do not recommend anyone to blind buy it. I expected green fresh grass with white florals or fresh summer garden. Instead I got bitter smell of a freshly cut flower. Sharp and bitter. Also very weak longevity.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This is a really good modern chypre. I love it. It’s heavy, thick, weird, but not stuffy like some can feel... when I say heavy, maybe I should say deep/rich? Not sure. it’s a polarising scent, but if you love chypres that’s kind of part of the charm. We don’t want safe sweet perfumes! Something about your look should turn heads, it’s awesome when it’s the perfume.
This is very similar to Stella McCartney L.I.L.Y. (another modern chypre but now almost a decade old), and a bit of a distant nod to Chanel 19° (My #1!). They’re going for the same vibe as the classic green bombs (even Mitsouko a bit), and I think they did a great job with this one. This is actually my first Gucci perfume ever!",02/12/21 09:21,TackyAki

Or the smell of torn stems while clearing a brush. Strangely agricultural. Not unpleasant, but not my personal preference.

The white florals here aren't mainstage like they are in Nettari di Fiori, instead they play a supporting role to the dominant green notes.",01/26/21 18:22,Cozychamomile

The opening notes are delightful, very fresh, mint leaves accord for some reason is what I sense. Later it gets a bit sweet on my skin, as every perfume I tried so far, but it doesn't bother me, wanting more and more to smell it all day long. Too bad it last at best 3h on my skin. On hair has a slightly longer longevity.
Suitable for people that don't like sweet perfumes. I'm still exploring this perfume world, the starting point was 2 years ago after I realized that I cannot wear sweet perfumes during work hours, as it catches my attention too many times in not a good way.",01/10/21 13:55,Rssr

This note shows up days later on clothing, definitely not right away but the same aroma I got from the #19. I don't like it so this Bloom flanker may get swapped to.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This scent makes me think of conifer woods. It's green and strange.

I was on the fence about buying it. I enjoyed it but I couldn't decide if its something I want to smell like. It's definitely not for people who just want to smell pretty - this is a strange, unusual scent that will definitely draw attention.

I ended up getting it and I do use it sometimes, but it's been in my shelf for two years and I'm still not done with 50ml bottle. I think it's the sort of scent you need to really like to actually reach for. It's not a ""perfect (insert season) scent"" or something that just fits a certain occasion. It will always stand out.

In terms of longevity and sillage, it's decent. That's probably because it's such a weird scent that it's hard to not pick it up, even after a long time.",11/18/20 12:23,TerrCasey
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This is mostly white floral to me and I was hoping for something a bit more green, grassy, leafy.

Also it seems to be quite faint on me.",11/14/20 19:37,frusia
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This scent is amazing. I bought after I tried it one year ago. It's light yet it so lush and floral. I did not know that I had a soft spot for galbanum and honeysuckle. It starts out crisp and then it is drying down into this beautiful summer field of flowers. It's also quite aquatic which makes me think of walking through a garden during summer rain. It kind of captures the moment when rain amplifies every scent that is lingering in the atmosphere. It's very sensual yet very natural. I can not wait to wear it for warm summer days.

But....the longevity is bad. Have not tried to overspray or spray it on clothes yet so it might be a way to keep the scent. Maybe a body lotion might keep it at place as well. Because I do want to have this scent on me for way longer than 3 hours.
But honestly it is quite terrible that such a beautiful scent has weak longevity. Especially when I think of its price tag!",10/08/20 23:03,Woodamber

I just love how it is a warm floral which makes it more accessible throughout Spring and Summer. Kudos in adding the top notes of Cassis and Galbanum which lend an element of depth and sophistication that you don't normally find in a white floral.It is like standing in the middle of a lush garden in full bloom after the rain. You can appreciate the floral notes but there is the smell of earth and sun as well.
The sillage is great so you can spritz in the beginning of the day and take your sun-drenched garden with you all day long.",08/25/20 11:23,StillJuliaGayle
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"Okay, I am going to say this and then quickly duck out of harm's way, but... the opening of this smells like a German ecologically friendly dish soap...
please don't hurt me...

Let me save myself a bit though and say that it's not the fragrance's fault at all. It just so happens that this mix of notes seems to be popular in some German 'close to nature' household brands as well. Just that combo of Lemon, Lily of the Valley and Honeysuckle.
And it's just the first few minutes. The dry down I like a lot better. I never smelled galbanum leaf on it's own, but by method of exclusion, knowing that what I'm smelling is neither of the other notes, I have to say, well... seems I like galbanum leaf? And it goes amazing with the dried down citrus notes.

It's actually lovely. Clean, fresh and a lot of... errr... natural springtime greenery? It does remind me a lot of taking a springtime walk in Europe. Everything is budding, first tiny yellow and white blossoms on some of the trees, young grass reclaiming the thawed ground, a few first spring flowers here and there. Clean mild air, that carries the fragrance of new life and the promise that winter is finally gone.

I don't dare really judge the longevity. In hot humidity it lasts maybe an hour. I mean all of it is so gentle and fragile, you cannot really blame it for not standing a chance in hot and sweaty conditions. However, if I was currently living in Europe I would totally consider this for a no-brainer everyday springtime pick and it might last a lot better under those moderate climate conditions. Sillage is also very soft on me. It's probably a fragrance that you'll mostly be wearing for your own pleasure. In that sense it's very office/school safe.

Anyway, solid like from me.

Edit: I ended up getting a full bottle. The heat is just picking up in Mumbai and this is just such an incredible uplifting refreshing relief from the muggy hot air all around. I really don't mind spraying more often to up the longevity.",08/05/20 06:15,latafan
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"I got this one because I was looking for a green type of scent for summer. And because of the bottle, the bottle its beautil!

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"I find this much nicer than the original ""Bloom""! The original Bloom is a really straightforward, minimalistic, white floral smell. This flanker has many more green notes that are both lush and dry at the same time, I find it very well balanced with the citrus notes dancing on top. The white florals take a backseat. It smells very aromatic, with the other notes that round out the smell so that it's not sharp. Still, with all that is going on, it's not messy, but actually quite well blended to create a distinct fragrance. The dry down at first reminds me of Comme des Garcon's Lily, then it develops into a thinner ""Gucci"" musk that I reminds me of Gucci Envy. I was really surprised by this--there are so many Gucci fragrances that feel rushed or unfinished to me! 9/10

This is a refreshing EDT that's green through and through, but tempered in a way that I feel I could wear all year long. It's very reminiscent of flower stems and water in a vase that has infused for a day. Dewy cassis buds and delicate honeysuckle bring a joyfulness to the vibrant green galbanum top notes. Lily-of-the-valley gives this a crisp floral feel.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"Deep green; walking in the woods, inhaling the scent of the earth and soil and the half composted leaves from last autumn. Springtime coming, leaving the winter behind.
I love this. Many perfumes I have, love or like, are for me versatile to have most seasons, all hours of the day or night. But this one, at least for me, is really really a springtime fragrance. By springtime then, I mean from the very time you can see that the days slowly become a little longer, it can still be pretty cold outside. And then I love to wear it until the summer comes, and even on cooler nights in summer.
(I love the original Bloom as well, but it’s different.
Nettare di Fiori I don’t like at all: too strong, too mainstream - first time I had ever thrown a sample in the garbage bucket...🙂 but that is me, maybe not you.

However, if you love Bloom/the other flankers, don't blind buy this. Acqua Di Fiori is very light and pales in comparison to the other lush, white floral powerhouses in the range.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,This one doesn't lead with tuberose like the other ones do which is a very velvet rich smelling flower but most people don't like the waxy sharpness it has I think the original bloom is beautiful because of the tuberose being so dominant but bloom fiori leads with galbauam leaf which has a wett meadow & dewy green forest scent but minus the heavy woods. Men this could definitely go unisex because of the freshness it has and I think this one is the best one out of all of them. I have so many perfumes from 90's favs (CK escape) to current niche gourmands (BR540) to my current signature (Armani rose de arabie) and everything in between but NONE of them smell as FRESH as this I find myself reaching for it more than any other perfumes I have..hands down it's in my top 5 must have a back up list and yes I'll still be reaching for it in the winter becauseto me smelling fresh shouldn't just be a spring time thing smh.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"i've been wanting to have this since it first came out. i don't like other in the Bloom serie, because they are tuberose scents and i do not like tuberose. this one was love from the first sniff. i do not smell tuberose here, even if i do see it in the notes, and i am always very sensitive to tuberose - to a point than no scent with tuberose works for me. i have no idea how they managed to hide tuberose in this one, i quess here it just gives that full-bodied feeling, otherwise this green scent would be too flat. anyway, this is a modern green scent. simple and linear, strong and long lasting to me. it smells wet forest (no pine trees, just decicuous-tree forest,in a shadow, not in a sunlight; the smell of crushed leaves, green wildflowers and freshly cut grass. it corresponds just so well with nature at the place i live at. we do not have meny flowers, nor smells, just many greens, grass, wildflowers and forests, lots of forests. it is pretty much how it really smells here on a late summer evening, or early autumn day. it is a smell of a cut grass in a shadow, not a smell of a grass in a sun. it is a smell of crushed wildflowers, not those with many blossoms, but those with a few and small ones, and it is smell of more of a stilk than of an actual blossoms. why would i want to wear this you may wonder - it is very green and full of life, and not like any other perfume, and not any sensual or nothing to appear attractive. it is just like a smell of nature. very green. very pretty. just for myself. just wat i wanted.",08/23/19 02:26,Mirabele
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This is the Bloom flanker that most differs from the original. There are vague hints of Gucci Envy in the very opening. To begin with I get the sense of walking through lush, wet pine forests, past ponds covered in blooming water lilies, then the scenery dries out and the scent turns more aromatic. Afterwards, the dry down becomes more like the original Bloom, but sadly disappears too quickly. It really takes you on a journey and it's crazy to me how different this one becomes from beginning to end!

The note is listed in with the white flowers but Acqua is green and astringent, it is crushed leaf and wild flowers. I chose this one to buy a biggie from the batch as a new modern signature scent, as it fits me now. It has the green of the 90s classic Gucci Envy, so if you enjoy that, this is going to be the Bloom for you. Do try first though, it is the least mainstream crowd-pleaser of the bunch. Guys, this has the green herbal feel on a par with Fleur du Male - if you love that, try this. It is easily the most 'unisex' if you heed the conventions of gender assignment to smell.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"I really like this. First impression, this is different than anything else I own and tend to look for in a fragrance. On me, this starts strong, like a forest after the sun goes down and the air starts to cool around the wild blooms and the lake. I don't get how other people say that it smells synthethic, this smells so authentic to me, it really transports me to a forest where Snow White communicates with animals and battles the evil witch. The dry down its the best part, the greenery starts to mellow and surfaces a creamy floral aspect that gives it sweetness. This lasts too.
Good work Gucci.",02/24/19 14:17,Taishi92
Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"I've only tested this one on paper by now, but I've fallen in love.
It is definitely similar to Pleasures, but I think this one is more authentic. It smells exactly like green, field plants with a bit of soil, like a meadow. I guess this is not as pleasant scent for some people, as it is for me. I love it because it is so authentic and it takes me back to childhood memories when we used to work in the field and roll around on the meadows (which I still do, whenever I can) and these are beautiful memories.
For me, this scent is real, it is not artificial, plastic, urban, unique or innovative. It is the smell of nature as I know it, it smells like life in the woods, which I long for right now, during the winter, living in the city and being indoors most of the time.
Maybe i don't come across this kind of perfumes a lot, it is definitely not as warm or strange as are the scents I like in this moment of my life, but if it's gonna behave on my skin as I hope it will, it is going to be mine, no doubts.",02/18/19 12:04,diluted paintbox

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"First it smells like you just walked through a bunch of green leaves, trees and flowers, okay like you just got out of a forest after the rain. Literally. Then after that you'll see the wet woods and the ground more clearly.

It's interesting, different. I'm confused by it. It's beautiful but at the same time I just smell like I literally got out of a forest/ garden after the rain and the different types of leaves are all over me. Green, sensual but a bit dirty.

The thing I like most about this is that it smell natural. On the paper it smells green but on my skin it smells even greener ha ha. My friend told me I smelled like some type of herbal medicines lol.

The problem is none of my clothes seem to fit the smell. I own mostly either super bubbly clothes like pink hoodies n white denim shorts or really work-wear types. You gotta be wearing something like linen or anything a bit raw & natural for this scent to work well. Like you can't wear sloppy clothes and wear Decadence by Marc jacobs at the same time if that makes sense.

The worst thing abut this perfume is that the grass note is way too literal and it’s even stronger than the florals.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"I must be anosmic to this or it is very weak. I purchased it by accident ,at Shoppers Beauty Boutique and I’m not happy. It was $138 plus tax, that is well over $150 .... I thought I smelled this , becuase of what people say .... I smelled a Bloom that was like fresh cut green grass and I loved it.... but it wasn’t this . This seems like a soft aquatic with a dominant galbanum that is almost dusty on my skin. I don’t smell any white florals like Tuberose or honeysuckle.... if anything some water lilies or osmanthus. There is no sweetness in this, it’s a cold perfume.
To me this is like a sad , melancholic pastel... it isn’t like spring, full of new life and vivacious greens. ...beautiful but lethargic, a flowerwall with no life energy. It’s a beauty that is too delicate, too fragile , too mellow.
Do I like it ? Yes. do I recommend it? Nope, not for the money it costs. If it was cheaper, yes. Oh, and the silage is minimal and the lasting power quite poor too.... by my skin eats fresh scents . Bummer. I liked it .

The longevity is moderate but that’s to be expected as it’s only an edt.

The tuberose is still here but dialed down in the background making way for the green notes to shine. I will say that as much as I love this one, I won't repurchase. The performance is terrible.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"This doesn't smell anything like Gucci Bloom. If I didn't know it was supposed to be a flanker of Gucci Bloom, I wouldn't be able to tell.

They took out the tuberose. I know they claim tuberose is still in here, but I can't find it.

Instead this smells like crushed green stems. Fresh, green. Slightly sweet. Aquatic.

After about an hour, this turns into a Versace Bright Crystal type of smell. If you have put your nose on that, you can expect hours two, three and maybe part of four to smell like that. But underneath that 'Bright Crystal' vibe, there is lurking the green freshness of the opening that you can activate by breathing down on it, or misting yourself.

During hour 4 or five, the scent becomes a faint, faint green trace on your skin. I only get about five hours out of this. Perhaps six on a lucky day.

I like this a lot better than Gucci Bloom, because I hate tuberose and this is much more appealing to me. But that's just a personal preference. This is also weaker and lasts shorter than Gucci Bloom.

This is a nice, slightly sweet aquatic and green perfume. Not what I would describe as a 'floral.' More predominantly green than predominantly floral.",07/17/18 13:19,Michelle12345678

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"The original Gucci Bloom was a bit of a disappointment for me. I was on the hunt for the perfect wedding day scent, and although very pretty, Gucci Bloom was just a reinterpretation of a tuberose scent that had already been done to death.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori, on the other hand, is surprisingly more unique than its predecessor. I'm not madly in love with this flanker, but I do enjoy it. I find it to be a very refreshing blend of jasmine, honeysuckle, cassis and white musk.

The tuberose note barely features in this fragrance's composition. Jasmine tends to lead as the reigning white floral in Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori, followed by sweet honeysuckle and the sharp greenness of cassis.

It's hard to place this flanker into any specific category. In my attempt to describe Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori, I would call it a watery and crisp green floral. It doesn't smell anything like the original Gucci Bloom.

This flanker would be great for Spring and Summer, especially for those that live in a warm, tropical climate. The only downside to this fragrance is its lacklustre longevity and projection. You might want to reconsider purchasing this fragrance in a smaller bottle so it's easier to have on the go for constant re-application.",06/09/18 20:16,missk

It has little do to with the original and I think that Gucci would've done this scent a favor if they'd launched it in a different way.
It has hints of a very fresh tuberose but the Cassis and Galbanum lend an interesting herbal touch ( a bit like the new Balmain Ivoire). Green but in an abstract way. And also a little creamy and just really well rounded, in a way like the cleanliness of Forever and ever Dior.

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"I found myself underwhelmed by this. I expected galbanum and instead got honeysuckle. It is, by no means, a bad scent, but it is rather weak. Watery, if you would. As an EDT, this is to be expected. Eau de Toilettes don't always last less time than Eau de Parfum, but they do project less and this is most certainly the case here. Tuberose was in trend last year and Gucci Bloom definitely delivered one of the most chic there was, alongside Twilly & Gabrielle. It was bold, but also soft and elegant with white flowers blossoming around it.

Acqua di Fiori is closer to the ground, in the forest where all the greenery is... not in a romantic garden, adorned with gateways and white coloured flowers. Honeysuckle is definitely the most prominent, with its creamy sweetness enveloping your skin... and then that's it. The greenness is there, but not in a big way. LotV seems to be more present than galbanum, as the galbanum is very soft. Looking at the notes, one would think 'hmm, maybe a N°19 of the 2010s'. At least, that's what I thought, hoped and wished for. Perhaps that's why I was so underwhelmed. It's not the fault of the scent, nor Gucci but, instead, my own. I set a massive standard that couldn't be reached. Don't look at the notes and formulate ideas like I have, it does no good.

I wanted to try ACQUA DI FIORI ever since it came out - and to day I had the opportunity to do it.

The first and last thing I smelled was the freshness - the Galbanum Leaf is very present. After some 30 minutes ACQUA DI FIORI turns from being fresh to somewhat woody (I felt that Sandalwood and Musk took over the fragrance), but after an Hour it returns to its starting point (the dry down was and is Galbanum).

Today was very hot outside and that might have influenced my perception (i hope not).

Longevity: - 3/10 (it's only an EDT)

While the original is dominated by soft tuberose and jasmine sambac, this version is greener and more herbal. Galbanum, cassis, honeysuckle, and then sandalwood and musk. It is very wearable, if slightly unremarkable, but I appreciate that they decided to emphasise the green aspect of Gucci Bloom for the first flanker, instead of going in the sweet-fruity direction. The silage is soft to moderate, depending on the outside temperature, and longevity about 4 hours (pretty much the same as the original).

Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori Gucci,"Bloom Acqua di Fiori opens as a duet of vegetal galbanum leaf and ammoniac cassis in an unusually sappy, and herbal accord reminiscent of a long-since fertilised box hedge just taken to with a trimmer. Jasmine and honeysuckle quickly bloom from behind the tart foliage, shifting the composition almost entirely to a floral one. Transparent, tinged slightly green, and in the absence of any indoles, the florals here are those of opening buds. There’s a sweetness too, but nothing overbearing or matronly. Toward the gentle dry down of white musk and florals, sandalwood’s soft green creaminess becomes increasing apparent.

A genuinely worthy flanker, Bloom Acqua di Fiori manages to be effortless, youthful and endearing all at once. If the bottle is millennial pink, the scent itself is millennial green.

Feminine leaning though potentially unisex, longevity is moderate at 4-5 hours with soft sillage.

It produces a fresh, slightly salty effect that I appreciate more than really like. (Normally I detest calone but it is tolerable here.) So, for me Acqua di Fiori is a salty green fragrance with a hint of tuberose, and the original Bloom was salty floral with a strong note of tuberose. Both are well done and pleasant and I have considered laying down the credit card for both (with a preference for Acqua di Fiori), but ultimately both are too polite and lacking character for my taste. Longevity is under par. The opening of Acqua di Fiori offers 10 minutes of cool stemmy greenery. After those notes fade they are not replaced by anything as interesting. The galbanum is restrained.

What I do know is that Gucci have raised their game massively in recent releases the two new Guilty Parfums being notable. I thought the bottle, branding and campaign behind bloom gave it a high profile and a feel of real quality which personally never translated into the fragrance itself, however I have to say I really enjoyed this flanker and so did my better half. She enthusiastically came over waving her wrist at me saying “Smell this...It’s Gucci bloom” I sniffed it and immediately replied...”That isn’t bloom...it’s nice.” She proceeded to show me the bottle and it was this flanker. I subsequently got a sample and confirmed that Acqua di Fiori opens up with a green, galbanum note of transparent incense which by its very nature is fleeting but quickly establishes a herbal, musky woods which is very fresh and green. Nothing sweet, overly floral or cliched in here just really good, light stuff perfect for spring/summer and unisex...I’d rock it.

We all see that perfumes become weaker and weaker, the houses less creative and thousands of 'new' editions from masterpieces are coming on the market. Some people may like 'green' perfumes, it's something truly daring for Gucci I guess, we asked for something more unique but...I don't know. All I get is a grassy, earthy, green mess.

1921 Gucci,It smells just like a classic cologne for me,08/23/25 08:32,sycomore85
1921 Gucci,"This smells high quality and very well blended.

When I saw the citron note listed in the opening I thought it would be a blast of very tart citrus, but it's not. The citron is light and this fragrance smells mostly of neroli, somewhat soapy. I believe the oakmoss makes it more unisex, giving it a bit of a more masculine feel.

It's really smooth, but very light wearing after the first hour. Hardly projects at all and is a skin scent almost instantly. Might last 4 hours tops. Leans slightly masculine, but can be worn by pretty much anyone, any age.

The scent profile isn't very unique, but this is very well done. A great inoffensive work/office fragrance. The stunning presentation is probably the deciding factor that leads me to buy a bottle.",05/14/25 16:18,Tyrone E
1921 Gucci,"Gucci 1921 is a citrus, aromatic and floral fragrance.

Its opening is citrus and herbal, very pleasant, the list indicates that it is citron, but to me it seemed more like bergamot accompanied by lemon verbena and neroli. In these first minutes it reminded me a little of Zegna's Acqua di Bergamotto or Italian Bergamot fragrances. Once it reaches its dry phase, it remains herbal and adds a musky and slightly woody accord, without further changes.

Gucci 1921 is a fragrance for daytime use due to its citrus and fresh notes, the aroma is pleasant, for casual use or office work.

Its longevity was approximately 6 to 7 hours with a low sillage, it only projects well for the first 20 minutes, but then it stays close to the skin.

I liked the scent of this fragrance, but it is a little expensive and has a low performance, plus there are other fragrances with which you can get that citrus and fresh feeling.",11/03/24 19:54,caifan
1921 Gucci,"If you enjoy very simple blends of clean citrus fragrances and want a unisex one with a beautiful bottle to make you feel special, I can see you enjoying this one. Office, school, church, day-time friendly. Maybe on a first date on a lunch to not overpower your meal, but not for being remembered. It's a very clean, sweet orange flower scent. I bet it would layer and compliment most others in The Alchemist's Garden collection, but do we have the budget for that?

The bottle is to die for!! The bottle is so so beautiful as is most in this collection, but the scent is VERY generic. Most people would probably select a different fragrance from The Alchemist's Garden for that price and hardly anyone is going to want to buy some generic citrus scent to layer with for $384. I don't quite understand why such a generic scent would be selected as an anniversary release, either. Choose something else unless you want it for the bottle - try to get it on discount. It is absolutely not worth that price.",05/02/24 09:52,jow012

1921 Gucci,"A strong, masculine citrus, heavy on the verbena and neroli. I wear this when I want to feel like a successful businessman. It’s my can-do scent. It’s, admittedly, a little generic.",08/21/23 21:18,Lykopa
1921 Gucci,"Slightly different take on a classic but different enough from the likes of 4711 or TF NP. This isnt zingy or crisp like 4711 or smooth/ambery like NP but yea - that mossy quality gives it a different character which is unique in a way. This has the same lasting power as 4711 though which at sooo much more $, its not a compelling purchase for me even though it does smell nice.",05/01/23 22:01,nszlufik
1921 Gucci,I would mostly disagree that this is a niche copy of 4711 simply because of the citrus notes. This is a very nice green smelling citrus that has a faint but beautiful oakmoss note in the base. The oakmoss just gives a nice contrast while playing in the distant background. I’d honestly compare it’s styling rather then smell to bergamot 22. This is very smooth not juicy or sharp and has a soapy feel this is a great morning scent. IT’s performance is not great but it’s a nice wear and also great for layering. If you like bergamot 22 Nishane colonise or profumum Roma orangea you’ll likely enjoy this one. Not worth full retail due to performance but on scent alone it’s up there with the best.,02/24/23 13:20,Mrrob
1921 Gucci,"This is a beautiful citrus floral that is in the same vein as 4711 but better. And it should be better for the price of $350 USD. It separates from the others with a brilliant citrus limone cedrato (giant lemon) which is so tart and fizzy it literally makes my mouth water, a high quality natural neroli, and finely crafted oakmoss accord. Natural neroli is expensive and takes literally 2000 pounds of flowers to create 2 pounds of oil.

Here's the deal, if you want the best (my opinion) version of the 4711/Neroli Portofino DNA and money is no object, I'd get a bottle of Chanel Les Exclusifs Eau De Cologne. Longevity sucks, but it is the Ferrari of this DNA. I rank 1921 just below Chanel EDC.

If you want to spend less but still get niche quality, get a bottle of Histories De Parfums 1.6 or Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Parfum on gray or secondary market. If you want the best performing version of this DNA, get Bond No 9 Eau De New York.

Overall an excellent fragrance if you can find it heavily discounted. However, at $350, there are lower cost niche options.This is not super unique but the quality is there, and would probably only appeal to someone that wants the beautiful bottle for shelf art. I'd pull the trigger for around $100-120 because I love tart effervescent citrus, green mossy vibe and high quality neroli.

1921 Gucci,"Love this scent -- feels like a lovely modern take on 4711 however I will say for this price, the staying power is minimal. I know these are not notes meant to be beast mode to put on 10 sprays of this and not smell it 3 hours later was a little disappointing.",08/28/22 10:14,emerson10
1921 Gucci,5/10,10/24/21 07:12,mohsen95
1921 Gucci,"I love the way the dry citrus of the citron top note plays off the verbena from the heart in this fragrance. The effect is long lasting (for a hesperdic scent) citrus note that is reminiscent of the smell beneath a lemon tree on a hot day. As the citrus begins to settle, there is a delightful neroli note whose sweet, vaguely citrus floral scent gradually emerges from the lemony clouds of the opening and early mid notes. A nice oak moss accord marks the base. This is a great smelling, natural feeling, warm temperature unisex scent. Today is my second full wearing from the bottle I recently bought and my experience is at odds with folks who are getting very limited longevity. I am getting about 5 hours on a day that has gone from very hot and humid to pleasantly temperate this evening. I did not spray my clothes (I usually don't) but part of one spray caught my shirt and it remains noticeable 6+ hours after spraying. Projection is minimal, and is just a bit more than a skin scent from almost the first moments. So performance can be an issue with 1921.

This fragrance is definitely office safe. I find it very pleasant, but I admit that I bought it because I love the presentation as well as the fragrance. Like all of Gucci's Alchemist's Garden line, 1921 comes in an elegantly retro bottle with a great atomizer. Even the box and the little silken bag that accompany the bottle are lovely and luxurious.

So to sum up, 1921 is a delightful citrus-focused, lemony, scent with relatively poor performance but exceptional quality and presentation. If you love realistic, dry lemon notes, 1921 is worth sniffing. However, at the prices Gucci asks for the fragrances in this line, I suspect that, as others have noted, this scent is probably principally for die-hard Gucci fans like me.

UPDATE 8/10/21: The last time I wore this fragrance, in high heat with low humidity, the longevity was stretched out to about 8 hours with moderate, gradually fading to minimal, projection. I have decided performance is pretty good here, particularly for a citrus dominant scent. I am definitely happy I bought a bottle of 1921.",07/29/21 20:35,Akscent
1921 Gucci,"As someone said downstairs in this comment section, I feel like this piece is more for collectors or Gucci fans.
I am not.
I have tried it on and I would definitely not spend the niche money for something that in my view, is a simple neroli masculine scent.
I would love to spend the money on one of these bottles if the scent strikes me such as « voice of the snake » or even « eye of the tiger ». They are beautiful and collector!
However, the scent of 2021 don’t do the job enough for me. But Gucci fans, its for you! :)",07/18/21 03:30,Liz-frag
1921 Gucci,"I would say that if you are someone who is looking for something to wow your nose, this is not the fragrance for you. This is a traditional Eau Sauvage-esque fragrance of very high quality, and that's about it. I own it and love it, but is it worth $330 to someone who does not care about the fact that it was made to celebrate Gucci's 100th anniversary? Definitely not. This fragrance is the definition of something that is made for collectors. The packaging is absolutely top notch with incredible artistry and materials, the scent is high quality and has that dignified, understated, classic businessman vibe, and the fragrance has the best sprayer I have ever come across. If you are someone who believes that ""all that matters is the juice,"" this fragrance is the exact opposite of what you are looking for. This is something I will rarely use because it is more of a collection piece than anything else. Should I throw a $10 million 1965 Ferrari convertible around a racetrack just because it is a slightly enjoyable car to drive in 2021? No. It is not groundbreaking in any way in 2021 and it is slow and boring by modern standards, so it just stays in my garage as a beautiful piece of rare art to show off. If you want a modern marvel that will grab attention and perform well for a good price, buy a 2021 Corvette and Dior Sauvage. If you want a collectible piece of art that has timeless style and class, buy a 1965 Ferrari convertible and Gucci 1921.",06/11/21 11:35,BirkinSmell

Gucci No 3 Parfum Gucci,"Definitely an '80s scent. Aldehydic, citrus, oakmoss opening to a dry down of smoky, wet earth, lily of the valley scent. I like it, it's okay, but it reminds me of other '80s scents. Smells like an earthier Balmain Ivoire. Update: It differentiates itself from Ivoire in the rosier dry down which is delicious.",10/05/22 10:27,COLOREDGIRLSHUFFLE
Gucci No 3 Parfum Gucci,"I have a miniature bottle of Gucci 3, unopened and seemingly well-preserved. It is an old-fashioned inky-dark, earthy chypre - of its era and manages to be simultaneously dense yet muted.

Gucci 3 opens with a blast of soapy aldehydes and bergamot, bolstered by earthy green notes. There is some musk in there too. The bergamot is bitter yet realistic, and there is a smokiness to the opening. The dense, mossy base notes are present from the initial application, with murky oakmoss and dry vetiver in prominent roles. As Vilja Vee below put it, ""scorched earth"" describes it perfectly.

As it develops, G3 unexpectedly loses a lot of its earthy darkness quite quickly, and becomes more powdery and floral - iris/orris root and narcissus are most evident to my nose, and a subtle white floral accord in the background adds a feminine edge. The mossy earthiness of the opening becomes very suble, adding a hint of depth to the florals. It fades to a leathery-amber accord, while retaining the subtle earthiness. Restrained patchouli features in the drydown.

G3 is not long-lasting on my skin, unusually for a parfum concentration. It is subtle and quiet with intimate sillage and could be unisex by today's standards. Ultimately G3 is quite nice, but doesn't come close to other classics of the genre such as Givenchy III or Mitsouko. 3/5.",12/15/21 03:49,Enrium
Gucci No 3 Parfum Gucci,"At first No 3 is bitter, cigar-like, earthy (minerals? clay? chalky?) After it settles, there is a pleasant floral lift present, like a slight fleck of soft pastel teal somewhere behind an in-your-face wall of mahogany-coloured fuzz. The overall sensation is like being submerged in a bathtub filled with a heated mixture of inky oakmoss, mud and flowers as a part of some decadent skin treatment.

Perfumes that showcase oakmoss (especially chypres) have made me feel puzzled, and this does the same. It completely lacks moisture, freshness and sweetness, ie. it doesn't share much of a palette with any of my modern nature-inspired scented shower gels and cleaning products, which I think explains its anachronistic queerness. It more than makes up for these 'lacks' with strong smells from some foreign depths.

Trying to wrap my head around how anyone could have intuitively experienced this as smelling 'good', I suddenly envision an older vision of nature that does not merely seek to replicate its pleasures, but to refine and make mystifying rhymes with all shades of its profoundness. A sort of abstract religious language that you were ""supposed to get"". That, or rambling conservative statements that seem dubious to relay in modern contexts.

For now, I wouldn't wear this for anything else than sitting on the sofa in my bathrobe, pondering its historical context and what this scent has meant for the people who have worn it decades ago. I can't deny that there is an addictive quality and a complex character to it, in all of its scorched earthy bitterness.",04/20/21 22:44,Vilja Vee
Gucci No 3 Parfum Gucci,"I have a newly acquired mini of Gucci No 3 parfum, and it is exactly the way I would expect a chypre from this era to smell. Big aldehyde blast of soapy musk, followed by oakmoss, orris and narcissus. After it settles, a light dusting of rose emerges. And boy, does this last! Put it on last night at about 8 PM, and 12 hours later I can still smell it on my wrist. Not a huge sillage, but I suppose if I'd been more liberal that might have been different. In reading about the EDT, I might have to hunt for a partial somewhere. I'd love to smell a more rose-forward version. Very nice!",06/09/20 06:48,rowenaaine

لقد جربته في متجر العطور، هذا العطر الإصدار المكثف وهو أكثر زهرية مع كمية قليلة من التوابل بالإضافة إلى قاعدة واضحة من العنبر والبتشولي من ""جوتشي غيلتي""، بالإضافة إلى ذلك، شعر أنفي برائحة البودرية كبودرة الأطفال بطريقة واضحة، لكن العنبر والبتشولي طاغيان، لذلك لم أشعر بأنني أريد هذا العطر، لم يرضيني الشعور بالأنوثة هنا، برأيي هذه النسخة أفضل من النسخة الأصلية من ""جوتشي غيلتي"". هذا العطر ليس نوع العطور المفضل لدي، ولكن بالتأكيد يدوم طويلاً.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"The intense is a grown up version of the original Guilty. While its mother scent is more playful, floral and bubblegum violet, the Intense is deeper, with peppery amber balancing the sweet citrus and romantic florals. It also has twice the longevity and sillage, for which the original fragrance cant match. While the notes may seem overwhelming, it’s balanced so beautifully. It’s luxurious but doesn’t completely lose its playful side, and though it isn’t my favorite from Gucci, it’s a clear and well-earned runner up. It is my go-to for weekend getaways, late dinners/cocktail parties etc but I wouldn’t necessarily hesitate to wear it (one light spray) as a day scent.",06/03/24 12:16,CarmenNola23

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Gucci Guilty will always stay in my mind because it was the first perfume i got myself and the one which started my perfume collection. I remember the cool Jared Leto campaign and I was a teen and didn`t have the money to buy it. In my college lunch breaks I would go and spray it and feel like a million bucks. Then I finally got it and I wore it a lot with my leather jackets in autumn.
I also find this dark and intense, but also mysterious and really smooth. I pick up the amber, lilac, violet and pink pepper. Not good for warm days the amber dominates everything else and it starts to smell dirty. Easily unisex.
But it smells luxurious, soft, sexy and reminiscent of iris perfumes but not old lady like. For some reason this smells like marzipan, violet and lilac to me.amazing projection and longevity. Unfortunately its discontinued, not the same as the new intense version and this intense version was the best.",03/25/24 11:30,Devved
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"For me, I really find this dark and intense. I imagine this wearing in a cold night wearing my leather outfit or for formal events at night. It's not the daily perfume scent but it is good to use to break the monotony. First 15 minutes is intense and the dry down becomes somewhat dark, mysterious and I can relate the scent to an incense and maybe that is the combination of wood, soft spicy and patchouli notes. The patchouli is very subtle, I won't really able to recognize it but the juxtaposition of these notes is giving me the vibe of an incense burnt during the Holy Eucharist inside the church combined with the scent of a leather. It is not a disgusting scent, but rather a unique and sophisticated one. Sensuality may come from the concept of the darkness, leathery vibe but it lacks femininity and that might not be defined by other guys as ""sexy"". I love the bottle and I like the scent. The bottle is among my top 10 faves but this is not my top 10 favorite perfume. This for me does share the same vibe with Black Opium that is quite polarizing within the ultra feminine sexy department, alongside with Versace Crystal Noir. These scents are associated with sexiness when you imagine the girl wearing a sexy leather outfit with very dark smoky eyes. These does not offend either as I enjoy smelling and sniffing them on my skin. I am not getting the Barbie vibe but the Catwoman vibe in these perfumes....intensely dark (noir), could be naughty, feisty, fierce...hence, another category of ""sexy"".",03/19/24 08:17,Venneve
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"A unique, complex, and rather glamorous fragrance. The opening has an interesting and well balanced mix of bright and sweet mandarin and spicy pink pepper. The beautiful purple florals soften things up and add a lovely feminine touch. The patchouli and amber add a warm and golden spicy warmth.

I bought this fragrance back in 2011 when it first launched when I was 23. I wanted something that was elegant, classy, and feminine with a touch of glamour that would make me feel put together and grown up. I only ended up wearing it for a short while though. Not because it’s a bad fragrance, but just because it wasn’t me. I was still trying to figure out what “me” was in fragrances back then. I still have my bottle to this day though and I do like to smell it from time to time. It is lovely, but still not me. Now at 36 I’ve discovered that I prefer beachy/coconut, vanilla, gourmand, and woody florals fragrances for myself.

I get excellent performance with Gucci Guilty Intense. It has great longevity… it lasts the entire day, and I can still smell it the next morning on myself. The projection is very good too, it radiates out a few feet from me. Also, a little goes a long way, so it makes this a better value for the price.",02/20/24 18:41,Shimmer412
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I had this since 2012 and never really LOVED it. It's nice, clean and the bottle is lovely.

Now, when I am reflecting on it again, I think it was grandiosely mis-marketed. There is nothing dark, sexy, mysterious or guilty about smelling like lilac and violet with a tiny bit of red pepper.

For me, this scent is about an English tea party in a French garden: lilac bushes, violet flower beds, wicker furniture, white dress, Earl Grey tea served in airy fine porcelain... and sweet treats.
The Alice in Wonderland Tea Party theme. Maybe, Guilty is about indulging into biscuits or mysterious while reading the famous book.",02/15/24 08:51,tterekhova

This is the fragrance that made me fall in love with lilac in fragrances. It was so addictive and sexy smelling.

I have always loved how the lilac smell in my parents garden but Gucci put it in a bottle with added sweetness, powderiness and some spice! Created a masterpiece and then discontinued it a couple of years later..

I would be forever devastated that I didn’t secure a second bottle so that I can enjoy, even sparingly, this divine smell for the rest of my life!

I found something similar from Tiziana Terenzi, Aphrodite, and it’s built in the same style but it’s obviously a different scent.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I go in phases with this -- my dumb reach, my most ""perfumey"" perfume -- though I don't question if I like it overall; I question if I want to wait about an hour for the odd, sour, slightly bitter orange and pink pepper edge to fade. Once that initial, synthetic blast dies down, the floral heart of this perfume is truly pretty -- a literal bunch of powdery purple florals. Leans rich and soapy, and has a slightly grape-y whiff sometimes. If you like perfumes that smell like makeup, give this a try. The violet/heliotrope combo gives Guilty a soft, powdery fullness at the heart that I associate with some of my favorite waxy/oily/synthethic make-up scents.

As a fragrance it's unchallenging, a little basic, and prim... which brings me to the name, which doesn't affect the juice at all, but it's really irksome to me when perfumes are given these naughty, faux-transgressive names like Guilty. I think all those ""Ooh don't you wanna be a bad girl?"" gimmicks are really childish. What are you guilty of? Smelling like flowers? Grow up lol.

It’s not my job to know how it works, but I’m happy I get to enjoy the ride. 3 sprays of this and I’m set for the day.. I think it compliments all seasons but sticky summer.
Seems universally likeable.
The amber and patchouli base are quite warm, and I love it for that quality.",10/16/22 14:41,Sparkleball22
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"This one was my signature scent for a long time and I was heartbroken when it got discontinued, so I bought four backups.
I don't know what happend but I smell it differently now; like too much powder and very little lilac. The amber in the drydown though is still there and this is the only thing that makes me not to sell my bottles and move on. I still hope to adore it again the way I used to. And if I don't, I guess it is good since I can't buy it anymore. But I do feel a little sad honestly. Still, It is such a beautiful perfume.",10/03/22 01:47,ina.r

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"This is one of the perfumes I've had in my collection the longest. It starts somewhat peppery and then becomes more powdery, with a hint of lilac (which I absolutely adore), resting on a base of amber and patchouli.

Beyond the notes, this perfume holds a lot of memories for me - I started wearing it in university and it takes me back to the simplicity of those days. I stopped wearing it after I graduated, or when I started working in offices and moved to Chloe/Coco Mademoiselle, but I still kept the bottle - hidden away and untouched, but still good after so many years. I pulled it out today and it put a smile on my face. Would I re-buy this if I can find it? I don't know - but I will keep the bottle I have for as long as I can, just because it makes me happy.",01/15/22 15:32,renashepet

If I were trying to seduce an older man, I'd probably reach for this one instead of one of my many gourmand frags. Like Mark from Grey's Anatomy.

Now, in summer, I’m finding I love it and notice the pink pepper (a note I love when it’s not powdery in its treatment) blending beautifully with the lilac & I almost find some gardenia, though I know it’s not a note. Soapy, spicy, warm, sweet and lovely in hot weather.",08/21/21 05:57,shannonwheeler05
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I am disappointed by this blind buy. I was expecting so much more from Gucci and for the price. IMO there is nothing intense about this fragrance. It sits close to the skin and then it disappears. It is not a horrible perfume but there is nothing memorable or fantastic about it for me. Maybe it is because it vanishes so quickly.

This is the first perfume I have ever returned, that is how much I am disappointed by it. Usually, I give fragrances a chance and if I don't want it, I give to family. I would not gift this to someone as it just doesn't last.

I am fine with fragrances that sits close to the skin, sometimes I don't want beast mode. Sometimes I want something delicate and lovely but unfortunately I just could not fall in love with this one. Its way too weak for me. So, for me, this is a ""No.""",06/29/21 05:56,SummerRose

They didn’t, but one of the salespeople claimed that this had lavender in it and encouraged me to try it. It doesn’t have lavender in it at all, but it is still a nice scent. It’s not very “Intense” smelling- the violet and lilac stand out, giving it a nice soothing feel. I am relieved to see that it’s not a Xerox of Gucci Guilty- it stands alone well as its own entity.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"When I was a teenager (not that long ago!), this bottle used to sit in my mother's collection and I HATED it. I thought it was too strong and overpowering and all in all, just unpleasant. After trying it again in my 20s, I now quite like it. It's powdery and strong so back then my untrained baby nose registered it as a more mature scent, but it's not. It's a sensual blend of purple florals, especially lilac, pink pepper and amber. I don't get much mandarin on my skin, but YMMV. Now these specific florals are something I personally very rarely reach for, but it's still a gorgeous scent. Definitely for cold weather though!",09/02/20 07:18,Despair

I think it is an original scent, reminds me what a real leather bag would smell like. Its powdery for sure and the amber is definitely there.
I do not like Gucci scents usually, but this one, the Intense version is a winner for me. Only in winter I search for it, but in summer It's too much, suffocating and smells differently on the skin. For me it's a cold weather fragrance. Comforting and sooo smooothhhhh!Super sexy yet sophisticated.",08/20/20 15:17,PearlGarden
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I know this scent. It has been on my wish list since I received a sample of Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum from a seller a while back. While not the Intense version, it is basically the same scent except they swapped the rose for heliotrope and the pink pepper is amped up giving it a peppier opening. As others have noted, it is also a little muskier than the edp. It also has much better silage and lasts a lot longer, which has been the reason I was hesitant to buy the edp in the first place. Since I love Gucci Guilty I am over the moon that I basically found almost the same scent (this is better!) that delivers much improved performance. It's beautiful and really a joy to wear.

I cannot possibly expand on Jae's very informative review below, except to add that contrary to maybe being too much for warmer weather because of the amber, it actually performed very well in hot weather. I wore it during the heat wave we just had in NY (couldn't help myself) and it wasn't too much. It stood up to the heat very well; never disappeared, but never overwhelmed. It wasn't room-filling or cloying. There is no excessive sweetness that might make it so. Jae's description of dewy is very apt. It's fresh, but at the same time calm. No screechy, sharp, or jarring notes to disrupt. Nor is it soapy or complicated with dozens of notes. What notes there are work harmoniously together. While not quite delicate, it certainly isn't a beast. Beast mode would be an 80s powerhouse, which this sure isn't. It's modern, in that it fits in with today's olfactory sensitivities, while at the same time being present enough where it is noticeable. It smelled so great to me from beginning to end on a hot summer day, I can only imagine how great it will smell in the cooler weather. I am very happy I listened to all the positive reviews, particularly Jae's, and blind bought a bottle. It is already a big love for me. I really, really enjoy wearing it.",06/17/20 22:43,Anamandy
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Who would think of combining lilac, pepper, and amber? You'd think the second two would overwhelm the first, but that is far from true, because this is an inspired perfume. Dewey, almost syrupy lilac—along with the other purple florals heliotrope and violet—is put into sharp relief by the addition of spicy pepper and mellow amber. The patch is definitely there too, adding some leafy greenness to the florals and picking up that peppery note. The juicy mandarine orange is the perfect fruit here, because it's not a sharp as regular orange, lemon, bergamot, or other citruses. It neither clashes with the sharpness of the pepper, nor does it overwhelm the florals.

Guilty Intense is an altogether vivacious, lush fragrance. It's fun but not light, sensual but not sexy, fresh but not clean, juicy but not sweet. Because of the amber and pepper, it might be too heavy for warm weather, despite the cool, powdery florals. More feminine-leaning, but this will work on anybody. And in spite of lilac's soapy-powder quality, there's enough complexity and dynamism here to prevent GGI from ever smelling old-fashioned or frumpy. A lovely perfume.",06/04/20 21:20,jæ
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I'm not familiar with the original Guilty, I got a sample of this Intense version from a friend and will review it on its own merits.
This is not a very intense scent and not that 'guilty' either, but I don't think that it's extremely light and innocent. It's a slightly sensual scent with medium intensity. The opening is pretty and interesting, I really get the lilac, a note that should be used more often and more creatively in perfumery, and also the warming, piquant pink pepper and musky amber. This is a good floral choice for rainy days. But the drydown is disappointing to me, it smells like a muddled mixture of florals, amber, patchouli, pepper and musk to me, not very distinct or well-blended. I don't know why this fragrance seems so musky to me, as it doesn't have musk as a listed note, but that's how it is.
I think I would have liked this more if the lilac was more enduring and the base better blended.",02/18/20 02:35,SailorV
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"This one isn‘t as good as the others from this line. There is something in the opening that i don’t like. After, it gets floral powdery with the amber in the background.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I went to ulta ans was looking for a fragrance somewhere between night and day time and I think I found it. I smelled about 20 perfumes at ulta and when I smelled this I even said “oh” out loud. This is a perfume that smells like a strong confident woman would where which is why I got it! The first thing I notice is the Citrus. Floral and a deep sweet musk( no candy sweet here which I love ) on my skin this last 2 hours it sucks and I was disappointed. But on my clothes? Omg till the next day! I’ll take that! After 12 hours I still smell it on my shirt,
The citrus goes away and you are left with a deep sweet musk slightly floral.

Upon spraying, you can smell it from arms reach, after some hours only up close.

EDIT: I honesty might return it because it does not last on my skin at all, you can smell it on my clothes but it is very light. I think I would like to get something with more staying power.",10/22/19 10:49,gucciimars
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"It's a gorgeous, sexy, sultry, sweet scent for evening wear. There is lilac present but my skin is really amping up the amber and it's in charge here. A real shame because it's the lilac that really interests me.
Pink pepper adds a little spice but not much. There is a good dose of vanillary heliotrope. More violet might have made it less rich.
If there was such a thing as lilac wine then I suspect it would smell a bit like this.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"It really pains me (right in the ego) when I see a fragrance I feel so strongly (read: positively) about being billed as a forgettable basic-girl fragrance or simply ""office safe.""

I think that Gucci Guilty is far more special than this. Allow me to explain:

Guilty gives me really strong synesthetic associations, due in no small part to the actual presence of purple florals at its heart. I see an art deco stained glass window, moody indigo irises and pale milky greenery against a flamingly gold background. A soft subject matter, but sharp around the edges.

I also see neo-classical Madeleine Vionnet ensembles--all soft folds, flowers, and goddesses.

Guilty just smells divine to me. A bit heady and spicy, but with spring freshness fraying it around the edges. I get that sort of salty/sweet play-doh accord that I'm always seeking laced throughout, likely from the heliotrope. Adding to the play-doh effect is something I've seen other reviewers cite as well -- an unlisted nutty, almondy creaminess.

Can't. Stop. Smelling. This one has such a tactile quality to it.

An odd candidate, indeed, but one I'd put in the race for best make-up/cosmetic-smelling fragrance. The violet gives Guilty a soft, powdery richness at the heart that I associate with some of my favorite waxy/oily/synthethic make-up scents.

From top-to-bottom this is one gorgeous scent!

A note about the name and marketing: It's really irksome to me when perfumes are given these ""exciting"" faux-transgressive names like Guilty. I think all those ""Don't you wanna be a bad girl?"" gimmicks are really childish and probably are only persuasive in their own right to people who are still mad at their parents for not letting them dye their hair when they were in high school or something.

This one deserves a classier name that is...well...less guilty about its pleasures.",10/08/18 13:08,ingrid.superstar
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"This is quite sexy, in a quiet sensual way. One of my favorite fragrances. I am never without a bottle in my collection.

I mostly get lilac, pepper and patchouli which work so well together. The amber and heliotrope come in during the dry down and turn this beauty to a spicy, warm, sensual fragrance. Very beautiful.

Lasts about 8-9 hours which is ok with me. Sillage is moderate and perfect for work/crowded places IMO, but then again, I'm the kind of person that goes to work in Jungle l'Elephant LOL. I easily pull this off all year round as well.",09/20/18 23:50,letamercy

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Not more intense than the original. In fact, it might be weaker. I wasn't amused like I was with the original. Definitely not as powdery as the original. Less patchouli and amber too.

Sweet like pistachio, floral peeks through too, feels very grassy for some reason and for a quite some time. Just as the original it has some stages until the warm lilacs. Cannot pinpoint what note causes the grassy feel, could it be the pink pepper? It's weird because I have worn perfumes having a dominant pink pepper and they aren't grassy. Could it be the orange? whatever, it's grassy for some time.

Something vanillary that obviously comes from the heliotrope, but it doesn't settle. Leathery at times too, could be the violet? Either way violets don't settle either. I wish it had more prominent violets; in fact violets should be as prominent as pink pepper.

It's not totally bad, but it's not the best that Gucci could do. It's abstract and weird. Not intense, does not project more than the original but seems to last just as long. I got a full six hour wear, only it would stay really close to the skin.

When amber intensifies, the last stage of wear, it will smell kind of ""dirty"", it's ""guilty"" now. It's sensual just before it totally softens out. The patch is completely inoffensive, so don't worry that you can't wear it because of the patch, if you don't like it. It's not a patchouli centered perfume and that is fine, patch is barely traceable.

Come-hither, feminine, sensuous...all in a subtle, delicate fashion...but it makes quite the impact, even in it's subtlety (though it is subtle only in comparison to other popular dark fragrances in the market). It's the kind of scent that stays in your scent memory. Maybe it's the lovely lilac that's dressed in warm amber, and lightly powdered in spices. Heliotrope adds some sex appeal to the regular Guilty formula and violet adds a touch of mystique. Very womanly. A little mysterious, a little coy. Gently teasing. But ladylike and classy. I've run out of my mini for months now but I can still smell it when I think about it. The initial phase is especially heavenly and sensuous, and I get a little disappointed when it dials down into a thicker, slightly darker version of Gucci Guilty after 30mins, Still better than regular Guilty though. This scent is perfect for those who are not usually into dark or heavy scents (like Alien, Black Orchid, etc) but still want something 'sexy' for a night out. This is for the more demure, soft-spoken vixen. Also for lovers of lilac who want a more urban interpretation of lilac as opposed to the usual English garden variety. It makes a statement without screeching for attention. It's great for day-into-night wear as well, all year around, and versatile enough to be a signature.

This is a floral scent, but it's not what you'd usually expect from a floral perfume. I've never been a fan of floral perfumes, mostly because a lot of them contain heavy white flowers or a rose note that dominates everything. No, this is definitely not your stereotypical flower powerhouse.

Guitly Intense isn't heavy or suffocating like most floral perfumes. It's rather fresh and 'sparkly' smelling, almost like a fruit champagne. I always get a whiff of honey whenever I put this on, even though it's not listed as a note. Delicious!
I don't find it especially sexy (I've owned sexier scents!), I just wear it because I like it. It's appropriate for daytime wear as well! Don't turn this beauty down simply because it is a popular clubbing perfume!

I receive compliments when wearing this, mostly from my friends whenever I hug them. Like I said earlier, this is no powerhouse with monster sillage. It's a bit light and I usually spray around 5 times so that other people can smell it on me as well. Longevity could be better, however the real problem with this scent is that it becomes a skin scent rather quickly.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"My sister in law wears the original version of this and it smells gorgeous on her. I would never consider even to test it, because it is such “her” perfume in my world. But i got a sample from a lovely swap and decided to test it anyway.
It opens with a lot of realistic lilacs. It would be lovely in a garden but is way too much for my taste in perfume. But it fades away in a couple of minutes.
Later this is a gorgeous musky floral scent, a bit too fruity and has too much patchouli for my liking.
I still think it is lovely just so not “me” for some reason.
Try if you like sweet musky floral fruitchouli scents.
Good longevity.",06/16/15 02:27,Mirabele
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Clubbing perfume.

I like the packaging because I could dump it in my bag and not worry about breaking.

This perfume is extremely sweet smelling. It reminds me of the common perfumes that ladies in the club use, and would be masking sweat.

This is quite pricey, but it smells cheap. I was ok with it at first, until everyone else is using it.

There is also a cheaper perfume that smells exactly like this but I am not sure which.

I visualize myself with my girls at the bar or in vip wearing a bandage dress with 6 inch heels and smelling good with my Gucci guilty on. To me this is a very sexy scent. I get a warm, powdery, pink peppercorn scent out of this one. I will say that it is def a head turning, crowd pleasing type of scent and it smells fabulous. Be careful with how much you spray this one as well because it can be a beast! I think 3-4 sprays would be just right for a night out on the town with the girls or date night.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"ohh im soo lucky, just had a birthday and my hubby bought me this, is beautiful-its floral yet not at all old fashioned kind of flowers, more sweet-ish flowers with just a little bit of spicyness so its not heavy at all. Heavenly sexy sent that is sensual and creamy.If your blind buying as a gift i cant see how anyone would dislike it as its soo lovely- but just 1 thing- its not on me as long lasting as it may be on others-thats its only downfall-my partner said its totaly beautiful-really sexy perfume, i have never owned a very floral perfume b4 as i have sents like chanel coco , angel liquer and alien etc so strong sents are usually my thing, this does not project as much as those types of strong and heady perfumes but its totally beautiful and very summery and very easy to wear so an all round yummy sent u cant really go wrong with, but i do agree with those that say it should linger longer for the price ,could just be my skin sucking the life out of it :)
Bottle is stunning,well made,expensive,classy- feels good as you spritz this, i,m 42(shhhh lol) but it made me feel like im a sexy early 30,s and still have my mojo :)
I would deffo get this 4 myself when it runs out as it makes me feel sexy happy and warm- but in a soft sweet, way, rather than a showy kind of way if that makes any sense :) LOVE -LOVE- LOVE THIS FLORAL ORIENTAL !!",05/06/15 11:08,camden-girl

I wouldn't waste it for everybody to smell, I would save it for dinner with the one! Absolutely worth spraying on your hair if you wear it down. It is a very warm, flowery amber. After about 2 hours it is sweet and spicy. I'm sure that is how James Bond's Girl smell like. Seductive, feminine, empowering. The scent of a real lady! I'd say it is my signature scent for years.

As for the scent, it's all creamy and soft sweetness, sexy and elegant, not at all intrusive, although it is intense in a gracious way (I think ""suave"" is the word haha).

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I must have smelled this perfume more than 20 times from people around me because as soon as I sprayed it on the test strip, oh how familiar this scent is! A very expensive, luxurious, and alluring kinda smell. Great for party, not very wearable as an everyday perfume.",04/03/15 23:11,RayF
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Sprayed this on in a store. For being called ""Intence"", it really isn't. It's not a heavy perfume. It had a lot of amber on me, and ths increeeedible mix of soft, sweet notes - like soft cotton candy, a tiny bit of white berry chocolate, and warm freshness - hard to explain. It's a feminine, classic, but definitely not outdated smell. It does, in a way, remind me of today's candy smells, but this is done the correct way. Very long-lasting on clothes (it has been on my jacket arm for about 2 weeks since I sprayed this on my wrist, and I wear that jacket every day), but also lasts well on skin.

The way this smells on me is that it changes between giving me whiffs of flowers (lilac, for the most part) and pink pepper-amber-patchouli. Quite interesting! The latter 3 notes are the ones that remain on me for the longest time

You might not want to blind-buy it, but it's definitely worth smelling. The Gucci Guilty EDT and EDP didn't impress me - they are too sharp for my taste, while I like subtle fragrances.",04/03/15 06:34,lollsazz

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I'm continuously torn about Gucci Guilty Intense. On the one hand, I like it; it's a solid ""spicy lilac"" smell that's very unisex. On the other hand, I think it smells like a lot of other products on the market right now. That's not really GGI's fault--it may have even started the whole ""PINK PEPPERCORN EV-UH-RAH-THANG!"" trend that's going on now--but it's still a bit of a turn-off.

Guilty Intense starts off with a blast of pink peppercorn and citrus, firmly rooted in patchouli. After a few moments, the citrus fades away and the lilac becomes much more obvious. For about 6 hours, this perfume sits relatively close to my skin and smells like lilacs, pink peppercorns, and patchouli. The amber note provides a feeling of warmth, but is not particularly easy to single out.

While this fragrance is relatively linear, it does change a bit towards the end of its lifespan, taking on a slight powderiness that I think comes from the violets. However, I do not detect any heliotrope in this fragrance. For 90% of its lifespan, GGI is just the aforementioned lilac/peppercorn/patch combination on me.

This is not a bad fragrance by any means. It tends to be a crowd pleaser, it's easy to wear, and the level of projection is right up my alley. I do like it. But it's not a particularly unique smell, and I feel bored with it shortly after I apply it.

For reference, the main differences I notice between Gucci Guilty Intense and the original Guilty are that this fragrance is slightly more potent, and the pink peppercorn is more prominent in Intense. The original also seems more powdery than this one.",01/11/15 09:16,ReneesAnatomy

Now that I have it....I simply love it. It has a very crisp warmth to it, which I find very sexy. I do get a bit of spiciness which is fresh and not overpowering. It definitely is a fall/winter perfume.
It lasts on me quite good, 5-7 hours I would say.
I did try the EDT version but for me the EDP is more warm and crisp. If I had to describe it in one word it would be ""crisp"". It makes me feel very sharp and sexy whenever I wear it.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Ambery floral goodness! This EdP may not totally fit into the sinful and kind of provocative concept suggested by the name and the ads, but there’s definitely something addictive and overly sensual about it which I couldn’t find in the - nonetheless pleasant - first version.

On me Guilty Intense feels vibrant and cozy since the opening, with the sparkling blend of red pepper and mandarin orange providing a juicy, kind of nectarous crispness: the spicy aspect is quite noticeable in this initial phase, more than in the previous Edt where the emphasis was instead put on the fruity tones of peach, although the peppery note manages to stay demure and gently tickling, adding a certain warmth to the briskness of citruses. The overall effect is sheer and smooth at the same time, like a bright summery sunset. Shortly after the floral heart appears: a seemingly undistinguishable bouquet of velvety flowers in which only lilac really stands out with its intensely sweet aroma, luscious and almost erotic in here, while delicate hints of heliotrope lead slowly to the ambery undertones from the base. From there on the composition seems to turn down the light and at the same time it acquires depth, getting a bit darker and more voluptuous without losing its radiant aura: the beautifully blended drydown, dominated by an honeyed mélange of amber and patchouli, melts so well with my skin to create the sensation of a luxurious body lotion applied after a bath.
I wouldn’t go so far describing this fragrance as having a “your skin but better” quality to it, because all in all this is a quite perfume-y scent if that makes any sense, but probably its self-proclaimed sexiness comes from that creamy aspect provided by the amber and lilac accord that, to me, recalls the scent of warm silky skin.

I feel like this is a fragrance I should have in my collection one day, being a lover of sweet/ambery florals: after testing many from this group I would say Guilty Intense falls into the category of those flororientals I would be able to wear on a daily basis thanks to its perfectly balanced sillage (not too subtle neither obtrusive in the least: just right) and the very good longevity (about 8 hours on my skin).
Having to choose only two words to describe this scent's personality I'd say it is equally polished and seductive: it doesn't try hard to be complex or at all costs unique, but in my book it is a must try for those looking for an easy to wear oriental that's both warm and luminous.
All in all, a beautiful and in my opinion underrated/overlooked fragrance (that's often the flankers destiny....).",06/16/14 08:15,DarkViolet

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Ironically, this perfume does make me feel guilty, but probably not for the reason you think.
A good friend of mine gifted me a mini gift set of gucci perfumes last year, and I didn't like anything, but tried oh so hard to convince myself I at least like this one. 9 months later after I have never worn it once despite ""loving it"", it's time to face the music. It's so hard to admit to yourself that you hate something someone you like so much has given you.
I rarely leave negative feedback for perfumes, because I truly believe just about anything can be loved my someone, so why bash? But I feel like my warning to other bubblegum haters should be carried out, JIC.
GGI just doesn't do it for me. It's confusing, I feel like if lilac just wasn't in here it would have been fine, because I like pink pepper, patchouli, and amber. However with that sweet watery flower though, it smells like peppery bubble gum to me. I hate bubble gum! It assaulted my nostrils all throughout work, and with my first held high I swore never again!
I could never stand the flavor, reminding me of that cloying fluoride paste from my dentist. I still remember how over joyed I was with my dentist got in other flavors (yay, spearmint!).

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I liked Gucci Guilty Intense, but would only wear it for specific situations. It is a very light sillage perfume with very little longevity. Due to it's lightness I would recommend this before a bedtime seduction. It would also be good for a dinner out when you don't want your fragrance to interfere with your food. I found:

Within the first five minutes:
- Lilac, which I find made me feel pretty more than sexy
- Pepper notes that were uplifting and balance the lilac
- I noticed the violet, but cannot detect the mandarin

The perfume evolves quickly:
- Lilac remains and amber note increases
- Pepper dies down quite a bit after a half hour

6/10 rating
*1/10 headache factor - this does not give me a headache.

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,The smell of letting yourself be yourself. Love it.,01/25/13 18:56,Olia_Aroma
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"The first half hour of this spray is a kind of bitter yet soapy smell that I didn't paticularly care for.
After the half hour, the bitter smell goes away, and this turns into a warm, spicy smell.
I can smell the pepper and what I think is lilac.
As soon as the patchouli starts to blossom, this fragrance becomes much prettier. My boyfriend, who didn't like the initial notes, told me that the smell kept getting better and better.
That is until it went away. I sprayed this on around 6 p.m, and it is now 9:30 p.m. I have to put my nose right up to my wrist and sniff hard to find it.
3 and 1/2 hours? Seriously?
If this fragrance had some longevity, it might have been tempting, but I have cheapo body lotion that lasts longer than this fragrance!",01/23/13 18:48,jeffthebarbarian
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"It does indeed smell like that kind of old-fashioned make up that's not around anymore. A pleasant, sweet and powdery smell. To be honest, I thought Guilty would be something different - the EDT did nothing for me, I could barely smell it and thought there was nothing guilty about it, but I like this one a lot better.

On my skin it's pepper, amber, violet and lilac. Patchouli keeps it earthy and grounded, which is nice. This could have easily soured down to a bitter pepper-patchouli combination but it's sweet and well-balanced, I must say. It's almost syrupy and the lasting power (especially on hair- try it out) is really great.",01/04/13 12:23,lat

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Something about this one smells really artificial and fume-y to me - there must be a substantial amount of white musk in this, because I'm getting that telltale, airy headache-inducing cloud from something that's not listed in the notes. I'm also getting a bit of a peach accord that I have to admit goes really well with the lilac and fruity spice of the pink pepper. As for amber... what amber? Maybe somewhere in a supporting role, but the base is all about the tamed plastic patchouli holding it all together.

The problem I have with this one is the same problem I have with Midnight Poison. It's a pleasant fragrance, even if a little heavy on the musk cloud (why is that note not listed on here?). But in isolation, this scent does not impress me at all - sillage is barely there, with ""poof and it's gone"" longevity"", and while it's a pretty scent, it's nowhere near the sex-bomb that's advertised. Heck, if used on pulse points I'd use this on a spring or summer day for work - to me this is that non-sexual and nondescript. Take away the gold flacon and the sexy advertising (I do have to admit the ad is stunning), and Guilty Intense's overall impression scent-wise is more in the vein of Love Chloe's powdery pastel florals and musk: something nice to feel feminine and put together everyday, but forgettable. But at least Chloe EDP and Love Chloe have an aura of class and posh cleanliness about them. They smell like money spent on expensive toiletries, or like the French soaps in a five-star hotel. Guilty Intense doesn't even have that class level going for it. Between the gold plastic flacon and the forgettable drugstore scent, this is not worth paying full designer retail. No-go for me.",11/27/12 22:22,s_athena

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I don't know whether an intense version of this fragrance was entirely necessary. To be fair, the original Guilty was fairly short-lived, and while Guilty Intense is an improvement in terms of projection and longevity, it leaves much to be desired.

Gucci Guilty Intense is a pleasant fragrance, easy to wear and a sure crowd-pleaser. It shows a somewhat interesting contrast between peppery florals and earthy patchouli.

Since this fragrance has been 'amped up' to an EDP, what was considered pleasant in the original fragrance, now smells sharp and at times, a little screechy. The pink pepper accord is unfortunately overwhelmingly strong on my skin, smothering the feminine lilac and heliotrope blend.

I personally like to wear scents that make me stand out from the crowd and feel exceptional. Once again, (similar to my reaction to the original Guilty), this flanker comes across as bland and overrated. The high price tag leads you to expect so much more.

Gucci Guilty Intense is much warmer and more elegant than its predecessor, making it a good choice for Autumn and Winter. Fans of the original fragrance that had issues with its lasting strength, will most likely enjoy this intense EDP flanker.",10/07/12 05:39,missk
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Overall I find this composition stronger and more floral than the EDT, due to the intensified lilac note. Also the patchouli seems more dominant in the base, which is my favorite part since I love patchouli. While the EDP and EDT are definitely related, they have different personalities, and so I would choose one over the other based on mood or weather. I think the EDP smells more mature, has better longevity and more defined phases, but I love the sweetness and balance of notes in the EDT, especially in summer.",10/03/12 20:23,Jillzilla

It smells like ""Yves Rocher Comme Une Evidence"", which also has patchouli. And these two are the only patch perfumes I can stand.
The patchouli in those two scents smells very musky, maybe that`s why I can handle it?

It`s a very dark and erotic perfume in my opinion. I can smell flowers and citrus in the EDT, but not so much in this EDP, thankfully. It`s deeper, and more ""guilty"". :-P

Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"I had wanted to test this but hadn't seen it lately. Yesterday my husband surprised me with a bottle. He seems to find things that I look for and don't see but he finds them.

I like this I think it is classy and a bit stronger thank goodness. I have been waiting for the designers to return to the stronger perfumes because there are heaps out there for the people who like linear scents which is fine but others like me who like strong perfumes haven't had much choice from the mainstream of late.

This doesn't last very long on me. I have to respray every 2 hrs or so. I am not sure on a really cold day if it lasts longer or on a really hot day. The weather here is middle of the road so it is hard to tell at the moment.

If you like Estee Lauder Sensuous or Kate Moss Velvet Hour, Deseo by JLo, Britney's Believe, Provocative Women by Elizabeth Arden, Infiniment by Choppard etc you should try this but only if you can afford it because it is mega expensive and doesn't really last and is not as strong as it could be really.

It is strong but not offensive and polarising like Angel or Red Door etc you could wear this to the office because it has a smooth warm drydown slightly sweet. I don't get any headache from it and my husband could only smell it a little bit.

It is slightly spicey and warm so not sharp or prickly and no where near as strong as Bella D Opium by YSL. If you wear those sort of perfumes it is a great middle of the road one to choose as it has little elements of all of those perfumes. It could be worn on a hot day without being too cloying as long as you don't spray too much.

I think this one needs the body lotion with it to really smell it all day but appart from that it is very nice and worth a try if nothing else.",11/26/11 22:28,takeasniff
Gucci Guilty Intense Gucci,"Is it just me or are perfume designers trying to ease the mass market back into stronger perfumes? That for me is a good thing as I am craving something strong but original with lasting power and is available. I know I should stick to niche perfumes if I am after that but sometimes you just want to know you can find something when you like it. I don't have a lot of time to go hunting for things and I have to say most places seem to carry the same old range of perfumes some of the niche ones on here I have to go to David Jones to smell them.

I have noticed quite a few popular designers are introducing ""Intense"" versions of their previous editions which don't last and are difficult to smell apart from others on the market.

I hope the strong perfumes make a comeback as there really are enough office safe perfumes to chose from.

By the sounds of the reviews here this one is one to try. As usual no where around me sells it and doesn't know when they will be getting it. Sighs.. oh well I am sure I can wait. :(",11/23/11 19:47,takeasniff

The patchouli is just a hint, barely there. The dominant note for me is peach.

I have to say the whole ""Intense"" thing is fairly insulting to the consumer. It feels kind of like ""What ho, Biff, are you telling me now we have to put perfume in our perfume? This Occupy Wall Street thing is out of control boys."" The composition is highly unoriginal, fruitiness, clean musks and patchouli. But, it smells good, I bought it.",11/05/11 17:52,HazelMae

To be honest this smell better than the male version and I actually thought this was made for males because my girlfriends perfume normally smell so sweet compared to this one. Even my girl thought it was for males and she liked it and told me to buy it -.-""

I have only wore it two times and the first time I most have oversprayed, because my sister told me she didn't like the perfume I was wearing. I can see that if one sprays more than two times it can be overpowering and nauseating. I was wearing it today and my mom commented on how good I smelled.

A rose is a rose, and boys, this is a Queen rose - not a King.
Pure, enchanting sophistication, the hint of dusty Patchouli perfectly balanced on soft, juicy, pinky petals. No pepper, but a veil of musk to envelope in such suave, angelic embrace. It murmurs of that nonchalant sassiness typical of women who are confident about their place in the world and consequently have grown unafraid of their sexual appeal, a charm aquired with each experience.
I don't see a man pulling this off, or a girl. This is an emotionally mature, happy woman in my mind. Smiling to herself, she slowly walks downtown, content and carefree, unaware of others' attention. For she's an indomitable spirit, and time can't change that.

Neither is it sickly or fruity. My pet hate is fruitchouli perfumes that have cheap, sweet ingredients that are the mainstay of the mass perfume market. No, this perfume is quite different. She is an elegant, intriguing and restrained beauty that captivates with subtle magnetism due to the synergy between the patchouly, rose and musk which is grounded by the vetiver.

I am not generally a fan of Gucci (for the reasons explained above) but rarely they produce magnificent perfumes (Gucci Eau de Parfum now sadly discontinued). Flora 1966 is one.",07/22/19 21:57,Pilikins

Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"This review is about the new version of Flora, I'm not familiar with the original one.
Gucci fragrances don't agree with me. Not in a clinical ""I'm allergic"" way, rather a personal disagreement. The G frags I've had were generic, relying on the brand name rather than quality or originality. Not badly made, just nothing special.
Flora is a good example of a cool floral perfume that resembles other cool florals. There's a similarity to a wildflower scented organic laundry detergent I sometimes use, and Flora does have a soapy note.
This is a modern scent, wearable and work safe, unlikely to offend anyone with its average sillage and lasting power. Wearable and work safe is fine, but I expect more from a prestige brand like Gucci.",04/03/19 12:22,Phantomias
Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"I feel people are sleeping on the perfume.
It's the sophisticated version of Flora.

Rich. Musky. Patchouli. Floral. & Sweet scent.

Very unisex and iconic.

A timeless perfume that you'd buy several times over the course of life.

Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"I rarely salute a perfume.
I rarely bow to one either.....
And I rarely rarely lift my hat ( if I were a male) for a fragrance.

I thought it was spicy , sour oud that caressed my neck.
Only to discover that it's a stubborn red rose spiced up by this bourbon pepper.

The vetiver compliments this fragrance as a classy and beautiful olfactory experience.
On my skin it has nothing to do with aldehydes or 'old woman' scent.
If you like Oud, though not listed , and/or a mysterious rose , please don't miss this.
I dont want to smell like everyone else. Everyone here wears La vie est belle....... men,women,AND kids.

I wanna smell like Flora, a fragrance that says ' Don't f*^% with me'!


It's def 1966, and its def Grace Kelly.

I'm in love and its on my wish list.",08/02/17 06:00,Nil3

Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"I bought this perfume as I liked its smell, unique, not sweet, and sophisticated.

To my surprise, no one can smell it on me!! Including me !!!

So, for the price tag, I would definitely not recommend buying it.
It is like a skin scent, too soft to be recognized and appreciated.



Edit :
Yesterday I bought Zara Fleur de patchouli. It is very similar to Gucci flora 1966! Almost identical.
I hope it’s more long lasting , but again , for the price tag I can’t complain ;)",06/26/16 18:12,22Sasa22
Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,If you want something similar to Gucci 1966 try Yves Rocher Quelques Notes d'Amor. To my nose they are quite similar and they share mostly same notes. Not to mention that YR is readily available and costs a fraction of the price of Gucci.,05/21/16 01:45,maritta
Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"A very classy smell. It is at the same time soft, sofisticated and complex. Not overpowering at all and the roses are really very pleasant considering I am not a rose fan.

The bottle and the beautiful bag are an excellent match with the fragrance.",10/22/15 15:38,kre
Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"Wow! This is really very good juice. I got this based on reviews and the fact I was born in 1966 - I know how silly that sounds, but I had to have it.

I am wearing it at the moment and it's very spicy, it's a sweet/sharp chypre with a dusty rose base and it smells wonderful. It is like finding a massive bunch of flowers, dewy and redolant with scent in a dusty library. Woody, spicy, floral, dusty, deep,and deliciously divine!

If I had to compare it, it is like a mixture of Grossmith's Amelia and Roja Dove's Reckless - a complete love child of the two and clearly made from very fine ingredients. This is - to my nose - really rather special.",08/20/15 08:21,Scentmad
Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"(Review based off of a Decant)

This was a surprisingly difficult scent to locate (Thank you, swap boards!!), I've been wanting to test it out for SO long. I have yet to find a Gucci fragrance that does anything for me, so I was excited to give this one a go. I don't think it's worth the 200$ price tag to me, personally, but I digress.

Gucci 1966 is a really soft fragrance, very airy and elegant - No defining characteristics: No main sharp notes, no powder, no sugar & no synthetic chemical feel! It also has no relation to the ""current"" Gucci Flora & flankers, which contain all or most of the aforementioned accords all at once.

In the opening, I was met with a strong citrus feeling - pure bergamot, and a vodka-lime-martini-somethin'-or-other. It fades into a gentle peony/pepper combo, but only after a wierd liquorice note slightly reminiscent of Lolita Lempicka. The rose in this juice is non-existent, and so is the rest of the note pyramid! The drydown is mildly sweet, vaguely floral, and overall nondescript - Something along the lines of scented pre-packaged moist towelettes, on my skin! Wear time lasts about 1-2 hours for me.

I seem to be the only one here with this experience, so I'm going to go ahead & blame my skin chemistry!",04/25/15 22:39,Bloodlust
Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,this is so delightful. some of the the notes sounded heavy however the overall small is soft and beautifully intriguing. pepper and musk do not usually work on me however they do not dominate. the balance is perfect. 1966 says sophisticated lady. just lovely,07/05/14 02:42,julieekerr

Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"This is gorgeous. The bottle, the aroma, the packaging. It's completely gorgeous. It has roses & fresh spicy at the main accords refers to the above mention. But this scent smells like patchouli or maybe betel leaf at first 15 minutes. And it will settled and well-balanced until the end of the day, even get more sweet. The aroma of it's roses quite sexy. It's last all day. I think this 1966 quite good for evening. Almost forgot to say, this perfume a bit classic, everytime i wear it, feels like I'm in my late gramdmother's room, been chat sleep with her. I really missed her.

Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"I was surprise by this 1966, though it would be just a fancy version of Floral. The SA was so kind to let me had some free spray.

I can tell you this is a real deal. With current perfume market, bombarding us customers with cheap, synthetic perfumes, 1966 is a Real Perfume with Real Aroma Oil.

At first, I though this was a white floral like tuberose or jasmine, but the alcohol fade away, it leave me a woody smell. It's the smell of Immortelle Flowers found as important ingredient in Amouage Interlude. The flowers give you that kind of oud, woody, dry grass smell.

Ok, this perfume is the very very mind version of Interlude, it's not a silage monster that kills everyone on your way. A perfume that fits such elegant, classy lady like the great beauty, Grace Kelly.

So people, don't be scared by the price tag, this one, you pay what you get.

I hope Gucci will keep on producing this treasure.",09/18/13 06:24,mylancome
Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"So I went crazy reading reviews by everyone today, so I had to go to the Gucci store and try this myself!

I've been using Flora since it came out and I love it! This one struck me as very woody and spicy, almost like a men's perfume. Then it becomes very floral and almost sweet, but musky.

It cost me $280 (in Vancouver including tax) but I feel like I will be able to wear this perfume to special occasions, even when I become older. It's definitely worth the investment!",08/06/13 20:02,eunicek

Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"I was at the Gucci store on 5th Ave. today and I noticed this beautiful ad campaign at the store for this fragrance. The sexy black bottle, the beautiful flowers against a black silk background....I had to see what this fragrance was about. I tested on my hand and I walked out. I immediately noticed the floral aspect, but it was mixed with musky, patchouly notes. I waited to see how it would dry down.

I go into Henri Bendel and I was asked by several people what was that I was wearing because it smelled so wonderful. They described it as floral with a tad of sweetness to it, mixed with an earthy note.

I then went into Saks, thinking that they were carrying this scent, but they did not. Someone thought it was a Tom Ford scent, but I said no.

By that time, I had to go back to Gucci with the hopes that it was still open, to buy this fragrance. I was in luck! I bought it and I am so happy.

The packaging is so wonderful. I got the impression that Gucci was trying to ""copy"" Tom Ford with this scent and the packaging. Tom Ford does not have scents packaged in a black silk floral pouch (if Gucci has a blouse with this pattern....I will buy it)...but the box, the look and the combination of the notes, reminds me of something Tom Ford would have created.

I love the musk and patchouly notes that mix with the floral notes. Instead of a bright spring floral, the earthiness breaks it up and makes it so wonderful. In this HUMID weather in NYC, it really made me feel earthy and sexy. I felt like no knew of this treasure, but they wanted to know...I was asked by several people (men and women).

Enjoy and love this fragrance...be forewarned...people will seek you out.

I am excited over my purchase and I hope you will enjoy it as well.",07/13/13 20:29,talnyc

Flora by Gucci 1966 Gucci,"This is a beautiful EdP, like walking into a florist in the middle of heatwave, the drydown is a touch too ladylike for me but still intriguing. Happily, although rose is present as promised I don't get a huge walking rose bush (which I'd get sick of) it's certainly more complex, layer after layer, and rich, very rich. A floral for women and not for girls.

A bonus, the gorgeous packaging and with its own little Flora pouch, altogether will make it a wonderful present for someone.

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"Beautiful perfume! Chanel Cristalle with the rose, is what I smell here. It is like Chanel Cristalle and Versace Donna Versus had a child and named it Rose becaus she reminded them of her cousin Fredric Malle Portrait of a lady. Yes, for me this one is like a combination of those three iconic perfumes.Very unique. I do not gett any animalic notes her. Mainly rose,deep rose and chamomile on the patchouli-moss base. Yes,I smell mosse in here,like in Cristalle.
I love it! Very potent and long lasting perfume,perfectly blended.",05/15/25 23:20,Tami1979
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"A vintage bossy rose-patchouli dame with an animalic touch. She's absolutely gorgeous.
It's about time I got my curiosity for L'Arte over with. I'm relieved I only got a mini - not because there's anything wrong with the fragrance, but it would have been redundant for me to have this since I already have Fendi (1985), which I like for a dark, mean vintage rose. The rose is more forward in L'Arte, though, and has a sweetness to it.
There are quite a few fragrances like L'Arte from that period of 80's to early 90's, but if you're lusting after this one, be sure you're ready for a heady rose wearing all black, with high cheekbones and a beckoning glare.
Really a phenomenal dark rose I'd opt for during winter.",08/02/24 13:31,Aeternitas
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,I have a full 3.4ml bottle of L'Arte di Gucci purchased in early 90's and sprayed only few times. I always found it very strong and unable to wear it.

I do not want to hold on to it - any suggestions what to do with it and its worth?,03/05/23 18:16,Pnkdimnd
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"Wearing L'Arte today and boyfriend goes ""Wow, you smell good"". I agree. L'Arte is addictive and it doesn’t really remind me of anything else. Or it does, but it isn’t a fragrance. It reminds me of William Blake's “Songs of Innocence and Experience”. In L’Arte there is the same inherent duality. It's soul searching, yet takes no prisoners. Good and bad, young and old, guiltless and wise. It’s silky smooth, yet bold and has this incredibly textured feel to it. You can feel it and nearly taste it as well, when smelling it. It's almost edible. Elegant and poised, but warm at the same time. The rose in this gem is outrageously beautiful too and I hardly ever think so, since I find most roses to be a drag in perfumes. It’s a very dark, earthy rose. Not really gothic, but as the name suggests a piece of art from the asymmetri of the bottle to the nerve encapsulated in the scent itself. It's the juxtaposition of the chypre structure and the rose that casts a spell of some sort and L'Arte is indeed perfumed art in its purest form. L’Arte de Rose Absolu.",09/20/22 14:49,Selfscentred
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"I have a bottle of the original - don't really know if it's been reformulated, but it wouldn't surprise me - Gorgeous, sumptuous scent that never fails to get people to follow me and ask me what I'm wearing.

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"The Italian-style rose, the advancement of Gucci No.3, is the prototype of today's Niche rose fragrance. Outstanding descendants such as Frederic Une Rose, Portrait of a Lady... and so on, all have part of the gene of L'Arte di Gucci.
In fact, the fiasco of L'Arte di Gucci is not without a trace. Obviously, people at the time no longer valued fragrance, no longer appreciated the complex beauty of the old days, and instead pursued new fragrances that were simple and light.
L'Arte di Gucci smells to me, it's a bright, sweet and rich floral and fruity fragrance, more ripe and round than No.3.
I totally agree with a netizen comment.
In the morning, you can wear Gucci no.3, and at night, it must be L'Arte di Gucci moment.
Structural standard, the materials used are better than No.3 in 1985.
Peach aldehyde, then oakmoss around rose, geranium (peach aldehyde refers to Guerlain Nahema and Mitsouko, damascenone refers to Chanel Coco) and Tagetes on a civet base.
The leather barely smells.
In addition, the lack of details is what I think is the most regrettable thing about this perfume.
A plump, thick, honey-flavored patchouli chypre with powdered beeswax.
It is mellow and soft, and it really feels like mixed with natural rose oil, which is fragrant.
Luxurious, good-smelling, and a favorite fragrance for most noses.
Guerlain Parure in 1975, Estée Lauder knowing in 1988... From 1980 to 1990, the chypre rose can be found.
L'Arte di Gucci is a charming lady.
Serge lutens Rose de nuit is L'Arte di Gucci intensifying animal sensibilities.
EDT is not much different from EDP.
The white flowers of EDP are prominent, and the fragrance is better and diffused better, and the attributes are closer to the oriental floral fragrance.
I like EDT, the chypre features are obvious.",01/31/22 10:26,molly1217

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"If Explosive and Daddy Lutens' Rose de Nuit had a child, it would be this bxtch (forget the dates). Where Explosive's oakmoss turns sour on my skin, and Nuit smells like a cat has pissed on its rose, Gucci's L'Arte is balanced: rose comes to play, whipping its extraordinary large bloom out and on the table to impress all, followed by oakmoss oozing, and a VERY resinous labdanum creaming all over everything (think Teatro Alla Scala) . There is a bit of Aromatic Elixir's witch's brew in this cauldron, especially the chamomile-- but where as chamomile plays old on my skin usually, here it softens and seduces like the best chypres.

I kept saying she is a bad bxtch as a I sprayed and sprayed and my feline ran far, far away, under the bed... Her annoyance only matched by mine at the prices of this discontinued fragrance. Worth it.",12/17/20 19:24,fanonlamb

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"Some years ago, I found this online. I had never heard of it, but I was in the throes of Gucci Eau De Parfum (2002) so I decided to give it a try. Smart move. This is a gorgeous scent. Rich, seductive, very feminine. I get a lot of rose, but not a Victorian rose. A much more modern, assertive and dark kind. I also get leather, amber, orris and a bit of fruit (not the fruit punch variety, thank goodness).

Since it has been sadly discontinued I wear it for special occasions. And it never fails to get me compliments, the best being ""It smells so different, so unique"" (yessssss!).",12/09/17 16:40,PerfumeEmpress

To me, chypres have a ""witchy woman"" kind of vibe to them, and they're serious business in the fragrance universe. Nothing playful or frivolous here, I feel that you better know what you're doing when you wear something like L'Arte!

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"L'Arte di Gucci opens with the most beautiful rose note that I've encountered. Pure, singing, rich and deep. Just beautiful!

After about 15 minutes the heart opens, bringing in a light LoV, warm narcissus, a touch of geranium, and soft, silky, breezy mimosa. The rose remains clear and true, but softens, leaving a wonderful scent trail. You know that saying about how little girls are made of everything nice? That's what L'Arte is made of. This scent is almost magical in its complexity and balance.

In the dry down vetiver and leather appear, warming the scent, and grounding the airier florals which continue to move slowly forward. And that rose note, it remains perfectly balanced with the whole.

I usually can't wear rose, but this is spectacular. On my skin it has the darkness of the rose absolu, with the spice and tang of the base, and the wonderfully light, almost fairy like supporting florals.

Have you ever wondered what Morgan le Fae wore? Titania? Something like L'Arte, I'm sure. Gucci may call this art, but I call it magic in a bottle! You *must* try this- its phenomenal!",05/25/15 12:01,lotus and jasmine

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"A mean green rose that shines like rippled light on patent leather, it's tender and soft too, with the subtlest sexiest skank running underneath like gleaming threads of gold. On me, I feel there is something animalic softly growling (or loudly purring?) in the base, but just retrained enough that it feels like the kind of secret recognizable to only the initiated.

Everyone says this is a vulgar 80s power horse, but to me it's incredibly sleek, smooth and modern. Smoldering, opulent and dangerous and knowing exactly what she's doing and getting herself into, she's like that girl who has perfect delicate bone structure and looks good doing saying loving hating breaking EVERYTHING, roaring through the night.

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"L'Arte, huh?... Well, what can I say? It matches its name perfectly. Art... The art of indifference and nerve! Because even negative aspects demand a certain artistry. And here, this snob Italian lands a blow! She takes no prisoners! Insolence and sass galore! Rose as a note in perfumery, is not something I am truly fond of. (When it comes to male fragrances especially, I find it almost impossible for rose to be harmoniously blended in the composition. Untill now, only Loris Azzaro's Acteur and Alain Delon's Iquitos have found a not just decent but stunning way to do the trick.) But here rose shines! And not in a usual and, more or less, expected romantic way. No! A dirty and marginally vulgar rose it is that drags you by the nose... It is the scent of a woman who, under her expensive suit ( a Gucci one doubtless), hides leather underwear and a stiletto. A stiletto that she shall not hesitate to use, if all else fails (most unlikely). She had the misfortune of being born in a fin de siecle.

L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"I thought initially that I was experiencing something rather 'witchy-woo' a-la Magie Noire but upon a closer inspection I realised that there is something different and haunting to this composition. This is a byzantine fragrance;where a lost place with the sunlight overcast, the chills are warmed with fur, a diadem displaced is found, wine from overturned goblets spills forth and paths veiled by bramble canes sing of old glories.
I am unabashed in my love of this fragrance, and I am at a loss as to why the house of Gucci sacrificed one of it's most ravishing beauties. The more of the old guard lost, the more inclined I am to say my prayer before the tidal wave of juvenile syrup crashes over civilization. I can only surmise that it's birth was between two epochs and wasn't deigned to survive.",05/28/13 14:05,thenightflyer

A few months later I dropped it on my bathroom floor and it shattered. I cried(for a while)! I was already hooked. I searched obsessively on-line for a replacement bottle and finally bought one for $90.00....which is a great deal. I will never understand why this fragrance was discontinued.

This to me screams class, elegance, and sophistication....think Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast At Tiffany's and you're close. It can be quite strong so exercise caution. One little dab with do. It can be quite pricey, if you can find it but totally worth every pretty penny and more. Overall, a hands-down, knock-em-out-the-park perfume. Long Live the House of Gucci.",07/20/11 12:29,Alesangel
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"Revised- I should have revised this as soon as I acquired some which had been properly stored. It is as I had hoped- smooth true rose, rich dense animalic unique beautiful. I left my old review intact below.

OK, this is frustrating and I'm still trying to figure this one out. I've never smelled this back when it was in production, and after reading about it, I knew it was just my kind of perfume. I got my bottle today and I tried it on. I was first off told that it didn't smell good- as if it had broken down and the components were coming apart (my spouses description- not mine)! I know it should be rich dense with an aniimallic quality that some don't like, but I don't know if that is what I'm detecting. I love animallic and this strikes me as something wrong. It is what I can so far only describe as either an over ripe fruit note- similar to but not as dominant as the one I smell in my possibly too old bottle of Oleg Cassini Cassini. The thing is I know these were both in a similar vein when they were new and fresh so I don't know if the similar unpleasant note is just how they both smell when they deteriorate, or if it is how they both are supposed to smell, or if it's unrelated in origin. The note faded in proportion to the rest of the scent when I wiped some of it away with a bit of oil. I'll have to test it again. Incidentally, nothing I did reduced the presence of the over ripe cantaloupe note in proportion to the rest of the fragrance with regard to the Cassini- I could just not get around that note, it took over the blend. On the other hand, with L'Art,I can smell the beauty of the fragrance around the off note- I can tell that I could love it and I just wish I could totally erase that note, but that note may be integral to the blend. Oh well- I wish I'd discovered this sooner so I could have smelled it when it was fresh!",06/15/11 18:09,puppynose
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"this is one of the best rose scents I met so far on my quest for the perfect rose.

don't be scared away by the honey, it is not another sweet marshmallow scent... it is not so smashing imho.

not sure about the loudness or strongness though - would be interesting to see how it behaves when sprayed and not just applied to wrist with a dipstick.

interesting enough to take up the challenge and check how expensive it is really.

P.S. : i made a comparison to this with Etat Libre Rossy de Palma, after 30 minutes, these are very very similar to me",06/04/11 07:54,adrienn99

Because of previous reviews and the high price of this perfume nowadays I thought I should try the EDP again.

It's still strong, but I can appreciate the scent a little bit more (maybe the price is talking to me :-)

I guess it's just not one of those scents I would die for, but I can assure you it's a very unique scent, a real 90-ies scent, and therefore it deserves a place in my collection.",05/26/11 01:13,etmpewo

HOLY GUCCI!!!!

This one is a true Art of perfumery for me! I really treasure my every bottle (the edt's and edp's) of this discontinued beauty. For me this is one-of the kind perfume that is not made anymore nowdays! I wish i could have twice as more as i have of it now so it would last me a lifetime. Prepare to be noticed when you wear it, not everyone likes it and understands it nowdays (it IS a heavy smell and really bold), but you gonna feel yourself like a million-dollar lady! Pure sofistication and class! But this is strictly a cold time fragrance for me, i would kill anyone near me wearing this one at summertime.
A LOT of roses and big jar of honey with some spices (coriander anyone?) and you will get an absolute ÜBERsexy, animalistic fragrance that is full of passion. It takes some nerve to wear it, but if you can handle it you won´t regret. EDP is a lasting monster, lasts for over 24h on my skin and even longer on clothes. The EDT is amazing as well, but just a bit lighter (sillage is a bit weaker, but still very strong), but the scent is the same. More chypre in EDT but still over-the top honey rose!
Use it with caution, do not overspray it or you might end up having a headache. 3-4 sprays are more than enough.
But in general this is a true masterpiece and one of my most favorite and outstanding fragrances! All later Gucci edition don´t even come close to this one! Truly THE BEST Gucci ever made for my personal taste. (Gucci nr 3 is amazing as well and is on the same level of quality)",04/19/11 09:16,passionata20
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"I had the good fortune to test this discontinued beauty recently and it is very beautiful. The opening is strong and 80's-esque. But it moves into the heart of honey and roses after about 20 minutes and it is a wrist sniffer, for sure.

I spent some time in my favorite perfume store deciding what I wanted to get myself for Christmas with this one and Boucheron Initial. I could have gotten this one for about $20 less, but I decided to go with Initial. As I was driving home, I started kicking myself as this was developing so beautifully. I couldn't stop sniffing it.

But after about 2 hours as it moved into the base base notes, I was glad I went with the Initial. The dry down is unpleasant to me, plasticky and weird. I dodged the bullet with this one.",01/23/11 16:48,MsMaryO
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"This starts off really sharp and heavy, but after the first few minutes this perfume gets better and better! I really like it now, lets see what it does in a couple of hours...

Oh and I totally agree with Mymlan, that's exactly what it smells like!!!",08/26/10 09:59,Passionflower
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"l'Arte de Gucci (edp) is, together with Poison edp and Rabannes La Nuit, one of the most apparently seductive fragrances I've ever smelt. It's like a bottle full of feromones.

This stunning beauty is a creation similar to Christian Louboutins red sole high heels. They were made to send a big fat signal to men:” I’m free and ready to be romantingly chased”. But also, l’Arte is so elegant and sophisticated that you instinctively will understand that the woman wearing it is in full control of herself. And that the chain of reactions that just started around her, was exactly what she wanted and expected.

So what does it smell like? Well, as Nuppu says below it is honey dipped roses. So bind your self a big boquet of very big velvety dark red roses. Take also some that are on the verge to be owerblown. Add a lot of dark honey. Then add some animalistic notes, a pinch of moss and there it is.",04/09/10 01:22,mymlan
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"I had it in 1993 (?)...I was dating with young diplomat,who gave me it as a present. I loved it for a bottle shape, for a box, for a mistery, but it is so sophysticated smell, so I used it for only special occasions, which is back then were almost every evening.
Since that I have hundreds of perfumes, although, when I saw it recently in a small boutique, I asked to sniff again.
oh, my God! It brought me back: honey -rose,moss.Femme-fetale woman should wear this.I didn't know that back then,however, I started to dream about this perfume day and night. I would trade most of my collection things just to have this one!",03/15/10 19:44,silverbutterfly
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"This has to be the most addictive concoction I have ever laid nose on! And discontinued! The lovely reviews of Mals86 and Chat Lunatique capture this perfume's spirit wonderfully.

Rose is a rather difficult note for me, as it is usually either too powdery, or too acrid, or dangerously close to the smell of burnt plastic. But this! This is none of those, oh no, this is a thick, velvety, fleshy, moist, scorching red rose, dripped with desire. A rose that slowly starts darkening and wilting, from the edges to the core, under the song of forbidden whispers, touched by the spell of the loss.

As a side note, although perhaps similar in structure to Paloma Picasso, Soir de Lune and Knowing, I do not find those perfumes good alternatives to L'Arte: on me Paloma Picasso screams with strong vetiver and musk, in Knowing - the prominent sandalwood eats up the beautiful rose, and Soir de Lune just seems to lack in depth compared to this one.",01/29/10 06:40,Lilian
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"Wearing this for the first time today, and I adore it. A little black glass vial, scored at the vintage boutique over the weekend (I made quite a haul there!), and I feel like this is a scent to wear with a little black dress, pearls, high heels and nothing else - except maybe a small whip.

There is a sharp sweetness to it, and a heavy, rich floral spiciness behind that somehow. And below that there's something really earthy I don't recognize but I do love. It's deep and strong but I don't mind - I just want to sink into the fragrance. I put the tiniest dab on each wrist, and I now am floating in a cloud of confident sensuality.",01/18/10 06:54,cynnolan
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"Well this is for a real chypre lover!!!Very loud,strong,heavy classic chypre.Reminds me of Pilomma Picassso and very much of Soir de Lune by Sisley.I am not a chypre fan and i will pass it,although is a great perfume for mature women",10/23/09 05:31,allexa27
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"I love Dark Rose fragrances - the ones that focus on deeper/spicier/more interesting facets of rose - so I had to test L'arte.

I bought a tiny edp splash bottle, and immediately loved it. The top notes (aldehydes, berry, green notes and a very hissy cassis bud) are immediately glamorous and almost overwhelming, although much less so when dabbed rather than sprayed. The heart of the fragrances is rose. Don't be fooled by the long list of floral notes; most of them are there to round out and soften the rose and geranium. This rose lolls luxuriously, seductively, on a mossy bed. The drydown is sensuous and deep, and the best olfactory description of ""bittersweet"" I've ever smelled. It smells like the beginning of autumn, following the best summer of your life... or time for Cinderella to leave the ball.

It is simply gorgeous, and quite sensual. I prefer to decant it into a roll-on bottle (I went straight out and bought two large bottles of the edp; it's nearly impossible to find now), since it can be a bit harsh in the first ten minutes when sprayed, containing a plasticky note that I don't care for, and which I don't smell at all when I dab.

I'm sure that the recent restrictions on oakmoss were what killed L'arte di Gucci; it is crammed full of moss. Well, that and the fact that the current fashion in perfumery is for sweet and fruity scents, the polar opposite of the sophisticated L'arte. Shame.

Chat Luna below is right, it is ""intemperate"" and slinky, and rather reminiscent of Ungaro Diva, which I also like and which might be easier to find at this point in time. But L'arte has a smolder, a smoky-eyed stare, that one rarely sees outside film noir. An amazing scent.",09/21/09 12:03,Mals86
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"My Holy Grail...was lucky to snatch both edt and edp when the prices were not that sky-high... Actually it is almost 1:1 with Sisley's Soir de Lune, but less peppery and spicey. It's dark and warm, elegant and definitely not for young girls. A woman needs to have some background to be able to wear it...and then it will become like a second soul and skin;)",01/10/09 11:06,mahanta
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"I wore it, when I was in 9th grade. I had a black mini. I loved it. It's very solid and warm. Very sexy chypre.
EDP at first has a bit sharp (aldehyde) green notes with fruity notes that you won't find such in recent perfumes, then comes flowery base entangled with musky, leather and woody base. It has similar feel to honey through it too... It has old-fashioned feel to it- it's indeed like Soir de Lune and sister of Piguet's Bandit. I thought it was oriental perfume at time. Shame they discontinued it.",10/19/08 04:23,Trvevil
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"Yes, L'Arte de Gucci is strong, opulent and even loud. I don't know why, but on me this smell rich, honeydipped rose with something else what I cannot identify. But lot's of honeylike sweetnes.

This is a scent that Alexis from 80- Dynasty tv-series woud wear, luxuriant, bold and very femme fatale.",07/26/08 13:05,Nuppu
L'Arte di Gucci Gucci,"I had a brief experience with this years ago and at that time, I remembered it was priced on the higher price range which of course is nothing compared to those super expensive perfumes that had emerged nowadays.

Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,This is a true classic for a reason! Gucci No. 1 has been my go-to scent for years. It's floral and elegant with a touch of powderiness that makes it feel sophisticated. The longevity is amazing - I can still smell it on my clothes the next day!,12/16/24 18:20,Sayan09
Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Guy Robert is one of my favorite perfumers. He weaves his compositions into a tapestry that illuminates each element and has them singing a chorus of dramatic movements throughout each discrete work's development. It's not to say that this has anything to do with some wondrous alchemy on the part of Robert, but each vintage I own seems somehow immaculate, spared from the ravages of time, still sonorous after decades. It is quite a coincidence, though, and makes me wonder (and oh how I love to wonder!).

In Gucci No 1 EDP, Robert's penchant for arresting grandiosity is in full effect: an announcement of aldehydes ringing in the glamour of full-bodied florals, most notably rose, hyacinth, heliotrope, and lilac to my nose, with strong suggestions of carnation and ylang-ylang. It's intoxicating, with the blooms bursting and effulgent, reminding me of walking through an arboretum at the peak of spring with all manner of blooms emanating their seductive aromas. Yet it still manages to feel baroque and tender, especially as the dry down softens the edges, as if the flowers all retreat to a welcoming moss-lined cedar chest to reflect and rest. It is sensational.",04/29/24 05:38,alphairone
Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I had bad luck with this scent. I bought a sealed box, but when I opened it, most of the juice had evaporated, so there was less than 1/3 left. The seller agreed to return half of my money. Anyway I decided to make the most of what I got and have been wearing it a few times now. This is fabulous, high perfumery, kind of old school. Very velvety and creamy, smells like you've been using the most expensive, luxurious soap and body lotion. I can't tell the notes apart, but the scent is woody and a little bit animalic but not in a bad way. It simply smells like a wealthy, well-maintained woman, driving in her leather-upholstered car, wearing Gucci sunglasses. The scent lingers around you without re-applying for good 8-10 hours. It's a pity my bottle wasn't full, but if I ever run into Gucci no 1 again I'm going to snatch it.",02/26/24 04:37,Salkavalka
Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"When I was a child and thought about what perfume smelled like, Gucci No. 1 is what I imagined in my mind. As a child of the 80s, it’s no surprise that a big powdery floral with aldehydes and oakmoss in the base, would be what I had olfactory dreams of. When I first spray this it simply smells like “80s perfume,” but I immediately recognized the aldehydes, then the hyacinth, and I could already detect the oak moss. My 9 year old told me that I smelled good at this point. As it dries down, I smell a simple, but fragrant bouquet of early spring flowers, the oak moss and aldehydes are still there but tempered by the woodiness that’s peaking through. Maybe this perfume is dated, but it’s very lovely, and it’s exactly what I miss in todays perfumes. Definitely worth a try, if you can find a sample, it’s worth it!",01/07/24 18:15,cgaleb
Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I believe iI wore this in the 1970s, based on the picture. When I look at those many notes (and especially what some of them are), I wonder how it was that I wore this. I don't consider myself a big lover of florals. These days I am more of a gourmand girl.

Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I have an old bottle of Gucci no. 1, with a content that has become resinous and difficult to spray, but the juice is still fantastic! It is like that one week of late spring/early summer when you can stick your whole head in a blooming jasmine bush, or a white lilac tree, and become totally emersed in a drunken, heavy and sweet smell, with still fresh and green stems, before the bloom is over, decay kicks in and the smell goes bad. Gucci no. 1 is right on that border between perfectly folded out and over ripe flowers. It stays on the good side though, even though my bottle is ancient by now. What a treat!

I never smelled it before and as soon as I got it I sprayed some on. I didn't know what the notes were in the fragrantica pyramid but the very first thing I smelled was aldehydes a little bit of hyacinth. Soon it started to change into a very warm fragrance. This is mostly a spicy honeyed carnation with thick gooey Amber. I get the oak moss in the middle notes along with the Ylang Ylang. It smells like there may be some civet in here but it just adds to the class and sophistication of this perfume. It lasts so long at least over 12 hours. Sillage is an arm's length and after 30 minutes sits closer to the skin but still very noticeable.

Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Maybe I am too subjective in here, because I have worn this svent for almost three decades and at that time I did not know nearly as many fragrances as I do today. Whatever the reason, I love this fragrance. I do not usually like carnation that much, which is to me the most preeminent note in this fragrance, but here, although very obvious and as noticeable as in other famous carnation fragrances or even more, it is used in a very good balance from my viewpoint with the other notes. Its scent goes and comes, and, at the breaks, lets you smell fully the round full sweet side of this fragrance, to me achieved mostly from jasmine and amber. It also smells a lot of cedarwood, whose scent mixes up very tightly with carnation. Also, this fragrance is really strong and powerful, everyone in a room wil notice it, and has excellent silage and staying power. Well, it was created at a time when eau de parfum really meant what it is supposed to mean. Guy Robert really created masterpieces. I have owned for decades all his three to me main fragrances, Madame Rochas, Caleche and Gucci nº 1. It is a pity it has been discontinued, although some five years ago I still found a bottle in a London Chemist.",07/29/13 06:31,Migalex

I didn't like that at first but now I've come to understand that it's more a compliment then a degradation as I first took it. Now I come to think of the classic parfumeries in Paris, late 1700 and the French court every time that I smell it.

Addendum:

I have a LOT of scents, so it has been a while since I wrote this. I wore it again today, and the first application as I said before was ""pretty"". It seemed very floral and kind of Joy/Fidji/Anais Anais-ish. The scent would be kind of on my periphery and then dissipate when I tried to get a good sniff. Then, after lunch I reapplied my vintage edp, spraying a bit more, not a lot. Same bottle, mind you. It was like putting on a different scent! All of a sudden the herbal/green/woodiness flowed forth and enveloped me in majesty! Now a few hours later, I have some of each the floral and the woody quality. Oh yeah, this is a real masterpiece, alright.",07/19/12 19:37,kuanyin4
Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I don't typically review women's scents, but this is an epic masterpiece. With the passing of Guy Robert just two days ago on May 28th, I wanted to say that this is a bottle of amazing quality - a masterpiece and timeless beauty. While classified as a ""Floral Aldehyde"" - it is stunningly deep, rich and full of earthy and wood notes. Oakmoss, patchouli, amber, cedar, musk and a benzoin/vanilla base further enhanced by tonka bean. So deep and warm. The color of the Eau de Parfum in a 60ml spray I bought for my wife is bronze and all the notes are true to form. It is closer in color to Guy Robert's 1970 masterpiece he created for Hermes in Equipage (4 years earlier) than his bottling of Gucci Pour Homme Original just two years later...a chypre.

Now, while I am adventurous in scent and adore his 1976 creation - a masterpiece for men! - there is a part of me that believes this scent with it gorgeous base notes and integrated oriental tones and depth could possibly be worn by a confident, classic man! I have floral scents for men that are far less rich as this and could easily be worn by my wife. While I believe this is perfection in scent made for a confident and elegant woman of taste - understand that this plays off Carl Jung's archetypes of both Dynamic Feminine and a strong presence of Static Masculine in the base notes that could easily rise to the forefront. It smells as good today as it did nearly 40 years ago - and, perhaps in comparison to so many scents that are not nearly as well-composed...even better. Timeless. Just like a piece by Bach, or Chopin - does it ever sound ""dated""? No, it is classic...as is this fragrance.

I see this as a centerpiece for a woman's collection - it is chic, amazingly elegant and gorgeously rich. Not for the faint of heart. Age appropriate is 30's to 60's, but it is how a woman carries herself and her aire of sophistication that will allow her to adorn this fragrance. This is a confident Woman's scent that is never going to be out of style - like Monsieur Robert's Pour Homme bottling...you must wear this proper or it will wear you.

Gucci No 1 Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I'm not sure about this one yet. I just got a vintage bottle of it--never before opened--and I was VERY eager to try it out on me. Gucci 1 is definitely designed for a woman. That said, I'm still trying to decide if it's for me. It has a very strong, decisive signature & I'm not sure which notes are the ones that define it. For me, it really is the aldehydes, cedar, geranium and carnations.

Gucci 1 has a way of making an imprint on that part of your mind where memories are stored. I can still smell it precisely even though it's a recent discovery for me; isn't that what is so amazing about classic vintage perfumes!! This is a main reason why we love fragrance isn't it?

This would go well with a mediterranean style palacial estate.",10/31/11 16:04,Hellokt

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"Whoa, very pretty. I was wondering if the lily of the valley would be heady and it is not. To me, this is well blended. Sweet and juicy floral. There's something candy like to it, but its not cloying. I love this 9/10",10/22/25 18:17,Lnn1994

Tears From The Moon Gucci,Not worth the price at all imho. Average fresh peony and soapy clean scent. Has a little bit of a sharp note almost smelling like magazine paper which I find a little annoying. Will most likely sell my bottle. Although I will say the bottles are absolutely stunning and I love the concept behind them. (Also the atomizer is amazing it sprays really good and even),09/26/25 16:39,SmellWithDel

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"On paper, very lovely. I was completely blind to the top notes for some reason, and smelled the bottom and they were sooo good. Soapy and then a musk at the end that was so good. I ordered it after smelling it in a duty free.

I wonder if the blindness had been because I had been smelling other perfumes.. but the dry down was so beautiful on paper. I didn't spray myself because I wanted to smell how it developed on the paper in case I didn't like it, I didn't want to be trapped on a plane with it! It was so pleasant. Soapy and a light musk at the end. Then looking at the notes I thought I could imagine the opening, because I love white flowers.

Well, I just received it in the mail and.... I don't hate it as in, need to wash it off but.. I just sprayed it on and it's been.. 45 minutes and it already smells stale. The elements are there. And very pretty. But there is a sharp note that someone above described as ""magazine paper"" and I know exactly what they meant. To me, that sharp note, like an out of tune violin, smells to my nose like pleather.

I wanted to smell like a cloud. I wanted light and comforting. I feel so dumb for buying this blind! I can see it giving someone a headache.

All the lightness of the Lily of the Valley is dragged down by this dense pleather smell. It's fleeting, but enough to turn me off. I am so glad I didn't buy a full bottle. It doesn't do the rest of the line justice and I have no idea what happened. It smells the same way on paper. Sweet, then pleather, then stale perfume. I am so bummed. I wanted to love this so much. Edited my harsh review.....99% of the reviews I read were positive and the other 1% are reviews saying it's nice, or ok, but too expensive. If the fragrance delivered and smelled magical, as I was anticipating, then the price would be worth it. I guess I assumed because it was the higher end of perfumes, it would be good.

I might wear it to bed occasionally.",09/10/25 06:26,HChan47

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"Tears From The Moon, by Gucci, smells like roses and Lily-Of-The-Valley.

It is a very refreshing, floral, spring bouquet. The scent is very pleasant and very easy to like if you like refreshing rose fragrances.",04/12/25 01:15,JuliaToothFairy
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"This is quite unique, I don’t think I can compare it to many fragrances, few that come across my mind that are slightly similar but yet still different. HFC Dancing Queen but it’s stronger than Gucci and slightly sharper, Gucci is much softer yet still has that slight spice sweetness that I remember from HFC. And also Kingkydise Laurent Mazzone Parfums but I think this one has more musk and citruses so again I do prefer Gucci over this one as well.
Tears of the moon is very gorgeous, and absolutely ultra feminine fragrance and first fragrance from Gucci line I actually truly love and wear. I think the Lily of the Valley really adds that green quite note, softness and uniqueness to this fragrance that differs from other peony center fragrances. Also I would classify it as clean clean fragrances, it definitely has some slight spice and sweetness to it but just perfect amount not to be overwhelming. One down side is I don’t think it’s great performer, I get may be 4-6 hours before I have to reapply. All in all love it and definitely happy I bought it.",04/03/25 06:28,Kots_Tanya
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"This one from this line stand out to me maybe because of it simpleness, has a very sweet light floral scent, but it kinda nostagic in a way that makes me think about that one time I went to a picnic to watch the night stars in the cold forest that I didn't have. Anyway in a more simple term I think it's simple, skin scent, blooming flowers, good for everyday wear, suitable for those that want a soft, leaning feminine sweet light floral scent.

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"@Antoshka2 From the looks of your shelf of perfumes you own, you're not afraid of feminine leaning fragrances so why the archaic comment? All perfume is unisex and it is such a silly delusion to think otherwise. This is a beautiful floral bouquet that any man could rock if their fragile masculinity isn't at stake.
We all have the right to smell good, and I think any man that wears peony or any other floral focused perfume is still a man through and through, just one that may smell extra divine.",08/27/24 13:48,Johnny Madison
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"This fragrance is very pretty, it really is like all of those from ""reminds me of"" section together but lighter and more transparent. Carefree, sweet (just the right amount of sweetness), pleasant. Dries down to a slightly sweet jasmine with a hint of musk. Lasts about 30-45 minutes. I've never tested a $450 bottle of Eau Fraiche (not even a cologne in my opinion) before. I picture a young wealthy woman in a flowy floral dress on a sunny morning heading down to the terrace in her mansion to have breakfast. She only needs this Eau Fraiche to last about 30 minutes because after breakfast she will be wearing a different fragrance heading to the city to do all those important but unnecessary things she needs to do :-D",07/13/24 16:04,natk
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"Notes listed are not complete. The base notes are missing, they are showing the beautiful top and heart notes. I smell incense and patchouli, just the faintest bit but it's there. So top notes are light clean and lovely. It's the dry down as usual, that doesn't work for me. Coco Mademoiselle base notes and it's mixed with the top notes but I still get the faintest ghost dry down it's the very very last notes of Coco Mademoiselle. This is wayyy lighter version so if you like that fragrance and it's just too strong for today's world or you work in healthcare but want that smell this is it. This is a wispy fresher ghost of that scent and suitable for healthcare. I don't like Miss Coco, don't like incense or patchouli but it's a crowd pleaser it seems.",07/09/24 16:14,corgi02
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"Such a gorgeous floral perfume. It’s very well blended and I can’t pick out one flower over the other. It’s delicate, has the perfect amount of sweetness from the florals. There is just a touch of powderiness. It’s a very feminine perfume and I always feel pretty when I wear this. Longevity and sillage are moderate, but for how airy and light it is, it performs surprisingly well. Every time I’ve worn this perfume I get compliments, it really is so very pretty.",06/11/24 09:41,cgaleb
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"Ultra feminine, that peony is intoxicating. Most people associate peonies as fresh flowers, but if you've buried your nose into one you would understand what it means to get drunk off of a flower. This captures the peony blooming right in front of you beautifully. I disagree with people calling this clean because I am understanding that to categorize this as fresh. I wouldn't call this a fresh scent. This is very floral forward from opening to dry down. It'd not even like you're holding a bouquet, it's like you have flowers blooming in front of you, behind you, right next to you, and you're smelling it all at once.",04/27/24 21:27,jow012

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"I had high hopes for this white floral blend. Whenever I get my nose on these types of scents, I always hope for naturals, but instead get stuck with synthetic, cleaning products aromachemicals.

I think it will make the bride look more ethereal and radiant if she wears it.

I feel Gucci always does bring out the best in their perfume line..(also Gucci pls bring back Gucci Parfum II and Gucci by Gucci EDP)

UPDATE:
this is my new signature scent. im bummed that it is sold out in my area and the waiting list for this perfume is now 2-pages long! i just love it so much i spray it on even before going to sleep. when i do spray it on my body, i'd take numerous sniffs on myself coz i love smelling it on me. people complimented me many times and i feel the perfume sings to me and calling my name hahaa..it's haunting as its name suggests! Oh GUCCI PLS DO NOT DISCONTINUE IT!

UPDATE Feb 2025 ~
im still loving it. it's a gem, a rare find, it's 2025 now and i havent found any perfume that smells like it. =)

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"I don't expect designer brands to stop making Peony fragrances, given that they sell exceptionally well. But I do hope that the perfumers try to present the note in a novel and refreshing setting.

Gucci Tears From The Moon and Creed Wind Flowers are two recent releases from established brands, both prominently featuring Peony.

The Creed plays it incredibly safe and does absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, delivering a floral, caramelized perfume laying on a gigantic base of coumarin. Typical pink floral. You've smelled it hundred times before; you know which scent I'm talking about.

The Gucci however, does start somewhat disappointing, but as it dries down I discover a wonderful take on Peony. The contrast of a floral note with lily-of-the-valley reminds me a lot of Dior Lucky, but not as much ""zesty"" and more delicate. What I LOVE about Tears From The Moon is that I smell next to no sweetness in it. Sure the peony itself does have a sweet accent, but it comes off in a totally natural and floral manner instead of a sucrose-type sweetness that I'm not really fond of.

As far as relation to the moon goes, I'd say this resembles a waltz under the moon: peaceful and elegant but still with some energy, rather than a quiet alone stroll or romantic dinner under the moon which are more melancholic and mellow respectively.",05/09/23 19:22,17seyed
Tears From The Moon Gucci,I really like this but if oversprayed it can give a slight dash of a hairspray vibe. Does resemble Bright Crystal but not the same sweetness. Mediocre lasting powder but better than BC.,05/05/23 10:14,AquaBaby5
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"This is an ethereal beautiful soft floral scent with very light citrus notes and a powdery feel. I agree with the previous reviews that it is not long lasting on my skin and does not have great silage beyond arms length; however I do find it to be potent for the first hour it is on. Definitely recommend a smell. Added this to my collection as I didn’t have any lily of the valley fragrances, and I also needed a new spring freshie.",04/22/23 08:45,lerikasierra
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"the name does not match the smell. this is a rich, soapy, almost syrupy feminine floral. very “fresh out the shower” as someone said below. it’s a basic shampoo scent and may be too sweet for some, but I think it smells great and most men would love this on a woman.",04/02/23 09:35,wowoweee
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"I got this as a sample with my purchase of Winter's Spring at the Gucci counter at David Jones at the Queen's Plaza Mall in Brisbane, which I love! (I'm talking about the Gucci scent here, though I love this high-end mall too with it's Chanel and Dior boutique.)

I liked the opening of ""Tears From the Moon"" at first and I thought that it had a fairly pleasant smell, but that it really lacked any ""oomph"" to give it that extra boost. It's a very soapy, sweet and girly fragrance and smells like you just came out of the shower. I get a hint of citrus at the top, but it's more an almost sickly Glade rose air freshener smell. I guess that's the peony and the lily-of-the-valley mixing together. I don't think that it is a good combo at all and I usually love lily-of-the-valley.

As it develops, it gets closer and closer to the skin rapidly, until you smell pretty much nothing just under two hours later. I would NOT spend more than $500 AUD for a perfume that hardly lasts at all like this and smells cheap. I don't know what Gucci was thinking with this...",02/22/23 10:22,WhiteFlowerPrincess
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"This feels like a departure from the rest of the collection. The majority of the scents are quite evocative, fitting, with names like A Gloaming Night and Love at Your Darkest. Tears from the Moon is almost too pretty to fit in with the rest of her melancholy siblings. It’s a beautiful floral that starts off bright and airy, with a little green from the lily of the valley, and dries down to soft spiciness from the Stephanotis. The peony is very subdued here. While I really like the scent and the overall aesthetics of the collection, the longevity leaves much to be desired.",02/10/23 17:09,Chocobaby

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"Admittedly, I’m a sucker for any floral. But this has to be my absolute favorite. I wore Coach Floral on the daily for years, and this is her more sophisticated older sister.
It’s not at all an aged floral in my opinion, it’s very light and I’d say friendly for nearly all ages, while some florals can smell dated or age you. It’s a very fresh scent, you’re paying a lot to smell like you just took a shower and lit some candles, sprayed some rose water and walked through a garden of jasmine. It’s a very pretty scent, but quite light. There is no sweetness to it, it’s a dry floral scent. Fades nicely, and lasts many hours, but more of a skin scent than one you could smell projecting a mile away.",08/28/22 13:09,gen_shaye

Florals and fresh but super feminine to my nose. The sales woman at the botique liked it but I could tell she didn't know anything about perfume (she tried to tell me that niche fragrances should be linear) so take that with a grain of salt.

I got one spray on my hand and it lasted about 1.5 hours before it was gone. I'm getting close to giving up on this brand. Another 350 dollar disappointment from Gucci. This house is all style and no substance.",07/24/22 20:48,The Wolf
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"Just like a gentle morning kiss or an innocent evening peck, this fragrance arrives without any fanfare to simply envelop the space around one’s body with its close to skin notes while making its arrival a sensual happening.

The subtle peony notes take the center stage while the balance of the floral notes provide their supporting rolls in perfect harmony and create a symphony meant for one… intimate and reserved for the seldom few who get a chance for a closer encounter!

Tears From The Moon Gucci,"I finally got this in the mail! its a lightly powdery delicate dry rose scent to me. When I say delicate, I mean very delicate which may bake it lean feminine however there is no sweetness to this. Im getting less Peony and more Rose as the notes say Peony but it a very natural floral oil and not an imitation of a floral note. This is not a strong fragrance at all more of a skin scent. I do like this a lot thought, however it may not be a crowd pleaser or compliment getter.. you will never bother anyone with this even if you spray 100 sprays. Its a white linen type of scent but maybe fit for a queens bed... it does remind me of royalty. A white satin pillow of a princess or queen :) Very fluffy and dry like a coconut husk type of dry but balanced out with the natural light floral oils in it. Really worth trying if you like light, delecate white T kind of frags.",05/03/22 13:38,Nicyoung
Tears From The Moon Gucci,"I got a sample of this a few days ago and tried it out, the initial opening was very floral, the jasmine and peony really took over,

I first thought no way I can pull this off but after I let it settle for a few hours it was almost powdery with a very light musk note coming through, it did grow on me as the day went by and I really would consider buying a bottle,

It is however a little more on the feminine side so it all depends how it sits on your skin.

I would however highly recommend getting a sample to try if you can. It is very long lasting and the projection is great! It is for sure a complement getter!",05/01/22 02:46,SmthR21

Eau de Gucci Concentree (1982) Gucci,"Copied and pasted from review on new version (before this version was added to the database):

idressyou 08/20/10 14:53

This is for the original cologne concentree version. Initially, I get almost pure hyacinth, with a smidge of Spanish cedarwood, with the cedarwood becoming more prominent as the drydown continues. I have a jar of hyacinth tincture I made from purple hyacinths picked from my yard, and this is almost spot-on. I haven't tried the reformulation, but the original is very pretty and a must-try for hyacinth lovers.",04/11/24 00:59,idressyou
Eau de Gucci Concentree (1982) Gucci,"The vintage one I have (comes in a dark plastic bottle) is pleasant, but reminds me very strongly of the smell of 80's, 90's hair salons.

Eau de Gucci Concentree (1982) Gucci,"(I have the rectangular pocket spray with the word concentree having an accent over the second 'e'). This is a beautiful perfume. After a few moments of initial spray on my inner elbow smell very similar to a Anais Anais by Cacharel's dry down (nod to @Kentington, whose review I only looked at after I began writing this review and noted the Anais Anais similarity). I believe I can detect all but a few of the notes. Thankfully for me the tuberose and hyacinth are neither loud nor cloying which would have steered me away. My takeaway: flowery, muted vanillic woods with a dollop of aldehydes that is the glue that holds it all together and keeps it sparkly. Very lovely and classy.",07/02/20 16:26,Adrien02
Eau de Gucci Concentree (1982) Gucci,"I had this, wore it, and loved it. It was marketed for women-- not unisex as labelled here.

Eau de Gucci Concentree (1982) Gucci,"For the guys who might be interested in this one...while ""unisex"" certainly applies to perfume in general, and you should wear what you want and not worry about what labels go on things (blah blah)...this is VERY floral. Reminds me a great deal of Anais Anais, but instead of an almost salty lily note, it's the powdery hyacinth from Chamade with a sweetish dry-down. If green-powdery florals are your thing, then this one is your perfume...but if your idea of ""unisex"" is a variation on the classic citrus colognes, then you're probably not gonna like it.",04/08/19 17:22,Kentington

Eau de Gucci Concentree (1982) Gucci,"This perfume is beautiful- and it saddens me that it was so short lived, and that many have forgotten it, or confuse it with the far inferior 1993 reformulation. Maybe a fresh floral missed the zeitgeist by a decade, as we were heading into the 1980s powerhouses when this was launched.

This is one of my favourite fragrances I’ve ever owned.
It’s simple.. but elegant.

I was gifted this at 14 years old when I was growing up in the UK (I am now 31). I loved it then and I still love it now.

I now live in Australia and could not get a bottle of this anywhere due to it being discontinued or paying an unjustifiable price $$$

This is a very nostalgic and sentimental smell for me so it’s a 10/10.

citrus, woody Cyprus, slight floral note with the tobacco and leather coming through which smell amazing. Very well blended.

I just bought Rasasi Abyan because of fragrantica votes.. and WOW it smells exactly the same. I don’t know how because the notes are completely different but it smells like Gucci by Gucci, but it still isn’t loud and powerful like it needs to be.

I really wish they would remake Gucci by Gucci pour homme making it more powerful and lasted longer as it was very unique and in a lane of its own.

These types of fragrances are not every day work horses. Just pick the moment and it will delver stellar performance for that brief 2 - 3 hour business meeting, flight, intimate or casual 3 hour barbecue nite out with the guys.

Which sucks, I never slam on perfumes for performance, with this im just gutted because it would be in my rotation. But due to it's performance it's not.

Please make an intense, Extreme, Parfum! Boost this thing up!

This < me being disappointed. Seriously if this lasted atleast 4hrs I'd have a bottle at all times.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,The tobacco in this scent is beautiful. I don't agree with many reviews here that it's generic.

I've had multiple bottles over the years and found a NoS bottle at a local pharmacist last year. The cypress and violet are beautifully blended and the scent is refined and mature for a designer fragrance.

If they re-released this in a more potent form, I might never touch the rest of the collection again. For now, I just have to accept that 8+ sprays is what it takes, and the 50ml bottle will drain all too quickly.",02/20/25 08:41,eusp

This is a very well put together scent, it’s incredibly masculine and smells like a strong man. It reminds me of like a dryer, greener Creed Aventus kind of

This is all-season, day or night to me. Some people beg to differ when it comes to summer but this is definitely summer appropriate. It’s not sweet at all or too dry and leathery to the point that this would off-put anyone in hot weather.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"How on earth are people calling this ""classy"" and ""sophisticated""? Maybe I'm showing my age (early 30s), but this was a relatively popular sleazy clubbing fragrance in the 2010s...

Maybe this is now considered ""sophisticated"" in 2024 because the current day male fragrance landscape is drenched in syrupy, le male elixir type fragrances. So this probably seems almost austere compared to the current day fragrance trends, but make no mistake; this was definitely ""clubbing juice"" back in the day.

The only reason this doesn't have the same current-day clubbing bro ""connotation"" as Eros and VIP 212 have is because this had a higher price point than those two, and the other two came out a couple of years later with an overall sweeter, more crass profile that the club boi's shifted to.

Extremely obscure reference, but this smells like the PUA/Roosh V movement of the 2010s.

If you know what that was and you've smelled this fragrance, then you will know I've perfectly summed up the type of guy this fragrance was popular with back in the 2010s.

There's no class or sophistication here. It's 2013, and I see an Andrew Tate-looking chrome dome guy who has over sprayed the shit out of this, wearing dated Ksubi ultra-tight skinny jeans (the ones with the million, purposeful pre-made rips in them and random zippers everywhere) with a long sleeve black polyester shirt or v neck t shirt, top three or four buttons undone, hitting up Miami, Bangkok, and Bali clubs, performing his pick up artist ""seduction"" routine on trashed girls and trying to start fights with every ""soy boy"" he sees.

I used to smell this so much in clubs back in the 2010s. There was definitely a particular ""type"" of unsavory guy who wore it. Might sound like I'm being over the top, but to quote LCD Soundsystem: ""I was there"".

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"#419 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""

Between it's introduction and its discontinuation I probably wore Gucci Nobile for business and office wear more than any other fougere. It's loss was tragic, but like eventually finding a new girlfriend, I found Houbigant's Duc de Vervins L'Extreme and a decade later Dior's Eau Sauvage Parfum and I got over the loss. Gucci's had hits and misses for me. I like and still have Mémoire d’une Odeur. I thought Guilty Pour Homme Parfum was so bad I gave it away. I've also had Gucci Envy until it was discontinued.

I like this Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme, which is supposedly also discontinued, though you still see it on Amazon and eBay. And some folks are saying Gucci Pour Homme is the same scent in a different bottle. I can neither confirm nor deny. I like this sample enough that if there were an EDP version of this scent available I'd own a bottle. It’s like most EDTs not much sillage, longevity three hours at best. A very masculine fragrance, very peppery, woody notes, not too much tobacco for my taste, and some bergamot. Good business wear stuff. Maybe a little dated, by like 20 years, but now you'd say it's a ""classic"" fragrance like Geoffrey Beene's ""Bowling Green.""

There are many scents that I'd wish for in an EDP, by Jacques Bogart, Lomani, Vicky Thiel, Ted Lapidus. But they are only available as very moderately performing EDTs, about which I have declared, ""I will buy no more forever."" At some point I hope to check out Guilty for Men Absolute for myself, if it's not discontinued by then.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci by Gucci
I'll start by saying that it's been in my top 5 for six years and it looks like it will be in my top 5 for life.
I think they made an excellent choice with James Franco as the advertising image, the warmth of his gaze defines the essence of gucci by gucci.

All in agreement with its sillage, I deduce that it is extremely ""intimate"", for personal enjoyment and for those people who enjoy our extreme confidence, so much so to allow them to get close to our neck or chest and feel it in its maximum splendor.

Its aroma gives me a certain serenity, when I have insomnia, I apply a little on my wrist and immediately feel calm, maybe it is the incense note and/or its balsamic accord.

Yes it is true; very Italian scent, elegant and seductive, for formal and evening wear. Easily the signature fragrance for a gentleman.

With one of the best opening I've ever felt, in one word, ""perfect"". It smells great, too bad it fades so fast,

To my personal taste one of the 5 best tobacco notes I've tried, (pure havane, versace man, gucci envy & michael by Michael kors). Also I perceive a small ""bitter"" and woody hint which fascinates me a lot.

The bottle is already in the major leagues of design, perfect for collection even if you don't like the contents.

I pray that someday a ""parfum or intense"" version will be released, the one that came out in 2015, ""Gucci pour Homme"" with the silver lined box, failed to repair the ""defect"" of the sillage.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Why aren't tobacco perfumes made that way?

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme a combination of tobacco, violet and cypress, unique, memorable is a legacy that Aurelian Guichard leaves behind, another masterpiece of the house, undeservedly thrown into the shadows.

Gucci by Gucci is a brilliant perfume that has unfortunately been forgotten. I say this because it is unique, a piece of classic and modern art at the same time with a note of fresh aromatic tobacco, slightly smoked... a little hint of darkness. The novelty of this creation comes through the introduction of the Violet and Cypress instead of the sweet or gourmand notes we are used to, transforming the perfume into something green, ozonic and crisp. It makes me think of the air you breathe into the forest after a heavy rain.

It has a romantic vibe, it is tailored by a hand that knows very well how to bring delicacy in a perfume into the same place with elegance and masculinity. A classic italian DNA. The notes may not say much, but the story is what matters. This perfume deserves a sequel that unfortunately I have not found elsewhere.

Performance is typical eau de toilette. On the skin last quite a bit, maybe a few hours due to the reformulations instead I recommend it to be sprayed on clothes. Sillage and projection average. This fragrance requires to be used in autumn and spring on cold temperatures, being quite versatile. Pair it with a shirt, a sweater or a leather jacket.

Gucci by Gucci must be placed alongside the other sacred monsters of the house, Pour Homme, Envy and Rush.

Hate to say it, but this is just another woody aromatic. It doesn't jump out at me as a ""wow, this one is special"" fragrance like the Gucci Pour Homme 2003. Are you telling me they axed that for this one? What a shame. There's a reason this one doesn't get any mentions in the fragrance community, and with Youtubers. Don't think I've seen this on a top 10 list, ever. This fragrance isn't bad at all, it's a borderline like/okay for me. I've experienced hundreds of frags over the past few years since I got really interested in them, so at this point, I've been spoiled by masterpieces in this category. Perhaps if I found this earlier I'd be higher on it. The bottle is nice; Gucci is the master of clunky, heavy glass bottles and this one doesn't disappoint.",12/30/20 06:38,Eau De Treasure
Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Zesty, woody, pine-y tobacco scent.

* I smell on paper*
Zesty wood because of the bergamot, pine-y because of the cypress and the tabacco makes it gentleman like. It smells expensive, but still a crowd pleaser so you can wear it at the office. It doesn't smell like paper, but I reckon if you like the smell of paper from old books, you will also like this one if you don't mind a pinch of flowers.
I hear some say smokey, but I hate smokey and don't find this smokey at all.

* My womanly 28 y/o opinion *
To me this is a panty dropper. Smells just like James Bond would smell. A confident gentleman who knows how to charmely pop open champagne. You can only wear this from about 30 years old and if you have a calm personality. If you are very extraverted or emotional, the spell that comes along with this scent might be spoiled. Don't tell them, but I buy this one for every boyfriend I have.

To conclude:
You have to love cypress (pine like smell), bergamot (citrussy wood), tobacco smell and don't mind a little flower.
It's widely available, so try it at a store on your skin first! :)",12/18/20 07:06,Onsmupske

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme is a woody and aromatic fragrance.

At its opening the combination of violet and citrus leaves gives me an olfactory illusion like grape juice. In a few minutes a woody base of mainly tobacco and cypress and to a lesser extent patchouli and amber emerges.

I love the scent in general and it would be one of the best fragrances if it performed better. I have the bottle that now says Gucci Pour Homme, but it is the same aroma as when it said Gucci by Gucci, and the projection was always just as low, although smelling it on my wrist is perceived for about 8 hours.

It's fresh and woody, but not fresh enough to be used in summer or spicy enough to be used in winter, so its best settings are spring and fall and the office.",11/30/20 18:08,caifan
Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"I like this one, I don't love it. I bought this one at the mall when I was going through a tough time with a break up. I wanted something that would pump up that confidence after being out of the game for a minute. This smell is nice but wasn't exactly a compliment getter. Maybe it had a placebo effect on me because I didn't wear it much but just from wearing it occasionally it did build my confidence up a bit. I've been blessed to have some smoking hot women as my GF's. This is one of the best bottles I've seen in a fragrance. This right here is strong and sturdy and this fragrance made me feel strong and sturdy. The dry down for me is the best part of this. I wouldn't pay more than 45 for this but I bought this at 80.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"My partner insisted on purchasing this fragrance for me shortly after it's release. ""Sex in a bottle"" is how she described it.

I absolutely love the tobacco note in here, and paired with the other notes, creates a classy, masculine, smoky and seductive composition. It's a shame about the poor performance though. Fits a reserved personality.

The rating on this one should be higher. I agree with some of the reviewers below, this is overlooked and indeed underrated.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Growing up we all have heard of Gucci, probably one of the most well known designers on earth. When I started my search into the fragrance community I had to own Gucci, I couldnt care less about how it smelled, I just had to own Gucci. So my first fragrance I bought when I got into the community, was Gucci Pour Homme.

The Good:
The good is all in the smell, 100% nothing about the smell do I hate. It's warm and spicy with a good amount of tobacco. You don't smell like a chain smoker when smelling this but the Tobacco is just enough to enjoy. I honestly had a hard time pinpointing certain notes in the note pyramid except for Tobacco. As someone who does Leather crafting as a hobby I found no hints of leather. This isn't to say the smell is bad(it is perfect) I just cant pin point some notes that are supposed to be in here. Finally the bottle, it's just such a dope looking bottle with the weird pin like thing on top, I love it.

The Bad:
The biggest shortcoming is the longevity and projection. It turns into a skin scent like 2 hours in. Yes the smell is amazing but this just makes me so sad. An amazing scent that is fantastic but turns into a skin scent in no time.

Conclusion: Honestly one of the best scents in my collection, if it wasn't for the terrible projection and Longevity. The fragrance is pretty cheap on most websites and I got me 2019 batch online for like $40.",08/12/20 11:59,Imad M.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Beautiful scent with lack of performance. Lasts about 5h top, and becomes a skin scent after 2 hours. It's never a big projector by any means, people would literally need to be right next to you to smell it after 2 hours. Great date scent. Very sophisticated, classy, safe and not overpowering. If you can't stand sweet fragrances and looking for a fresher sensual date fragrance, get this one. I don't recommend going heavy on the spray though because the scent itself can be pretty thick. Just do like 5 sprays first, then reapply 1-2 sprays after 5h. This one of the staples in my collection just for the beautiful scent itself. Do keep in mind that it smell a little sweeter on clothes (just a tiny bit from the tobacco) and last a little longer on clothes too (about 6-7 hours, but a light scent).

UPDATE: After wearing this a little more, I've gotta say the performance seem to be worse than what I thought it originally was. I still can detect it at the 5h mark if I really smell it up close, but everyone in my family said they couldn't smell it at all anymore (that was about the 3h mark). You'd probably have to reapply this one very often if you want people to smell it. It's a very pleasant scent and everyone seem to like it, so if people can smell you they will compliment you on it. On clothes it becomes really faint after 6h",04/05/20 01:23,Khoi Hoang Le

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"What a thoroughly FRUSTRATING fragrance!!! Gucci Pour Homme is my absolute favorite men's cologne on the market today--because of its ""perfectly modernized"" 70s/80s scent! (It is heaven when I get the chance to spray it on at Macy's cologne counter). But I refuse to buy it because of its poor performance and value.....It's effectively a ""very light"" skin-scent, after the below average projection of the first hour or two!

What both utterly confounds me and ticks me off about the poor performance is that if you take a look at the note breakdown, this fragrance is primarily made up of otherwise STRONG scents (Tobacco, Cypress, Violet, Patchouli, Leather, Resin)???? So it seems that the only one making out ($$$) on this fragrance is Gucci, because it appears they could easily ""improve"" the performance of this beauty...... if they wanted to :(

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"On first spray its fresh, its actually like the mainstream citrus fragrances in the opening. After some time passes though, it starts to change into a more heavy scent. This heaviness comes from cypress i believe. You can sense it is like a niche smell that strives to be a mainstream cologne. Even though it has tobacco in the notes, don't worry its not overwhelming like tom ford tobacco vanille. The tobacco in this one is perfectly under control. Even though i somehow like the smell, i can't recommend it because of really low silage.
TL;DR: Mainstream Frag with nichy twist, poor silage.",09/17/19 14:53,gonomon
Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"i remember when it first came out in 2008, i discovered this edt maybe one year later with a sample from a friend. at that time the reputation of gucci by gucci p.h. was ""safe, generic, easy"" and the main-eventer was the one by dolce and gabbana, all before the ""decade of decadence"" in the fragrance game started by bleu de chanel and completed by sauvage and its clones.
i think gucci by gucci p.h. in 2019 deserves another reputation. considering the modern offering, this scent smells now more complex, interesting and very masculine. it opens with a fresh cypress and maybe vetiver, then a pleasant tobacco became the leader of the drydown, mixed with other woody notes. it is a very nice fragrance for a dinner in a restaurant with your gf, it is very romantic and smooth. i like the manly character inside this juice, nothing like the freshy-teeny-sweety fragrances of today. the performance is the main downside of this scent, the projection and longevity are slightly below average. it is the same category of ch men prive, very valentino or lanvin avant garde(maybe theese have a better performance, not so much..). so i recommend this scent for close enviroments and nightout, but also for work because it is inoffensive. for fall and spring, for 25 and up.
a friend of mine says it is discontinued, i dont know if it is true but is still easy available in stores. i found a tester for a super-cheap price. i have the renamed bottle and personally dont find big differences with the orignal gucci by gucci.
in the overall, this fragrances is not the masterpiece for the ages but is too underrated and deserves more attention. in the current market we need edt like this. un profumo che forse non rivoluziona le vostre vite ma è decisamente piacevole, molto maschile e più complesso rispetto a tanta roba banale in giro attualmente.

Fast forward to today spiting 2019 and I decided to pull ot out from the back of my collection. I was surprised I didn’t use all of this up around the time I got it. This scent is great. To me, it’s a leathery, citrus, tobacco type smell. I haven’t fully checked the pyramid, but I don’t need to, I already know that the leather is dominant in here. It’s not leathery like John Varvatos, but it seems to go about the leather in a different way here. I think what turned me off from this scent when I originally got it was the longevity is horrible. I get that it could be a body chemistry thing, but I’m not buying that. I lent this bottle out to 3 different friends and only one of them got 2 hours out of it, while me and my other friends only got 1 hour.

First Spray impression: Dried Tobacco smell. this accord smells a little synthetic but in a very nice way.

3 to 5 minutes after application the tobbaco start to settle and start to smell sweet and musky without smelling wet. wich I like.

After 1 hour this fragrance starts to fall down on projection and sillage. wich I found a little dissapointed. but the longevity is very good. you will smell it on you as skin scent.

I used to own so many Gucci’s fragrances simply because they were unusual, big and so well made.
Nowadays Gucci produces flat and just ordinary scents with no charisma.
This one is no exception. It actually makes me sad they have discontinued the unique products and replaced them with such rubbish.
Not worth the money asked for it.
Buy some 007 aftershave and you’ll get at least the value for money.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"I own the gucci by gucci pour homme in the edt travel spray version. The fragrance is pleasant, intense, strong and masculine. The tobacco is felt with arrogance but only for a few tens of minutes. Afterwards the cypress and violet take over. Here the cards on the table change because, in my opinion, the latter removes from the fragrance the sense of initial virility. With leather and amber we try to recover the great masculinity lost in the central phase but the scent is repeatedly knocked down by a presentful jasmine. Finally, then, that note of bergamot could save it.
It remains a great gucci but not among the best.

Il packaging è lo stesso... la bottiglia scura identica alla foto qui pubblicata ... in pratica cambia solo il nome... La piramide olfattiva è uguale per entrambi. Se la memoria e il naso non mi ingannano credo di notare una differenza fra le due versioni ( avevo testato il Gucci by Gucci che mi ricordo più buono di quello che ho ricevuto ). Deduco sia stato riformulato anche nel nome ma non ho trovato nessuna conferma.
Rimane una fragranza molto buona ma sono un poco deluso sulla durata e sulla scia. Sulla mia pelle non superano le 3 o 4 ore. Inoltre il tabacco che dovrebbe essere la base è appena percettibile e solo per poco tempo. Rimane un buon profumo per via del cipresso che a me piace tantissimo.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"What a wonderfully gentle tobacco scent! The tobacco note is instantly recognizable from the first spray, but instead of an old-school tobacco note, this one is distinctively modern. The cypress and violet notes add a beautiful green overtone, both sharp and mellow at the same time - it is difficult to describe - but there is great depth and sophistication in how they interplay without dominating each other. The result is an oakmoss-y depth that avoids being barbershop-ish.

I don't get a powdery note, nor do I detect the jasmine. The sharpness of the perfume seems to come from the bergamot, which opens up and becomes distinct after a few minutes, yet it doesn't overtake the complex nuance of tobacco and green notes.

It is a beautiful perfume that isn't for everyone. It is distinctively masculine. The way that the tobacco note makes it seem dark while being clean can't be emphasized enough. I can see this perfume as a good introduction to tobacco-dominated perfumes for those who are just starting out.

I have sprayed 1 to 5 sprays and gone to work several times. I don't want to be that guy that overdoes it. I am not sure you can overspray this cologne because its sillage is so poor. I absolutely love the scent. I am not sure how it smells to others and I have not received any compliments with this one.

This would be a scent I never want to be without but it is a cologne for me. I would love to try an edp or intense version.

UPDATE: I LOVE this cologne and I discovered that it lasts all day as a close up scent if I spray it a few times on my clothes.",06/09/18 19:02,lynwood234
Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Initial impression - kind of peppery, small, non-offensive, but sharp fragrance. One hour later - I experienced a beautiful intoxicating vapourous classy smelling citrus and lavender perfume coming off my arm which was in the hot sun while sitting outside at the cafe - beautiful. I also had some Mont Blanc Legend tester on my foream, so that was working in tandem I think.
Purchased!

UPDATE: Very nice fragrance, but basically only slightly better than a skin scent in terms of strength and sillage. I would much prefer and recommend Aramis Tuscany - so much better in this regard, it’s a proper fragrance when compared with this.",05/25/18 02:48,Fendy1

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"I really like the smell of this, very cool, very classy.

Unfortunately the performance is absolutely abysmal on my skin, there isn't much projection to begin with (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it becomes a skin scent in 1-1,5 hours, and it's totally gone in 2-2,5.
I haven't experienced longevity this bad outside of 007 ocean royale, and at this price, that is simply not good enough.

Now, this might just be a case of my skin chemistry not jivin' with this juice at all, and as I said, it smells fantastic, so I'm not going to say 'don't try it' - but I am definitely saying 'don't blind buy it'.",05/07/18 08:17,De Oratore

This is my leather armchair smoking a sweet pipe tobacco scent. Great cooler weather office or casual fragrance. It lasts through a whole work day on me. It gives me a small inoffensive scent bubble.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci (by Gucci) is a charming masculine aromatic. The opening contains a charming burst of vivid aromatics so arousing, it just leaves you breath-taken! Deep, passionate, and romantic. It's that kind of fire that makes you want to buy it as soon as you smell it.

The most prominent aromatic notes (violet and sweet tobacco) project with a bright and bold vivacity. Ambrosial probably would be the best way to explain the aroma. It's something like a cocktail of the most sensual dark-fruit pulp, accented with a hazy masculine grain provided by the subtle presence of pepper.

The fragrance is so well-blended, and projects with the full sense of hard work and detail so legendarily accustom to the art of luxury craftsmanship. The scent doesn't come off cheap in any way; or just thrown together; nor does it possess any type of quality to it that might make a man feel ashamed wearing it.

Gucci (by Gucci) is a fragrance that's very well-suited for a man to wear with dignity. Everything seems to come natural while wearing it: The sense of great style, the comfort of its arousing charm, and the feel of genuine luxury provided by the quality of the blend.

Ranks of nobility legendarily wore custom fragrances as the distinguishing attribute of their character, and Gucci (by Gucci) definitely projects as one of those kinds of scents, making it an instant favorite among men with a taste for the divine.",02/10/18 19:14,ReapThaWhirlwind

this juice is not for boys, it is for men! men who overrun testosterone. confident and macho is what this juice speaks.

i have a little story with this juice. i entered a night club wearing this with a group of friends and sported an acquaintance at the bar. the greeting turned rather wild and she did confess that it was the cologne which i was wearing which did the magic ;). she did mention that if she will ever smell this cologne again she would instantly recognize it.

fast forward few months and another group of friends came to pick me and she was with them. as i entered the car, wearing this very cologne, i see her in the car and the look she gave me was like.. i know you are wearing the same cologne!!

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Very very weird stuff… After the reviews and the scent pyarmid, I excepted a totally different smell. I would like to get a manly, classic winter time tobacco/cypress scent.. Actually I got it, but very weird. The opening is a pure citrus/bergamot mix without any violet or cypress, and after the first sniff I thoght this will be a summer fragrance. Few minutes later the bergamot fades away, and I smell a very light/airy tobacco/cypress combination with a special herbal/camphor vibe. I don’t know why, but it smells like a sports cream or a rheumatic cream…Interesting…Later joins some patchouli, amber and resins, but this camphoric vibe lasts very very long. Anyway, this is a clean, safe, masculine fagrance, but do not blind buy. The sillage and the longevity terrible, as most of the Gucci, so this is the reason why I dislike…

- spring/autumn/witnter, but maybe could work in summertime. Very versatile stuff.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"I love the crisp clean woody smell of the cypress with hints of leather and tobacco. It's a very elegant smell that would be good for cooler weather. This scent lasts a good 5 hours on my skin and is very pleasant. My wife even likes it... and she hates most colognes.

I also use Versace Oud during the cooler months. Gucci by Gucci will be a nice lighter addition to the Fall and Winter months. I found a bottle at Nordstrom Rack for $44. I had to get it. I watched a lot of reviews of fall and winter colognes on Youtube and Gucci by Gucci was usually one of the top 3. I would have to concur with those reviews.

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"Quality: 4.5 out of 5 – It’s a beautiful, high quality scent. For me, it borders on a masterpiece. I LOVE it. The magic happens after it’s been on me for 3 hours.

Originality: 4 out of 5 – It’s very original yet triggers a scent memory in me of Jimmy Choo Man. I have both, yet prefer this.

Projection (Sillage): 3 out of 5 – moderate; Only people in your near vicinity can smell your scent, unless you’ve just sprayed it.

Longevity: 3 out of 5 – moderate; 5~6 hours

Versatility: 4 out of 5 – This scent is very versatile; it works well for day/night, autumn/winter, office-based work/formal occasions and for men over 25.

Value: 4 out of 5 – currently £49 for 90ml. It’s about the going rate for a fragrance of this quality. I love it enough to pay this but if it’s on sale, great!

Compliment Frequency: 2 out of 5 – Nobody moves away but I don’t get compliments on it either. To put some perspective on this, I’m wearing it now and haven’t had a single compliment on it over the whole day. A guy walks into my room wearing Creed Aventus and 2 people complimented his within 2 minutes! Yes, it’s a hugely different fragrance but what the hell?! :)

Packaging (Bottling): 4 out of 5 – Much thought seems to have gone into the packaging; it’s attractive and highly functional.

Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 – Great – This fragrance does just about everything you could ever want from a fragrance of its type (meaning it’s good enough for a lack of projection, longevity and compliment frequency to ignore). There aren’t any significant problems with the fragrance, I love it but not everyone’s nose/skin is the same so you may not be left in complete awe. Not ground-breaking but has the potential to become a classic and should be considered a staple for collectors.

Recommendation: Not everyone loves everyone’s taste so try before you buy but otherwise to me, it’s so good it’s worth blind buying!",10/12/17 04:45,Escenta

I used to just spray this on just before leaving the house in a t shirt and jeans not thinking about how I wanted to smell. I always thought That it smelled good and would do for the moment. Upon closer sniff, this fragrance has a bit of depth to it. The opening of this scent is almost minty, the cypress and violet really play nicely off of each other and the citrus is present, but restrained. The mid notes of tobacco and jasmine come through with subtlety, giving some warmth and sweetness after the minty opening. It's at the mid notes that you get a craving for more of what this scent has to bring, but it is also at this point that the scent just seems to restrain itself. We get a nice resinous, leathery finish framed by a bit of patchouli. Is it a bad scent? Not at all. Is it innovative? No. Will it go well with a field jacket, a clean tee, jeans, and some Stan Smiths on a date night? Yes!",03/01/17 14:03,fromthebayandaroundtheway

Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme Gucci,"This has been my signature scent since it was first gifted to me in 2010. I still own a bottle from that period, which has always been stored in a humid environment with daily temperature fluctuations (my bathroom). To this day, there is no detectable change in the scent or its performance (the latter being meh to start with). It is unquestionably a sturdy fragrance.

The scent can be described in one word - suave. Wear this with a tux or dinner suit and you'll be shifting your 007 swag mode into overdrive. Seductive 'femmes fatales' will try to kill you, guaranteed. It's an all-season, semi-formal/formal, evening-only fragrance best suited for when you're playing baccarat at the big boys table.

Gucci smells really masculine and you get tobacco, patchouli, cypress and bergamot with some other notes mixed in. It's a manly scent, and signature worthy.

The downside is performance. I get about 2-3 hours with weak projection. It's a shame because this one smells awesome. With better performance, it would be a super star.

You will get some compliments with this one shortly after applying. But it fades so fast that nobody will be able to smell it after a while. But it does smell great and it is suitable for any time of year and nearly every occasion.

But on me, this is predominantly a tobacco/violet/amber fragrance and that's what makes it so wearable for either gender.

In terms of availabel High Street fare, this IS different. My first spritz on a test strip in Boots this morning and I was like 'urgh, this is some dank musty rubbish - what is this smell?!'. Tobacco. Lovely moist, smokey tobacco seeping through the cypress and bergamot. Sure, berganot is found in most frags. However, the tobacco note sets this aside the deluge of citrus / fresh spicy scents out there at the moment (Sept 2015). I can smell the amber and patchouli on dry-down, and it adds depth, which combines to make a great masculine accord. The downside is the longevity, which has been noted by numerous folk before me - its not great. The answer? Top it up with a discrete travel dispenser! This is far from generic. Its a good, solid, interesting day / night, all ocassion scent.

Very smooth tobacco with a nice sweet (but not the repulsive synthetic Chanel-like sweetness) leathery vibe to it, this is very easy to overdo (spray VERY gently!). Extremely strong projection, lasts very long and stays on clothes. I bought this a few years back, so I have no idea whether it's been reformulated as some folks say.
Conclusion: A frag with a lot of character that you should try in the winter, at night. Definitely not a summer scent and I don't imagine using this for the office.",09/23/15 08:31,vihri

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Category: Soft spicy, pink floral, powdery

Notes: Sprays on a vibrant citrus and gently leathery osmanthus, soon joined by peony, an almost liquoricey pink pepper and a smooth, ever so slightly powdery sandalwood. With time the rose and rosy nuances of the pink pepper become more apparent. The overall scent impression is a soft, slightly spicy and rosy, pink floral.

Vibe: Red licorice. Velvet. Cabriolet. Rose flavored marshmallows. Leather couch. Plaid pencil skirt and blazer. Black rimmed glasses. Massage therapy. Morning green tea. Laptop. Inner city parking. Portfolio. Saleswoman. Friday.

Sillage: 6.5/10. Pretty impressive sillage for an EdT I must admit. Doesn't project a ton, but I wouldn't classify it as intimate either. It does lose strength with time and within a few hours it is however pretty much a skin scent.

Longevity: 4/10. Longevity is less impressive, lasted me about 3-4 hours before it was so soft it was barely detectable.

Wear: Day or evening, personally I'm leaning evening. I think this is a little too heavy for summer wear so I'd say probably best suited as a spring or fall perfume. A traditionally feminine scent most suited for age ranges 30-55. Office wear approved as it is very toned down and inoffensive.

Overall rating: 6/10. So completely not my kind of frag, but I can't deny it is a very pleasant wear. I'd say this is the smoother, softer sister of Burberry’s The Beat - they share the same sort of powdery, soft and yet mature scent profile. Where The Beat is a bit overwhelming and problematic for people prone to get scent induced headaches, nausea or asthma, Flora by Gucci EdT is a lot more well-blended, subdued with a quiet poise. I think for those expecting a traditional peony fragrance, there's a risk of disappointment as I don't find this to represent what I know the fragrance note to be. What it does however carry with it from the peony is the maturity, making it feel a lot more adult and refined. To me the citrus, pink pepper and rose are what carry this scent, although I wouldn’t call it a rose scent either. Probably best described as a mildly powdery, soft and spicy pink floral.

There’s something so beautiful about it, like a gentle breeze carrying the scent of blooming petals.

It’s a really nice fruity floral, defiantly smell the orange in this I can’t smell rose in particular , maybe more peony florals but it’s just so lovely. I would get this for a teen, but as an adult I would still wear this aswell if I want something that people are going to smell. 100% a compliment getter too.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"A scent that falls into the category of “generic perfumey” but in a likeable way, similar in feel to Burberry’s Weekend. Peony/rose and patchouli would belie any attempt to pass this off as one’s natural aroma, but the osmanthus and sandalwood soften and blur the edges so it’s hard to say exactly where skin stops and this begins.

The parfum had a nice soft spicy scent as well, the pink pepper wasnt' overdone. I got zero peony w/ this yesterday, which is fine w/ me since I'm not a huge peony fan.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,What is happening with quality?,03/02/22 10:23,elisa.fuentes.1
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I first purchased the EDT about two months ago and thought the EDP was worth purchasing too. While very similar in composition their performances are surprisingly different.. Gucci Flora EDP is a deeper, richer concentration but it is more intimate. The EDT on the other hand is a tamer concentration but it amps the volume in sillage and projection. The opening is an explosion of garden flowers and osmanthus notes. It is almost like spraying your own garden bubble out of a bottle!
It will be fun to test these in the upcoming warm months!
My opinion, the edt is the better purchase. The edp's competing edge is slightly better longevity.
Another moment of honesty, I found the scent off putting in colder weather so wait until warmer months for its beauty.
Still keeping both. I will be layering edp under edt!",01/24/22 22:45,ScentBliss555
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I was expecting this to be really boring, which it is, but it is also far lovelier than I assumed it would be. It makes itself a little more interesting with the ""osmanthus"" note which is not really osmanthus but is that nice apricot-y fruity-floral that I tend to gravitate towards. It's light, simple, non-offensive.",01/06/22 12:40,tippytee
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is one of my favorite perfumes.
It's definitely unique in my opinion and I have yet to smell something similar to it.
The top notes I smell is peony and citrus. Very fresh, girly and clean.
However, once it starts to dry down its creamy, a little powdery and definitely a lot of osmanthus.
I personally don't get any of the bottom notes, however it does last long on the skin and it probably has a lot to do with the pink pepper.
I would recommend this fragrance because it's definitely hard to dislike, therefore I think its a safe blind buy if you like soapy yet sweet, clean scents.",11/30/21 20:26,xxjennieee
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"If you want fresh cut florals this is not it. It smells like the dumpster behind a florist shop, wilted flowers fermenting under the humid sun. Accented by some musty musky smell",11/20/21 18:43,lordbig
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"How does this smell like fresh floral, creamy, slight spicy rain? It does and I love it. Especially for rainy, cold days it fits the aroma so well while having a sophisticated feel to it.

The opening is a bit sharp, I was afraid I wouldn't love it, but after an hour or two it's a creamy fresh floral I adore. This with the osmanthus that give it a citrusy peach vibe that's fizzy, uplifting and highly youthful.

The sillage/scent trail is gorgeous and lasts about 4-5 hours on my skin while being a skin scent for 7.

Usually I have a dislike for patchouli but I really like it in this as it is complemented by the pink pepper and sandalwood that makes it everso earthy, creamy with the slightest fresh pink pepper spice. Smells natural but not dirty.

Might become my signature",08/09/21 10:44,norhal96

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"When my perfume collection was <10 bottles, this was the most grown-up perfume I had. It was the first foray into florals stronger than just backing up a fruity composition, and was intoxicating to my boyfriend at the time. I think his appreciation for it deepened my liking for it. Revisiting it years later, it is pleasant, it is unique, but I don't think I like it as much as I did back then. (And neither does he - he doesn't recognize it!) The bottle is hefty and super pretty on top of a vanity, though.

The scent pyramid is pretty accurate. Smelled from the cap, it's a very blended mishmash of peony, citrus fruits (but not in a really fresh/uplifting way, just in a non-jammy way), and osmanthus. Once sprayed, the drydown has a muskier and sweet osmanthus shining through, with the citrus long gone. It lasts about 6 hours on skin, and at least the day on clothes.",11/29/20 20:06,fyetan

You're inside with the windows cracked open to let in the fresh air, the smell of a calm, peaceful, yet slightly humid scene. This is truly comforting.

It is very floral on the skin, but I like that little touch of musk (that’s what I tend to smell anyway, anyone agree?) that links with the floral notes, making it even nicer in my opinion, more natural and airy. More a day scent than a night scent for me. I’d love to wear this while having a stroll in the park, maybe having a coffee with a friend outside in the park or the beach...

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Flora EDT is a citrusy floral fragrance with some spice and woodsy notes in the base. The osmanthus is actually very beautiful in this composition. It’s a fruity-floral note in its own right, so it interplays well with the mandarin and other citruses. The rose helps to balance it by deepening the floral profile. This is a bright, Spring-ish fragrance that reminds me of a morning stroll on a warm day. It’s very traditional, but still well done. I could easily wear this to work or out for errands.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Someone gave me a sample of Flora EDT with a swap, otherwise I wouldn't have tried it because it sounds a little boring to me. Well, what can I say, it's sure not the most original scent on earth but I actually enjoy it.
Osmanthus is clearly the most important note here with it's apricot-like floral scent. I also smell the light and airy peony and something creamy and musky. There is no musk listed, so maybe this supposed to be the sandalwood, even though it doesn't smell like sandalwood to me. What I like about Flora EDT is that it's rather warm for such a light, clean scent. The citrus notes don't overpower everything else. This smells a little synthetic and like it could be some everyday body care product, but think of a nice hair mask rather than a shampoo. Nothing I would buy for myself, but not bad.
I have never tried the EDP so I can't compare.",05/14/20 10:45,SailorV
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Flora, a bottled bouquet of Asian osmanthus flowers. I have smelled actual osmanthus which is so prominent in Good Girl Gone Bad By Kilian. It smells like a flat with all its windows closed, on a hot summer day, a flat filled with flowers and nothing else. With peonies and osmanthus. It is very very dense smell, floral and somewhat pollen like. In Gucci Flora, osmanthus is comined with citruses to provide it that open window freshness, to speak in a metaphor. As it dries down, Flora becomes clearly more and more floral. The base of patchouli doesn't really come through a lot but the pink pepper in the base does, yet again providing some freshness. Flora isn't exactly modern, but not vintage either I find it a little undefined.",04/09/20 14:56,bel.gravia
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Out of all the Gucci Floras I've tried so far this is my favorite to date. Opens with a creamy citrus, in particular Mandarin which I love, followed by peony, a light rose, and a fruity osmanthus. I love the apricot vanilla scent of Osmanthus. It is such a mellow floral that is so pretty giving this scent a luscious sweetness. There is a softness to this scent that is really nice despite the pink pepper which is barely detectable. Very smooth and gentle, nothing overwhelming or sharp. Longevity is a little disappointing lasting only a few hours but silage is nice, if a little on the soft side. This will be a nice go-to during the warmer days of the spring and summer. I'm curious to try the eau de parfum of this scent and wonder how much of a difference there is in scent, silage, and longevity. I'm willing to bet it is just as pretty as this is.",02/26/20 15:20,Anamandy

On skin it is absolutely gorgeous, citrusy but not sharp, floral but not overly, with some muskiness underneath. I cannot detect much patchouli or pepper. It is peonies, citrus notes, a huge huge dose of osmanthus, very very pretty osmanthus and some light muskiness.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is a lovely fresh floral. I find it quite sweet and pretty linear on the whole, at drydown it’s just a softer version of the first spray.

It’s pretty inoffensive, office safe and mostly suited to spring or summer. There’s so many now I only feel able to wear in winter so this definitely wouldn’t make the mark in colder weather for me. The sillage is average, longevity could be better I think, about 4-5 hours on me.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"While far from ""a sensual, young girl"", I happen to enjoy this EDT quite a bit! I am a fan of osmanthus in perfumes. I like the floral, fruity sweetness it brings to most compositions and it really holds this fragrance together so that it reads a bit more fruity floral than strictly floral. Fruity florals do tend to be marketed more to the youthful audience, and as a grown woman, I'm not particularly interested in smelling like a strawberry, but I do like a peach/apricot note, which osmanthus imparts. It works well with the peony, creating a light, somewhat sweet fragrance perfect for spring days and after a shower. I also own Generous Violet from the same collection, which I am also fond of, but I enjoy this one a little bit more. Has decent longevity and sillage for an EDT. I will reach for this quite a bit throughout this spring!

EDIT - Just sprayed a bit of this on the back of my hand and still really like it. I read through many of the reviews and I sense a paradox - so many people refer to this as ""generic"", and yet if you read the reviews, both positive and negative, I began to see that what makes this work or not work for people really varies, so maybe this isn't quite the simple little perfume most seem to assume it is. I found it interesting that so many experienced a metallic note. If I smelled that, I would scrub it off immediately, as that quality would send me running for the hills!

Look at the bottle if nothing else, it's so pretty! The notes seemed promising. Rose, osmanthus, sandalwood - I expected so much from it. Rose is my favorite, osmanthus is in my signature, sandalwood keeps intriguing me. The promise was there - Flora could have been stunning.

Didn't happen though.

It smells like... for the lack of a better comparison... dusty water. Edp, edt... doesn't matter. It's boring. A pretty shell with the most unmemorable scent stored in it. It's as disappointing as a broken promise.",10/08/17 06:57,CoffeeCup

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Gucci flora seems to have safe notes for me so I didn't expect to dislike it
I received a free decant sample of it with my other purchases and I don't know whether it's edt or edp.I just know that I dislike it with all my heart just because there's something in it that ruins it for me.I can detect peony and mandarin orange as dominant notes,it could be a pleasant floral-citrus combo if there was not this wierd note in it.there's something that smells like oxidated metal.like a piece of old metal that is wet and oxidation process has ruined most parts of it.as time passes this metal thing becomes even more prominant.horrible smell of metal can easily shadow flower and citrus as it does in this perfume.it must be something about my body chemistry because I'm sure a perfume can't be made to smell like this.almost always I try to give time to perfumes so I usually don't wash after applying perfumes even if I don't like them.but I couldn't Tolerate this metal smell so I had to scrub it.it even gave me a toothache,like biting a piece of metal
I guess it must be something about pink pepper.I disliked it so much that I feel I can't try any new perfume at least for a week

باتوجه به اینکه گوچی فلورا عطر معروف و محبوبی هست یا با شیمی بدن من سازگار نیست و یا سمپل که ازش تست کردم خراب بوده..رایحه غالب این عطر به مشامم ترکیبی از گل صدتومانی، پرتقال شیرین و یه نت وحشتناک مثل آهن زنگ زده هست که هرچی بیشتر زمان میگذره شدیدتر میشه..اگه این بوی آهن زنگ زده نبود می تونست یه عطر معتدل و گلی،مرکباتیه سیف باشه اما متاسفانه هست و باعث شد حتی من که اصلاً عادت ندارم به پاک کردن عطر،مجبور شم اپل با صابون و بعد با پنبه الکلی بیفتم به جون پوستم..حس میکنم این بوی زنگ آهن زیر سر فلفل صورتی هست بهرصورت تجربه خیلی بدی بود.این بو حتی باعث میشه دندونم تیر بکشه دقیقاً مثل اینکه یه تیکه آهن گاز زده باشم
درباره موندگاری و پخش نمیتونم چیزی بگم چون بعد یه ساعت نتونستم طاقت بیارم و پاکش کردم

It's a simple fragrance and smells the same from start to finish. It's a combination light citrus, osmanthus, and patchouli. It's a lovely little garden smell.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"My all time favourite (well, top 5 actually). Simple, innocent & very pretty scent. I never get bored or tired to smell Flora. It's a must have in my collection if my bottle was about half way to go. I really love the adds & the commercial. Very captured the feeling of the scent itself. It's floral but been blended tons of citrus fruits. Unfortunately i didn't get too much roses in Flora because i really love rose. It's my favourite flower. I do get the smell of sharp peony & leathery osmanthus to it, along with fresh citrus creamy mandarin, until Flora fades away on me. But in the dried down Flora smells a bit musky (patchouli pink pepper combo) but still buttery creamy floral fruity feel to it. I still remember a year after it released, my best friend bought a gift set and she showed me that and i'm like ""OMG are you serious???"" And we opened up, tried the whole things in the set..... Oohhhhh my Gucci..... Very pretty Flora.... It's lasts 8 to 10 hours on me with a moderate sillage. Not overpowering. Easy to wear, casual. Quite versatile imo. The bottle are nice too but quite frustrated to get out the pretty juice inside when it's about to finish hahahaaa....",03/29/16 05:38,GGLiCious

Green Floral Gucci

This has got to be the most subdued, delicious patchouli in perfume I have ever had the pleasure of smelling. When I smell a perfume on myself or others, or on blotters, my nose immediately picks up on the foundatin of base notes. The notes listed here as base notes include patchouli and sandalwood. I did not pick up on either. Faint patchouli, like it was in the distant background. I got green notes but it could be the green leaves of patchouli combined with the green leaves of the osmanthus which is found in the heart/middle notes. I didn't get any rose or citrus orange notes. I was able to smell the peony. To me this is a green patchouli-osmanthus with a fragrant peony. It can initially disappoint you as it does sort of smell like a generic you've smelt it before at Macy's or Nordstrom's fragrance. But it's really subtle and complex, despite the simple linear arrangement of notes. It's very mysterious and dark, but still very sweet, like a pretty young girl hiding behind flowers bushes. But she is not innocent nor a child. She is a young lady beckoning a man to join her behind the bushes, for you know what. This is really nice! Bravo Gucci. I would not mind buying another bottle.",10/21/15 14:01,Gigi The Fashionista

I eventually found a bottle at Nordstrom rack on sale ! I have since used the entire bottle and plan on purchasing more.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Pleasing is how I would describe this. Mildly fruity, with lactonic peach notes, mildly floral (faint jasmine is there), lightly sweet, with a warm bade including vanilla. The middle smells like warm apricot jam scented with vanilla, and is somewhar soapy at times. A your-skin-but-better kind of scent. The drydown is musky and milky, and a hazy fruity - floral aspect is still there.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I like this one. Don't love it, but like it. To me this smells really generic. I feel like I keep seeing frags that are recent releases that smell generic. I don't know if I would spend my money on it, but I wouldn't turn it down as a gift, either :-)

This one is pretty linear on me. It smells the same when I first spray it vs many hours later albeit the flowers aren't there so strongly anymore. The citrus and flowers mesh nicely to create a fresh, uplifting feel. There is no sweetness to my nose. The patchouli is what makes me like this a lot. I love patchouli and something about my chemistry really plays it up. The patch here is nice, toned down and gives a woody feel to the florals. Flora reminds me of a bright, sunny early spring day with a nip in the air.

This is an all around nice, very inoffensive fragrence. Good for daytime and would be perfect for the office.",05/19/15 16:07,laura21774

This smells like too tart and too sweet lemon lime soda pop.

Something about it smells masculine on me. And I have no clue what that is. I do enjoy peony so that a saving grace for me but other than that, I can't tolerate it. I get no pepper or anything remotely spicy.

I think the non descript citrus notes annoy me. There needs to be some balance. Too much!

The floral notes lure me in and I have hope and then I spritz it and remember why I don't wear it.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I'm of two minds about this perfume, but neither of them is love. More like like/hate.
Sometimes when I sniff the bottle I get warm/powdery/rich smells, kind of like Tresor. But I can't wear Tresor either, lol.
Sometimes I smell it and it's just heavy syrupy stale-air-in-boudoir and kind of nauseating.
I've tried it on my skin twice, and it was intriguing, but I wanted a break from it.
This is sad, because it's such a beautiful bottle. (I only have an almost-empty bottle, and it didn't have a bow so I put one of my own on it. It looks so pretty... reminds me of the song ""Lemon Tree"" LOL)

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"AHHHHH I'm so sad about this perfume. T_T

I absolutely love the osmanthus flower, their scent is sweet and up lifting, very bright and a little fruity. Real osmanthus is such a joy to smell and during their blooming season you can smell a tree full of osmanthus flowers from miles away!

HOWEVER, the osmanthus in the Gucci Flora is NOTHING like the real flower. I can tell that the main note is suppose to be the osmanthus but it's just a mucky, dirty, and soapy osmanthus. The dry down is a powdery, sweet, but again, murky osmanthus. I thought of the color GREY when I smelled this on my wrist. I was so so sad.

The citrus and other florals are pretty much non-existent on my skin. I don't think there should have had any spice notes in this perfume, it kind of ruin the osmanthus. Or maybe they just didn't get the osmanthus extract right.

It's so hard to find perfumes with osmanthus notes, and I had high hope for this one, being from Gucci, but I was so disappointed.",01/17/15 14:46,mylilacs
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This looked, sounded and smelled beautiful (in the bottle). I sprayed it on my arm and it was lovely for a couple of minutes, then started to get all heavy/musky (the patchouli?) and continued to sit there being heavy/musky like my grandmother's mahogany coffee table (with the sweets on it) for a long time.
I washed it off, and then, strangely, it started to smell pretty. If there is a rollerball version of this, I would be very interested to try it!

P.S. I think it may have been the osmanthus. I just read a little more about that flower. (?) Edit: The info about the flower included that it can smell leathery... so I thought maybe the heavy/musky vibe came from that?",01/10/15 16:54,Deirdre1969
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I'm getting annoyed with this flower scent. It stays linear on the skin from the beginning of the application till the end.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"After a while not wearing this (since february - summer in Argentina) I picked it up after I saw the silver bands of the box shimmering in my wardrobe, I remember that I wasn't very fond of it because while it was nice it was not love. Today I had this ephiphany, if this was more chemically sweet and fake this would smell like Armani Si. Why do I like this more? I like florals that are florals, and after all this is a floral, a particular one. Starting off by the blast of Pink pepper and citrus, peony and osmanthus it seems gaggy and awful. Then the osmanthus shines revealing a leathery quality, not the kind of cologne-bitter-leather you find everywhere. You can tell it's a flower that smells like the faintest of leathers. Patchouli rarely comes across, gives this fragrance a base, slightly woody and herbal. I already reviewed this, hated it and then liked it again. Flora you never cease to reveal new faces. It May seem bland and generic, but When you find the right amount to use, the right temperature and the right mood, this is joyous.
Amazing longevity, with close sillage, a breath of fresh air among Girls wearing LVEB in 32°c.

I will go one beyond that - this smells exactly like a perfume that might be included in a ""big girl's makeup box"", maybe something Mattel made in the 80's for little girls who loved playing with Barbie. This smells like a 6 year old's idea of what grown up ladies might smell like when they go on dates or shopping or whatever imaginative fancy 6 year olds come up with.
I cannot even really pick out specific notes - just a cloying, strangely apricot-ish scent with something fresh/vaguely ozonic floating underneath. I don't necessarily like to write reviews about scents that I do not like, and so I won't say I hate this.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,This perfume is really gorgeous. I bought it recently and I literally own over 70 bottles of perfume but this is quickly climbing to the top of my list. The problem with most rose fragrances is they end up smelling very old lady-ish when I wear them but that's not the case with this perfume. It is just the right amount of floral and sweet so that it doesn't become to sweet or to mature it's the perfect balance. They say that this is aimed at the younger market but I think anyone in there 20s or older can wear this perfume and it's so lovely that I think it could be worn as a day or evening scent.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I finally found a floral based Gucci fragrance that I like. I'm sorry, but the Garden Collection was horrible...especially the Magnolia and Tuberose ones which were very chemical-like and smelled nothing like the flowers they claimed to emulate (I would know, I grew up with said flowers in my garden). Well, now that I've lost any potential for gaining upvote balloons....on with the Flora review.
I should've purchased this one first. Flora is a beauty. It's a soft, sweet citrus floral. It's beautiful in all its simplistic, innocent beauty. I picture myself walking in a Victorian or Chinese garden while wearing a long, flowy dress when I wear Flora. I was also pleasantly surprised to see osmanthus make an appearance. It's a lovely, unique exotic flower that I haven't smelled in many perfumes. I also find Flora to be very sweet, which I personally like. It smells like sugared exotic flowers and mandarin.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Flora, to my nose, is almost an osmanthus soliflore. Save a bit of peony and pink pepper.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I had preconceived ideas of Flora being an over the top sickening floral scent. However, when I was given a bottle as a gift I was quite pleasently suprized, I get more of a citrus-floral vibe from this. Initally, I get a burst of mandarin orange with the peony, with a small amount of the citrus aswell. The other floral notes in this perfume do not come into play until at least 30 minutes on the skin. Then, after that, I can smell rose and a slight hint of patchouli. The mandarin orange does a good job at balancing the floral notes, and stopping Flora from becoming an over the top floral scent. I applied this about 9 hours ago and can still smell it on my wrist, so no problems with the longevity.

Overall, I like it. Will I re-purchase? Probably not, but I'll enjoy using this bottle up nevertheless. A worthy buy if you're looking for a well balanced floral scent with good longevity.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Flora is one of those EDT that didn't agree with me. It smells very strong on my skin with huge and suffocating hit of sweet florals. It actually made me move away from rloral scents all together for a while. I am slowly re-introducing myself to florals, wearing predominantly white and mild rose.",10/31/13 23:30,katushka37
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Flora is about the ONLY strong floral that I can enjoy. It's just sweet enough to tone down the often-harsh white florals whilst drying down to a creamy sandalwood base. It's fresh and beautiful and sophisticated while still being youthful. A much better scent than any recent Gucci creation, in my opinion.

It is one of the few perfumes (Angel, Black Orchid, Le Male) that lasts all day on my dry skin. Sillage is amazing so it can be quite strong for those around you. When wearing Flora during the day I like to walk through the spritz or spray it on my skin before dressing. I have made myself sneeze with a couple of early liberal applications!

I have yet to smell Flora on anyone but myself so it could be a unique signature for a lucky woman. And the glass bottle is not bad to look at on your vanity either.",10/25/13 04:35,Mercedesxoxo

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is light and pleasant and good for work. I like the streak of rose that emerges. And the faint (ever so faint) fruit keeps it bright and energetic. It does have what I call a ""thin veil"" aura about it, the same one that appears in Bvulgari, D&G, and Guerlain florals. It's not quite the same smothering a veil as in some of those lines, which is why I can wear this. I think No. 5 Premiere is more classy, and if I had to choose, would go with Premiere. But this is certainly a winner and manages to be both modern and old fashioned at the same time. I will like to find this lingering on my blouses.",10/16/13 06:31,Scout

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is litteraly pure osmanthus juice (at least on my skin). When I was young, my parents sent my brother and I to a club for a month or so in summer (we live in argentina). It was kind of like a summer camp, except we went there every year (you were admitted until.you turned 14) and we got there at 9 am and left forlunch I guess. In the club there was a huge shrub that was always surrounded by bees so we weren't allowed to go near it, it was really close to the pool area so the 'counselors/teachers' were careful with the bees. One day I took a bunch of those sticky white flowers and found out that if you took the bottom of it, pulled and removed the bulb and sucked on the 'straw' (how we used to call it) you would taste a honey-like sweet substance. The smell of the shrub itself was sweet, this translated wonderfully in Flora, it's not sweet in an overtly chemical way, it's more like herbal/natural sweetness. It's not bad if you like to smell like osmanthus, but it's aswell quiye strong and my.colleagues find it quite nauseating, it lasts forever, and if overapplied can give you the barfs/headaches. If you've bought it and feel like there's something missing (in my case I like it but the osmanthus is just so weird/off putting) I found out you can use the herbal sweetener for perfumes that are extremely dry/sour (chanel 19/ chance eau fraiche/ paco rabanne metal cabotine, etc) to add a little something, this is only my experience since Flora translated into osmanthus and pink pepper, no sandalwood, no rose, nothing",08/25/13 23:29,fiouu

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is so over-powering when first applied. One hot mess until dry-down.

If you survive to dry-down, it develops into a well-executed floral. The mandarin orange seems to go overly sweet on my skin, almost to distraction. The base notes seem to get swallowed up as well.

Smells divine on paper and a work colleague.

Strongly recommend skin test before purchase.",08/15/13 15:35,umtaleb

At first spray, I completely discounted it, but as soon as the base notes came through it was a whole new story. It's fresh and citrusy, slightly woody, and smells like spring. Flora is going straight to my Wanted list.
Now my only concern is that as Gucci is aiming this at a younger audience, and I've just hit 40, am I too old to start wearing this? Gee, I hope not!",06/19/13 20:11,NicoleO

I asked her 2 times that day and complimented on how she smelled over and over again... then I knew I need to own that perfume!!!! I was pretty shocked to know that she's wearing Gucci Flora..because I never thought I was the floral kind of girl... but this is a really lovely sweet floral scent! This is a really beautiful scent. I had the longest debate with myself whether if to get the EDT or EDP because I do want a long lasting one... but then I thought if I enjoyed how my friend smelled like so much and prolly EDP will be different as some people commented that the smell is sharper..then I think I just will not go wrong with the EDT.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,One of my favorite floral scents. I don't get a lot of the citrus scent on my skin at all. It's mostly the peony and osmanthus I pick up on with a little bit of rose. I think the pink pepper and sandlewood in the dry down are really beautiful and set it apart from the standard fruity floral perfumes I'm used to smelling. It's a good balance of unique enough to stand out from the standard fruity florals but common enough (porbably thanks to the patchouli and rose) to not offend too many people when you're out in public.,04/28/13 03:01,Memi_La

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I picked this one out to redeem for the voucher out of a Sephore gift sample pack, and it is a pleasant, ""safe"" scent, though somewhat boring. It will not be my daily go-to scent, as it does have this ""plastic"" predictability along the melon or cucumber lines (but clearly synthetically rendered). Makes me think of Barbie dolls for whatever reason.

it's a quite original and it smells like luxury and freedom. the bottle design is fabulous definitely my Favorite!!

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"The very nice lookalike notes of Gucci Flora may make you think that it is a very well behaved, nice, interesting floral which smells somewhat like J'adore, by Christian Dior. However, do not be fooled; the notes may look very pleasing, but the fragrance itself is what you may sigh at and say ""Oh dear"".

This fragrance smells like a very light, soft floral. It's too soft to notice. I think the killer for this fragrance is the osmanthus. Osmanthus generally smells very nice, and it requires a very nice background of other notes to maintain that sort of a stature. Gucci Flora is completely lacking that va-va-voom temperament.

When you spray this on your skin, it smells very clean. Not sweetishly clean, but just clean. I enjoy catching small whiffs of it on others, but on my skin, it screeches like metal being rubbed on road. A very close friend of mine loves this stuff, and she thinks I'm making a niminy-piminy old fuss over something that smells very unique and complex. I'm sorry but that's the thing to which I heartily disagree.

Well, Flora really didn't do the trick for me. Try it if you may, but be careful; this squeaky clean floral is not as innocent as it seems to be.",12/24/12 05:22,EauSensuelle

it smells like cheaper perfumes from the one dollar shop or imitations made in china..and i am really serious about the after rotten smell ,as soon as you smell it everything is nice fresh and sweet and floral but nothing crisp then immediately you get that rotten note that i cant stand even when it dries down it develops in to two distinct notes a rotten one and a weird rotten floral one ..

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I was shaking my head in disbelief when I got a sample of this and tried it without a hope in the world to like it - I just don't go for pure florals, they don't shine on me , they are too discreet and I usually stand out of the crowd here in Germany (a tatar-mongolian blood is running deep there somewhere), plus my skin practically absorbs most floral perfumes. The sample was eau de toilette, and i sort of gave up on it before even trying. I thought - alright, i'll have my 5-minute fun smelling the wrist and then i'll say good-bye to yet another vanishing-all-to-quickly floral. Well, well.. 4 hours later I am trying to figure out where this amazing smell is coming from, then i brush my nose past my wrist accidentally, and it strikes me: FLORA! First of all, I don't believe that eau de toilette in a sample is the same as eau de toilette in regular sizes. Samples are marketing devices, so i bet my bottom dollar that the strength here is amplified. Ignoring this, I must say: this is one of the most well-blended florientals out there. It reminds me a little of ROSE ABSOLUE by Yves Rocher because it has this creamy leather base that gives the scent depth and staying power. Also, I find it quite amazing, that a scent, targeted at a spring/summer season works so well in winter! - this is so seldom found in fresh florals, if at all actually. The only thing I don't like is the name: flora hardly suggests character or gives your imagination a kick. Currently on a hunt for an eau de perfume, hoping it will also be issued in pure perfume at some point. A keeper.",12/10/12 13:00,Kysyona

If too many girls would use this perfume, sure, it will smell ordinary. Besides, most can afford to buy this perfume making it ordinary.

the first spray of it,i smelled zesty-citrusy like scents..then it quickly turned to be floral..i mean,totally floral scent..i don't know what kind of flower that the perfumer used in this perfume.then as it dries down,it turned to be woody-spicy-gingery-balmy n a little bit oriental like scent.


frankly,gucci flora had made me happy n curious to know everything about it.why did I say so is because I am able to tell how the scents are like from the first spray of it,on my skin.so,i quickly turned on the wifi n search for fragrantica.com.the question that came across in my mind was : what kinda compositions that gucci flora has?


luckily,all my guesses are almost correct..there's citrus fruit in it,rose,osmanthus n peony flower...sandalwood,pink pepper n patchouli..the pink pepper n patchouli reminds me of my favourite perfume n that is chance by chanel.it's really a mature scent for me.


Anyway,gucci flora to me is an aristrocrat-like fragrance.it also pictures a woman with elegance n timeless beauty like the princess of monaco,grace kelly..this perfume also has an expensive-smelling kinda fragrance..initially I thought it only suitable for rich n famous people..but I was wrong..it is humbly made as a universal fragrance..which means anyone can use it regardless of who you really are...gucci flora is also classy n sophisticated fragrance..


I used to dislike this perfume last time because it has strong scents n somewhat unpleasant n made me headache..but it's been a while i didn't wear this perfume...so i finally gave myself a second chance,like what i did to chance by chanel..maybe my olfactory senses has improved...and i'm liking it now...thank God.I prefer to wear this perfume in night time..
For those who like light n airy floral scents,i recommend you guys try this one..if u prefer gucci flora to stay longer on your skin,try the edp version.this edt is a lighter ones n the lasting power isn't as good as the edp.",07/25/12 07:33,nurul.ain
Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I love citrus perfumes and this is definitely not my type of scent. I got it as a gift and used it a couple of times and I must say that it's anything but fresh. It is nauseatingly floral, makes me feel old and it has a kind of a disgusting undertone. When I got it I thougt that it's a neutral scent that would not offend anyone. Having used it for a short while, I hate it. Smelling it makes me sick and I'm glad that nobody I know uses it.",06/30/12 16:19,małgorzata.kurpiewska

Flora by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,This is a very clean and light scent. It smells amazing but it is too weak for my tastes...if this had some more staying power and was a couple of notch's louder I would buy some in a heartbeat. I am actually surprised that this one is so weak being that it is Gucci...they usually have better lasting power with their fragrances.

Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty EDT is a well-known fragrance that leans into a classic aromatic profile. It opens with a fresh citrus note that’s clean and pleasant, followed by lavender and patchouli that give it a slightly old-school vibe.

It’s versatile and easy to wear, especially for casual or office settings. However, for me personally, it didn’t stand out enough to make a lasting impression. It’s safe and inoffensive, but lacks the uniqueness I look for in a signature scent.

Performance is moderate, with decent longevity and soft projection.
Overall, it’s a solid choice for someone new to fragrances or looking for something familiar — but I likely won’t repurchase, as I prefer scents with a bit more character.",08/24/25 07:14,FernandoB

Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme is a citrusy, powdery and aromatic fragrance.

It is a fresher version of the original fragrance, although it retains much of the DNA of the Guilty Pour Homme line. In this fragrance, citrus and musk are accentuated, and orris is added, which gives it a powdery sensation and is a litlle more elegant than EDT.

Guilty Eau Pour Homme is the freshest of the entire line, and a good option to use during spring and summer, mainly in casual situations.

His longevity with me was good, more than 9 hours. and sillage better than others in the Guilty Pour Homme line.

It seems that was discontinued, but if you can find it a good price and you like the Guilty Pour Homme line is a good flanker.",04/21/23 22:39,caifan
Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"I admit I'm old fashioned, I guess. Powdery scents on men make me think of my grandfather, who wore the old style barbershop powdery fougeres, and sweet makes me think of female-marketed perfume, so this one had me very puzzled. It starts nicely fresh with the citrus, but the dry down is full on, whole sugar cotton candy powder. It seems like it can't decide what it wants to be, a fruity powdery sweet female slanted scent or a fresh citrusy men's cooler. It doesnt' even strike me as really unisex, because it's too freshly citrus to be a modern 'feminine' scent and too super sweetly powdery to be male. I of course acknowledge that gender tags on fragrance are limiting, outdated and purely used for marketing, but still, being used to 'masculine' being bold, bracing woody and 'feminine' being candy sweet powdery fruitiness, this one has me puzzled.

There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but it sure doesn't settle much on me. Try before committing to a full bottle, but you wont' be disgusted. You might be confused like me though.",02/02/23 19:24,tessture
Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"Bought this recently and I really like it. Great for everyday wear in the summer or right out of the shower. Brighter than most of the GG line and I really enjoy the citrus. Could be an office scent, but I like it as a casual attire fragrance. Not a trendsetter but definitely likable and a compliment attractor.",08/18/22 16:26,Evan Massey88
Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"Very, very generic and has quite poor performance... the scent is pleasant enough but I only reach for this when I am fresh out of the shower and want to spray something on that won't be around long enough to compete with whatever fragrance I will actually be wearing for the day.",01/14/22 22:52,Josh1994
Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"This fragrance was a pleasant surprise. This one (Guilty Eau) and the Guilty EDP are easily the best of the line IMO. The entire Guilty line, to me, is well done but I certainly understand how the original, and some of its flankers like the Black or Intense, can be labeled as boring or generic. They’re very safe, kind of synthetic, but undeniably pleasant and appealing to the masses.

I was blown away by the EDP version for the risk it took, and it was such a bold and daring direction for the line, and I smell A LOT of the EDP formulation here in Eau. These two seem to be the ones that try to break from the mold and take a few risks, and it pays off in spades.

Eau is very fresh, but it’s not a generic “freshie”… it’s pretty rich and complex honestly, a beautiful mix of citrus/fruity flavors with some musk and spice to really add depth and solidify the fragrance. At first sniff it may seem deceptively light and airy, and it is compared to the others, but it’s still very rich and pretty deep for an EDT/Eau variety. It’s rounded out by this underlying woody/floral/musky warmth which can give it an almost powdery, barbershop-like vibe in certain stages, which I really like. It feels rejuvenating and refreshing, but fairly classy and relaxing at the same time.

Longevity is also surprisingly great on my skin, and I think it’s super easy to go nose blind to. At first I thought it was just okay as far as longevity, but I sprayed myself three times before bed and woke up 6-8 hours later and it still smelled amazing on skin, the drydown stage is really nice and relaxed. I always feel people REALLY exaggerate when it comes to longevity on this site anyway, it’s kind of ridiculous. I could wear this in any season, it’s really versatile, though it seems to do best in average temperature, not overly hot as it is very rich and fairly sweet.

Along with the EDP, hands down the best in the line by a long shot.",07/17/21 10:44,Bfreepro417

this frag is good for climate-controlled environment on which u wont get sweaty then only u will get good longevity with this one... i have tried spraying from 12noon and the base notes lasts on my skin til 1am for my bedtime shower, so i guess this one suits my body chemistry or because m not sweating at all.. so I suspect Gucci made this for men that does not sweat few gallons a day!! HAHA
for me this frag does not smells boring at all since am all about citrusy scents ever and patchouli as base probably gave it that unique character to this frag.
so am keeping this frag as my signature scent forever.",10/07/20 02:41,Rav Pahud
Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme and Guilty Black was what I wore mainly in my last years of college back when I had no interest in collecting fragrances. And to this day, these two fragrances are still some of the best in the designer market. Guilty Eau is much better than the original, as it isnt sweet and heavy. Instead it is airy, silky, and more elegant. There's definitely lavender in this as well, just like the original. In addition to all of this, I can't help but be reminded of Masculin Pluriel here. In a lot of ways these two share a similarity somewhere. I would go as far as to say this is practically MP without the leather and vetiver. Needless to say, Eau Pour Homme brings back great memories to me and it is one I hold dearly and close to the heart.",08/10/20 08:42,alanwake

Once you were my favorite of the Gucci Guilty line, sharp, refined, versatile, long lasting, and perfect for a professional environment.

Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"It really surprises me that no one has mentioned how much this smells like Chanel Homme Sport Eau Extreme. It reminds me almost exactly of it but the Chanel has better longevity about 8 hours on the Chanel, 4-5 on this Gucci. It's quiet, unassuming, a little icy and a lot smooth. It's a nice fragrance. The one thing I notice about this Gucci when compared to the Chanel, is the Gucci has a slight fizz scent in it. I don't want to say root beer but more like a light root beer in vanila ice cream fizz. It's not bad at all but unless you see a huge price difference between it and the Chanel, you'd be better off going with the Chanel. In my area, Gucci still brings a fairly high price at $79 a bottle for this. I can get the same size bottle of the Chanel for roughly the same price.",06/07/18 18:07,ShiveringTimber

Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"Guilty Eau is a fresher version of the original Gucci Guilty. It has an opening like white, iced lemonade—with a clarity and refreshment factor that is simply out-of-this-world. This formula most notably replaces lavender and cedar with snowberry and orris root, which makes the fragrance a lot smoother and sweeter, with a sparkling tinge off the top like pure fallen snow.

It's literally what gives this fragrance its glow and makes it so enjoyable. And the aromatic effect that it adds is so divine. It's almost like walking through some snow-covered woods, and you can literally smell the snowy freshness from off top the bushes, with a crisp, icy tinge of the berries and petitgrain that brings the whole atmosphere full-circle.

The freshness factor alone makes Guilty Eau such a pleasure to wear. The fragrance is light and non-offensive. It does just as well in the winter as it does in the summer in my opinion—and could even be suitable for work given its versatile, and universally appealing qualities.

For all those people that wished for a ""perfected"" version of the original Guilty—Guilty Eau is very likely to be that wish come true.",03/29/18 17:16,ReapThaWhirlwind

It's just hard to get excited by being so fresh and clean, you know what I mean? I enjoyed the musk and patchouli base notes, of course, but then those are reliable for me, as always.

It was fine, I was told I still smelled quite fragrant at least 5 hours later.

And in fact, my co-worker loved it so much, I gave her the rest of my sample so she could entice her boyfriend to use it. So, for me, though enjoyable, it will be a one and done scent for me. Just not the style I go for.",04/19/17 18:29,taranwanderer77

If you've ever smelled a bouquet of blue flowers, you've smelled this. Most will like it (including myself), even though it's in no way remarkable. Longevity is 1 hour for me, after which it becomes an almost undetectable skin scent. This is not an evening fragrance in my opinion. I think it goes best with casual attire on breezy spring or summer days. I'd say this is a unisex fragrance, but certainly more masculine than feminine. It's also arguably the best in the Guilty line, despite that being a non-boastworthy achievement. Safe blind-buy for anyone that enjoys floral scents.",03/06/17 10:04,36thDisciple

Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"It is nothing so special about this scent, a big name and another patchouli musky floral scent. It is grouped as a woody aromatic.
The smell is pleasant, but the projection and longevity is far beyond its price and expectation!
You need to test this on your skin few times before you decide to buy it or be a gucci maniac ;), otherwise, do not waste your money and there are tons of far better scents out there.
I would say gucci guilty man is suitable to wear in spring/summer mornings.
The combination of orange blossom, orris and snowberry makes this a nice light citrus white floral powdery scent, but what a disappointment when it fades away after an hour and becomes a skin scent!

Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"To me, this scent is a perfect blend of Versace Pour Homme and Burberry Brit Rhythm, both of which are favorites in my collection. I never would've imagined something that was at the midway point between the two though, because they're such different scents! Brit Rhythm is leathery with deep fruity notes. Versace Pour Homme is aquatic with florals. Combining them? No way. But Gucci Guilty Eau does exactly that! This is an improvement on the original Gucci Guilty in every way.

Longevity for me is perfect and it just barely lasts noticeably through a 9 hour work day, which is perfect. Today I can even still smell it under my shirt over 16 hours later! Mind you, that's under my shirt. It won't last that long on skin.

Bottom line: Forget everyone's comments about synthetic this and generic that. It smells good, period!

It's not a bad fragrance (pleasant, synthetic, people-pleaser) but come Gucci...an original thought, concept, idea and perhaps a somewhat original men's fragrance would be welcomed.

I give this one a 5/10 based purely on the scent alone. But it earns a barnacle encrusted anchor for being so dull, boring and a clone of a copy of a clone. What's Next?

It just doesn't really stand out in any way to me. Also I'm a fan of sweeter scents so that may have some bearing on my opinion. This is a fresher citrus based scent that doesn't have much sweetness at all.

So this just falls into that gray area for me, where I don't love it nor hate it, it's just kinda there. Not something I would wear.",02/25/16 15:44,MrBumblepants
Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"Boring, synthetic and thin citruses on top of some non-descript musk and bland woody sweetness.

I get a tiny hint of orange blossom and perhaps a smidge of patchouli if I really stretch my imagination.

Other than that, it's pure nothing. The same basic sweet, cheap and thin shit they've been bottling ever since the original.

Honestly, it drives me nuts. Balmain Homme is in a similar style, yet somehow manages to actually smell good and slightly creative. It is possible to do a fresh sweet scent that actually has some quality to it. Why must Gucci insist to fail every time?

Perhaps I am being unfair. I know the Gucci by Gucci line has been a big hit for Gucci, the Guilty possibly an even bigger hit. And credit where credit is due - Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme is decent.

I just know that Gucci can do so much better. They gave us Envy for men and Pour Homme I & II.

Why can't they show just a teeny tiny bit of creative and possible release something that's actually good? I'm not looking for a fragrance lovers fragrance at all, just a great scent. Paco Rabanne did it with 1 Million, Viktor & Rolf did it with Spicebomb.

Both of those are sweet and mainstream, but damn decent in their own rights.

Please Gucci, get your act together.

Longevity is fairly non-existant. 2 hours tops.

Gucci Guilty Eau Pour Homme Gucci,"I ran into this new Gucci Guilty flanker at Ulta.. At first I thought it was the same old Gucci Guilty because the bottles are almost identical but soon I realized that it was the new Gucci Guilty Eau, so I gave it a spray on a tester strip.. This is just my first impression of this new flanker.. Gucci Guilty Eau opens up very reminiscent of the original Gucci Guilty just a bit brighter & fresher! Fresh citrus top notes lead to a very fresh floral heart which than leads to a patchouli and musk base.. Gucci Guilty Eau smells a whole lot like the original Gucci Guilty except it is lighter, brighter, & fresher! There is no lavender here, instead there is amped up citrus & florals.. Lots of fresh florals like snowberry & orris compliment the prominent orange blossom heart.. The patchouli base is still there but it is a much lighter patchouli this time around.. I am not sure if this Eau flanker was really necessary being that Gucci Guilty Black already was basically just a fresher cleaner version of Guilty.. It does seem to perform very well, especially for an Eau flanker.. If you do not like the original Gucci Guilty or the Gucci Guilty Black flanker than I doubt you will like this one.. But if you do enjoy the other Gucci Guilty fragrances than you might really like this one! This is basically the Gucci Guilty for hot summer days! But when all is said and done, shame on you GUCCI!

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"At the very beginning, the fragrance opens with a slightly coniferous nuance and a hint of balsamic warmth, I assume this comes from the vetiver.
The opening feels rich and dense, almost enveloping. As it unfolds, the composition becomes softer, revealing a pleasant delicate sweetness, lightness, and femininity.

Overall, the scent feels warm, elegant, and perfectly in harmony with its name. It also evokes an association with autumn and fallen leaves 🍂

Alberto Morillas is truly a master 👏🏻 creating such a soft and elegant fragrance from this rather complex pyramid is pure artistry!",10/18/25 10:04,Anna Mam
The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I have many perfumes and a hundred perfume sample decants and I rarely find something that feels ""me"". This one is earthy with notes that are classically male but somehow still feels feminine. Perfect, love it.",08/28/25 17:24,SimoneSimone1
The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I love this scent a lot. For me the opening and heart of the fragrance are very unisex, but the dry down was a bit feminine, mature and powdery. I'm relieved I dont like the dry down because I really can't afford to love this as much as I love the rest of it. I'm wearing it today in 90F heat. Inside, in the cold air-conditioning, it's sweet amber and smokey patchouli. When I wear it outside it lives up to its name. It reminds me of the very dry dead grass at the end of summer with the smell of the flowers that have dried in the heat. After an hour hitting golf balls at the range it's still lingering close to my skin. I personally like this more in the cold weather months.",08/24/25 18:08,irisosiris

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is definitely a spicy, dark patchouli scent like others have mentioned. I dont normally enjoy scents like this so my review might be a little biased but I will say, it's not very overpowering on the dry down so it's better than most dark patchouli-woody scents ive tried.
Even if you're into this type of scent I don't really find it worth it because of its hefty price tag. I dont think its anything special either, its a smell ive gotten from many colognes on the market but its definitely on the softer side if that makes sense. That being said, It's definitely a unisex fragrance maybe even a bit more masculine-leaning.
I dont know, other than the bottle being super stunning this is very bleh.",10/24/24 14:51,urinal__
The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is just gorgeous and perfect for fall. It’s woody, spicy, and just the right amount of sweetness shines through. It smells completely different when I smell it directly on my skin (more woody, darker) than when I smell it in the air around me (aromatic, sweet woods). It’s just special. My young daughters always tell me I smell good when I wear this, too. It has pretty good longevity for how airy it is. The Alchemist’s Garden line has some true gems in it, and The Last Day of Summer is in my top 3 I’ve tried. Beautiful natural smelling perfume of such high quality.",10/18/24 18:34,cgaleb

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Most fall focused scents that try to capture the feelings and ambience of autumn end up reminding me of fall candles. Kilian Smoking Hot is good but I get that vibe from it as well. This one hits that mark without giving me that synthetic feeling. I was finally able to aquire a discounted bottle over a year after trying it at the boutique. It just hits that vibe perfectly for me without being cloying. The cedar nutmeg combo is really great here, and it lasts a long time without shouting across a room. My friends who I've let try it, really like it, and want a bottle. Unfortunately, it's been discontinued, so many won't get a chance to check this one out without paying a truckload of money on a blind buy. Highly recommend you try it if you get a chance.

P.S. Watch out for fakes. I bought a fake bottle of Midnight Stroll from a poor guy that had no idea he'd been wearing a counterfeit, which are unsanitary and dangeroust to put on skin. The scent should be rich, elegant (midnight should be strong) and not smell cheap. Pay close attention to the bottle and packaging, and try to feel the real bottle bag so you know the texture. The draw strings on the bag should not be frayed and coming apart. I posted pictures of the counterfeit in fragram",09/08/24 23:33,The Wolf

I remember sampling this many years ago in a Neiman Marcus and not being impressed, which is generally the problem with testing at Department Stores where the air is filled with perfume.
Fast forward a few years, I saw this being discontinued and ordered a decant, along with one of the Voice of the Snake. It was an immediate love for me.
I get mostly cypress with nutmeg on a woody base. Maybe a little patch and fortunately I don't detect any vetiver. The composition is smooth and well-rounded, leans masculine and seems to have decent longevity.

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I would say this scent is quite nice for about 90 minutes to 2 hours. Then it is down to almost nothing on me. The opening is the best part. The freshness of the cypress and the sweetness of the nutmeg makes for a great partnership. It’s a happy casual uplifting scent I would say. And actually more suited to fall than summer. Safe. Unisex. I would not buy a bottle because of the short half life but that’s not the same for everyone so I would encourage a trial if you like the notes or if you admire Mr Morillas, as I do.

Woody and smokey. Does it remind me of the last day of summer? No, it reminds me more of Halloween or Fall 🎃.

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,Nah hate unisex scents. Has no character. No wearer in mind by the perfumer. Unisex scents all have one thing in common... Profit over artistic creation. The Last Day smells nice but its neither masculine or feminine. It's genderless. Thus boring,06/04/22 20:29,richmilton
The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I assumed this would be heavily masculine leaning but i am pleasantly surprised. Definitely leans a smidge masculine, but definitely still fairly unisex.

There's a very heavy coniferous, piney note here but it's well tempered by sweet earthy vetiver and the spiciness of the nutmeg.

There's a woodyness from the cedar, the patchouli doesn't feel especially present to my nose. Maybe contributes a bit to the earthyness but i can't isolate it.

The cedar and nutmeg are stronger here than the note breakdown would have you believe. In fact if i had to rank notes in terms of prominence it would be cypress > cedar > nutmeg > vetiver > patchouli.

Not ideal for a hot summer day. Probably best worn in transitory seasons like spring and fall.",05/15/22 08:56,twoski
The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"First impression: an interesting slightly fresh herbal woods with an earthy undertone from the present but tame patchouli.

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is a good reminder to occasionally try things outside your comfort zone. I never would have tried this frag because the notes on paper don't particularly appeal to me (and patchouli usually makes me gag) but a friend I bought a full bottle of Memo from included a carded sample, and... it turned out to be my #1 favourite frag of all time, out of the hundreds I've tried and my ruthlessly curated collection of niche. It's hard to describe its beauty. The sweetness of the nutmeg lends an almost gourmand warmth to the cedar notes, and (like a few other people here) my nose gets a not-listed smooth sandalwood-- cozy but still very elegant, like Balmain pajamas or something. Perfectly unisex, and I'd wear it in any season except maybe the hottest days of summer. Also, if the retail price is making you shrivel, I got a reasonably* affordable tester from a discounter.
*Not according to my partner, most likely ;)",02/18/22 06:19,WitchBeatrice
The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This fragrance is very high quality. I wear it like aromatherapy after a shower in the evening. when I first tested at Gucci I was surprised at how masculine it was considering how feminine the bottle is. it starts spicy and warm. it dries down very soft and very woody, although it took a few weeks for the woody scent to macerate and mature. it reminds me of a chest of drawers or antique armoire lined with aged burgundy velvet.

regarding performance: this redefines the word ""eternal"". it is hands down the longest lasting fragrance I own. I can easily smell this on my skin 15-20+ hours after application. with a nice long spray and sumptuously fine mist, it also happens to be the best atomizer I've ever used, and must contribute to its longevity.

9/10 overall because of its linear dry down, and heavier use can get cloying into the second day 😅

update: this woody cedar blends well under many other scents with woody bases, and blue fragrances. believe it or not even Fahrenheit layers beautifully over this, making the dry wood wet and aromatic. of course it also goes well with other Alchemist Collection scents, esp Autumn Leaves",12/16/21 17:35,dudebro

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,Very fresh and green scent. Patchouli certainly is strong here. The whole scent become more somber and woody later on. I was holding the nozzle the wrong way and had it all sprayed into my hand. The scent in my had was very strong at first but very quickly disappeared even while a small spray on clothing lingered on. Nice spice dry down. Certainly the longevity is not up to par with the price. Neither is the silage. Rather disappointing.,08/05/21 03:53,ckorp8
The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"A dusky perfume, nostalgic. Patchouli gives it an earthy raspiness - a lasting, lingering haze, otherwise it would be about sweet resinous cypress with clean nutmeg and nice rooty vetiver.

I do think of autumn on its way - the scent of damper cooler earth amidst the aroma of mature trees. An evocative scent which has a sort of golden elegance and mystery - like September sunset on old stone.

Hmm, waxing lyrical there, but this does conjure up a walk I used to take on my return from work some years ago, through a park filled with ancient trees, then through a neighbourhood of beautiful Arts and Craft era houses.

I like it, but it's definitely one for late summer and autumn, as intended - hence the name!",04/15/21 08:41,woodlandwalk

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Absolutely stunning fragrance. With a small online discount on Saks, I blind bought this a few months ago and it's been love at first sniff. I'll say I have a general bias towards dry, green woody fragrances, but man, the quality of this fragrance is just undeniable. It's almost difficult to dissect, which is what makes it such a quality composition.

Bitter cedar, cypress, and earthy vetiver are met with the warmth of nutmeg and patchouli. It does have a medicinal tinge initially, but that disappears rather quickly. The way the nutmeg is used here is, dare I say, ingenious. As it warms up on your skin, its spiciness suggests sunlight, or a forest drying in the late afternoon sun. Dense, but at the same time airy and fleeting. In tandem, vetiver provides a freshly upturned earth feeling (more dry peat than wet soil). Vetiver is one of those fragrances that I generally stay away from, as synthetic or low quality vetiver in most fragrances often smells sour and gives me headaches, but this is not that. This is the vetiver that I imagine people fall head-over-heels for.

All of the materials in this fragrance forwardly express their high quality. It even feels oily, which makes the very fine spray even more impressive. And while it sits pretty close to the skin, it stays with you until the next day. I wouldn't know if it was ""worth"" the retail price tag (that's always subjective), but I will say I don't have any regrets buying it and will gladly buy it again when I finish this bottle.

On an unrelated note, I've expressed some embarrassment to owning a Gucci fragrance as the brand in the last few years has developed a reputation for excessive branding and tackiness, but I recently read an i-D interview with Creative Director Alessandro Michele, and while I am still not a fan of the logos and merchandising, he did convince me of the direction he's taking Gucci in. A true visionary who pulls inspiration from every imaginable corner of the universe, I'm very excited to see what other fragrances await us in The Alchemist's Garden.",10/01/20 12:16,ateneo_ldb

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Blind bought this... and all I can say is wow...Presentation is a heavy textured white box with gold foil printing with a Victorian/baroque style all around. The lid lifts off to reveal the fragrance laying in the box atop a handsome striped ivory satchel with matching bird motif. It has the feel of an ornate coffin upon opening. The bottles are stunning and feel very high quality. Quite heavy in the hand and the cap fits so tight it could easily support the weight of the bottle when pressed on. ‘The Last Day of Summer’ is in pristine white gloss lacquer with realistic looking reflective gold print that has a slightly raised texture imitating a hand painted gilded bottle. Two pops of green print fill the bow tie on the wreath surrounding the perfumes title. The top of the cap is adorned with the same bird and a band of gold, with the cap appearing to be an antique ’stopper’. I am not exaggerating when I say the atomizer on this bottle is the best I have ever seen or sprayed, similar to some Dior’s. A longer that usual sustained fine, fine mist comes out producing a voluminous dose, almost seemingly powered by aerosol. This aroma is a dank, earthen smell unlike any fragrances I can think to compare it, yet doesn’t feel ‘heavy’, cloying or oppressive. The nutmeg plays a big role here and provides just enough nutty sweetness to lift the patchouli and very rooty smelling Vetiver. The sillage it produces is just gorgeous: you get floating trails of musty green woods and a vibe that tricks me into thinking I’m smelling high grade sandalwood. While I can understand anyone wanting to smell like this, as it comes across very natural and earthy, it does read to me slightly more masculine, only very slightly...This is likely due to the very earthy use of Vetiver. It even seems to imitate a subtle leather accord... I can say I have nothing in my collection close to it, however, I do feel it is at home amongst other Alessandro-era Gucci fragrances that use daring raw earthy notes, namely Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme. If you hate Vetiver you may want to skip this one, it has a very rooty earthy feel. In my mind it conjures mosses and lichens growing on a fallen cedar tree on the forest floor with the first chill of autumn bringing a slight moisture to the air causing the smells of these natural growths to atomize up into the air and hover near the ground. Lovers of earthy smells must get your noses on this one, it produces a calming feeling, a slight sense of melancholy knowing the end of summer has arrived and that first rustle of leaves makes you take notice and know fall is approaching and with it darker days and colder nights to come, but with the seasons change new beautiful landscapes of colors and smells you forgot you had missed during the hot days of summer.

The Last Day Of Summer Eau de Parfum Gucci,"oh my god this is so good

On first spray, a bright/sharp dash of freshly grated nutmeg - combined with the cypress & cedar it has a tough cough-syrupy edge.

The nutmeg here is so pure and true. When I cook I always use freshly grated nutmeg because the already-ground stuff does NOT compare in scent or flavor, and this is very fresh, you can smell that oily medicinal edge when the newly exposed surface of the inside of the nutmeg hits the air.

Then everything calms down a bit, the cough syrup/medicinal vibe disappears, and what's left is fresh spice on a bed of conifer forest and a soft gentle layer of vetiver underneath it all.

I feel like the vetiver is perfectly used here, sometimes if there's too much it projects forward on me and that's all i can smell, but here it is a wonderful supporting note.

I can't stop sniffing myself and everything is beautiful. Like sunshine through the trees in the mountains.

The name is poetic but this feels more like the first breath of fall than the last day of summer. Don't care, I love it.",11/21/19 10:43,DulciusExAsperis

However, as I'm wearing the sample, it's actually more pleasant than I first perceived. It has a restrained beauty. It's well balanced between woods and spices, and there's an interesting incense note that gives it some character.

What about the ""salt-sand wave?"" No salt or sand notes. The ""droop-headed flowers?"" We have yew-berries, nightshade, Wolf's-bane, and poisonous wine- all missing. And FFS, what about glutting thine sorrow on a morning rose?! We should at least be glutting our sorrows on a morning rose! Where's the dewey morning rose? This perfume is not appropriately named at all. It's like the boyfriend of an English major once heard the English major reading this poem but wasn't listening, but somehow the title stuck in his head and he just pulled it out of his ass and everyone thought it sounded great! Well, you should all apologize to Keats and to those of us who have read his poem and expected a lot more out of this perfume, at least a hint of a f'ing grape or a rose. If you're going to be a ""Haute Couture"" line, you need to do better than this, Gucci. This is simply woods and balsam. Not that don't enjoy woods. I'm a lover of woods.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Wild irises grow along the coast here, and that’s the ‘feel’ I get here. More shimmery than their denser cultivated country cousins. The heart notes seem constantly blended, like stirring something in a pot, nothing heavy gets to settle. The geranium, lilac & rose stay perfectly even & full. No one mentions this note, it’s my favourite lilac perfume, by far the sexiest one, Pepper stays to play longer than expected, delightful. And the base, that patchouli is so smooth. Bvlgari Splendida Patchouli Tentation has this same P, a rich river carrying the higher notes along so beautifully. Amber keeping it all warmed through. I’ve been told I smell like a hug and a dirty sex bomb in the same day lol.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I blind bought this fully expecting to be disappointed. I assumed it would be kind of trashy like ""Rush"". However, it is the most beautiful, purple floral powdery fragrance. It is not a blast of baby powder in your nose like ""My Name"" by Trussardi or ""Omnia Amethyste"" by Bvlgari. It is a perfectly moderate fragrance. Subtle, but noticeable. Not at all weak. Moderate sillage and above average longevity of 7 hours at its best. The initial spray is a bit aggressive but once it dries down, it is gorgeous. The mandarin orange and bergamot are more distant but certainly noticeable. They add a bit of juiciness to the florals. I find this quite versatile, from everyday use to serious events, this fragrance is a solid choice. While the current bottle design is not great, the gold colour is accurate.

P.S. Somebody asked me what laundry detergent I was using. In a way, it does remind me of a very nice laundry detergent. If you are into this category of scents, give ""Guilty"" a try!",08/19/25 10:56,FragranceLover00

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"To me this is the same as the previous version, a soft spicy lilac amber perfume, absolutely addictive and one of my all time favourites!",06/02/25 13:06,bel.gravia
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This review is for those missing the original formula (in the little rounded edged square flacon).
I have not smelled this EDP version, (I really should try it) however, I bought the EDT as the notes are almost the same as the original version, with bergamot removed and raspberry added

I have the original and did a side by side. The EDT smells almost identical however the original is spicier, soapier, the notes a bit crisper and more distinct. It also projects considerably more and lasts longer on my skin. So if you have nostalgia for the OG you might just find what you are looking for in the EDT version.",05/27/25 00:16,LuckyLei
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,This is very pretty and sophisticated – a rich smelling floral. Perhaps just a bit too mature for my taste. I also get something slightly metallic from it.,05/19/25 18:23,sc0tty2th0tty
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"It differs slightly from the eau de toilette which is airier and more floral with gorgeous lilac.
This feels fruitier, though the fruits are not obvious. The lilac seems in equal proportion to pink pepper and is not as evident. I feel also a salty facet which might be the amber base that rounds this scent up giving it a slightly soapy overtone.
I am not perceiving it as stronger than the edt and I do not feel violets here, nor geranium. Patchouli is also rather non-existent or styled beyond recognition. Maybe a little bit of rose comes of slightly soapy here.
It is very pretty, modern, stylish and floral in an not obvious way.
It is sensual, human skin-like and ever so slightly sweet.
But I think I prefer the airier eau de toilette and the lilac Love Edition.
It feels universal occasion-wise, possibly also season-wise. This makes the scent special.",05/15/25 07:00,MademoiselleMaya
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,Maybe my bottle was a dud but was bought from a reputable company. I wish I smelt what everyone else here is smelling but all I got was a metallic watery scent. I waited patiently for months for any transformation. There was none. Decluttered.,05/07/25 20:55,MsRizz
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I've been wearing the original 2010 version of Gucci Guilty for 13 years, and it’s filled with wonderful memories, especially from my wedding day. I recently tried the 2019 version, and while it’s similar to the original, I found the Eau de Parfum lacks the same charm. The violet and lilac notes seem more pronounced, and the powdery scent is much stronger than I prefer. I still favor the Eau de Toilette, which offers a pleasant longevity and captures the essence of the original beautifully.",04/18/25 20:48,Ldidovets01
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This perfume broke my heart - I’m a big fan of Lana del Rey and after seeing her being face of the campaign I immediately blind bought a full bottle, hoping it will give me beloved “Lana vibes”.
I don’t know what’s the cause of it, but after pleasant opening of lilac and bergamot, a strong gasoline (?!) smell sticks with me till the very end. Actually, I had to wash it off quite fast because of that, I didn’t even have a chance to fully wait for it to dry :( gasoline is one of the most hated smells by me, so I simply couldn’t stand it.
It’s super weird and don’t take my words as a red flag or something - I read a lot of reviews and didn’t find similar complaints. It just doesn’t work with my skin chemistry :(

But Lana is so beautiful in the advertisement, I’m proud of her and I hope that one day she will release her own perfume and it will become my perfect signature ;)",04/13/25 16:09,Punika
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This perfume is more naturalistic than I expected. The opening is very stingy and quite zesty with citruses and herbs, which may be too overpowering. But otherwise is this a really pretty purple floral fragrance. It has very powerful aromatic scents in it, maybe like menthols and spicy woods like coniferous, whilst the undertones are more sugary and aquatic, which the scent eventually dies down to. This perfume might smell a bit chemical, but I still think it's a very clean and quite refreshing fragrance, and I really like it. I'd recommend this to women who like naturalistic green yet floral scents. It's unique!",03/16/25 11:46,MildÈdes
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"A little too overpowering for me, but I'm not a fan of strong flower scents so that makes sense.",03/13/25 13:35,Marinab96
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The opening is a pink pepper blast, rosy and citrusy, and tart, almost like raspberry. Guilty is a soft, slightly powdery floral fragrance that smells clean and elegant, in an understated way. It reminds me a lot of A Drop d’Issey – both have prominent lilac and smell clean in a floral scented hand lotion kind of way.

Guilty feels extremely versatile, seasonless, timeless, and ageless. I can’t think of a season or occasion it wouldn’t suit, and it would work just as well on both young and old women. It would be a great signature scent or a gift for a loved one. The longevity is at least 6-7 hours and sillage is moderate.

I love the ads with Lana Del Rey, but this isn’t at all what I imagine she’d wear. Lana Del Rey needs something more seductive and theatrical. Guilty is Elizabeth Grant sitting on a window sill at home, wearing a cashmere sweater, finishing up writing Norman Fucking Rockwell.

This is one of those perfumes I’d like on others. It’s pleasant, but not something I’d wear. I find it quite boring and I dislike the opening.

EDIT: My mother owns a sample of this and has been wearing it a lot recently. The more I smell it, the more I like it. It doesn't fit my current taste/style, but I could see myself wearing this when I'm older, after getting sick of the heavy woody incensy florals I'm currently loving. Maybe this will be a signature scent for 50-year-old me.",03/11/25 15:00,illusoryme
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I have a good memory with original Gucci Guilty 2010. New EDT was not covered my nostalgic needs, so I tried this EDP and it was a right !!

That iconic opening of Guilty, top notes and geranium. Then purple flowers shows up very softly. Purple flowers with masculine touch of geranium and patchouli but it is keep forwarding to feminine.

Longevity was 12 hours +, Sillage was intimate at the first but it bloomed arm length.

Problem is I needed to over spray to feel purple flowers the notes I love. Nostalgia covered.",02/12/25 19:08,Ziva99
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I love Gucci Guilty EdT so much, it is one of my favorite perfumes ever. However, I remember thinking once that even though it smells amazing, I don't know if I can justify paying so much for something that doesn't last that long, and I'm thinking it again now that my bottle is nearly empty. I still have a tester of the EdP, I put that one on one wrist and the EdT on the other, and compared them. The EdT feels somewhat fresher and dries down musky, and I sense more pink pepper. The EdP is similar but is more soft and powdery. Others have said this, but I'd like to reiterate that this perfume is great for every day and every season (a bit less so Summer). I find the guilty line is not as sexy as it is cool and a bit classy, which is what I like about it ('sexy' gets thrown around way too much when it comes to perfumes IMO). I tried this before when it came out in 2019, I loved it, but I used to think it smelled too powdery/mature, and that the EdT (which I already had) is better for me. Now that I've gotten older, I have changed my mind, and I can see myself pulling this off. I still have some doubts about the performance of this one, but I'm considering getting it in the future.",01/18/25 07:23,eu4ia
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"A pleasant sweet, floral scent gently fades into powdery notes. It feels comforting and enveloping, smooth and calm.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Clean, fresh and safe.

Fresh mildly citrus opening that already has violet mixing with it. As it dries down, the violet takes over giving a clean masculine vibe. Amber becomes slightly noticeable in the background giving some depth and warmth.

Could be unisex. Could wear year round for all occasions by varying the sprays. Longevity and projection are average. Not sure of the value…plenty that do this for less.

Overall, it’s OK. I don’t need to buy it…I have plenty that do this better for less.",12/18/24 08:14,MNadz

it feels very cozy and effortless, id say its appropriate for every age and works with most outfits. the floral notes are such a nice addition to the overall profile.
it doesn't last too long which is the only drawback for me. i find myself thinking i sprayed way too much just to reapply it 30 minutes later.
overall a very nice, basic perfume for everyday wear!",08/12/24 17:09,kayeah
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"If you want to smell clean, light, powdery, not very sweet then this is your girl. It’s a lilac/violet fragrance.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Super floral which I’m not a fan of, but while it is sharp, it’s at least not stabbing-my-nose sharp. I don’t get any pink pepper, amber, or citrus—really just florals and patchouli. Has minimal sillage and lasts about 6 hours on me.",07/15/24 17:06,anamawsity
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Thick? Lol this is super powdery and thin to my nose. It's really lovely, just a shame the patch in the dry down ruins it. Also nowhere near as beautiful and interesting as the discontinued original in the square bottle",07/02/24 11:00,MyScentBubble
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Soft and clean. Powdery, lipstick/makeup type scent. I really don't like those type of scents, but this one is ok somehow. It kind of reminds me of scented baby wipes. Would make a really good easy reach fragrance when you don't really have anything else in mind. Something you'd wear to the office or with a plain tshirt. The name Guilty is definitely a misnomer. I think it could work for any age, but I could see younger girls not liking it much because it isn't ultra sweet or even overly floral. It isn't a heavy scent at all though, so I wouldn't find this weird on a young person. I just have a sample, but I will definitely be using it up. Not sure if I'd buy a whole bottle because it's just not my type of scent, but I like it and it is continuing to grow on me.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I'll admit, I think I must have tried too many samples while shopping, and my nose might have been confused when I thought I was in love with Guilty while shopping. Took it home, and the day after I found myself mildly disappointed. What I smelled while shopping was just a tad louder.

My bottle turned out to be surprisingly 'too clean' for my taste, and others' opinions were similar-- mostly that it just smells like an overpriced lotion.

I can say, however, that it's grown on me after about a year. I've come to appreciate it as a simpler scent for weekends when I want to relax.

If you're looking for something loud, complex or sultry, Guilty would probably be my last suggestion. An understated scent-- albeit probably not worthy of its given title. 'Guiltless' would be more fitting for this one.",06/11/24 16:45,ioniccolette

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Beautiful!! I love how delicate this is and the dry down maintains that light and airy feeling. This is clean without the headache of some ""clean"" perfumes - like fresh air mixed with delicate flowers. Everyone from your aunty to your grandma to your next door neighbor will like how you smell. Very inoffensive, I don't see how anyone can dislike this. While saying this praise I would like to point out that it's definitely not unique and I don't see this lasting very long on most people. However, the dry down is intimate and soft and my friend could smell it on me when she got in my car and said I smelled good (I could hardly smell it anymore on myself after 3 hours so I was surprised).

I think this would smell the most beautiful in early winter or late spring/early summer.",04/30/24 14:39,jow012

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,If Gucci stop making this one I will have nothing to live for. I have 3 bottles of this one in 3 different sizes.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I keep seeing sophisticated florals being called “rich auntie” scents. Especially with patchouli, rose, and/or the chypre accord. Gucci Guilty is that essence but in the most modern, sexy way. I do feel rich when I wear this (lies) but not snotty old money rich- more like 90s supermodel in the corner of a nightclub, private booth, slinky dress kinda rich. People want to be seen with her. She’s got legs for days and somehow just puts her hair in a stupid clip and looks like a million bucks. This scent is kinda classic but still a little edgy. It’s effortless, cool, but dressy. This feels like a signature scent you could wear through the decades. (It’s more suited to grownT women)

Spicy, floral, aromatic, musky; depending on the weather it reads a bit juicy or more powdery. Orange, violet, and patchouli might be singing loudest to me but it’s very well blended. Can see this working most seasons as it’s not a particularly warm frag. Just fabulous ugh!",02/25/24 20:02,jdb_

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I love it. It's powdery, elegant with slightest tang of sweetness in the background, to some degree sort of cottony.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This reminds me of the old Bvlgari pour femme which I have in my collection. The powdery especially after dry down I guess. However, the Bvlgari has a more fresh citrus to it while Gucci more floral. It's not the type of perfume which makes me wow at first sniff. It's ordinary and okay. But due to the powdery note, it makes you feel slightly older than you are. The note does evolve over time on me which is a good sign. It grows on me when I use it a few times. But I still doubt if I would get a full size of it.",01/18/24 01:03,coucoupetite
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The floral for me is a strong lilac. It is a little too sharp, almost like a sweet-tart. Only a hint of patchouli, which is a good thing. I like fruity florals, but usually think they are too sweet and need more orange. In this case it's the opposite. It does have a mild powdery dry down that softens the tartness, but not enough. I'm not familiar enough with violet or geranium to know if they are contributing to what I don't like. It is strong too, not offensive, but you can't get away from it.",01/14/24 13:34,Ralison71
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I recently received this as a gift. Call me old fashioned, but I typically enjoy lilac and violet notes, so this fits into my collection easily. There is somewhat of a sharpness, maybe from the pink pepper or geranium, that is a bit unpleasant, but it fades away quickly. Sometimes patchouli can make or break a fragrance for me, but it's not too overpowering here. Maybe because of this, Guilty EdP doesn't seem to have much longevity - I normally only spray once or twice, and I don't really mind a scent dissipating after a few hours, but I figured I'd put it out there just in case it matters to others.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"wow this smells so beautiful! The sales clerk sprayed Gucci Guilty on my left wrist and Olympea Solar on the other. Even though OS is rated as longer wearing on fragrantica, I think GG lasts more than OS. I was contemplating between GG and OS. OS has very little presence to me. I had to put my nose near to my wrist to smell it. GG on the other hand has more projection! I catches whiffs of it while I'm shopping. This is the first time I smell violet on a perfume. It reminds me of christmas. So so beautiful and uplifting fragrance! I associate the smell with my aunt who visits from UK every christmas. This fragrance reminds me of her. It does smells like a rich aunt.

Ignore the negative reviews guys. You have to test it first to see if it works on you. GG is certainly not crazy projecting like Libre or L'interdit but it's beautiful and wearable, so I don't mind.",07/16/23 07:08,IdoleYesIAm

Boring, average, clean, feminine floral.
it's a classic mainstream frangrance; a violet, rose and lilac flower bouquet, with a tad of berry fruityness and a classic amber-patchouli base.
Not repulsive as other designer frags (think LVEB, Prada Paradoxe, Coach, Michael Kors, Daisy etc) indeed it's very wearable, not offensive, but as well not memorable.
OK for office wear (if you are able to locate a bottle, that is).
Very similiar to CK Beauty, RL Romance.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"GLAMOUR level 100! Gucci Guilty is one of glamorous perfume I have encountered, and I have encountered more than 200. It’s a powdery lilac and violet bomb with a punch of freshness, helping it not to be too much. It’s not sweet or syrupy at all, it is floral and powdery. It is a must for all violet and lilac lovers. I get all the middles notes listed above, but here the lilac and violet are the ABSOLUTE stars of show! Velvety and creamy, it is a rich perfume that will get you noticed and last really well; I can still smell it though my laundry basket. I had the impression to be in a cloud of powdery lilac for hours while wearing it and people asked me a lot while coming closer “it smells good in your direction; is that you?” Close to Violet Orchid, Lolita Lempicka, Parisienne and share the Moulin Rouge vibes of Le Classique EDP, I easily also imagine Betty Poop, Jessica Rabbit, Marilyn Monroe, Dita Von Teese; and yes, Lana Del Rey wearing that. The kind of perfume for people that want to make a statement, for sure.

Could be wear all year long by people who wants to be noticed in the crowd, however IMO Gucci Guilty is not perfume really casual or for work, nor for clubbing, its sophisticated, glam and if you are an over-sprayer; it could be really inviting and sultry ;)",05/18/23 09:40,Icarel

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Ok, not bad by any means, but not … compelling?

I LOVED Love, Chloe EDP and this is nowhere near as good as that beauty.

This is a pretty, powdery floral that’s very light, polite and unnoticeable. There’s a metallic streak that bothers me though. I love the bottle and am disappointed it’s not vastly better. At least it isn’t a super sweet gunky vanilla thing. Ok if I’m allowing myself to be snarky it is a bit like a bathroom air freshener. And there’s just something I can’t quite pinpoint that I don’t like about it. I think this needs a bit more green or a bit more sweet or a dash more of an unusual note. As it is, it’s just not compelling for me and a generic sort of air freshener. another recent blind buy mistake was Lilas Exquis by Jacques Fath. that one is a much better lilac floral than this Gucci. fairly similar overall but the JF seems better quality & dash more green.",04/27/23 17:03,perfumesniffer
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Really wanted to like it. I imagined it as a good drugstore gem but this fragrance is almost giving me a headache with its really long lasting and strong flowery vinegar that never goes, never mellows. Such a shame as I absolutely adore the flanker design. It could work for someone who works at a medical setting. Work fragrance for someone who doesn’t want to exude any personality but smell clean and put together to others.",04/06/23 03:34,mizzflrpt7
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Getting to know this one. I'd been always intrigued by its smell so when I found it for a really good price went for it without even thinking. So far it remains a ""yes but..."" perfume: gorgeous vintage lilac BUT too much patchouli; baby gentle and understated BUT a tinge of something gagging. I will continue my investigation because it draws me in, time will tell if we are made for each other.",03/31/23 04:56,melusina1982

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is a soft lilac and violet (very) feminine fragrance. Seems best suited for church or a Sunday stroll in the park. Some have said it smells like baby wipes.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I loved Guilty, the citrusy floral but slightly spicy and patchouli notes could have been designed especially for me, a perfect everyday scent. But like most perfumes I’ve loved, it’s been reformulated 😢 This one is still recognisable as Guilty but much more powdery and sweet, maybe less spice. There’s something about this new version which slightly reminds me of Paco Rabanne XS for her, if anyone else remembers it?! That was a perfume I loved too so I’m not too disappointed.",03/01/23 04:38,Luce23

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I think this perfume would suit a classy, mature, sophisticated woman -but it really isn't for me lol. Not my style, not my vibe, but it's definitely a pleasant fragrance. I get almost no floral notes from it, besides a hint of rose and geranium. It's very amber-y, with the second strongest note (in my opinion) being mandarin orange. Then patchouli maybe? No pink pepper thankfully, which I hate. It smells expensive and I think it would make a great gift, even if it isn't something I would pick up for myself.",02/09/23 15:29,moneyistheanthem

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Was very sweet at first, I thought it might be white florals and some fruit, like strawberry. On the dry-down, it's sweet, feminine, powdery lilac. Not a green or photorealistic lilac, but really pretty. It leans a bit mature, but the orange gives it some brightness.",01/15/23 15:03,onlythesun321
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This fragrance is pretty, but I don't think I would purchase it. The violet or lilac in it reminds me of either 1) a comforting, soft-scented laundry detergent/laundry sheets OR 2) baby products (baby wipes, baby oil, or baby lotion). It's a plush, soft scent, so I probably lean more toward detergent in the first few minutes and baby products at the drydown. None of those are bad - it's actually pleasant. I'm just not sure I would purchase it as a fragrance. I think I'd like it more as a plug-in for a room scent than perfume.",01/12/23 06:10,Allthingssparkle
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Guilty Pour Femme is synthetic, very mature, strong enough to make your throat itch. Settles into a powdery floral, still synthetic and a bit spicy. I got no fruits or amber, just a harsh cloud of flowers and patchouli. This is the opposite of a perfume I can't stop smelling my wrists for, and so many other things I don't want from any fragrance. I have a sample of the EdT waiting to be tested, but I'm honestly too scared to even try a little spritz at this point.

I was trying to figure out what the flowers reminded me of, but as others already said, it's definitely baby wipes. I'm sure it's good for someone who likes scents of this type, but for me? I got an immediate headache and looming nausea which both lasted for several hours, despite scrubbing my wrists clean, until my suffering finally ended when I fell asleep at night.

For the love of god, don't blind buy this if you have asthma and/or allergies, and please don't overspray if you wear this to public places.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Well, this is the perfume which dominates. Strong, mature, sexy.

Patchouli and violets dictate the aroma most. Geranium makes the scent milder but with bergamot and pepper, the result is spicy and fresh.

I agree that this perfume is clean, however I don't like it's syntetic mark. For me, this scent creates very luxury and confident image but it's not autentical...

Sillage and longevity moderate. At nights it will be fatale and chic.",11/13/22 03:20,Shui-Xian

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"pretty, fresh and clean. Smells like a fresh clean shower. Definitely more feminine but since its such a clean scent it could work on anymore. The citrus isn't overpowering but very very gentle due to the powderyness and the floral notes sweeten it up slightly. Inoffensive. Definitely doesn't last long at all, id be shocked if I even got 30 minutes out of it tbh and it sits veryyy close to the skin. A good everyday intimate scent but definitely could be improved.",10/01/22 20:23,sweetlikecandie
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I got more of the floral and pink pepper notes. I didn't have to re-spray which was a good thing that it last throughout the day, I had to smell my clothes by the end of the day since it had faded a bit but I could still smell the perfume when the wind blew. Now that it is fall and temps have changed, this will be better to wear during cooler weather as it may be cloying in the heat.",09/23/22 08:38,Peaches&Cream
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"To me this fragrance is all lilac and little else. The sweetness balances out most of the green sharpness, but like most lilac fragrances it still retains something that I would describe as cold and slightly sharp. The other notes aren't prominent enough to change that and to me this remains a lilac soliflore first and foremost, so it's a note you have to get along with to love this fragrance. And I've found that I don't. I don't mind this on clothes or paper, but when it warms on the skin it initially turns a bit sour. This could be the mandarin orange, but it's not really distinguishable as an individual note, so it simply smells like sour lilac.

Overall I find that what this fragrance is truly guilty of is being lackluster. It's very simple and pretty generic. Somehow I've held on to my bottle, but I couldn't really tell you why honestly. Lilac is not a very youthful note to me, but at the same time a more mature wearer might want something a bit more elevated. This doesn't smell particularly refined, and the longevity isn't good either. So it's definitely not a fragrance I can recommend to someone, especially given that the price point is pretty high for a designer fragrance. I mean I guess it can be used for layering, but you could get a much higher quality fragrance for the same price from niche and independent houses.",09/18/22 06:30,scentine

Now? Oh, it’s lovely! I have no idea where these grandma/vintage comments are coming from. Are these days anything not strong on vanilla or gourmand notes people view as an old-smelling retro perfume? How boring 😜

Gucci Guilty opens a bit spicy, and that spiciness remains present in the dry-down as well. The florals here are simply divine! Had no idea I would enjoy lilac and violet combo this much. Yes, the perfume is kind of powdery, but it doesn’t bother me at all. General impression: clean, modern, quite elegant and unique.",07/20/22 02:50,yana.levus

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Lana Del Ray was the perfect ambassador for this. It's so unique like her but also perfect for the office. It's inoffensive, pretty but it also has the vibe ""I'm only tame if I want to be"" while at the same time subconsciously planting the idea ""she has to have money"" in the mind of whoever observes you as you pass by. It almost invokes a sense of mystery which is what I really like about it. The character is there.

The initial spray is consistent with the dry down with a well done Powdery lovely vibe intertwined with a violet rose. In the world where every woman seems to reach for Coco Mademoiselle this is quite unique while being very VERSATILE to wear in every environment you walk through from day to night. I recommend every woman to pair this with your favorite red lipstick.",05/16/22 08:39,haleykbhenry
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I like Gucci Guilty pour femme, it is a pretty violet make up bag scent. It's slightly fruity but not overly so. Pretty powdery violet (it's not sharp like violet leaf can be) Floral lilac of spring comes through. I like the fact that it is more floral than fruity and the patchouli in this one isn't overdone. It's slightly spicy from the pink pepper but again that isn't overdone either. Guilty pour femme is a nice spring violet/lilac powdery make up bag scent. I may have to get a small bottle at some point for my collection. I like Pour Femme better than the Intense and the Absolute. The Intense gave me a headache and is to fruity and the Absolute is to fruity as well, you don't get enough florals w/ those and I'm a floral girl. This Pour Femme is up my ally and I may have to add it to my collection. Nicely done Gucci.",04/19/22 13:06,LSAUG

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,Mmm this is super unique for a designer fragrance. I expected it to be girly and floral but it's much cooler. I can really smell the violet.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Violet just doesn't work on me. I'm trying to accept that. Something about this scent smells powdery in the worst possible way. *On me* the scent is one that reminds me of cheaply scented baby products. My nose picks up the warmth of the pink pepper and a bit of patchouli... and that's it! No citrus, no rose, no amber (so none of the notes that I love and really hoped to smell).",02/17/22 16:55,nickinicole
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Before trying, the notes of this of perfume sounded good but not too exciting. My first trial gave me again the same impression, good but not something very extraordinary. However this perfume has been somehow addicting for me. It is not too mature nor too girly. It is in the middle ground. It seems basic at first but gives me attractive woman vibes. It is hard to explain but this must be the definition of woman perfume. I'm imagining a succesful, confident and elegant woman in her late twenties or thirties wearing this. And also, I bought this as a rollerball to see If I will like this one and it has been a good discovery. So after it finishes, I will buy a full bottle.",02/10/22 11:35,BilgeD

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I remember reading about Lana’s Gucci Guilty campaign — she was originally considering her own line, but then got the offer from Gucci and went with that instead. I think this scent is absolutely beautiful and matches her vibe; no celebrity perfume could come close to this, so I’m glad she went this route. As a patchouli fanatic, I jumped on this as soon as I was aware of its existence. The top notes are quite common in perfumes these days, but the floral heart notes were very well-chosen for this blend. No jasmine or tuberose like everyone else seems to be doing. It seems fitting that Lana would be associated with a perfume containing violet, too, like it’s a nod to her poetry book. I love that. Rose and geranium are really lovely here, too. And the powdery nuances from the lilac note just works so beautifully, and I’m not usually a fan of powdery notes. This perfume is just so classy and gorgeous. I’m wearing it right now as I’m getting ready for a photo shoot and it just makes me feel like a sophisticated little fairy queen. I only have a travel rollerball currently (be warned, they don’t come 100% full… it’s closer to 75%), but I’ll be investing in a full bottle at some point. Great work with this one, Gucci.",01/29/22 10:25,fairycoffins
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I like floral as the main point and a little bit of everything else. This perfume meets all those requirements! This is my everyday scent that describes me the best.

Love it.",01/12/22 17:31,Ganyadnal
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This reminds me of the dry-down of Angel EDT (the older, comet version). They share pink pepper, bergamot, and patchouli.

Strong sour powderiness, borderline unisex. Longevity seems average at around 5-6 hours, though I would expect better from an EDP, especially at this price point. Projection is very good, it fills up a room.
Scent-wise, I think it's more interesting than the common offerings on the market at the moment. I think it's a bit too outgoing for an office or other professional settings, it could choke someone out in a closed space. It's more of an outdoors scent, maybe a date in the park or an open space event. Very chic, but I don't know if I can call it elegant. It has just that tiny bit of sass in it to make it quirky.

I would be very happy if someone gifted this to me, but considering I already have Angel EDT (the old, comet version), there's no need for me to buy it for myself. When I run out of Angel, though, I'll get it for sure as a replacement.",01/03/22 08:57,AlexandraTroush
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"To me this would make a perfect perfume for a bride. It's a delicate and romantic floral. I get well blended hints of lilac, violet and rose on a soft patchouli base. The dry down reminds me of a baby's skin scent.",12/20/21 07:29,pinkstate
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Love this. Its classy and sensual without being to heavy and mature. Works for all seasons but I personally view it as more of a fall/winter scent.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is the perfumiest perfume I have in my collection 🤣. Let me explain, this is a very aromatic, floral, heady scent. A tiny bit fresh and zingy because of the pink pepper, and bergamot opening. But other than that I really can't pull out any other notes from this scent. Altogether it's just what a department store, luxury perfume should smell like. Low key this reminds me of a more modern younger version of white diamonds. Which is what my mom used to wear back in the day when I was a child. So this has some scent memories attached, but it's still it's own scent. I actually like it, which is crazy because it isn't my type of scent profile at all. But it's great layered with other things in my collection. Gives me rich boss confident woman vibes. You literally smell like money with this one. High end, expensive, classy and good taste. This lasts forever so you're getting what you pay for. Definitely strong AF too. Can't really overspray with this one or it'll be too overpowering for yourself and the people around you. I think because its such an aromatic scent it could potentially be worn year round but as I am just wearing it this fall, I think of it as a fall perfume.

It smells very vaguely familiar, almost as if I have smelled it on someone else before, but it smelled better on them. Unfortunately, it does not play well with my nose and skin chemistry.

ETA: The more this fades, the better it smells. Too bad for most of its life on me, I don't like it :(",04/29/21 13:03,rachelsedge
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,Light and sparkling but also textured and sensual. Guilty opens fresh with a zesty citrusy burst like a combination of orange zest and patchouli. Starts to dry down to a cool floral and shifts to something a bit more sheer and watery. I get subtle hints of violet and and the texture starts to become powdery although I'd say it's a very light powder. I also get a sheer earthy aroma that smells a bit damp (though light and inoffensive) and there's something that smells woody about this as well which could be part of the amber I see listed as a base note. Overall it's a light fresh scent that expands to become a bit more powdery at heart and something I enjoyed getting wafts of as I wore it. Not mind-blowing or unique but also easy on the nose and inoffensive.,04/04/21 22:28,CurrencyThat
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Let me start by saying that till now I haven't found a single Gucci perfume that I liked, and this is no exception. Smells to me like bug spray mixed with a bit of baby powder. It just has this Guilty dna that I am not a fan of. Performance is good but I don't like it. I don't feel ""Guilty"" that I didn't buy it.",03/25/21 05:16,MrAbbas
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Having liked the unusual accords of the original Gucci Guilty, I was keen to compare it with this newer iteration, especially given the colourful retro-fabulous Lana Del Rey/Jared Leto ad campaign. However, this is a watered-down version, despite containing many of the original notes. Overall, this is less sweet and more green, but lacks depth.

After the alcoholic haze of the initial spray dies down, citrus and patchouli jump out at me. More tart bergamot than sweet orange, it has an earthy green, almost masculine quality. The geranium becomes more evident after half-an-hour or so, with a musky undertone. Violet and amber creep into the drydown but Guilty quickly fades to a powdery skin scent. Limited longevity and moderate sillage. Not a floral fragrance to me, could be unisex.

Fleetingly interesting, but ultimately disappointing. Passable, inoffensive day scent.
Guilty of insipidity. 2/5.",03/20/21 08:18,Enrium
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Very disappointed with this perfume.
I bought it after smelling a faux version on my Daughter, thinking how lovely it was.
The (expensive) reality is very different.
It's a nice smell initially, though probably a bit too musky for my liking, however, within an hour, it's faded to practically nothing on me!
All that's detectable is a very faint powdery smell - my family couldn't even tell I'd got any perfume on! It is like a very watered down EDT instead of the EDP it is supposed to be.
I was hoping this was going to be my new signature perfume for all occasions, instead, I have just wasted £50 😡",03/12/21 05:09,PeppaPig
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I’ve just realized that I have been owning this fragrance for longer than a year now, thanks to one of the most generous Fragranticans, Scarbo, and never got to review it.
I am wearing this on a way too warm early spring day, around 15+ degrees Celsius, sun shining and an overall uplifting, optimistic day.
And Guilty EDP sings beautifully on my skin, not too intrusive but not too close, loud enough for me to catch wafts of it when I walk or move. The scent is very soft (as in tender and graceful), but absolutely present and it’s as clear as spring water. I get slightly sweet, dewy flowers and plants with a crystalline quality. Almost a glassy / sheer perfume, somehow innocent because of the lack of sweetness and “fluff”, yet in no way simple or immature.
I see this fit for any lady, from young to mature, because it’s so classy and feminine that it cannot really clash with anyone, as long as it’s worn with grace, imo.
Performance is fine on me. I have sprayed it 3 hours ago and I still very much smell it (not up close from the skin, because I have sprayed it on my neck, therefore I’m pretty sure it creates a bubble around me).",03/03/21 05:36,Seducianne
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I smelled it in winter in Russia in 2019, as my friend was wearing it while we were in the Ural forest there walking for about 3-4 hours. The minute I smelled it on her it was like that smell I was searching for since I was a teen in Russia in 1983- or even earlier... I can't remember to be honest what year it was. I wore many other perfumes which reminded me in a certain way about that dreamy like a fairytale perfume. I put it back then in 1980-s on my fur around my neck as my classmate's mom had it in a tiny little bottle made in France, this packaging was so similar in style to Channel as my mom always had Chanel 5 at that time, but this wasn't it for sure nor Gucci. I went through many vintage pictures and even bought Chantilly although the packaging was very different again, the experts were saying this was it; not it wasn't unfortunately... From my memory, it was in a way similar maybe to Chantilly, but way better smell than both of them Chantilly and Chanel 5 ... Mind you back in 1970-s or 80-s Chanel was a lot different than these days. I bought Ch5 again for my mom just a couple of years ago, and I swear it just has a horrible heavy and irritating side to it. So, I am waiting now to get Gucci Guilty once I have a chance to smell it and buy it in the store here in NZ. I am an old fashioned and I only trust to buy my perfumes in stores.
This perfume was made to evoke my memories when I was a teen. Some compositions are just calling you and you can't get enough of them. Thanks, Gucci, you made my dreams come true.",01/31/21 18:21,lanaconstantinova
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"So.. my task today was to compare this and the old intense edp. I really love reading scrupulose reviews so I will try for somebody who is breaking the head about new and old before sniffing. When I sprayed it I was a little dissappointed about the new version - it's less loud and more rounded, maybe more mass pleasing, I usually like perfumes with character or I would say perfumes with characteristic smell. At the first 30 minutes, I would disagree with those who compared it with chloe love (RIP ;(, chloe was a thicker, a little bit darker, more powdery and dry. Also I cannot see masculine or vintage vibe, but it's also not candy cotton girly sugar water like many of the new perfumes. I would say it's interesting and really represents more modern version of guilty (not that I have issues with old one :D) . This got more and more interesting while I analized it. Like I said, at start I missed the punch and loudness, what makes guilty guilty. It feels like you take the idea of guilty, but dilute it with something greener, brighter and lighter. When I think about associations - old one is oilier, translucent liquid in gold tone, new one is like translucent pale green glass, sun shines through it and you can see bright yellow.. so the feeling is like the new one is a little cleaner, tidier, not so sweet, which I like. And if we compare guccy guilty girls - for original girl/woman a lot of happens in her life, she enjoys it and she likes to be everywhere. She is clever, likes culture venues, she also likes to have a good party with a lot of drinks and dances till morning, she goes to dates, foodie etc... quite vivid. The new one also has everything happening in her life, but she is thinking more in advance and she cares for herself, she makes it happen the way it's good for her. So a little bit calmer, more in harmony, maybe little more minimalistic and eats healthier..

For both perfumes I see no age limit.

After some hours 2019 version is less sticky and more powdery than intense version, fades gracefully. But if you overspray you can catch detergant vibe.

In the end I can say, that after a day I fell in love with new EDP more and more. I like that it wraps you in a soft airy, but not sugary and sticky cloud. I thought that I would miss original guilty's DNA, but after a while compared with new one it feels overwhelming in some way.

Guccy Guilty 2019 edp Its a little greener, airier and sunnier, less sweet, but has the same idea underneatg. It's more modern but in a good way. Longetivity is somewhat the same for both. :))",11/26/20 13:17,redhairfrag
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I came across this perfume at Sephora and remember falling in love with it immediately. After smelling several perfumes from the Gucci Bloom and Tom Ford ranges, I felt that Gucci Guilty pour femme stood out as feminine, light, powdery and elegant. In my opinion, this is the type of scent that does not perform like a typical perfume with monstrous sillage. Instead, it wears close to the body despite being long-lasting. At first spray, it is a sweet floral that quickly develops into a slightly spicy mildly fruity concoction. The dry down smells a little bit like baby powder, mild soapiness and of course, sweet florals. It is absolutely beautiful. This is a crowd pleasing scent that is appropriate for the workplace but also for date night. For this reason, I think Gucci Guilty Pour Femme could easily be adopted as a signature scent that is elegant and timeless. Needless to say, I purchased this fragrance immediately.",11/23/20 13:03,Cristinaaa
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I have to be honest and say that I actually prefer this one over the original Gucci Guilty. Maybe it's because I love powdery floral scents. I love the manderin and red pepper opening followed by sweet violets and lilac. It's classy and has a vintage vibe which makes me feel nostalgic. My girlfiend loves this scent which is another pro. To be fair I did expect something more 'Guilty', but i like this nevertheless.",10/21/20 15:17,emma__lisa
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Smelled it today at Gucci counter, it reminded me about Chloe Love - a nice powdery scent was discontinued by Coty.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Lilac powdwery, wet/dry pressed compact face powder. Reminiscent of an old world. Some may even say it is old like perfume - something sitting on an old style dresser. I dont care, i like it. But dont expect a bomb.
Either way, it is nude like - And it has a kind of musky soft spicy nude allure, (keep thinking lilac too). Its not an overtly ""sexy"" perfume. Its more like - im nude so come in closer and smell the sweet spice of my skin.
Sadly, I find it performs well on a card and not so much on my skin - its like its kind of there but not ?
Perhaps it is one of those invisible under the radar penetrators, that softly projects..

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"With the exception of Delina Exclusif this is my favourite perfume that has come on the market in the last few years.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This signora is an underrated beauty. GGPF has some of the original Guilty DNA, but this flat passport-like bottle takes you on a fresh journey through the collection. Along with shades of lilac and violet, I also detect some heliotrope and almond nuances (similar to the texture found in Alien), powdery softness and clean soapy musk. A little sweet mandarin offers sparkle to the warm base.

It's light, elegant and clean. If being addicted to this scent is wrong, then I'm Guilty!",07/01/20 10:45,Tigerlillian
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I really love the Guilty EDP. I never really tried the earlier EDT so I can't compare, but this has a nice opening that is bright but not too citrusy. The main notes aren't necessarily clear on paper but this is not A Rose Perfume with some backup singers, it's a floral perfume that might have some rose in it, which I really appreciate. It's a really nice blend. I'm not sure I actually know what geranium alone smells like but I think I like it. It doesn't have a distinctive lilac like a soliflore but you can tell it's in there. The drydown is a really nice warm, sweetish patchouli that lingers a long time on my skin. It wears really well all fall/winter/spring so far, feels beautiful, and is a nice alternative to powerhouse white flowers or pure rose for when you still want a floral not fruity or tea or musk.",06/12/20 11:33,kml24

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I just have to admit that I’m just so into this fragrance. It’s so creamy, musky, light lilac floral with an elegance to it. It’s clean, fresh, and subtle which I like sometimes and over the top other times. It’s not overly floral but I love how rich but creamy this is. It’s warm and effortlessly sensual. I love it. Lilac can be intense but this isn’t at all. I have this and the Edt and they smell almost identical. I prefer the Edp because it lasts longer and is a little bit stronger but it still smells just like the Edt. It’s so good I can’t stop smelling it. It’s very office or anywhere friendly and it would make a great signature fragrance.",04/17/20 10:26,Rosemary14
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This starts off on me very fresh and sweet and then turns into something that smells like expensive soap. I'm not usually a fan of soapy perfumes but this is the right kind of soapy. I don't know what it is about this perfume but I just can't get enough of it. Wearing it I suddenly see myself in a whole different way. I feel confident, sophisticated, sexy even. I honestly have no idea why people are saying it's masculine. On me it feels feminine and then some. It isn't the strongest perfume but it's adequate in that respect. Usually I have to spray twice if I want it to last all day. Seems to cling to clothes for ages though. Sex in a bottle. I'm definitely buying it.",04/03/20 16:51,pip41uk

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Elegant, creamy-powdery and classy. The nuances differ with temperature, as a reviewer below already has mentioned.
Winter test: sparkling, but elegant beginning (mandarin, bergamotte), distinct flowers and soapy woody (Patchouli)musky drydown. I think that part may seem a bit masculine to some; for me it seems just classic and mature (the good kind of being mature).
Spring test: yummy sweet mandarin opening, mingled with lilac and sweet violets, bit candy like due to a more enveloping and warmer ambernote. Not so much Patchouli, stronger and longer lasting heartnotes.
Both experiences: an updated, even upgrated version of the original.
Personal taste: I like the less sweet experience in winter more, but the springtime sensation is also alluring.
My final vote: underrated.",02/08/20 01:13,Astara_Elaria
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is a really lovely scent, if you like makeup, powdery type smells you'll probably like this, this isnt the standard makeup scent but it gives me the same sort of vibe. Very soft violet, lilac rose powdery scent with a twist - it's got a slight warmth to it and at times it smells like sweets...I cant put my finger on which ones persay but like a gummy sweet, however it isnt juvenile, this is one classy mama and a great mix of modern and vintage, this is extremely feminine. The only negative about this scent is if I wear it too much it doesnt smell the same and I lose interest in it, it kind of becomes very nondescript, but then if I stop wearing it for a while and then wear it again it smells just as beautiful as it did with the first few wears, it's really wierd, I've never had a perfume that does this...either way its beautiful",01/29/20 12:35,Vikki1985
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The description 'dirty floral' makes most sense to me, because the florals are there, but somehow distorted. I love the scent of lilac so much, but this is more like a lilac bush trapped under a thick layer of dry bergamot and powdery violets.

My boyfriend said it's too sweet, but it's not to my nose.. quite the opposite, just very dark, maybe bittersweet? So the sample I got left me a little indecisive. I don't hate it and I understand why many people may love it, I guess this just isn't for me.",12/22/19 20:59,catmeow

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Wore a tester for the past week. On the one hand, this smells v. good - it is pleasant, rich, it smells expensive and it has presence without being obnoxious. This is what made me love it at first. On the other hand, it doesn't smell really original or specific to me now that I've worn it for a longer period. It is not quite generic but it does smells a bit like a perfume store, it smells like the idea of perfume. In the very best way possible, don't get me wrong, but still; Gucci Guilty doesn't seem to have a very strong identity to me. Nevertheless charming, and I find the advertising for this absolutely delicious. May still purchase a small bottle if I ever come across a good deal.

01/21 I still think it's not super interesting but I love it anyway! The lilac is delightful, warm and elegant. Sometimes you need a scent like that, and I think I wear this one well. Bought 30 ml today.",10/28/19 04:01,s.pellegrino

Tested it on the counter this afternoon. 1 spray on my arm, and until now, 6hours and a bath later, I can still smell it (though it's now faint since I took a bath) the opening is the same to me however the dry down is much deeper (maybe even to deep so I think 1 to 2 sprays is enough) Sillage is soft for 1 spray but as long as I can smell it on myself, I'm good.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"One of these things is not like the other one.....

The edp in the ‘absolu like’ bottle, is not like the guilty edt in the rounded squared bottle.

This starts bright floral, white floral but .. bright, it’s a touch dirty like the other edt, but only slightly, this has stems in it with the flowers without being green. Plus a little like the smell if you nick the skin of an orange thrown in too.
This isn’t strong, I suppose i it catches your clothes it will last a bit longer. I had an hour now it’s a skin scent. This is like the dry version of guilty and without the Smokey dirty white floral feel.

This is not an amped up version of the edt, this is a different scent, with a different feel. Why Gucci? Stop messing around.
I should say that I do like the fragrance, and it’s the wee purple flowers that make the dryness. I’ve just washed my hands with some warm water and it’s made this pop out a bit more, I love the layer of smell under the dry layer. But I still want to point out to people that this is not the same as the edt the shop assistant said it was the edp version, pretty much the same scent, I don’t think so",05/07/19 17:02,dglightblue

It has a nice powdery touch & a scent you'll enjoy catching subtle wafts of. All in all really nice scent I enjoyed the original & this was no exception.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Sniffing this fragrance was a milestone for me. For one, it reminded me of the first perfume I ever fell in love with - Bvlgari BLV, minus the sharp, throat-tickling ginger notes. Second, I've only just got back into collecting perfume and was so puzzled as to why some fragrances, especially florals, just make me nauseous and give me a headache. But after testing this and falling in love with it, (alongside a glorious shopping experience at the Gucci counter of a department store in Singapore), I came to understand that I can't deal with white florals, only purple ones. It's a real revelation for me! I adore this scent. It's not utterly feminine, there is a hint of something unisex there that makes it all the more lovely for me. It sprays out strong and loud but settles onto skin pretty nicely after a half hour. Longevity is not fantastic, I must admit, but it performs well in hot weather and I can use it in the day. My curiosity has been piqued and I will explore all the other fragrances in the Guilty line.",03/14/19 18:21,Shinder13

I think it is appropriate for all occasions, maybe even for a date. It has something to it that i can not describe. It isn’t sexy, but it somehow alluring. Could easily be someone’s signature.
It projects softly for the first minutes and then turns into a skin scent. Longevity is 3 hours and counting.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This should be right up my alley, but weirdly it’s not. In fact it’s so nondescript, I don’t even know how to begin describing it. Okay, so it starts as a powdery floral (lilac+violet), but only for the first half an hour; then it turns herbal and sweet-ambery, courtesy of orange, patchouli and amber. I feel that the scent is not given enough time to develop before this cloying sugared patchouli takes over. It reminds me of Ayurveda by Tesori d’Oriente - a scent that costs 5€...

Creamy and powdery... Long lasting.

Want it to pop? Layer it with the men's Gucci guilty pour homme (original)

I do believe this is replacing the previous guilty range for women, as an updated, more current fragrance.

Delicious and I'm a massive fan.

I also wanted to have this new baby for its own reasons,like great bottle, Gucci house, cool advertisement etc. But it didn't happen. The smell itself, although quite nice at the beginning, later turns up on me into sharp lilac mixed with some soap notes. Don't get me wrong. I do love soap, clean feeling in perfumes. If I didn't I wouldn't be a fan of Chloe Love Florale in the first place. But here the soap is unbearable to me. Too much of everything.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"First, let's take a second to appreciate the gorgeousness of the bottle!!! the bottle even looks better in reality,, packing:10/10.

The scent: it's indeed comparable to Gucci guilty intense, but more powdery; comparing it with Gucci guilty Absolute
they have nothing to share at all!!

The first stage: lilac and pink pepper, in the dry down the scent becomes more powdery and musky, even though musk is not included in the notes, I guess I get this feeling from the patchouli; for amber I can't feel it at all, the bergamot I can get a hint of it when the scent dries down, but I guess what really gives the scent that crispy feeling is the mandarin orange that shows up very well and adds a very pleasant twist, preventing the scent from being so powdery which might irritate some people!

All in all, I would classify the scent as a powdery sweet with a crispy edge; I find it classy and modern, and suits women +25.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I’m personally glad they have bought back the edp of Guilty, I was never a fan of the original edt’s in either the women’s or the men’s... I found them a bit bland and ineffectual as wearable fragrances, both requiring heavy use and re-application throughout the day as they were so light.
This(and i’m assuming it is the original edp formula) has extra body and although still a delicate feminine breeze of a fragrance, will linger through the day in a much more respectable manner.
Well worth switching up to if you are still attached to the original edt.


Regarding the packaging change, I hope this means they may just discontinue the original edt. I don’t find the re-packaging confusing as it makes more sense to unify the range under one recognisable bottle especially as the original edt women’s is virtually alienated by the introduction of the Absolute range.",01/14/19 09:44,MeThePerson
Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Ok, so I finally got to sample this today. First off, it's definitely an amplified version of the original Guilty, which isn't a bad thing.

The orange is very intense to me and stays even throughout the dry down. The patchouli, lilac and amber are stronger in this composition as well, giving it an almost boozy quality. The bergamot and geranium are barely noticeable to my nose and I get slight pink pepper nuances.

Overall, I think I like this one better than the original Guilty; it's much longer lasting on me vs the EDT. Good job on the EDP, Gucci!",01/12/19 20:32,Whit

It’s a lavender that I, as a non lover of that note, will probably wear from my tester for fun and memories sake, because it does not last more than an hour (at a push).

OMG, is this the best synthetic floral scent ever?? I mean, i did not like original Rush, even thoygh it was my best freind's sugnature and i quickly dismissed Rush2 as something not original or outstanding when it was released (maybe i just did not like the cheaply looking packaging?), but i recently acquired a bottle of it and i am testing it and im in love. It is nothing like original Rush, i do not smell any similarities, apart of same synthtic feel. I love tuberose, i love lily, they are here, but not your typical heady tuberose, this is mostly fresh lily, not cloying at all. Opening is fresh, flowery, syntheticly nice. It is still not the most original or outstanding, but it is really-really nice!! I say that sadly lasting power is not the best, almost 3hrs on my cold skin, and of what most magical part only ladts for about an hour. Yet it is refreshing, young, simple and seductive.

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"This reminds me of that ""Valérian et la Cité des mille planètes"" scene (the only scene from the movie which I remember) where the two main characters are bickering on the beach over a cocktail and then later it turns out that the beach was just a simulation projected over walls of a sterile white room. Of palm trees planted in corridors of malls' luxury sections. Spreading a towel to suntan on Dubai's coast with oil rigs before you and unfinished skyscrapers behind.

I was once caught by a downpour in a middle of a walk through Singapore's National Orchid garden, waiting for the rain to end in one of its white-glass greenhouses -- Rush 2 makes me think of that. It's cooling, green, behaves well in humidity. For some reason it doesn't remind me of air refreshers as 2000s aquatics usually do. Is it the bitterness? Lack of citruses? Whatever it is, other aquatics don't really inspire me, but I would love to spend a season somewhere like Taipei or Sydney or any other warm seaside metropolis with pair of vintage Dior ski-mask sunglasses and a 75 ml bottle of Rush 2.

Rush 2 is reminiscent of OG Gucci Rush as it had inherited its predecessor's unashamed artificiality, that light sweetness of cheap plastic but it is very different in its mood. Rush (an eternal love of mine) is pointedly pessimistic, stuck in a melancholy it doesn't want to be taken out of. It sits alone on a tiled floor of a bathroom in one of those abandoned industrial buildings turned night clubs, gone a little mad, mumbling Baudelaire to itself as people step over its legs: l'Espoir, Vaincu, pleure...

Rush 2? For some reason the start of R2 clicks play on the Azealia Banks' ""Count Contessa"" in my head. R2 is more like: ""The world is ending? Okay, fine, whatever. Bring out your swimsuit skin, we are switching the server's ambiance to Fiji.""",04/19/24 07:19,balleflat

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"This was a recent blind buy, I found a 30ml in TKMaxx for £30. I had already read reviews for it, so was fairly sure I would like it. I don’t know what age this bottle is, but it smells nothing like the descriptions here. It has a very bitter pungency to it, like a dominant black currant or tomato leaf note (but very harsh & crude). I usually like bitter, but here it’s combined with a sort of burnt plastic smell. It actually smells really unpleasant to me. I would describe it as fruity only - because I can’t detect any floral notes at all. It did remind me of Kenzo Le Monde Est Beau - but comparing the 2, the Kenzo is way more nuanced, & 100x better imo. Quite honestly, sniffing them both side by side & Rush2 smells like utter crap. Odd considering the ridiculous prices this perfume sells for now. Also, it dried down to practically no smell at all after a few hours..a very faint musk.

Don’t know if this just my odd perception, or if this bottle is old & spoilt - or if it’s been badly reformulated at some point, prior to being discontinued. I can’t be doing with checking & obsessing over batch codes & all that stuff, so I don’t know. For anyone missing this perfume I recommended just get yourself a bottle of Kenzo Le Monde Est Beau & you will have a similar, but (I think) better perfume!",07/06/22 02:02,indigo

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"I have just written my impression on the GR 1. I was so afraid to smell the GR 2. If you know the flankers, you know they usually change few notes, but it is still the same DNA.

LUCKILY, not with this one. While I have a bit repulsive relationship with the 1, 2 was love at first sniff. Aaaand.... I am going against the crowd again 😁

Repeatedly I am shocked at the reviews. GR is certainly NOT the younger sister of GR 1. On the contrary. They are not even at one family. To me, this is completely different fragrance. The notes are blended seamlessly. Yes, I smell berries, but not in a juvenile, teenagery, simplistic way, like perfumes in a drugstore 👎They are deep, dark, mature and have a distinct elegant undertone. I can smell a note that I can't name, which reminds me of those very sophisticated perfumes from my childhood. Somewhere around the 80-s. It brings me happy memories. I think my Mum used to smell like that note - maybe it was the formulation of her face creams. And I haven't smelled that note since then. (Sidenote: I do not understand why has perfumery changed so much. Those scents in the 80-s were so good!)

Well, this is another great example that notes do not give you much clue. Go and sniff it for yourself. And no offence to Fragrantica reviewers, but you can discover that you can totally rely only on your own nose. Because you can be like me, the White Raven😉",09/30/21 12:23,sisina96rv
Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"In the beginning, Rush 2 left me with one strong impression: ""watery berry"". What makes it special is, that while it has the full body of the berry notes, it comes without much of the sweetness one would expect. Rather, in its early-to-mid stages, Rush 2 reminds me of shampoo and wearing it makes one smell freshly showered.

The palm tree / narcissus notes come out early and lend just a hint of air and bitterness to the composition. This bitter stage lasts for roughly 1h 30 minutes. After that you get a more linear berry-scent with the black currant beginning to shine. This stage, with the black currant notes getting stronger and stronger also marks the final stage of the fragrance, which alone lasts more than six hours on my skin.

During this last hours, I do not get any hints of ""dark"" materials such as the oakmoss. Rather than that, it is just the berry notes that are gaining intensity, while some of the watery aspects tone down. By the time Rush 2 disappears around 8 hours after the application, it is pretty much a straight berry fragrance.

In the beginning, Rush 2 has moderate sillage, but becomes a skin scent from hour 3 onwards. Here I would like to add that, although the original Rush is the overall louder fragrance, from the moment both become skin scents, Rush 2 is more strong and stable than the original.

As for my verdict, I would like to say that the emotion Rush 2 evokes in me mainly is nostalgia.

This fragrance so much smells like most girls in the late 1990s / early 2000s smelled like. There was a time, when everything was berry-flavoured. Yves Rocher berry-scented shower gel and body lotion that were popular in those days also come to my mind. Young girls nowadays probably use other products, but to me this is the fragrance profile that I will always connect to this age group.

That being said, I find Rush 2 to be a very pleasant fragrance and personally prefer it over its predecessor. While it does smell less expensive than it is, it is still a very nice representative of the berry genre.

Rush 2 surely can be recommended to girls in their teens and twens, but probably even more so to older ones who have experienced the late 1990s/ early 2000s and want some nostalgia. If you want to bring some memories back, fetch a bottle while you can.

TL;DR: regal early 2000s watery berry, not sweet.",07/24/21 15:29,Eribert

Rush had a prominent citrus note which was very sexy. It was kind of fizzy, I guess. I liked it a lot and I think it is a pity it has been discontinued.

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"I love Rush and it’s one of my signatures so of course I was curious about this one but they are totally different. The one thing they have going for them that’s similar is that plastic vibe they both share. Rush 2 is very clean, kinda reminds me of a floral laundry detergent with a dash of hairspray. I didn't get the black currant or oakmoss just the soft white florals with a little rose and that palm leaf. It’s not a bad scent but it’s pretty boring tbh. It’s the complete opposite of Rush which is fruity, earthy, synthetic and spicy. It’s still got a unique edge to it but longevity and projection on this one was not the best. Both fragrances layered together make quite a unique scent I will say but ultimately ended up giving my bottle to my mom and she loved it.",05/24/21 14:09,Andre4242
Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"I have a supply of original Rush2 from circa 2001. Quite simply, this is a cleaner and fresher version of original Rush (of which I also have a supply from 1999). Somehow it seems fruitier than the single inclusion of black currents suggests. Curious how dissimilar compositions seem so obviously related; but in the case of these two they do. Because I'm commenting on original Rush2 all I can say is this is an absolutely gorgeous versatile perfume. The black currents are juicy. The florals are sweet. Not sure what 'palm' smells of, but there is a green aspect. Can't say I notice musk or oakmoss, which suggests they've combined cleverly with everything else.

Both Rush2 and the original Rush last all day on me. Despite the eccentric packaging (to which I am indifferent) Rush2 is high quality fragrance in the original versions. An era when Gucci really shone. 🇮🇹",05/18/21 06:36,Pamilo

I remember, being an early teen when this came out and to me it is the scent of girly magazines, lipgloss, platform shoes and so on. For the scent itself, I think this is a pretty floral, almost showergel-like. The freesia is most prominent to me. Some green accord, I guess it is the palm tree, comes out also as a rather fort green impression, bamboo-like.

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"I first wore this perfume back in 2003 and immediately fell in love. I had never been so drawn to a perfume before. It is perfect. I wish I could describe it better in words but it's one of those fragrances that doesnt have one major note that sticks out, at least to me. At first spray and for several hours later it smells the same, and then it wears off to a light musk. To me there is something watery about the scent, like freshly watered leaves and flowers. I don't get the black currant at all. I mainly sense a presence of palm and narcissus. There is nothing sweet about this fragrance, it is fresh but not in a citrus way, and floral, but not in the typical sense of floral. It's like I said, watery floral. It is just divine. I want to buy multiple backups so that I know I will always have this. It is such a unique fragrance, and every time I catch whiffs of it throughout the day, it just makes me love it all over again. I would say it is more of a spring/summer day time scent for everyday.",06/09/19 21:10,shaeri87

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"I really can't recall how I acquired this, but I was jolly glad I did. Once the scent has virtually expired, mine came with body lotion, sweet, long-lasting and saucy: it quite converted me to this method of wearing fragrance. True, it wasn't the longest lasting scent but the body rub had animal undertones and seemed to have more staying power.

I quite liked the idea of the oblong kitschy shocking pink bottle, but dang it was hard to get the last little bit out.

For a while I did the two-step with Gucci Rush 2 one night, then Dior Addict the next. Dior Addict won, needless to say. My, but I was a busy girl. It was trollop-ey, imagine Anita Ekberg wearing a tightly corseted off-the-shoulder number with carmine lipstick on.

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"I used to be part of the crowd who thought Rush 2 bore no resemblance whatsoever to the original Gucci Rush. But now that I have worn both within a few days of each other, I have changed my mind. They ARE sisters! First of all, they have the same father, Michel Almairac. They were born a mere two years apart from each other and therefore part of the same ""perfume trend generation"". Like sisters who are close to one another, they are able to play together and layer well with each other. While original Gucci Rush is the louder, bossier, dominant older sister, Rush 2 tries to emulate her in certain ways. In Rush 2, the fruity aspect of Rush's peach is replaced by a sweet juicy black currant note. The original had a strong gardenia note, while Rush 2 has gardenia but it rests shyly in the background, preferring to let cleaner flowers like freesia and lily of the valley do the talking. The original is the bad ass of the clan, sneaking out late to party while Rush 2 stays home and studies but lets the original sneak back in through her window because after all, they are close and she likes to live vicariously through the stories Rush brings home. Rush 2 is the daughter grandma likes better but original Rush is the one who will go on to be famous.",08/15/18 06:31,stacia79

the rose and gardenia don't kick in until after the dry down, and i associate the hint of sweetness from the lily of the valley-it almost borders on too much-but manages to stay light-almost green-due to the palm tree, i am assuming.....
i only need one spritz-more than that is too sweet, and too much floral....and too invasive to other people....

I probably liked the pink bottle and I tend to like Gucci fashion.

Tried it for the first time, today.

It's not unpleasant, but one spray of this is almost imperceptible, on me.

At first, at least...

My current handwash leaves a stronger scent, even after it has been thoroughly washed off!

After a few minutes, it has got slightly more noticeable, however; but, it's also become slightly soapy (appropriately enough).

It's not bad, but I prefer something a bit (no, a lot) more rich, complex and intense.

About the scent, I find this so be so spring-like and charming. Beautiful, bright and fresh freesias, lightly spritzed with water, with a tinge of green from the palm leaf and anchored by that woody-musk base. Something slightly creamy often appears on my skin at times, too. I love how this is never too sharp or overpowering, which makes this effortlessly chic to wear at anytime and anywhere.

I plan on making this fragrance my next signature as this fragrance is also very hard to find in my country so I will smell unique (as I am truly a unique person!).
Edit: I managed to score a small bottle of this at tkmaxx for about 27% of the retail price and the scent exceeded my expectations! I kept having to smell my shirt after I had sprayed this 3 times!

Now, this is A PERFUME!!! Amazing! It looks so simple when you examine the ingredients- put yellow, green and white flowers together and you get a miracle. It's as if a florist made a perfume inspired by a spring bouquet.
It's got absolutely everything - freshness, energy, heavy sillage, sweetness...and that mysterious element that can be best described by - ""I don't know what they put inside it but it smells gorgeous!""
It's definitely the fragrance that most people, even strangers, asked me about.
The top notes are combined beautifully - lily of the valley doesn't always behave well in a huge crowd of scents but , in this case, it's blended absolutely perfectly with rose water and fresia. Fresia keeps the energy of the other two scents together and calms them down. After the first shock, you become overwhelmed by ""oh-so-amazing"" cloud of white flowers.

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"The original Rush is possibly one of my favorite compositions of all time, and I was dying to see what a flanker would be like. I was excited to see that the note pyramid for Rush 2 features gardenia and narcissus, which are two of my favorite floral notes. Unfortunately, now that I've tested the scent, I'm left disappointed. It's a very nondescript green floral. Lily and palm leaf are pretty much all I perceive. There's really not much else to it. Rush 2 is mildly soapy and smells very ""thin"" and watery. It's incredibly safe, bland, and inoffensive, especially when compared against the original Rush. In fact there is so little tying these two fragrances together that it's very misleading for them to even have the same name and bottle.

If you don't mind the simplistic composition and the very soft sillage, this could be a perfectly appropriate fragrance for office/daytime use. But Rush 2 is not something that I would ever be excited to wear.",05/28/14 08:54,Yurpdod

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"This is the smell of springtime to me. I've wanted this fragrance for ages now, but have been unable to find it for a decent and worthy price.

The freesia is my favorite flower, and finding a dominant freesia in an accessible fragrance is too hard...so it only made sense to try this one. I was especially okay with dropping $60 on a blind buy of the 1.7 ounce, when reading that narcissus is also a note. WIth two of my favorite flowers in one fragrance, I figured I couldn't go wrong.

It's very light, fresh, clean, and slightly powdery. It smells exactly like freesias to me, but I don't get so much daffodil. I get the fresh, clean flower accord of freesia and lily-of-the-valley, then there's the complex, dark tropical fruitiness from the blackcurrant and the palm tree.

It's very airy, and it's the scent equivalent of the color silver. It reminds me a lot of this tiny bottle of freesia oil that I have...but the oil is very cheap and low quality, even though it smells just like freesias. This fragrance is freesia-done-right.

It was definitely a great blind buy. I could see this being a great everyday perfume for dry, crisp winter days and fair upper-60's/low-70's spring days. It's definitely not alluring and dominant enough to be used as an evening fragrance, but that doesn't mean it's not beautiful at all.",11/22/13 22:37,asher.jessie

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"A few weeks ago, I met a woman who smelled so wonderfully I actually asked what perfume she was wearing - and I've never done so. She said, ""Gucci Rush 2"". I'd never heard of it, so began looking..only to find it was discontinued. I found it at an online perfume distributor, and eagerly placed an order for the 1 ounce/30ml size. It arrived packaged very well with samples, and coupons too, so I was pleased with this company. I opened the box, and still skeptical of an online purchase of a discontinued perfume, I examined my ""box"" of Gucci Rush 2 carefully for any sign of it being a fake, or tampered with. There was nothing out of order. The writing on the plastic sleeve stated Made in France. There was a bit in English, and possibly Arabic? I also learned here that if a perfume has been used before, it will likely spray fragrance on the first pump, whereas if never used, it will need a second attempt to spray. Thank you fellow reviewers for this piece of information! Mine did need a second pump, so I was confident it was new, and authentic. Then, I sprayed my wrist.

I am totally bewildered by this scent. It may have for a nanosecond resembled something about the woman who smelled so wonderful, but on me it smelled more like acetone nail polish remover! I am wondering if Rush 2 is one of those mysterious scents that meshes with one's body chemistry in a very specific way...similar to the genetic variances among people who either love or despise the herb cilantro, with nothing in between.

I would love to smell this fragrance again on the woman who wore it so well, but on me it brought to mind the scent of a newly unwrapped plastic doll.
~sigh~
Update - I received a thoughtful private message from another member here who suggested I try purchasing another bottle from a different distributor because it was possible my bottle had gone bad. Well...I must say this was true because I adore my new bottle of Rush 2! While it does require frequent touch ups throughout the day, I derive a joyful burst of energy with each reapplication. I am relieved to know my first experience with Rush 2 wasn't a personal chemistry issue, but due to an ""off"" bottle. People compliment me every time I wear it!",06/29/13 16:44,DeeDee2

The main thing I smell is Gardenia, the sweet, dense, creamy, almost waxy white flower. There are also some sweet berry-vanilla mixture blended in there, creates a very happy and girly smell. This facet of Rush II reminds me of Valentina by Valentino and Escada Magnetism.

The scent dries down with the sweetened gardenia and hot musk.

It really hits me that Rush II smells exactly, I mean SPOT ON like L'oreal hair mask (moisture repair, yellow tub) that I used for years.

Overall Gucci Rush II is warm, inviting, alluring and quite sensual. The smell is not sharp but distinct. I think it would work brilliantly in cold or hot weather, particularly suited for a dinner date or other cozy occasions.",07/24/12 00:15,CatBlanc

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"During my high school years, this was a scent I swore by. It was the perfect thing for day, night, school, dates,... Everything my little heart desired. But as I grew older, I discovered more and more perfumes and Rush 2 simply got left behind in my explorations.

Rush 2 scent is somewhat cute. Very floral like almost every Gucci perfume. It is not THAT commercial as some latest releases from this house (such as Guilty) but again, I've never encountered someone who disliked it. There is that fleeting scent of alcohol when you first spray it on but it never bothered me. However, the lasting power of this one is unfortunately horrible. It just disappears. Without a trace. Luckily, square bottle which reminds me of cassette case is practical for carrying around in your purse so you can put it on whenever you want.

All in all, Rush 2 is a very sentimental perfume for me. I still own a bottle and put it on every now and then when I am feeling nostalgic. But it is not my favorite anymore. Far from it.",09/26/11 02:08,penny-lane

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"I got this a few years ago, and I still have it, even though it's not wearable anymore. To me it smells like a mixture of a floral and a fruity smell, and t is very summery and fresh. It's not my favorite, but it's not bad either.",07/21/11 09:17,nadalinica
Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"The first time I purchased Rush 2 was primarily because I loved the packaging. It can be conveniently dumped into and grabbed from a handbag without any thought as to the possibility of it breaking. As one who frequently freshens up, I also found the scent perfect. The scent is unmistakably feminine and sensual, but at the same time unique and subtle.

I do detect rose the most with Rush 2. On my skin it smells like I have just stepped out of a tub of spring water and rose petals. Fresh, yet ironically poetic---the scent invokes memories or conjures feelings of ""what ifs"", which evolve into sensual, desperate longing demanding immediate satisfaction---true to the name ""Rush"".

While the strength of the ""rush"" dissipates as quickly as the longing is subdued, the drydown is like that perfect moment whose memory never fades which you keep trying to replay in your mind long after.",07/15/11 08:37,h3lov3sm3

I was surprised that I actually liked Gucci Rush 2 and ended up buying it. Somehow I did finish the whole bottle (box?)

Anyway it is very versatile, clean and you can wear it all year round and it never becomes cloying. The green heart notes give it such a refreshing, cool feeling that even in the summer it stays fresh and crisp.

It became more pleasant and lighter after a few hours, but still not enough for me to like it.",04/06/10 07:22,Annah7
Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"Rush 2 is hardly related to Rush at all. This is an entirely different composition altogether.

Upon first application, I could barely smell it. The opening notes are extremely subtle and intimate. I would describe the rose, freesia and lily of the valley as having a soapy and fresh-like quality.

With the emergence of the heart, Rush 2 develops character. The scent strengthens considerably and shows elements of originality. The soapiness is still present, however I detect a subtle greeness, like a tropical, damp garden smell.

Rush 2 concludes with a simplistic black currant and musk blend, with this being the only fruity kick you will experience during the development of Rush 2, right at the very end.

I vividly remember a man that owned a perfume store where I used to live, raving on about Rush 2. He had me try it several times but I had to go back to this fragrance 3 years on because the scent hadn't stuck in my memory. Because of that I don't think this fragrance is very memorable, certainly not signature material in my humble opinion.",02/14/10 00:40,missk

Gucci Rush 2 Gucci,"GUCCI RUSH 2 is nearly the strict antithesis of GUCCI RUSH. RUSH 2 is cool, slightly soapy, lightly floral, not at all sweet, and rather shortlived in the edt.

The somewhat dark, lingering oriental thickness of RUSH (imparted by mingling patchouli and vanilla) is not present in RUSH 2 at all. Rather, RUSH 2 is a tiny bunch of little white flowers on a cool morning with dew still clinging to kelly green blades of grass.

It's almost as though the Gucci people self-consciously sought to produce a fragrance that would appeal to all those who disliked RUSH. A better name for RUSH 2 might be:

the perfume inside...
hmm,there's nothing about ""rush"",it's a girlish floral perfume with lots of lily of the valley.maybe the pure floral mixture makes it a bit(just a bit)soapy,but I also recognize some fruity notes,that i guess it's black currant.
this is a very young fragrance for people who don't like much citrus in their perfume.it doesn't smell sweet,juicy or bitter,all about flowers.it's not annoying at all.so it can be wore at any occasion.

It is probably the most realistic mimosa you get out there. Very clean. Very luxurious. I find it very feminine, fragile, innocent. Sadly it does not have a strong projection. For this price tag I would expect more ""work"". As always, the bottle is gorgeous and elegant. Not for a hot, beach vacation day. Keep it for cooler and drier environment.

Winter's Spring Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This smells just like a mimosa flower in full-bloom on a summer's day! It's so beautiful and cheerful and it's a strongly yellow floral and decently sweet and slightly powdery and musky fragrance, just like the intoxicating scent from these little yellow puffs of joy. I can smell the slight honeyed almond smell that mimosas/acacia/wattle flowers have too in here.

It's a lovely and linear day fragrance that can be worn in spring or summer and is very feminine and unique, but at the same time I think it's office appropriate and it wouldn't offend anyone.

It's slightly expensive for what it is, but it does smell lovely and its bottle with the sweet little squirrel on the front is beautiful. I'll definitely buy this some time soon! I've been really hankering for a nice and realistic mimosa-dominant scent, considering that that's so rare unfortunately in perfumery.

It's so much nicer than the awful and unrealistic smelling Love Mimosa by Amouage...",01/28/23 18:47,WhiteFlowerPrincess
Winter's Spring Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is the one I was looking for. I've always wanted a soft mimosa with a bit of creamy, powdery touch and this is it.
I think the aesthetic of this perfume is extremely beautiful, combining the name, bottle and the fragrance into one.
It opens up a bit watery, almost smelling like a sweet wet paper. The pepper in the note doesn't really stand out but exaggerates the wateriness of the perfume. The wateriness reminds me of the frost on the mimosa, which is said to be the first flower that blooms in spring.
After the frost is melted, the real spring comes. Powdery, delicate, beautiful mimosa comes with creamy musk, blending perfectly with skin. It's bright spring but not overly bright. Rather, it's delicate, a bit still cold from winter.
I admit that this is a soft skin scent. The projectivity is poor compared to its price.
But still, it's one of the most gorgeous scent I've ever smelled and if you like a soft and creamy mimosa like me, you must try this.",10/25/21 01:16,Eve Lee

Winter's Spring Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Upon first applying a sample of this, it smells very grassy, but with a slight floral element. I assume this is the mimosa. This definitely smells like spring and very nature-y. Currently a week and a half into March, I thought it would be an appropriate time to try Winter's Spring, as we are in the transition period right now in Chicago moving out of winter into spring. Though to me, this smells very much like an established springtime scent, with grass, flowers, and sunshine, which is not what it looks like right now here at all with still some snow on the ground and no other greenery really and bare trees, but warming temperatures finally. So perhaps my location plays a part in when I'd think the time of year would match to this. I can also smell this within 5"" of my skin strongly.

5 minutes later and it smells slightly less grassy, but with more of a delicate sweet slightly powdery yellow floral scent coming out. Both this scent and the grassy scent seem pretty realistic smelling. It's uplifting, joyful, clean, and hopeful coming out of winter for pretty, sunny, warmer spring days. It does smell more ""botanical"" and not really like a perfume unless you wanted to smell specifically like a flower/mimosa and no extra frills, but I do see that this says it's meant for layering. To which this would definitely lend a beautiful and realistic green floral scent.

10 minutes later and I can pick up a little bit more of the pepper, adding some warmth and energy to the mix.

20 minutes later and it still smells the same, but I smell it more within 2"" of my skin.

30 minutes later and it's a skin scent. Not sure why there are so many votes for ""enormous"" sillage, unless there is really that much of a difference between a splash sample (that was still applied heavily) and spraying with an atomizer, but it was never that overwhelmingly large of a projection on me. I do also feel like it smells more like a fresh, clean, herbal lotion scent now, too. It's pretty sunny and positive feeling.

I'll see how long this lasts.

2 hours later and it's fainter on the skin, but I also feel like it's gone more towards just an expensive ""lotion"" or ""body milk"" scent as well. It's now more creamy and fresh rather than green and floral. Though pulling back a bit, it does still smell like the absolute slightest hint of green floral in the air though if I move my arm or have it just near my face.

3.5 hours later and it's basically gone. At the 3 hour mark it already was nearly gone and I could only smell the slightest hint of it with my nose to my skin. A bit surprised at the $340 price point it only lasted about 3 hours. But I suppose it was a good realistic floral scent.",03/09/21 11:03,pamplemousse2

Winter's Spring Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Funnily enough, I was wearing Un Fleur de Cassie when I tested 'Winter's Spring', and yes, there is a resemblance. Very high quality then, but with more of a 'clean' scent, less animalic than the Frederic Malle - more delicate and I think feminine.

As the concept of the Alchemist's Garden is of layering these pure perfumes with either an oil or floral water, I tried this with 'A Winter Melody' scented water, but actually I liked 'Winter's Spring' by itself more.

I love the concept of these, I spent an enjoyable half hour in Edinburgh's Harvey Nicols with someone called Ryan who was enthusiastic and well informed (makes a change from orange-faced slightly vultury sales-people!). I managed not to drop my jaw too much when he explained the eau de parfum is about £200. It's clearly good quality, and as I mentioned in my other review about 'Eyes of the Tiger' from this series, I like Gucci's 'take' on these pure essences.

I'm also tickled by the concept of alchemy and the Medievalist theme, especially as I'm steeped in study of all things Medieval just now as I'm painting a series inspired by Medieval cosmology.

If Winter's Spring was a planet it would of course be Jupiter - early spring, as the cold Saturnine snow begins to melt. That time of year when you know within a few days that winter's finally on its way out though it's still chilly.

I do like a green floral (faves are Baiser Vole, Hothouse Flower and of course Chanel 19), and my favourite time of year is spring, so this is a winner, but to my mind it's more for early spring and late winter.

Very delicate, a whisper of warm soft floral under the green of spring mimosa.",05/06/19 11:35,woodlandwalk
Winter's Spring Eau de Parfum Gucci,"A true botanical Mimosa, one of my very favourite winter/ early spring flowers. I love ""Une Fleur de Cassie"" by F.M. but it I very intense, so this one here is a great 'pick me up' every day kind of scent: very botanical and true to origin so unisex for that reason in my book.
I would imagine this to work extremely well layered with Penhaligon's 'Ostara' that these Spanish bastards from Puig decided to discontinue!! (unforgivable).

I love the visuals of this collection and I think both GUCCI and COTY did a great job with this (although I find the pricing of the scented waters rather steep).

Forever Now (Gucci Museo) Gucci,"This is probably the MOST disappointed I have ever been when blind buying a scent from a powerhouse brand, and it’s precisely because of this experience that I refuse to do so going forward.

I don’t want to get all dramatic here but if there was ever a totally legitimate reason to rant about a fragrance, it’s this one!

And here I thought, when I first heard about this on the blogs…I seriously thought that this one had the potential to be a special fragrance that only select people would know about, and just be an absolute treasure to enjoy for years to come.

It’s not necessarily that it’s a bad concept, it’s just SO weak!

You could dump the entire bottle all over your arms and chest and ask a random stranger to smell you an hour later, and they probably wouldn’t even be able to tell you put _anything_ on!

This is the ***epitome*** of a weak and watered down scent, and it has absolutely no projection or sillage whatsoever.

I gave it another try during August, during one of the hottest weeks out of the year here in NY, and 45 minutes after I sprayed four sprays on my arms, I could smell absolutely nothing at all — and this is in 95 degree heat.

I would love to know exactly what happened here, because for Lorenzo Villoresi to have his name associated with this is a complete embarrassment, especially considering that he has so many amazing scents that he has been involved with in his tenure as a perfumier.

Perhaps it’s possible that the bottle I got is from a bad batch? Doubtful given the other folks complaining about this.

Also, and I am **never** one to complain about the presentation, because I care much more for what’s inside the bottle — but for this to be a Gucci release, it’s just laughable…the label is on crooked, and not just on mine but on all the others that I’ve seen as well.

It’s also printed on very crappy thin faded paper. The cap is light plastic with almost no real weight to it and doesn’t fall into place at all either, it’s just sort of “there” on top of the bottle. You could turn the bottle upside down a few times and the cap easily falls off, with no real way to secure it without using scotch tape. It’s just disgraceful, it’s like they didn’t even try!

I could have produced a better quality presentation in my garage with an inkjet printer and standard consumer grade materials purchased from Ali Express.

I will end with this — I have smelled better quality scents with better quality presentations from clone brands that cost 1/10th of what this one cost me, and for both Gucci and Villoresi to have their names attached to this is an absolute disgrace.

I would LOVE to know the backstory of this and find out exactly what happened here…there has to be more to this story than just Gucci wanted to make a boatload of money. They already have boatloads of money, lol, and this specific scent wasn’t even very widely distributed as far as I know.

There’s got to be more to this story…someone screwed up here, big time.

I mean, it was SO bad that I legitimately thought for a moment that I had received a fake / clone, even though I had ordered it directly from Gucci 🤣🤣🤣",09/29/22 17:14,NiqueK

Forever Now (Gucci Museo) Gucci,"This fragrance was a bit of a let down considering the staying power...as someone mentioned, this fragrance is labeled Eau De Parfum but it does not project as one, not even cologne level.

Forever Now (Gucci Museo) Gucci,"I can't believe my luck when I chanced finding a bottle of this and was able to bid and win the bottle for $71 plus shipping. JOY!

The opening is fresh, very woodsy, and aromatic. I barely can pick up the lavender. Powdery tones from the iris emerge, but since this is a Villoresi creation, the development is very calculated and restrained, but stays throughout. So goes for most of the scent--somber, subdued, and a bit dark.

Sweeter, warmer notes emerge with leathery vetiver-patchouli tones, but the sweeter notes barely registers as floral, more like a sweet amber. The drydown is a warm, musky leather with ever so slight resinous touches.

If this is a true Villoresi, the whole composition is probably without synthetics. Smells like it too. And sadly, the scent is diaphanous and fleeting. It wears very close to the skin throughout, and only lasted about 3 hours on me and had to build up several sprays to get decent sillage.

I don't know how this can hold up in cooler weather because here in this late August heat and humidity, I still have to put my nose to my wrist to know that it's there. Because it doesn't project much, it is definitely a personal scent, great for office cubicle wear.

To sum it up, I think it definitely symbolizes its roots, but not really the NOW of Gucci. Forever Now tips way more on the masculine side of the perfume composition. It also smells very familiar. I don't know whether to think it's because it smells like a Villoresi, or because the accord combinations are pretty standard for a leather scent. You be the judge.

And for those who say this smells like YSL Nu, or Infusion d'Iris, it is way off the mark. Forever Now is too dark, too dry to compare to those.",08/30/13 15:12,iMaverick
Forever Now (Gucci Museo) Gucci,"Opens very dark and almost somber in tone. I could have sworn I initially noted oud in the opening, but perhaps this is a blending of woods, black pepper and nutmeg. Fortunately things switch gears rather quickly, and progress to a more vivacious rendering. The Florentine iris is the star of this eau de parfum, and rightly so as Forever Now by Villoresi was commissioned to commemorate the opening of the first Gucci boutique in Florence in 1921. It's powdery presence is noted throughout the dry down. Rose of Bulgaria and Morocco along with ylang-ylang and jasmine create a floral heart, but again are a supporting cast to the iris. Suede, leather and amber give a smoothness and warmth. Complex, opulent and sensual are words I would associate with this modern chypre. (47)",07/21/13 01:07,jhitt793
Forever Now (Gucci Museo) Gucci,"I went into Gucci on 5th Ave. today, not for their fragrances, but for a bag. I saw the Flora by Gucci 1966 and I was drawn to that one...see my review on the EDP.

I then noticed this black bottle..again, I thought of Tom Ford..Why is Gucci trying to ""copy"" Tom Ford...Well, as they say imitation is the best for of flattery...

Well, as I was waiting for my bag to be wrapped, I tried on the Forever Now scent and WOW....It is so spicy and woodsy. I immediately thought of Tom Ford, but I could not match it to one of his fragrances exactly.

As it dried down, the orange citrus note came forward and made it so nice. It reminds me of Orange tea. Really warm, citrusy and woodsy.

Very nice. I bought the Flora by Gucci 1966 for $200.00 and a bag, so that was all I was going to spend for today. I will consider buying this scent in September.

I can see how this scent can lead more to a masculine scent, but it is unisex. If you are not into unisex woodsy fragrances, this will not be one for you.

I do love the orange that pops out at the end. What a nice treat.

A lot of patchouli on impact, black pepper defiantly in the dry down, but in all, clean, (dark)green, non-animistic way. I still have an original Gucci Pour Homme and this has a similar enveloping earthiness (although no so intense/incense)

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"This was a blind purchase selected only after reviews.
Unfortunately, I can't say that the first test resulted in an immediate success. :-/
I had expected a ladylike, easy-to-wear, warm but still quite discreet classic scent with an elegant but at the same time professional touch. Oh, how wrong I was!
Instead, I was hit with an unwanted scent shock at the first spray; A harsh, and quite chemical scent bomb of quite tacky Jasmine with a slightly dirty undertone that attacked my nose in an extremely uncharming way. Scent memories of my old aunt's cheap bath salts with an overwhelming ""Jasmine scent"" appeared. To say that I was disappointed is a deep understatement!
But I decided to give it a chance anyway, and for a couple of days I have now tested it more closely and I think we are starting to understand each other now.
First of all; Spray a very small amount at the beginning to get a feel for the scent!
The first scent note of Jasmine is overwhelming and almost makes one teary-eyed in its harsh strength. And yes, I find it tacky at first.
BUT give the scent a chance to calm down, about half an hour, preferably with a little humidity in the air and suddenly the change comes. The scent deepens, becomes weaker but fuller and warmer, almost a little lazy. The artificial pungency goes away and leaves only an appreciated trace of the Jasmine, the floral scent suddenly floats above the skin, with a faint soapiness while a slight animalic pungency ensures that the scent does not become too predictable flowery and one-sided.
I think I now will finally be able to appreciate the scent and that it can actually be very wearable even in everyday life. But a warning; Don't overspray it at the risk of turning into Mrs. tacky! ;-)",08/14/25 09:43,Eneah

The whole day I could smell it, even now 5h later I still smell it. That's great.

The scent is more grown up, I see it more for someone 35+ and it doesn't fit my age. Honour is also grown up, but more universal, I could see that one as a bridal scent, this one is nice, is also gentle, but my favourite is still Honour.

I actually sprayed it on the right arm and on the left one I sprayed Guerlain Nettare di Sole, the soft, somewhat creamier version , because I smelled also more powdery reformulated version and the second one may be not helpful for this case, the first one is playful, youthful and still with a lot of grace.

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"Love this!
So, my current search for a most realistic, soliflore- esque for tuberose consisted of this, Do Son, and Tuberoza by Nishane, and this is the winner.

At first I wasn't sure as the jasmine really is quite a powerful top note.
However, the tuberose took over and wow.
Coming from a lover of true tuberose, and the buttery goodness with the slight touch of green real tuberose has- this is it.

Don't get me wrong, I do love jasmine- I have jasmine and tuberose blooming in my courtyard as I write this ;), just is not what I was looking for in this search.

So like I said, I wasn't sure at first due to the heavy jasmine top note. But that dissipated to a glorious transition to the tuberose with just a smidge of the jasmine's green/spice remaining to give this fragrance the well rounded-ness(??) true tuberose has.
I am not familiar with true creeper, however in this, I feel it plays just a supporting role to the tuberose and doesn't outshine. The result is the intoxicating tuberose ""soliflore"" experience I was looking for.

As stated, I compared this to Nishane's Tuberoza and Diptyque's Do Son.
IMO, this is a more potent, longer lasting version of Do Son. (After the initial Jasmine, that is).
Do Son, IMO, is a constant, albeit light tuberose and very very light, at that...too light- for me at least.
Tuberoza, while lovely, had a little too much spice for me (a little too heavy on the gardenia and marigold perhaps) and not as soliflore as I wanted.
*To make note, I also adore gardenia and marigolds- have these two in my yard as well, but again, not what I was looking for.
**It did have good staying power though, btw.

***@ eimbrown- I think you may be mistaking the combination/addition of the jasmine's touch of spicy green to the tuberose's richness as gardenia; and while some might consider similar, is not the same...???

Anyhoos, if you're looking for a true, near soliflore tuberose experience, with a decent presence and longevity, I HIGHLY recommend!!!
Not as long or dominant on the skin as on my nightie, but a day later, still present and (although only slightly) fills the air when ""waved""(??) around.

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"One of my all time favourite perfumes. It smells like the transition between spring and summer with a green, fresh and dewy smell which also has a creamy sweetness to it. It feels like im laying in a sunny garden next to a lake. The jasmine scent is prominent, but not overpowering. It all smells very light, refreshing and sweet at the same time. I do not understand those who think it smells like a grandma; I don't think they're smelling the depth, layers and story that this fragrance is supposed to tell.",07/20/25 09:00,jasmyne fry

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"The most beautiful tuberose and jasmine perfume.

When I first smelled this, I was transported to my younger years, spending my weekends at the Hindu temple and going to South Asian weddings. It smells of poojas and flower garlands, but also a dewy, British summer garden; so fresh yet heady, and photorealistic. The perfume equivalent of pinning a fresh garland of jasmine and tuberose to your hair.

This sweet white floral echoes my dual heritage beautifully; perfect for summer days spent in breezy cotton dresses, in the British countryside; but also equally as perfect for when I'm draped in exquisite silk sarees.

The perfume itself is quite linear, almost a soliflore. The tuberose is creamy without being heavy and the jasmine is intertwined perfectly with it, without being too loud or sharp like Mugler's Alien. It's sweet but in a green, floral way, without any gourmand or fruity notes to make it cloying. I think it's perfect for layering with other perfumes, to accentuate their white floral notes.

I adore Givenchy's L'Interdit in winter and this feels like it's summery sister.",07/15/25 06:25,cosmic_desperado

I would not say that it's something special, and i do want to mention the price being quite expensive.
The lasting power for the EDP is good and so its the sillage, but the EDT doesn't last that long, which makes sense since it's a lower concentration fragrance.

Once it settles it becomes more lush & creamy. It gives you that sweet, almost banana-like scent. It’s very straightforward & linear. Enveloping you in an enchanted garden of white florals. It’s soft, feminine & versatile. Best in spring & summer. Can be worn anywhere during the day & even for a date night in the summer heat.

I love this perfume because it’s easy to layer with other fragrances and lotions if you wish. I once layered this is BBW lotion in sun-ripened raspberry & it was so good; I got a lot of compliments that day.",05/20/25 17:43,Glyceryl

I never asked her if it was the EDT or EDP. So I went on eBay and purchased 4 small vials of the EDT and fell madly in love. Decided I had to have more do went in EBay and ordered 3.4 ounces but the EDP not the EDT. They are decidedly different. I actually thought I liked the EDT more but now that I have both, I love them equally. The EDP is definitely heavier on the tuberose with jasmine whereas the EDT is much lighter.

I really like how clean and focused it is. The jasmine isn’t drowned in other notes, it stands on its own, clear and pure, and it's in your face like when you drink and directly inhale jasmine tea. It’s minimalistic, but not boring. There’s intention in the simplicity, and the longevity is great. Nothing extra, just a well-executed linear floral that knows exactly what it wants to be.",05/06/25 22:21,MetaMystic
Gucci Bloom Gucci,"This is one of the most magical floral perfumes I've ever encountered. The first time I smelled it, I instantly thought of a photorealistic flower bouquet, like walking into a flower shop or through a fancy garden. It's been about a year now since I initially encountered this fragrance in a Sephora, but I'm still completely in love. It's one of the crowning jewels of my collection. I will admit, this fragrance is not complex and it's mostly tuberose. It's a white floral scent accompanied by a slightly green quality like cut stems, which I understand is not for everyone. But to my nose, which is addicted to anything white floral, it's a simple, elegant masterpiece. It really does smell like a fresh bouquet of flowers, stems snipped, and arranged in a vase. This is a perfect fragrance for Spring, as the white florals are more subdued in cool drizzly weather, although I will probably still wear it throughout the Summer months and maybe even into Autumn as well.",05/06/25 09:17,worldcat123

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"Perfumes are truly magical...I was under the impression that florals do not agree with me. And here we are... hopelessly in love with a perfume called Bloom.

It is light and fresh, there is no vanilla or musk to weight it down, no woods to make it harsh. Just pure flowers, clean, creamy, yummy. And still, some may find it heavy because it projects and lasts like crazy. You have to love jasmin to love this perfume. My kids love this perfume on me, so does my husband and he is picky. I reach this one all year, for any occasion but I do believe spring is her season. This is one I will repurchase once my bottle is gone ❤️",04/20/25 04:51,Chira
Gucci Bloom Gucci,"As someone who loves jasmine and is picky about tuberose-based fragrances, I felt that there was just barely enough jasmine in this to balance out the tuberose. It's a pleasant scent, but since it is mostly (if not entirely) tuberose I can't say that I would enjoy this fragrance nearly enough to purchase it. In my opinion there are plenty of far more balanced tuberose fragrances than this (Armani's My Way comes to mind), though this is probably just a personal preference.",04/05/25 14:06,AubreyNoel

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"Was gifted this fragrance years ago and have repurchased three times. A gorgeous floral suitable for absolutely any occasion imaginable. It's like a botanical garden from a fairytale universe, yet very sophisticated. I find it to have a very cold/cooling property to it almost like the flowers are slightly dewy, which I find makes it great for layering. It blends well with a lot of other fragrances in my collection and adds a cool, uplifting, invigorating floral touch to any fragrance combo. It does smell a LOT like Do Son by Diptyque however, I find Do Son to be slightly spicier and a tad more complex, and not as dewy or cooling. They both serve a time and place but Bloom is generally a safer choice for office and indoor spaces and definitely wearable for any season. I get complimented on it everytime I wear it.",03/15/25 22:26,shadowplaymp3

Gucci Bloom Gucci,I got this my junior year in college I believe after choosing from the Sephora holiday samples and I fell in love - I'm such a fan of jasmine and tuberose and this was a nice transition for my second go-to perfume in my life. It's dewy and light and inoffensive. I unfortunately grew sick of it near the end of the bottle and was desperate to finish to it - it's just not incredibly interesting or intoxicating and I think I grew out of its simpliness after a while. It does make for a good work/school scent though.,03/07/25 10:41,teawaterfairy

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"Very similar to Do Son by Diptque. There's pros and cons to both. Do Son has a slight biscuityness (think digestive biscuit) that I find distracting, but it's also somehow ""brighter"" than Bloom. This is a pleasant and light jasmine/tuberose. It's ever so slightly powdery as it dries down but in a way that is still very realisitic floral. I veer towards saying it's not exactly sweet, though others have described it that way. It's really just like walking into a greenhouse of white flowers on a sunny and dry day. It's not a complex or exciting fragrance, but it's elegant and fresh such that it's wearable for many occasions. I would wear this to the office or any formal occasion where a more flamboyant scent wouldn't be appropriate.",02/25/25 03:27,linweaf
Gucci Bloom Gucci,"I'm surprised people don't consider this a winter or fall scent. I purchased it when it first released and wore it often during colder periods.

Original: I received this as a blind gift and I've tried to like this. So much. Every time I try to wear it I tell myself that its floral, lovely, I like white flowers, its so fun, the bottle is so cute, its from Gucci, my sneezing is a coincidence, etc....

I hate it. I am sorry and this isn't a dig on anyone and I hope I can give this perfume a home with someone who loves it in another town or country (the further the better), but I cannot stand it. And I love other smells with jasmine and tuberose in it so I cannot for the life of me distinguish why I hate this perfume, but I find it develops so oppressively on me after one spray and I have to imagine the Rangoon Creepers is what absolutely does not agree with me.

I will say, the silliage and longevity is insanely long. For those who love it, congrats! Please wave at me from across the street!!

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"One of my favourites for spring/summer. I am a lover of white florals with a touch of earthy green. Some of my favourite florals include Gucci Bamboo, Dior Addict (which is more vanillic than floral but still), Boucheron Jaipur Bracelet and Cartier Baiser Vole (light pink liquid not yellow). I also happen to adore tuberose and jasmine. So it’s not surprising that I fell in love with this scent.
Sure it’s simple and pretty linear but it’s also effortlessly beautiful on me. I have many of the better known tuberose forward perfumes Michael Kors, og Caroline Herrera, KK, Madonna ToD etc But Gucci Bloom does stand up on its own as distinctive from the others. It is too fresh to be considered a typical tuberose or jasmine bomb. The green notes reign the density and sucrose in, affording it an airy balance. On me this lasts pretty much all day. I love to layer this with the discontinued Tom Ford Orchid Soliel. The two compliments one another sublimely with OS amplifying Bloom’s projection and longevity.

I hope to have a bottle of Bloom in my collection for a long time, as it is one of my favourite florals to wear. Stunning in it’s simplicity. Just sweet enough, balanced with grassy green and the rangoon creeper drydown is lush. Imo signature bottle worthy and I’m not even a signature bottle kind of gal. Too much variety to be confined to one or two scents on a daily.",02/15/25 00:43,Name Discontinued

Years later, I have bought it again, and now, I get it. The white florals aren’t old-ladyish—they’re elegant. Gucci Bloom doesn’t smell like someone’s grandmother. It smells like someone with good and sophisticated taste.

I credit this shift to Alien. Two years of wearing it, and jasmine went from something I tolerated to something I actively seek out in every fragrance.

So yes, Gucci Bloom is firmly in my top three—alongside Mugler Alien Essence Absolue and Burberry Goddess. And it’s not going anywhere.",02/01/25 15:39,Purepotts

Can’t mistake this linear, boring, nasty smell. I couldn’t get away from the lady fast enough. I can’t take florals other than freesia and Lilly of the valley.

No depth, no surprises, just a predictable white floral dizziness that lingers too long without saying much. There is no way it wasn't designed to be forgettable, blending into the nausea it induced like a scent—if I can even call it that—you’d smell at a random drugstore perfume aisle.

I having multiple samples of this and even a travel size, I have to say this in an elevated floral. I'd expect nothing less from Gucci. My signature scent for many years was the original Gucci Guilty and why this is not like that at all it has the same elevation of class and sophistication while being very feminine and soft. I'm a strong goth girlie, heavy on the girlie that lives in the south and I like a statement. I'm a lover of all the Aliens and Angels. This to me is just so beautiful and accessible. Highly recommend trying it. I wrote an earlier review that it's like sticking your head in a bouquet of flowers and yet it also is just so smooth and powerful but not so overpowering or sickly.
Adore. Last year my signature scent or I guess the last few years was Utopia by KayAli and this has a similar vibe while being very different still in it's on class and bold.

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"This is a solid unisex white floral for people who want something straight forward to put on for any situation.

It's not a statement in the slightest, but that's sometimes what you need.

Yes, it's quite a unapologetic green tuberose. However, as an enjoyer of Cacharel's Eden ,but often sad how it always feels slightly too much, I appreciate how this one soothes into something more subtle in time.

I think this is a perfume you can't enjoy if you don't enjoy;

1) Simple scents

2) White florals with no sweetness

I'd also say this perfume will absolutely smother you if you over spray.

I got profumo over this in the end because of profumo lasting a touch better and being creamy, But I'll certainly ask for this if anyone asks me what I might like as a gift.",11/16/24 13:21,lalapope

Nice scent non the less, and makes it possible to have a romantic day to day perfume. Smells soft and delicious.

It is a beautifully balanced scent, it leans more to a true floral and does not have any real sweetness to it. It is definitely a more stereotypically mature scent, but don't let that deter you as it is a beautiful one. It has extremely good longevity (12+ hours) and a moderate sillage.
My only advice is if possible, do a wear test before purchase. When I smell this from the bottle, it is a true white floral scent, however on my skin it is much much more green, and I don't like it as much. So I would recommend testing to see how it reacts on your skin.",10/08/24 20:41,Missm7393

I tried it when I got home and I was like no seriously wtf was this and why did I waste my money on it. I think this scent actually turned me away from perfumes for a few years after that. I do not want to say that this smells like a grandma because I love the way that my grandparents smell. But it probably smells like someone else's grandma.

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"A nicely done clean and green tuberose, with a backing of jasmine and what smells like honeysuckle. This is a really linear perfume and very much an inoffensive and balanced white floral. Whilst it's nothing ground breaking and it doesn't evolve much, it's a pleasant and easy to wear perfume that I think would suit many occasions.
I already own many spectacular white florals, and I think Diptyque's Doson nails realistic tuberose, so not sure I'd purchase a full bottle of this one. Something in Bloom, in the dry down on my skin, did get a little bit sharp and screechy when sampling this one in the warm weather today, so I do wonder if it would be less screechy in a cooler temperature.

To me, Bloom smells classy and sophisticated, timeless yet modern. There’s something incredibly luxurious and posh to me about tuberose perfumes when they’re done right. This is also one of my most high-performing perfumes, as other people can smell it on me, I can certainly smell it on myself for hours, and it lasts a long time.

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"Today (June 20th, which also happends to be the Summer Solstice) I finished my 4th fragrance in 2024: Gucci Bloom. I bought a 100ml bottle in the fall of 2017, after smelling it first in the Summer. I then asked the salesperson wheter Gucci Bloom or Mugler Aura would suit better for an office, since I worked my first real job at the time and wanted to give myself a treat. The salesperson said Gucci Bloom was better, I ended up buying Aura because Aura intrested me more. I could however not forget Gucci Bloom: its powdery, almost medicinal smell and the stunning water nymph/Ophelia like commercial with Dakota Johnson that I rember seeing all the time on TV. So I went back and bought the biggest bottle they had.

Ever time I smell this fragrance, I feel comforted and mature. Like the well put together woman I want to be. I bought this fragrance when I was 21 and at first I wore it everytime I felt not taken seriously or when I had big life or career events. I wore this for example when I signed the pages to buy the house that I was lucky enough to buy in 2021.

In 2021, I started to wear my 8 oldest fragrance bottles suited for every season as a rotation. Gucci Bloom became a staple in my Spring and Summer rotation. This fragrance is beautifull and etheral in the warmer weather and to me it signals good times to come.

The opening starts of with a strange mix of powdery and green, which if sprayed too much can be very medicinal. This is very brief, because soon all the white florals pop up with the main act being tuberose. It stays pretty linear the whole time and I get a solid work day/ 8ish hours when wearing it.

I feel like letting go of an old friend with the bottle being finished, but I am happy with my big collection to finish bottles.",06/20/24 15:03,WinterSneeuw
Gucci Bloom Gucci,"Massive blossoms of humid, photorealistic tuberose and jasmine radiating from the tropic heat, hanging down from damp bitter green branches. If ever there was a scent so aptly named, Bloom is it. This performs beautifully. On hot days Bloom warms up on the skin and surrounds you in an heady aura as if the climate around you shifts- all without feeling too heavy or cloying. It is enchanting. It is timeless. It is a signature scent.

I wore the heck out of my bottle when it released, and took a long break away from this fragrance for a few years until just recently. I found a sample vial of the yellow Profumo Di Fiori flanker in my nightstand, and I needed Bloom back in my life immediately. Profumo is excellent, masterful even, but my true love is the original EDP... One of my top favorite frags of all time. In an olfactive landscape oversaturated with gourmands, saccharine florals, and sweet musks, I return to a favorite that possesses none of these trendy qualities.

However, there is a certain bitterness that lingers beneath the strong jasmine smell that I just can't shake off and it turns me away.

It smells like the type of fragrance my mom would wear. She loves beachy yet clean white florals. This is less beachy yet still has the type of floral I associate with her.

As it wears, I get more of the sweet tuberose. Bloom stays rather linear once the tuberose comes out. I think if you like Armani My Way, you will enjoy this because of the similarities. One major difference is that Bloom stays calm and mellow while My Way is punchy and bright.

This fragrance is pleasant but not for me.",06/05/24 10:38,YourFragranceFriend

I was shocked by how natural-smelling, wearable it was. It smells way more expensive than the price point was. The whole thing just screams great judgement. It was refreshing because for a while everything released either smells like molten sugar or half-washed laundry.

It's a tuberose, a bit waxy and creamy, counterbalanced with a green, bordering astringent jasmine. The base is a nice woody musk. Just nice and very pretty.",06/04/24 01:19,exquisitecrops

One of them even sent me a picture of himself smelling the pillow the day after I'd leaned on it during our date.

And now...I love it. Someone wrote that it's like hugging a put together mum...maybe that's why those dates liked it? :D But for me it's an answer to a need I didn't know I had. I think it's elegant and timeless, yet fresh. I won't comment on the notes, since other people have already done it better than I could ever express myself.

It warms up on my skin so beautifully. I keep smelling my wrists when I have it on. Only downside is, the longevity isn't that great on my skin.

Would be nice to layer with some post-bath sesame oil for a nice cozy 90's vibe. For men in particular, this might be nice to blend with something spice-forward, it's more girly at first but settles into a more unisex floral, IMO.",05/22/24 04:21,noctivagantlibertine
Gucci Bloom Gucci,"the opening of Gucci Bloom is the most perfect honeysuckle-jasmine i’ve ever smelled. and once the creamy bubblegum tuberose kicks in, i feel like i’m drunk on white flowers. i’m having flashbacks to my East-Texas childhood, shoving my face into star jasmine, gardenia, and honeysuckle. it’s so strong at first you can definitely taste it, but i’m not even mad about that. all the warmth, none of the funk. rangoon creeper is also known as “Chinese honeysuckle,” and i can see why.

as strong as it starts, though, it has slightly poor performance overall, going out in a blaze of glory rather quickly, but leaving a sweet, dark, powdery trail behind. (i wonder if layering this with Not a Perfume would make it stick around longer.)

EDIT 5/31/24: tried this with NaP and, while not sure it improved the performance, it filled in the spaces, boosted the powdery musk at the end, and made it more interesting overall — and did not alter the glorious opening in the least. win-win.

Gucci Bloom Gucci,Beautiful and elegant white flower scent! Opens up with white flowers and settles nicely on my skin. Smells well blended and balanced. I would buy this for a summer holliday.

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"There are 2 different fragramces this reminds me of. Maison Margiela flower market and/or Armani Rouge Malachite. FYI the Armani is significantly stronger and longer lasting, the MM flower market a more natural take on the scent of the florists.
But, this is undeniably a beautiful scent, and has about the ideal strength and projection for a wedding ceremony. I tip my head to those who have written about wearing this for their wedding day. Its perfect for thr occassion... I'd kiss your hands on bended knee to show my apreciation for tou elegant taste.
As mentioned elsewhere, if you are not a fan of tuberose - beware. This may not be to your liking. In perfumery the white florals of jasmine, orange blosson amd tuberose are rightly lauded as the 3 queens, but as a caveat, tuberose isnt as easy on the nose as the other two. Its not as divisive as full on rose, or orchid say, but now amd again i meet people who arent fans.
Its good, but there are similar scents do it even better. But a queen on her wedding day shouldnt be making eyes water feom ten feet, so this gets my vote for the most formal occasions. Also one spray is probably light enough for the office, so if you want a naturalish elegant floral, this could be for you.",03/20/24 12:24,Kingofclubs

Gucci Bloom Gucci,"I too wore this on my wedding day, 5 years ago now. There's something endearing, almost nostalgic and dreamy about this white flowers composition. Somewhat, it screams rich and nonchalant about it, as almost all Gucci creations. It really lives up to the house DNA.

The opening has a prominent bubblegum note from the tuberose which subsided almost immediately on me, to make room for a really enchanting jasmine.
I guess that the nostalgic note singing in my mind has to do more with the white flowers overall, than anything else. It's a romantic, tender concoction with a modern twist. I may be biased, as I love a good jasmine, but this is really classy, ethereal in that demure way that so well suits brides on their big day.
If you love white flowers, give it a test.

10/10 though longevity isn't great on me to be honest. The intense isn't as good.",03/15/24 03:59,Forbiddenjade

Gucci Bloom Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is OG Bloom's tangy twin I got at a very very good price.

You trade the creamy, syrupy sap of the original for something a little more sparkling and luminous.

You should get this if you feel the original lacks something to energize the composition.

It's extremely fresh and zingy to the point spritzing yourself with this first thing in the morning is up there with a cold shower and a hot cup of black coffee for rousing you from rest.

The dry down is also pretty nice, and a tough different. OG bloom stays quite green and sappy as it simmers, this one terms into a zesty musk. Not quite citrus peel, but in the same family.

It doesn't last the longest, but I also find the OG doesn't last well on me either. So far, only Profumo seems able to stick around long term.

Overall, it's a solid perfume to get if you want something floral to wear in the heat but I also don't think it's exceptional.",02/11/25 00:58,lalapope

Gucci Bloom Eau de Toilette Gucci,"The opening is a bit much for me, probably because of the lemon, but the dry down is nice. To me this smells like a more tuberose-heavy version of My Way. I'm particular about how much tuberose is in a fragrance (just a bit, not too much), so I love My Way but don't enjoy this nearly as much. I see how many people could like this fragrance, but the composition is just slightly off for my personal tastes.

EDIT: the dry down evolved to a very rubbery scent. Not a fan.",10/12/24 14:13,AubreyNoel
Gucci Bloom Eau de Toilette Gucci,"It is very cute and potent. It dresses me in the prettiest flowers. I feel them yellow, slightly honeyed with a citrus edge. Contemplating there is definitely orange blossom and tuberose. Lemon and bergamot are adding their super freshness. I detect also neroli. The composition is fresh and floral. Today it is raining, 21°C, but it did not alter the performance of the scent. Sillage is substantial. I am constantly aware of the scent.
Comparing it to Bloom eau de parfum - it is less dense and more citrus. The edp is a heavier floral, dense and heady. Flowers heavy with pollen. I can see the edt having its own fans regardless of Bloom edp. However, it lasts 3-6 hours on me. The edp lasts much better, around 12hours.",09/09/24 03:25,MademoiselleMaya

I think it's a great blind buy since it's well made and smells elegant without going too much in any direction (it's not too sweet, not too cloying, not too fruity, etc.). But this EDT is too citrusy. All I can smell is orange and lemon with a hint of tuberose in the background. I do like how light and ethereal it is since I don't like loud scents.

This one smells fresher, lighter and more citrusy than the original version and it is a more springtime perfume.

Gucci Bloom Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This new version is a little fresher at the start but after a few minutes it returns to being a concentrated tuberose flower perfume, as we know the eau de parfum, or at least I feel a great resemblance to it.
For an eau de toilette it lasts well, I would say about 4 - 5 hours, although after 3 hours it is already very soft on the skin and I can still feel the tuberose even if it is close to the skin. Medium intensity the first two hours and then begins to soften.",06/23/22 10:20,Isa Ramirez
Gucci Bloom Eau de Toilette Gucci,Sampling this today and I really like it. Pretty neroli/citrus forward tuberose. I'm not getting a lot of lemon w/ this. My nose picks up more of the neroli and orange blossom. Creamy/ Musky/floral dry down. This is a daytime spring/summer scent. Very uplifting and refreshing while still being a heavy white floral for those of us who love white florals. I like this flanker very much. Has the Gucci Bloom DNA.,04/21/22 11:54,LSAUG
Gucci Bloom Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is a lovely white floral fragrance for spring & summer. You can definitely tell that it's a Gucci Bloom flanker. It is similar but not the same. The most dominant notes in Bloom EdP are jasmine and tuberose and jasmine and orange blossom play first riddle in the EdT - I really enjoy this combo. The fragrance is more radiant, airy and uplifting. The orange blossom and citrusses add freshness and zestiness to the fragrance. Gucci Bloom EdT is a great choice for women of every age and suitable for any occasion. The fragrance is pretty long lasting (7h+; becomes a skin scent after 3-4h) and has a moderate sillage. I think that it will ""bloom"" even more beautifully in warm weather.",03/18/22 01:45,Paula80

Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"My accidental love
Gucci Bamboo is called my ‘accidental love’ in my collection. It was a leaving present gift from a colleague 8 years ago. She made me open and spray it in front of her and was hit with a very sharp and detergent like opening that my nose disliked and I had to hide it with a smile and a ‘mmm lovely!’. It sat unloved in a drawer for 4 years and then my colleague joined my new team and the guilt kicked in. I thought I’ll wear it on her first day and maybe use it up at work until it’s done so I don’t have guilt. And surprised myself that when the bottle was done I just had to get myself another bottle. Most of my perfumes are unlike the others. So this one is a keeper for me, it’s lovely on my skin. There’s the obvious fresh, citrus opening from the bergamot, mandarin and orange blossom with a slight juicy floral round sweetness of pear, lily and jasmine. A powdery, very slightly spicy, musky dry down with the sandalwood and a very slightly spicy tease of ambergris with a layer of comfort from the vanilla in the base. I love this on my skin, I get delight from an almost sweet, milky, creaminess that must come from the ylang ylang that gives this lovely, subtle hint of honey every now and then when I move. I see this perfume described as a simple, uninteresting scent, and I know I’ve obviously developed a strong emotional memory to it, but to me it’s a classy, fresh with hidden complex gems that I just love and will always enjoy wearing this.",06/18/25 10:14,Curly Hen

Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I have already written a review on this beautiful elegant perfume, it is a soft beautiful clean floral perfume with a non artificial powderiness that comes from the floral notes that makes it so classy, soft and magical.

However, each time when reading reviews, I keep in mind one thing in particular: the year a perfume was made and when the reviews are posted.You see, it is a common practice of perfume houses to reformulate their perfumes and yet release them under the same name as if no changes were made.And it is never for the better, at least in my experience.

So, back in 2016 when this was made, In went to try on a few perfumes in a big cosmetic mega store here in Greece, and it was this one that captured my attention.It smelled amazing on me throughout its stages, and the middle part, as well as the amazing drydown it was what captivated me and made me buy it. However, I hadn’t noticed that there were two different bamboo perfumes, one edt and one edp, so I ended up buying a set of the edp perfume with its lotion, instead of the edt I had tried on. And it was actually the saleswoman fault that didn’t clarify which one she had given me to sample or that there were two.

So imagine my surprise when I got back home, and I excitedly tried it on again and was so…underwhelmed…What happened to the beautiful perfume I had tried on at the store?Why is this similar but different?Why had the amazing drydown never come?So, I looked it up back then on Fragrantica, and checked the notes that I had picked up on, and the reviews clarifying and realized the mistake… The next day I travelled the 1,5 hour car drive back to that store, explained what happened and got my beautiful edt perfume which was everything I had remembered it to be and more.

My bottle from back then was of course of that first year it was released (2016), given that I didn’t want to use it all up(it was a 30ml bottle), but also because in all these years I grew my perfume collection significantly (I don’t want to keep wearing the same perfume each time) ,I still have it in my collection, and it is as beautiful and amazing as back then , maybe even more so, as I have noticed quite a few times with quality perfumes sold by reputable perfume houses.

So now that it is spring here and my perfume cravings have grown,I revisited this little gem, my precious, and it feels like coming back home💕.So, I looked it up online and ordered another 30ml bottle of the edt as a backup, and given that it was difficult to find the edt available, probably this is being discontinued?-so I hoped with all my heart the one I would get now would be from an old batch, and not a recent reformulated version (the newest reviews on this here, made me certain this perfume has been reformulated).I even thought: wouldn’t it be great if I magically got the same exact batch code as my old one ?~mind you it’s 2023 , so we’re talking about a 7 year time difference pretty much…😆. So imagine my utter delight and surprise when I got my perfume delivered today and I checked right away the batch code on the bottom of the box,and compared it to the old one, and it was …THE SAME.😳

I am so happy,words can’t describe, that I stocked up a bottle of the original formula. If you can, when looking this perfume up, check the batch code and if you are lucky and find a 2016 one,get it. If not, since I don’t know exactly when the reformulation on this was done,probably don’t bother.

This one is a classy perfume ,soft but has a presence.It lingers, it has great sillage and lasts for quite a few hours (8 minimum). It is great in all weather conditions, it is all circumstances and hours appropriate, but where it shines even more, it is in drier weather (hot or cold), because it is then that it emits that magical natural floral powderiness.In more humid conditions it will bring out its more fresh floral aspect.

This one, is a perfume as perfumes are supposed to be made, elegance and magic in a bottle ❤️",05/23/23 10:39,Lalouve<3

Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Well, I accidentally bought the EDT instead of the EDP. I have only tried the EDP once, but I definitely smelled that bit of soft creaminess and that it had a moderate lasting power. This EDT version is nice, clean and shampoo-like, but it's more crisp and lacking that bit of creaminess from the EDP. It's also very weak and doesn't last very long. I get about 2-3 hours and then it's gone. It's also IMPOSSIBLE to overspray! I'm gonna go through this 75 ml bottle in a record speed because I have to spray it all the time. I do kind of like this perfume, it's really easy and now offensive, great for work, summer days and other places where you would want to go easy on the perfume. I just think the price tag is a bit much for the actual performance on this perfume. Perhaps the EDP is a better choice than this one, I'm not sure.

Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"It is funny how we change over time. I find that I'm gravitating towards floral fragrances with hint of citrus notes especially for this summer. Gucci Bamboo EDT is a classy, modern white floral with a dash of citrus. I also get a bit of woodiness which smells like bamboo to me. I do enjoy it and find that it can be worn in most situations . I don't think its targeted towards very young people eg under 20s , you may need a little more maturity for this. However, I do not think this is vintage. I think its beautiful but it has average longevity. IMO, Its worth a sniff.",07/16/21 14:03,SummerRose
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is a clean, sharp fragrance which I bought for the warm months coming up however I don't like this fragrance. The woody/musky notes just don't agree with me after the original burst of bergamot. For me it just smells super cheap and not what I would expect from Gucci. For me this could easily be a cheaper brand/designer.",04/02/21 05:11,ME.fragrance
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I love Gucci floral perfumes. They have a common Gucci element to them, a sort of DNA that I really love. I've got Bamboo EDP which is more quiet and sophisticated. The EDT is easier, it's a complete perfume, start to finish, nothing is lacking. A bright citrus opening, some pear makes a lovely way to the floral heart so there is no distortion just beautiful harmony. And all of this settled unnoticably into a wonderful base. Then you catch yourself asking: what smells so good? Bamboo EDT. Dont let the EDT sign trick you. It develops, performs and lasts.",01/07/21 21:40,bel.gravia
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,I have Milton Lloyd's Tatti which is supposed to be a dupe for Bamboo. It has that 80's /90's unisex vibe - the bamboo has a zen like smoothness and the florals lift it a little higher into a more feminine leaning scent. Great sillage and longevity.,11/03/20 14:14,Noelanii
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Perfect fragrance for those who want to smell clean and inoffensive. Not every fragrance has to be loud and announce you when you walk into the room, some fragrances just simply have to be just that, simple. And Bamboo EDT is a great example of that. There is a sour fruity note in the fragrance that actually works well in Bamboo, the fragrance is great as a signature scent, great for the office, great for everyday and great in workspaces where you can’t actually wear fragrance. If you wear fragrance simply because you love wearing fragrances and don’t care for compliments, Bamboo is great for you however, when you overspray, even though it is an EDT, it actually does last and projects very well, even better than the Eau are Parfum version! Very crowd pleasing and one to check out!",06/08/20 19:13,RachelSeun

Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is a very light soft fragrance. Its like a lighter version of 212 by Carolina Herrera, you can definitely smell the similarity. At first spritz i get a lot of citrus then it dies down into a mild floral scent. It is a perfect fragrance for the office or for those who do not like overpowering smells. I might try the edp when i finish this bottle because this maybe is just too weak for me.",07/17/19 04:36,Shan101beauty
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"A clean, citrusy white floral. Reminds me of 212 by Carolina Herrera. Doesn't smell exactly the same but it's in the same scent category in my opinion. My mom disagrees. She loves this Gucci Bamboo EDT but hates 212. I think this may be great as an office scent. I let my mom shop my perfume wardrobe to give me an idea for her Christmas present and she chose this. Since it was new to my collection and only sprayed to sniff I gave it to her. She adores it.

The opening of the this is very sharp. It kinda burns my nose and throat. The dry down is lovely though! Soft floral. It smells divine on my mom. I'm glad she has it.",12/29/18 17:20,rumari47
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Oh my...where to begin...

First of all let me say that I like this scent on its own (you know what I mean later on). It is so interesting because it combines freshness with white florals, making it perfect for every weather condition (even really hot weather).

I love that its freshness doesn't come from green or woodsy notes,it doesn't come from aquatic notes either and it isn't over the top citrusy...it is as citrusy (nothing lemony) as it is needed to enhance and balance at the same time the white florals.

So,yes...I really like it on its own...however... I absolutely love it combined with Versace's Crystal noir body lotion... and that is probably because these two perfumes have similar notes and are 'cousins' let's say...

Crystal noir is headier and more night appropriate because it is a darker beauty on its own and also really shines through during wintertime (cold and dry weather).That is why when using its body lotion I used it on its own.Combined with the perfume it was just 'too much'...

However since Bamboo is a lighter fresher version of Crystal Noir,when I combined it with Crystal Noir body cream (which is also a beauty on its own) it was just...magical!It really enhances the perfume making it cosier and ethereal with better projection,like a comfy blanket,creating a small inoffensive,classy sophisticated cloud of beauty that is just...ugh!It doesn't make it heavier,it just makes it perfect balancing even more the citrusy notes and projecting the white flowers much better giving it an air of pure sophistication!Big Love!!! <3 <3 <3",05/26/18 09:24,ange ou démon
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is better than the edp. This one is warmer, softer and the lily note is better done here. The citrus here isn't so strong like in the edp. The edp was very flowery, but the citrus was fighting with the lily for attention, and it ended up smelling like dirty water. On the edt, even though the lily is not so intense, it is definitely stronger than the citrus, what i really appreciate. It smells a bit soapy, a bit creamy and light sweet.
Think of a poor cousin of Baiser Volé.
If you did not liked the edp, you probably won't like this one, because the differences are really subtle.
If you're looking for a fresh perfume to wear at work,this could well be an option.",01/24/18 05:08,raiza1990
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is a beautiful floral with a hint of something a bit unusual, and much nicer than the EDP which verges on a slight urine smell.

Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"So beautiful!
I really don't get the reviews stating that it's weak/watery or bad longevity. Bamboo EDT is really beautiful floral with a nice fizzy citrus opening. Stayed 18h on my wrist, no joke. Reminds me of Vanitas by Versace byt less cloying (tiare usually doesn't do it for me)
I really recommend you to give it a fair chance, don't let negative reviews scare you off. Also, if the EDP is too thick/too much for you, try this one. A pleasant, clean, easy to wear, almost creamy floral with good sillage and longevity.",01/15/17 08:52,ppetra-

Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is a basic green neroli and citrus scent that fizzes for about five seconds and then evens out into that dry, nondescript, papery-woody ""fresh"" scent that Calvin Klein made very popular twenty years ago. Unlike anything from CK, Gucci's note clarity and longevity are very good, and the fragrance feels like a decent fruity-floral, with enough bitterness to be comfortably unisex, but I would implore anyone interested in Bamboo (parfum or EDT) to give Jacomo's Silences a try before dropping the bigger bucks here.",10/12/16 16:31,karlovonamesti
Gucci Bamboo Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I noticed in the duty free shops while traveling this year that Gucci are really pushing Bamboo as their main women's frag, at least in the Nordic countries and NL.

The EdP blurb states ""The fragrance apparently reflects confidence and femininity. It is designed for modern women of character that is multifaceted; the fragrance is intense, graceful and gentle at the same time"". Well, I don't get how how it's confident or intense, it's very inoffensive. A wallflower type scent, really. A ""don't mind me, I just work here"" type of perfume. It reminds me a bit of Versace Vanitas, which is another citrusy, effervescent white floral, difference being that the Versace is a bit arrogant and I find that to be a nice thing.

EDIT: The drydown is somewhat enjoyable. Creamy jasmine comes through and really lifts it.",09/18/16 10:33,Madrona

I place it right alongside the Axe products high school boys wore in the 90s and aughts...firmly in the 'don't come near me until you wash that off' category. Made to Measure just never measured up for me, despite trying it out on men and women as an experiment when a prior partner was suprised by my level of distaste for this fragrance. I don't have any issue with the longevity or sillage, it is easily identified at arm's length and lasts a full day. I would categorize it as a clean aromatic scent, that is very sharp to my nose. The lavender, bergamot, and amber come across as synthetic and harsh - they are all overpoweringly forward and never really let go to allow appreciation of the other listed notes.",08/10/23 02:30,msisa

P.S. If you don't know fresh fragrances don't last long then you are in for a shock. It's just not possible to make, ok? You can pay 10 times more for Creed freshies and it will still last couple of hours. It is the way it is, get a $1 sample bottle and take a refill with you, apply and reapply.

Made to Measure Gucci,"Amazing smell, terrible performance.

Been wearing this one since its launch in 2013. I've received many compliments while wearing this cologne, both from women and men. The lavender and leather are quite prominent, in my opinion, and combine for an appealing, subtle scent. The problem is this cologne is TOO subtle. Combine the subtly with the mixture having terrible performance (between 1 and 2 hours at its absolute best), and you get Made to Measure.

I would personally avoid buying this unless you're totally drawn to the smell, plan on wearing it to bed or other short occasions, or if you're fine with reapplying it multiple times a day. Personally, I've been so drawn to the smell that this fragrance has stayed in my collection.

Made to Measure Gucci,"Now for a totally positive review!!!! Gucci Made to Measure was purchased by me in a fully packaged mini format. I kept returning to it, and just bought a full-sized bottle.
Let's start with the outside: The packaging is so elegant. The bottle is HEAVY glass with thick seams. I like glass. I am an Anchor-Hocking groupie, vintage hobnail goblets. I believe glass is very practical. This bottle is weighted in quality. This heft feels so good in the hands, it almost is soothing. The top is described in the literature as hand finished. It is a beautiful satin-finish brushed pale, pale gold. It is some kind of metal. Lid has very broad shoulders and rests with great solidity on the bottle. The classic ring or stirrup allows you to pull the top off with a nice crisp click from the lid. ( Not magnetic, just a nice fit--they got it completely right. ) What a great ritual it is to reach for Gucci Made to Measure Pour Homme.
The juice itself is clear with a very unusual hint of gray. Is it the glass of the bottle? The atomizer is A+ very much like those on my beloved Dunhill.
The scent: Fastest open I have seen. You pick up the Lavender and maybe the Anise. I think the Lavender is just wonderful. Some orange in the drifting scent. It quickly moves into what seems like the Juniper Berries. I love Juniper Berries and it is a listed note. I think Juniper Berries is often mishandled, but not here.
As for Plum it seems like it is easily overwhelmed, like my experience with Pear. Anyway, I do not really detect the Plum. In the final dry-down with my nose right up close it is strange. Is it Water Lily? Some kind of melon scent. Not a scent, a suggestion more like.
Aside:This is the kind of magic I love about fragrance. Roja, Ohrmonde Jane are just a few that do 'suggestion fragrance'. I don't mind a good knock on the head from Juicy Couture Dirty English. (Very interesting note profile.) So you don't have to walk softly around me at all times. That is why building a broad assortment of fragrance is so much fun.
Great credit to Gucci in its blending of Leather, Patchouli, Amber. It is really neat. . .it is giving the scent what I call a 'fullness' and kind solid base of not-so-sweet. Really you just feel it all--not in isolation of scent.
This scent moves very quickly to a close, intimate scent. Conceived in 2013, I think it is a new direction here in 2021; well-conceived, strategic; a going for lots- of-love blend.
Aside: I think that some of these new houses are going to 'niche' themselves into total obscurity. Gucci is designer, but who cares? We are talking about an illustrious house. They know how to do it. I am a total Gucci fan boy, yet I don't recklessly buy all of them. Money, you know.
This is a 'just for you' kind of scent--like the name--'Made to Measure' One of my all time favorites. Wear it for yourself, and those close to you--literally-- will more than likely love its fresh, sophisticated and delicate scent.
In closing, it felt good to not write a gripey review as it is fun to be positive. Well, heck, they got it superbly right.. so.",03/16/21 12:09,norm1

Made to Measure Gucci,"I think it's great!
In fact, it's one of my favorites from this house.
One important thing: You need to try this on skin.
When I first tried it on paper, it didn't really impress me. I could barely smell it, the entire thing reminded me of paper/papyrus and it was rather boring, light and I couldn't imagine it to last very long. So, at an airport I decided to spray myself with it and proceed with the day. It evolves great - so good that it's now on top of my wishlist.
It's a little sweet but not cloying or heavy at all. It's still somewhat light, has that generic vibe to it but it smells really refined and well blended at the same time! I tried it in many different conditions and they all worked great. Australian Summer? No problem. Winter in New Zealand? Still works well. My girlfriend could notice it on me after an 8 hour flight, so I think that's pretty good! Of course I wasn't walking around a lot in the plane but it's still impressive for such a light scent.
Prices are cheap for this one and I don't see it very often, so I'm afraid it might get discontinued sometime soon.. time to get a bottle of this!
I was shocked to see so many negative reviews because honestly.. it's not that bad!",10/19/19 14:58,Pawly
Made to Measure Gucci,"This initially smells like Hugo Boss Hugo Man but less synthetic. My first impression is that this is a fragrance that is hard to dislike, which is confusing when I read the negative reviews.

Personally I find this fragrance easy to wear, yes it's somewhat generic but I personally can't dislike the fragrance based on the fact it reminds me of other fragrances out there. However I'm pretty sure this does not smell like any fragrances in my collection so it's a welcome addition.

It's light and sweet on the opening, there is definitely a fruity/floral note which brings some freshness to the scent. It does evolve to a slightly warmer scent as time goes by which for me makes this scent more suitable for warm/cool days (Spring/Fall). It might be too much for very hot days, however you could wear this during summer nights.

I've had more positive impressions from women than men, which makes me think that the fragrance is designed to appeal to the opposite sex.

It's not a performance monster and does not shout, but it's an amazing safe clean scent to wear on most occasions.

Overall I rate this one a 7/10, definitely worth a try and by no means a bad fragrance as others are pointing it out to be.",05/23/19 05:35,ShazJamal
Made to Measure Gucci,"Its awesome for a designer for me. This scent is heavily reviewed for being generic and bland.. The plum and berry note is so good.

I figure if a 60 year old woman compliments me in Saks 5 Avenue its a buyer. I buy niche and designer(very picky on these). This smells damn good. Its a scent that will please every crowd, if you don't know what to wear on that whatever occasion.",12/28/18 21:44,clintjr82

Made to Measure Gucci,"When I first smelled it right away I said this is for warm weather. I wore it during the summer and I didn't like it at all. The performance was so weak. Then just because I wanted it to be finished so i could get raid of it , I started to wear it also in the cold weather. To my surprise I really loved it in the cold weather.",11/17/18 09:18,Nemo-666
Made to Measure Gucci,"What a great fragrance this is! Gucci has never disappointed me! It's more of a late night summer and autumn kind of fragrance. Great for formal evenings and nights. It's definitely on a sweet almost gourmand side. You can detect almost any note of it if you will be patient. But the main notes anyone can feel are flowers with some fruit nuances and spices with a dab of a leather.
It's a great addition to a Gucci Premier line for women.
You will certainly feel some class and sophistication while wearing this fragrance. It's not generic or synthetic in any way! All ingredients are of a very good quality.
And one more thing, it has some Los Angeles (Hollywood) vibes to it, if you know what I mean. :)
Longevity is about 8 hours plus. Projection is heavy in first 2-4 hours, then it becomes moderate.
I highly recommend this fragrance for those who love the quality and sophistication!
P.S. Thumbs up for Nicolas Winding Refn, James Franco and the whole advertising campaign!",08/26/18 06:54,Alreadygentleman
Made to Measure Gucci,This is a very lovely fragrance. Beautiful smell. It's very strong and extremely sweet. I wish it was less sweet. The spice notes come through fine; it smells quite powdery. I like it. It's not for every setting though; it can be cloying in the summer especially if you overspray. 8/10,08/10/18 09:11,2SEXY4THISTOWN
Made to Measure Gucci,"I was gifted this perfume in High School. Soft, very subdued. A generic aromatic on the masculine side, wholly inoffensive and safe for most occasions/seasons. I've worn this to funerals. This lasts 4+ hours on my skin and clothing. I don't dislike it, but I don't love it.

On a bizarre note, I once dreamed, very vividly, that I heard soft sobbing coming from my closet. Upon inspection, I found my poor little Made to Measure bottle weeping quietly in it's packaging. I feel this dream describes this fragrances character in an abstract way.",01/22/18 08:01,RivkaLev
Made to Measure Gucci,"Today I took a sniff of Gucci MTM for memory's sake (it was connected to someone I used to love passionately). It still smelt so nice just how I remembered it. While the projection is weak, MTM is wonderful as a skin scent.",12/31/17 06:13,bfactor

Made to Measure Gucci,"I dont understand what everyone's issue with this frag is. I ordered a bunch of vials, M2M and 212 beinf two of them, and I preferred M2M over 212. Don't get me wrong, I loved 212 as well, but this has a bit more of a fruity smell, which I seem to like. Again, I only had vials of each, so it was hard to wear any of them, and they were just 1mL. I just bought a bottle of M2M and I still think it is great. In my opinion, it is comparable to 212 conceptually. It's aromatic and sophisticated, with a fruity top. Luna Rossa Sport was similar, having more of a fruity top.

I smell more juniper berry than plum, which is a bit upsetting. After a few minutes it becomes more woodsy, and the cinnamon peaks out just a tad.

I will update after I have been able to marinate in it for a few days, if I feel any different.

As of now though, I think it's great. A pretty safe blind buy. Just do not think it deserves so much hate",09/08/17 12:56,garyg199
Made to Measure Gucci,"I have all the accessories from this cologne, and besides the negative reviews, it will remain in my top shelves, and I will keep the frame I did with ""James Franco"" being the face of this cologne hanging from one of the wallS in my bedroom.

Made to Measure Gucci,"This fragrance does not deserve all of the negativity. It may not be the strongest scent. But the smell is very pleasant and intriguing. I bought it in spite of the negative comments because I thought the scent notes sounded interesting. I was not disappointed. The scent is not very strong, and doesn't project very far. But the subtle wafts of the scent while wearing it are very pleasing. I enjoy the fact that I cannot smell it so intensely because this means that I enjoy the scent longer instead of going scent blind shortly after applying it.",06/21/17 02:17,sethro77
Made to Measure Gucci,"This cologne was given to me by an ex so it's obvious she liked it and wanted me to smell like this. I personally liked it, it's more of a day time formal scent, not an aquatic but it's still fresh. It's a safe scent but I did receive compliments on it. Nothing exciting but it does not deserve all the hate. This is a refined and more polished Gucci guilty. A good office or summer Sunday church scent.

Scent: lavender and plum are the most distinguished notes during the opening along with citrus. A hint of cinnamon keeps it from being too youthful. A masculine floral scent.

Performance: I get about 3 or so hours of decent performance for a designer scent before it becomes a true skin scent. Not bad but not great either.

Season: a spring-fall scent. Can be used in the summer also.

Made to Measure Gucci,"Made to measure... this is actually quite good, hear me out.
You will always have 2 types of reviewers; the extreme frag heads who will knock a scent because the transition to the base notes wasn't smooth enough or the bergamot is over used... you know the type. And then you have the frag head who appreciates a good scent, especially when ladies respond to it.
I am the latter, I have a decent collection of Frags, shave soaps, aftershaves, you name it.

So Gucci MtM... I first got this as a sample from Sephora before heading off to Austria for my honeymoon. My initial impressionot was that it smelled like a mature man's Gucci Guilty, but more refined and more ""expensive."" Immediately my wife loved the scent, so that's a win. Walking around Vienna, talking to people, this thing will get compliments.

Made to Measure Gucci,"I can never give Gucci MTM a fair and objective review, as it has linked to some intimate memories. I remember enjoying it on my crush neck/shoulder when we sat quietly in a coffee shop, and, then, when I hugged him from behind. At that moment, MTM became the best fragrance ever in existence for me.

With all that distant memories removed, as well as the fact that my nose has got to know so many fragrances ever since, I came back to MTM to give it some less biased judgement. This is definitely a very pleasant scent, yet nothing special about it. The notes are too blended, and none can be discernibly appreciated.

I guess it'd better stay as a memory.

EDIT: So anyway, coming back to this scent after a couple of year, and with all the memories removed, I can say that I can enjoy this scent a lot more than when I made this comment. It has this subtle appeal that makes you want to reach closer to the person wearing this and just take a sniff. Very positive.",11/07/16 22:42,bfactor

Made to Measure Gucci,"Despite the aggressively negative reviews, I decided to try it on today and it was a pleasant surprise. It is safe and sweet fragrance, with unusual plum note, which makes it different from other perfumes in this category. The sent lasted for about 7h on my (oily) skin, but did not project so good, even after an hour, it was sitting close to skin, so Id say the projection is not its strong suit, and that is okay. Perfumes like this one are not to be smelled by everyone, I find it very unagressive and tamed in its poshness and elegant in its character. Would not be my first choice, wouldnt mind smelling it on someone else.",08/22/16 15:59,remy.cullen.5
Made to Measure Gucci,"This scent seems to get a lot of hate, I think it smells really nice, its perfect for a job interview or a nice night date or going somewhere that you plan on being in close quarters with people. It doesn't really project but the smell is nice. I only bought this bottle because my GF really enjoyed the scent, and at the end of the day what she likes is what I like because I am only trying to impress her. Its a pretty scent, it can be worn with work clothes, a nice suit, I don't think it fits a casual setting as it feels a bit to intimate for that but its a good cheap cologne. Nothing that will do amazing for you but it wont let you down, try a sample first would be my suggestion, its for some, not for all and I think people forget that sometimes.

Made to Measure Gucci,"This fragrance has a rather spicy output, but also is notorious lavender, quite used lately in many of the Gucci men's fragrances. What I like about this fragrance is drying her rather masculine, I think what stands out is amber notes.
It has very low projection, if you will have to notice her overcoat and longevity is also very weak, it shows skin flush. It reminds me of some other fragrance I've already smelled, but I do not remember. If the fragrance had the best longevity could appreciate more. Very nice bottle and very good publicity with the charismatic James Franco",06/20/16 10:21,caifan
Made to Measure Gucci,"Let me say that this is a normal fragrance its not groundbreaking but its comfy just to wear when you go to college or the office the smell its sweet but light if you are looking for something turn down sweet of One Million or Eros, its the only one of Gucci that I really like I just discovered that the plum also is one of my favorite notes and I can feel it well blended with the Ambar note, I was waiting to buy when the price down, and yes after 3 years I just get a 5 oz bottle for $950 mx pesos with taxes (like $50 usd) I'm glad I get the bigger bottle because it will be my summer scent to work, I use Angel edt in spring but right now with the heat I get a super scent of chocolate and it gets so suffocating; I was looking for something with good smell nice clean and with a vibe of classy but not to use the same as almost everyone in the city (Boss Bottle, Acqua di Gio, D&G) my other option was Savage by Dior, but I think Ill buy it later when I can get a better price.

The Longevity that I get is 8 hours the first 3 with a great (normal) projection and then it goes to the skin, like a bodycream with good projection.

What really surprise me is that I get compliments from ladies and girls who ask what I'm wearing i tought it gets so mainstream that it doesn't stand out but I was wrong with that I think its good for a Dinner or Dates for reasons more personals but Ill use it like a casual scent, go to mall or the supermarket with sunglasses in this summer.
I give it a 7 and Ill enjoy my purchase.",06/07/16 08:50,angelmarc
Made to Measure Gucci,"Gucci Made To Measure is a nice light but weak summer mens fragrance. Fresh, versatile, absolutely for hot weather, a decent scent for man and a safe choise.

The longevity is about 5-6 hours and the sillage is moderate with 5-6 sprays. After 2 hours though, it stays close to the skin.
The most distinguished notes I get are bergamont, plum, juniper berries, but I do not get so strong lavender, it is very-very weak as the rest of the notes listed above.

I like it, nothing unique but very versatile for any case in hot weather. The design of the bottle is magnificent!
I do not get the negative reviews or the nostalgy for other different Gucci scents. We are here to talk about only for ""Made To Measure"". And it is quite a decent summer scent!",05/12/16 15:44,GRAF

Made to measure is one of my favourites.

In my opinion it's directed more for under 25s, like myself.

This was one of the first fragrances I purchased and I have so many memories and compliments from it which might be why I'm so attached to it.

Made to Measure Gucci,"You know, I actually like this one for what it is. A Swiss Army knife fragrance that can be worn anywhere at anytime. Looks like it would bear resemblance to Gucci by Gucci but in bottle only, it actually falls more in step with the guilty line, and I am guilty of loving guilty intense and guilty black. Not creamsicle sweet like intense nor green and aromatic like black, it falls comfortably in the middle while borrowing notes from the aforementioned guilty fragrances.
Citrus, but not overly so. Sweet but not overly so, spicy, touch of leather but not overly so. You get the point. It is well rounded and can in fact be made to measure your season, wardrobe, and not be out of step, very well blended.
To me very similar to ysl l homme in the sense that when you're unsure of what to wear, you can grab it wear it and be just fine. No they do not smell similar but the two are unbelievably versatile. I will always own this,especially when it can be had under $35 at fragrance.net. Have the proper expectations and you may really enjoy this. I absolutely love to wear this in warmer months, as it has more to offer than just citrus and ozone, calone notes with white musk. Another guilty pleasure of mine.",04/11/16 20:44,rerthegreat

Made to Measure Gucci,"At the top, I get mostly lavender, plums, and leather. It starts off as a very generic masculine smell. I would probably like it if it smelled like this the entire time and it had more reaching power. However, when this cologne dries down on me, it smells like I spilled orange juice on myself. I like the opening smell but the dry down is pretty horrible. Luckily, it doesn't last very long and no one will really be able to smell it on you. I am glad I only bought a small sample/ travel bottle for $20.00.",02/06/16 12:54,Wolfgang Mazrin
Made to Measure Gucci,"I have a slightly better opinion on this scent than most it would seem. Probably due to the fact that I got a 90ml for about 1/4 the retail price and had read a ton of negative reviews before ever trying it. So my expectations were understandably low to begin with.

I get a little of the sweet that everyone speaks of in this scent. But mostly I get this kind of a bitter/floral thing going on....very reminiscent of the same DNA in the Guilty line.
Very linear and one dimensional to my nose, but still pleasant enough and something that I could see being a crowd pleaser.

Longevity is very good on my skin, however the same cannot be said for projection. This scent is a sort of a ""jack of all trades"", but master of none. Yes, it's somewhat ""generic cologne smell"" and doesn't really do anything to set itself apart as a unique composition.
But with that, also comes the ability to just grab and spray when you need a fragrance that will work in ANY situation and not offend/overpower those around you. So, that's something that my wardrobe could use, even if this juice doesn't really do much for me on a personal level.

Smells good, people around me like it, lasts long, cheap price....and that's enough for me to give this one a pass.",12/11/15 13:10,bigbz

Made to Measure Gucci,"First and Foremost Gucci Made To Measure's bottle is top notch, it was what initially drew me in to test this fragrance out.
The First blast of MTM was somewhat astringent and assaulting to my nose, but within a minute I got this vaguely familiar strangely deja Vu feeling, I left it on my arm and went to test other fumes to see what will become my next purchase.
As I walk passed the Diesel aisle it hits me, I grab Only The Brave and spray it on me, and lo and behold there I have the same scent on different wrists, and coming from 2 different bottles. I was a fan of Only The Brave a while ago I've been through 2 bottles before I got tired of it and moved on, so Gucci MTM was this blast from the not so distant past, but dressed up in a fancier, more elegant bottle, but that's as far as it goes. MTM does have a slightly more sophisticated quality to it, almost like only the brave slipped into a suit for a black tie event, and toned himself way way down to blend in. Made to Measure is not really a bad scent, but its been done before so it can easily be called Generic and Unoriginal. Its Longevity is around 6 hours and projection is very close to skin. (I asked for a few testers of MTM, along with my purchase of A*Men to warm me up this winter, which now takes me to going through 6 bottles of A*Men), if further testing prove this can be a purchase then I just may consider getting Gucci Made To Measure, but for now I'll give Gucci MTM a 6.5 out of 10.",07/23/15 06:25,Virgoan-hunk
Made to Measure Gucci,"very lightweight, in other words, I can smell it a bit right off, then it is mostly noticable for me only up close, and after an hour or two, not really much at all at that. It might be that I wore it in the summer in the day and it just evaporated real fast. Maybe this needs cooler weather.
It basically gives a quick blast of almost fruity citrus right off, and then turns into a light, warm thin brown leather after a minute or so, similar to the smell of the inside of a brand new pair of shoes.
I thought it was fairly decent, but it is very generic and there are probably hundreds of scents just like this.

Made to Measure Gucci,"Two of the scents I recently dismissed are the two I´m wearing the most. This Gucci ""Made to Measure"" (I never really cared for this somewhat silly name) I first found kinda meh. A better one than the original meh Gucci. Maybe I´m not being so fair; they are both good scents, but in the meh way (here I went again). Anyway, I read on a magazine some person saying this Gucci was his day by day scent and Bvlgary Man Black the night one. Then I gave it another try and now I found myself apreciating wearing it during the day. What otherwise would be simply an example of lack of personality now became a sincerily linking. It's an ok scent that I can wear without preocupation of being noted but sure that smells good and composed, and this is working better than others when I go work. After lunch I can easily reaply.

Made to Measure Gucci,"Ok...I went and got a sample from Sephora because I have been interested in the scent for over a year now. My final verdict: this is an awesome fragrance (for me at least).

Its not necessarily unique, but I can't think of a single thing that smells just like it and in this day and age, that's pretty successful. I realized the trick is to spray it close to the skin so that its less dispersed, and more potent at the point of attack (around my neck).

It has been 6hrs and I can easily smell it without looking for it. It's very smooth and easy on the nose, and it's definitely nice enough to be worn in formal occasions. I would even say ""signature"". I can not speak for the sillage, but I'm assuming it isn't that strong (though within the first 2hr, my significant other could smell it from an arms length away). This one is made to fit like a tailored suit supposedly - for close quarters.

In summation, I really like it though I acknowledge that it isn't groundbreaking. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a pleasant, fruity oriental that is masculine and modern. Its versatile while not being too casual.",01/24/15 17:52,scentualMan

Made to Measure Gucci,"This perfume is really surprising! To my nose it is extremely well balanced: the right combination of citrus opening, sweet flowery heart (nevertheless decisively masculine) and amber-leather base notes. I decided to try it on at the store because from the card tester I couldn't recognize any distinctive note. I sprayed it on my neck and on one wrist and I could not refrain from bringing my arm to my nose to go for the next fix. I don't understand how one may call it anything other that classy and sophisticated. Walking in the bubble of Gucci MTM made me feel like I was finally wearing something that suited me perfectly, I didn't have any of those ""maybe it's a little too much"" uncomfortable thoughts. As the evening progressed I received a few compliments from different girls and one insistently kept reaching for my neck saying the scent was just ""mmmmmmmmmm!"". It doesn't project much, which is something I actually look for in a fragrance.

Made to Measure Gucci,"At first I thought it would be some sort of peppery/woody ""synthetic"" nightmare scent, but it soon settled down into something decent. However, I found myself thinking things like, ""this seems like Michael for Men [Kors] but with some missing notes."" Unfortunately, I like those missing notes! It's certainly not bad if you aren't going to pay much attention to the scent you are wearing on a given day, but I generally like to wear scents of a different type (than ones I tend to wear frequently, such as ""fresh""/sport) or ""cheapos."" I won't totally dismiss this one yet, though, because it may be good if my sensitivity becomes high again and I can't deal with stronger/bolder scents. On the other hand, my guess is that for the designers, this soon will be considered bold and provocative!

Another wearing: it seems to be a bit too tame for me, so I think I should just move it out rather than expect it to become part of the rotation at some point.",07/20/14 22:05,Bigsly

Its was designed to smell like the fit of a well tailored suit - close to the skin. It has a VERY pleasant aroma that is smooth, well-blended and classy. My girlfriend loved this on a tester strip over 15-20 other colognes at Sephora. I sprayed it on my neck lightly, 3 squirts, and that lasted me over 10hrs of subtle, but always detectable to me, sillage.

Made to Measure Gucci,"Made a 360 on this one.

At first try I liked it: generic but well executed.
After having bought a small bottle, the weird and sharp top notes irritated me.
Yesterday I tried it again and although still weird, I like it right now.

The ""weird"" topnotes are also present in the new Gucci Pour Homme (same bottle, different colour). They are a bit synthetic and remind me of really cheap fake perfume you find on markets. However, once gotten used to it, it has something.
Compared to Gucci Pour Homme, Gucci Made to Measure is a fresher and lighter alternative. Not too sweet, which I like, but still fruity. Ideal for at the gym.

Made to Measure Gucci,"It's not a bad fragrance by any means, but like many others before me said, it doesn't break new ground either. It's a fresh scent that's good for casual use, and certainly won't offend anyone within its proximity. It's not particularly powerful and does seem to settle fairly quickly, so it does require occasional reapplying.",11/15/13 16:23,Elodia
Made to Measure Gucci,"I am quite suprised at how many haters there are. I can only imagine that there are a lot of people who are looking for a scent that is EASY to like or something that is trending. I think people are automatically taking the easy route by hating it instead of trying to contemplate a deeper understanding of the scent itself.

For example: Gucci Made To Measure has introduced Water Lilly as one of the notes in a Mens Perfume. I looked at all the other perfumes by Gucci on this website and this is the first instance that they have done this. I don't know what the ratio is in regards to how much Water Lilly is used, but I can say with certainty that I can detect something in THIS Gucci perfume that I haven't experienced in any of their other fragrances. I believe this to be the Water Lilly.

I think that this is a lovely fragrance. Made To Measure is NOT a fragrance with a bang that gets everyones attention... but maybe that is the point.

My main point is that when it comes to perfume, much like Painting, Music, Sculpture; the Arts: it is a critic's responsibility to put in some consideration of why the artist or designer made, whatever it is they made, the way they made it. I know I personally don't know NEARLY as much as a perfumer does in regards to scent so already my judgements and criticisms have little to no weight to them. But what is important is that I am TRYING to understand the creators intent and desire for the piece that I am experiencing.

Perhaps it's just as well... if they cranked up the concentration level it would smell undistinguished and conventional. It smells like a leather jacket and perhaps some lavender from about a mile away, caught on the briefest of breezes.

Made to Measure Gucci,"A light floral fragrance which is close to the skin..

I applied 6 heavy sprays

0 10 secs - Initial spray is lovely - clean, crips, class, debonair posh, sexy

10 secs- 1hour 15 mins - 4 inch projection but very very light and subtle - I would not be suprised if many get liitle to zero projection from this fragrnace. This projects a light lavender with floral fragrance, almost unisex, yet on the skin is a harsh woodys, spicy, generic, masculine smell.

1 hour 15 mins - 2.5 hours - 2 inch projection but still hardly anything there. Gets soapy-floral-lavender and tame and has very poor quality and common place

2.5 hours - 4 hours. Close to skin and gets harsh and little smoky on the skin - the quality of this fragrance is very low.

I cannot fathom how this passed testing at Gucci?.. are there many there who just say what people want to hear and not challenge? Where are the quality standards? It's as if someone has said just do a woodsy frag, it will appeal and sell - I don't think this will. The initial smell may fool many, but they won't come back a 2nd time

Update. I found a 20ml bottle at TJ Maxx for under $10 and figured why not. I gave it one good wear and couldn't stand it. I've changed my vote to dislike.

Made to Measure Gucci,"Yes I have to agree. It had that Guilty vibe when I first tried it. Quite humble and easy to forget what it is. Made to Measure makes Guilty seems more interesting, in my opinion. They must have tried to fool us by going back to the old bottle design. Why not just call it L'eau de Guilty or something. Gucci will soon head back to the think tank and find a new direction.",08/10/13 05:12,nattonline
Made to Measure Gucci,"Has Guilty really become so popular that Gucci decided to multiply its versions till the end of the world? Thus, Made to Measure during its developement smells like a sophisticated spicy peppery version of Guilty. It opens with a harsh spicy muted mix, soon the specific soapy citrus notes of Guilty appear. The best part of the fragrance is the final stage, when Made to Measure becomes woodier, a bit leathery, the freshness is being smoothed and we get the mild smell of strong black tea with bergamot. Unfortunately, the projection and longevity are very weak, even weaker than Gucci by Gucci has.

Finally, this one is a decent release for the modern market and especially for Gucci brand. Thank God it has nothing common with 1 million; Made to Measure is not sweet and not loud, being a skin scent. It smells like a son of Gucci by Gucci, at least they share the same mood. The problem is that, to my mind, the fragrance is not memorizable enough to become notable at the market.",08/06/13 13:31,antonpan

My goodness another crap from gucci and the price tag 85usd for 90ml you might as well buy axe or old spice. I will wear my joop anytime than this one or my paco rabanne i mil (you know as a lot hated that one for sure). Is it me or im just expecting more. I gave this one a fair shot and for me its a total fail am I comparing this to the old gucci releases of coarse im not ITS JUST A GENERIC BOREDOM SCENT its not made to measure anything. IF MY REVIEW IS WRONG HERE FEEL FREE TO COMMENT ON IT.
Longevity moderate 6 hours max on my skin 6/10
sillage poor to moderate quickly becomes a skin scent 6/10
Uniqueness nothing unique nothing memorable nothing to make you come back for more 5/10
overall smell 6/10 I dont usually give a 5 and I seldom dislike or vote for dislike on a perfume this could be the first.

Made to Measure Gucci,"A great scent, and seems to be a step in the right direction for the Gucci house after the less than desirable Gucci Guilty series. Definitely heavy lavender scent, but the inclusion of plum and lotus flower sweeten things a bit. Cinnamon, nutmeg and juniper berry offer a degree of spiciness, but are well blended. Lastly a warm leather accord rounds out the base offering depth and comfort. I consider this a modern aromatic fougere. Unfortunately this does smell rather commercial/pedestrian and I do not smell anything earth shatteringly inventive here. Despite it all, I predict Made to Measure will be popular amongst consumers.

Made to Measure Gucci,"I work in a duty free shop so I get to try perfumes early. And I am really sorry to be the first one to press dislike on this one.

The dislike here is not because it smells ugly or offensive... It's completely the opposite. It is generic, passively made, and completely unintresting. You get the feeling that you have smelled that, been there before.

The main notes that I can detect are lavender and bergamot which reminds me of Prada's Luna rossa(Maybe this is the reason I feel that this perfume is not new since Luna rossa is a new release too!). I can also detect a good vibe of anise and just a faint hint of cinnamon. Then, after a very long time, the base notes try to appear but they fail. Only the leather can be somewhat detected. You just know that the composition is not right when the base notes fail to appear after several hours. So, you end up with a strong citrus lavender smell which is not offensive but, as I said, rather generic and flat. The fact that Prada released their own version before gucci might be the reason of this review... But really, I want a unique perfume and Luna rossa is much much much better!",07/18/13 23:05,AND-MAT

For my bottle, 3 sprays is total overkill. Even 2 sprays can be a bit much. This is one that I spray on an half an hour before going anywhere. It’s at its best when it has some time to settle.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Absolute by Gucci aims for rugged sophistication but often crosses into harsh territory. The leather opening is intense and smoky, with a sharp, almost medicinal edge that overshadows the cypress and patchouli underneath. While the vetiver and woody base provide impressive longevity, the scent can feel dated and overly dry as it settles. It performs best in colder weather, where its dense, smoky character feels more fitting. Still, it lacks the smooth sweetness and balance found in Gucci Guilty Elixir, which I personally prefer. Overall, it’s a strong statement fragrance—admirable in concept, but challenging in daily wear.",10/13/25 12:59,barrykoppal

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"***Yet Another update since purchase on 7/14/25***

So this makes my 3rd entry and 2nd update since I'd purchased GGA on 7/14. So initially I was super aggravated with this frag bc it'd been through an OBVIOUS ""reformulation"" since production was switched from the U.K. to Spain. Been checking it every now & then to see if Id notice any improvements with performance/scent, and Im happy to say that GGA has definately improved. I am (Now) getting a more potent, smokey leather with resinous woods. Theres also a slight ""Gasoline smell"" and slight medicinal thing going on which is what I was hoping for when Id first purchased my bottle but was sorely missing. Seems to me as though produvtion in Spain has basically skipped the Maceration process so as to cut some cirners and save some coin, but hey, AT LEAST GGA is definately improving more and more over-time. Longevity has definately improved lasting about 5 hours on skin and much longer on clothes where I can actually still smell it the following day on clothes although quite faintly, but its definitely there! Anyhow, I have a feeling that this fragrance may improve even more over time bc it just keeps getting better and better where initially I could BARELY even smell it at all and what little I could detect was gone within 20 minutes or so. Would I recommend Gucci Guilty Absolute? Honestly, for the $80+ pricetag? Nah, Id recommend Lalique's Encre Noire L'Extreme as a dupe bc imo these smell very much alike except that instead of a slightly smokey leather note ya get a beautiful, slightly smokey Vetiver note and to my nose the resinous woods smell VERY similar. Also Encre Noire L'Extreme last much longer, has better projection and costs less than half the price of GGA. Now you'll also need to let Encre Noire L'Extreme ""Maturate"" for at least a month bc initially it also has poor longevity, but somehow becomes SUUUPER long-lasting once its matured. I dont belive that GGA will ever reach the Lalique's performance level no matter how long its stored away and allowed to Mature. Thanks for taking time to read about (My experience) with Gucci Guilty Absolute and I really hope this helps someone out who's trying to trsearch and may have any concerns about Blind-Buying this fragrance ☺️. I sure do wish that someone had mentioned the horrible reformulation before I pulled the trigger! And believe me, I CHECKED EVERYWHERE! lol..

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Releases of this caliber come around every decade, or even less often. So this brash, patronizing, and perhaps somewhat over-the-top title shouldn't surprise anyone. Let's be honest, the chances that any mainstream brand (I'm deliberately excluding niche fragrances here, especially the orthodox, commercially untainted segment) will present a fragrance as bold, original, and ambitious as Gucci Guilty Absolute are slim to none.
Today, history has come full circle, and to think that I had to wait six years for the opportunity to write something nice about a new Gucci perfume for a change, since the 2011 premiere of Gucci Guilty… This scent is so good that I consider the search and nominations for the title of the best fragrance launch of the past year (and there will be such a category in this year's ranking) to be over, back in February…
I'm glad that the brand that until recently I used to wipe my mouth with, for endorsing the mercilessly crappy stuff ordered to be signed with the Gucci logo by its former creative director, Frida Giannini, has finally handed Ms. Giannini a well-deserved dismissal and decided to return to being an icon of truly refined perfumery and style, at its finest, Italian. And it must be admitted that the Gucci brand has a lot to say in this field, so before we move on to the sound of the star of today's post, it's time for a mini retrospection... The image begins to wave, everything becomes blurry, the plucking of a harp appears in the background - and a soft fog begins to fill the edges of the field of vision...
Once upon a time, when herds of Allosaurus marched across the Jurassic steppes, accompanied by Maryla Rodowicz on the balalaika—phew, come back!—it wasn't that long ago!… Once upon a time, sometime in the late 1980s, the grand dream of Guccio Gucci (yes, the brand's founder was actually named Gucio) began to crumble. The company was truly on the brink of bankruptcy when a young, brilliant visionary and multi-instrumentalist, Tom Ford, took over. Ford also revived the bankrupt house of Yves Saint Laurent, so let's just say Tomek knows his stuff and didn't cut corners – for example, by offering Gucci's discerning clientele a tacky, bland, mass-produced product, with the motto: ""If others are offering it and it sells, then we will too!"" King Ford managed the Gucci family estate wisely and fairly from 1990 to 2004 – and the company prospered under his rule like never before. In 1998, the ginger angel Gucci Envy was born – and two years later, the woody, resinous Gucci Rush* was born.
Unfortunately, the idyll couldn't last forever, as the good King Tom was poisoned by the evil witch Frida and took over the kingdom, much to the despair and ruin of his subjects – STOP!, not this fairy tale again!… Unfortunately, one day, Tom Ford left for his own business, and his place was taken by Frida Giannini, who quickly introduced her own, very ""fresh"" and drastically different vision for managing the Gucci fashion house, which Ford had just revived. Bravo Frida!… Only what escapes brands like Lacoste, Hugo Boss, or youth-oriented brands like Puma or Adidas – won't quite appeal to a clientele accustomed to luxury and elegance, at its finest, Italian. It's as if Frida Giannini took over the best Italian restaurant, steeped in tradition and with a typically Italian flair for celebrating meals – and suddenly, with a single signature, she erased it, turning it into a fast food restaurant with a menu and service straight out of McDonald's… So we eat burgers quickly, with our fingers and from paper boxes, but we sell a lot and quickly – well, Bravo!, Bravissimo!!! 😉
And you don't have to be a great business strategist or a creative director with a monthly salary of tens of thousands of euros to know that this business model can't work. Old customers, previously well-served by Ford's genius and creativity, felt disgusted and cheated, while new customers, who had nothing to hold onto at Gucci, collectively voted with their feet and left for the competition... Some in search of lost quality, while young ones in search of more desirable and cooler logos... Hey, come back! We'll give you coupons for Dragon Ball and Pokemon cases for your iPhones if you stick around and like our Facebook page!... What do you mean, you don't want it? Hey, shove that case up your ass, you impudent little brat in Lacoste sneakers! Suddenly, it turned out that there were players on the market much better at promoting banal fruit juices for teenagers – which Gucci switched to, presenting the world with min, the Guilty and Made to Measure series… And then the wealthy and loyal customer sulked and took his platinum Visa to the competition... But how? Why wouldn't anyone want to buy the grossly overpriced and bland garbage from Gucci? It's simple, because there have been brands specializing in this area for a long time (and much more thriving), whose position wouldn't be threatened by the arrival of Gucci, a fashion house unknown in this segment. You know, it's like NASA starting to compete with our Bolesławiec, or Rosenthal in ceramics... And they went off to bake ceramic facings for space shuttles, not coffee sets!
Fortunately, someone on the board of the Gucci Group, which currently owns the Gucci brand (yes, thankfully, there was someone else overseeing Frida) realized that the business model she had implemented was ineffective given the competition and, moreover, was doing the brand more harm than good. As a result, the inept creative director was removed from the helm in time to prevent the millions of euros poured into shaping the Gucci brand's image from devaluing at such an alarming rate. Fortunately, Alessandro Michele, Gucci's new creative director, decided to return to the proven path of success, previously charted by Tomek Ford, resulting in today's post, Gucci Guilty Absolute! Yes, the tasteful, refined and exquisite GGA cut is undoubtedly the result of the will of the new creative director, because although the fragrance inherited the inglorious name of the Guilty series – I have no doubt that under the reign of Frida Giannini, it would not have smelled as perfect… And I only secretly hope that Frida will never find work in this industry again – which is what I wish for you, for myself and for every company in the industry 🙂
Okay, now that I've lambasted Frida from head to toe (but she deserved it)—taking revenge for promoting rubbish, tarnishing her reputation, and nearly sinking the brand that gave the world some of the greatest men's fragrances ever! (Ave. Rush, Envy, and GPH 1 and 2)—let's move on to the revolutionary Guilty Absolute. A groundbreaking fragrance, but I have no doubt this one will face more challenges than any other fragrance in history. Firstly, Guilty Absolute is bold, ambitious, niche, and iconoclastic, and the mass market doesn't like such fragrances. I fear the fragrance might end up like YSL M7, which was also ahead of its time and discontinued before, hmm, posthumously instilling in hordes of perfume lovers its equally bold, oud-like bouquet. Secondly, the fragrance inherited the name Guilty, which has negative connotations and is undoubtedly a heavy burden on its leg. Brilliant and demanding, Guilty Absolute is a fragrance on par with the aforementioned and equally brilliant M7, or the equally distinguished and challenging Encre Noire. A charismatic fragrance with character that will either win over customers and become fashionable – or disappear from the market without a trace.
You might ask why the brand chose such a famous name. I'm afraid Gucci might have had no choice, because unfortunately, perfumes aren't created overnight. A fragrance takes a long time to develop, both the fragrance formula itself and the back-end—the advertising campaign, name, graphic design, and bottle. Contrary to what some of you think, even the garbage piling up on perfume shelves isn't created overnight. Launching a new perfume takes time, and it's a time-consuming process that involves a significant amount of human and financial resources. While the fragrance composition is usually outsourced to an external person or company, the production is handled by a dedicated bottling plant, each new release must first be developed and entered into the brand's calendar—so the idea and its implementation are often years apart. I assume Absolute was in development during Frida Giannini's time, after all, a consistent bottle and name for the entire line were approved. Orders for bottles also go to glassworks well in advance and are very expensive.
So when Frida lost her job, and the glassworks called to say that the ~50 million Guilty Absolute bottles were ready and waiting for collection, Alessandro faced a real dilemma. In my opinion, the only thing he could do was replace the probably trivial fragrance composition Frida had previously created with something ambitious—while simultaneously utilizing the commissioned and already owned bottles and the partially implemented/launched campaign. This was much faster and, most importantly, CHEAPEST than starting from scratch with a completely new name, campaign, and bottle—where the existing bottles bear the Guilty Absolute name… We're talking about millions of euros, which, instead of being pointlessly thrown into the trash, were cleverly used with what I consider a better fragrance composition. I'm just speculating, of course, but that's how it could have been – because you'll admit that the scent is completely unlike Frida's ""taste,"" yet it inherited both the name and the bottle. To conclude, a comment from one reader – yes, one swallow doesn't make a summer, but this strange and inexplicable sense of peace – tells me that from now on, everything will be alright, that the bad lady is gone, and from now on, nothing stands in the way of always being alright…
Okay, now that we've covered the extensive and, in my opinion, essential introduction to better presenting this perfume – it's time for the real deal…
What's shocking and simultaneously most delightful isn't the ambivalent name, but the fragrance itself. And what a fragrance! It smells of real, masculine leather, heavy and deep agarwood, wood, and single malt whiskey barrels still redolent with fire and smoke! I would have expected something so massive, deep, masculine, uncompromising, bold, rich, and simultaneously avant-garde from an orthodox, non-commercial niche—not from a brand that, just a week ago, I considered the archetype of a producer of exceptionally poor mass-market products.
The fragrance makes a stunning impression and surprises with its smoky and burnt (burnt wood) bouquet. After the initial dismay caused by its unusual design, its subsequent reception is surprisingly easy and pleasant. Big applause and kudos to the genius of Alberto Morillas for presenting a topic usually considered a difficult and extreme niche in such a way that it becomes digestible and pleasant, even for the average consumer. Of course, I realize that not everyone enjoys the scent of burnt wood, ""black label"" whiskey, and oud, but similarly tailored scents are hard to find in the mainstream, and generally speaking, this perfume has no mainstream rivals. The rich and multifaceted aroma exuded by this expressive, dry, yet warm perfume is composed of numerous, fantastically intertwined details. Absolute is the smoke of a bonfire and the interior of a noble gentlemen's club, burnt wood or the fire-blackened and smoke-smoked interior of barrels in which single malt whisky matured.
But because the barrels were leaky, the contents were quickly drained, and they lost little of their rich, burnt aroma, acquiring a noble, alcoholic aftertaste. Finally, Absolute is a temple bonfire, where a pile of precious agarwood (oud) chips was piled on the ceremonial hearth, which, in a fit of fanatical barbarism, were set ablaze in honor of some forgotten deity… The chips burned only partially, extinguished by a generous amount of alcohol, which the priest threw onto the fire, generating a vast amount of fragrant steam and smoke. Besides, even a thousand words cannot replace a single whiff of this perfume, rich in subtle nuances and utterly exquisite… Added to this are sandalwood and a wonderful, rough, slightly animalistic, and incredibly masculine leather – finished with vetiver root and blades and softened with a touch of warm patchouli… For me, it's an olfactory orgasm.
Secondly, Morillas achieved the seemingly impossible. He presented the suggestive, idiosyncratic, and distinctly niche scent of a ""burning bonfire"" in such a compelling yet accessible way that the scent intrigues and captivates even those who normally prefer fresh and casual fragrances (tested on a group of work colleagues, some of whom consider Armani Mania a good perfume 😉 ). This, of course, doesn't mean that lovers of the casual mainstream will immediately abandon their fruity juices and switch to the burnt Made in Gucci scent – but if such an unconventional and simultaneously demanding scent is received so positively, you have to admit, it bodes well for him. Guilty Absolute is distinctive, especially in its initial phase, but it's not a nose-twisting axe with crushing projection – so you won't be hurting anyone with this perfume.
Absolute smells niche and distinct, as befits the combination of notes used – yet it doesn't terrorize, overwhelm, or overwhelm with a loud or overly ubiquitous bouquet. While one might expect a higher volume level from an EdP and, considering the highly intense ingredients used, at least 10 hours of longevity, in practice you can count on a maximum of 6 hours of GGA's clearly perceptible presence on the skin. On skin, because on fabric, the scent lingers much longer and is even less prone to evolution – maintaining that distinct woody and smoky burnt note for a very long time. On the one hand, those 5-6 hours might be disappointing, but I've written more than once that, in theory, intense and highly concentrated eau de parfums and perfumes tend to smell shorter in practice than theoretically less concentrated EdT.
So Absolute isn't a long-lasting powerhouse, nor does it trail behind the wearer, leaving an exorbitantly long trail – in fact, it sticks quite close to the wearer. However, the intended amount of clouds is surprisingly pleasant, easy, and enjoyable to wear – and I personally could reapply this perfume endlessly… Alberto, Alessandro – thank you for Gucci's return in such beautiful style!.....

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"With this perfume, a new dimension opened up in my world. I gained another layer of the construction of the world. Once I made my first sniff of this perfume, I was permanently infected by the fragrant dimension/aspect of the construction of the world.

This is not just a pleasant scent. This is an unremovable experience of something elusive. Pure metaphysics.

I am now addressing beautiful, elegant and classy women: make tests if men who wear this perfume can disappoint you, mock you, or insult you. Only men who have been around the block a few times and have something to say wear this perfume. This is not a fragrance for boys in short pants. Test it!

I discovered it just by chance. I wasn’t into perfumes before. I sniffed it when my 16-year-old student went to the bathroom. It was abandoned on his shelf, covered in dust, unused for several years. He got it for his birthday. Of course, I became immediately obsessed with it. I bought it from him for the first price he quoted. No negotiation. I would have bought it from him at any price.

The world was no longer the way it used to be. I can’t imagine me without this perfume; I can’t imagine the world without this perfume. It would be like the world without jeans. Or without leather jackets. Or without apples. I have more than 10 bottles of GGA. It depends on how you count. This perfume is now part of my identity. Just like rock music. Yeah – that's a good association. This perfume definitely is a good match for rock music. I bet there are parallels between a rock heart and this scent. Just like I bet there are parallels between Dior Sauvage and cheesy pop. Once again, I'm addressing beautiful, elegant, classy women: check it out!

I don't think it makes sense to describe how GGA smells, because it smells different to each one of you. It’s a bit like trying to describe a rainbow to a blind person. And the truth of every nose is equally true. De gustibus... Someone – most likely just for fun – came up with an idea of a car repair shop, and the unsophisticated crowd picked it up. Probably because they had no other/better associations. Maybe there is some kind of repair shop here. In a moment, I'll tell you what kind of a repair shop it is. I am a qualified Automotive Technician. Back when there were no electric cars – there were only purebred gas-powered cars. And GGA doesn’t smell like a car repair shop to me. Well – everyone stretches his/her legs according to the length of his/her… imagination.

For those to whom GGA smells like a car repair shop, I suggest an evening or nighttime trip to the forest, where non-deciduous and non-coniferous giants like 1,000-year-old redwoods, larches, and cypresses reign supreme. In such a forest, in a grease-free workshop (and if grease is used, it is made from tree resins), forest elves with large beards tie the logs with leather straps to make siege engines to attack orcs. At night, especially in the forest, it is dark, so you must rely not on what you see but on what you smel. Bon appétit!",09/19/25 06:04,Witkacy.Forever
Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"I bought this fragrance like 10 years ago. Back then I found it smelling unique and strong. We used to joke about it how it would fit a cigar smoking rich old man well, I was like 23 back then. Not a lot people around me liked this scent, it's not enjoyable if you over spray. I used to do 2 sprays and found that the perfect amount to enjoy this, and believe me people will notice it. When I didn't rock this one enough I gave it to my dad. And now since he passed away I took it back and love revisiting it once in a while. It fitted my dad great.",09/15/25 10:18,NomanWadan

No way this is actually loved I could see maybe 1 out of 10 people actually enjoying this stuff and probably upsetting everyone around them. It lingers

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"****Update since 7/14/25**** So, after having sprayed a good amount of fragrance out of my bottle, and letting it sit in its box since 7/14 the performance and smell has indeed improved over-all. The projection is still quite poor, but the scent does stick around a lot more than it did initially and the fragrance does now have more ""Presence"" (Thank Goodness!). It also (now) smell way better as initially it just smelled like some sort of nasty smelling, medicinal homemade ointment or something. I'm not sure if this dna will improve any more, but as for now, Gucci Guilty Absolute is STILL a Blind-buy regret for me 100%. Again, it still does wear VERY light and if Im going to compare my experience to what most people's experience with this scent was when they made their YouTube reviews and posted their initial thoughts when this fragrance released, then there's ZERO doubt in my mind that its been through a horrible reformulation bc the way most folks describe their experience is WORLDS APART from what Im getting. Lemme put it this way, Ive tried layering my Iso e Super which is an ultra light, ""barely there"" woody experience along with this bottle of Gucci Guilty Absolue so that I get a boost in longevity, and the Iso e Super is almost OVER POWERING the Gucci Guily Absolute which is freakin' WILD to me!

Again, because of its resinous/woody nature, this fragrance truley does remind me of a much weaker version of Encre Noire L'Extreme just with what I suppose is a touch of leather in the base vs the smokey Vetiver. With heavy sprays Im getting 4 mmmaybe 5 hours of soft projection on skin and ofcourse its longer-lasting on clothes. I do admit that (NOW) since its had a chance to ""Maturate"" a bit, I dig the actual scent (Love Encre Noir L'Extreme), but (IF) Id learned that they had switched production from the U.K. to Spain and that the fragrance had been ""Reformulated"" there, or what I would call BUTCHERED, then I would NEVER have spent over $80 for a bottle. It still ticks me off when I think of how dishonest it is for Gucci to wait for the Hype to be over and for all the reviews to be in to then weaken the fragrance considerably Im sure to make production less expensive bc this was not ""a hit"" or a ""Successful Seller"", yet the price has actually gone up?! A total SCAM if ya ask me!

Ill have to get over it and stop my whinning and complaining so that I can enjoy this fragrance for what it is which is a Great smelling, al be it intimate Woodsey/Leathery fragrance. Ill be back to report any further improvements if there are any. CHEERS!",09/05/25 20:25,Morenoetrata
Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"This is a masterpiece
Meant for people who have mastered good taste.
This reminds me of Assam Oudh in the way that it makes every fragrance seem 'bodily' when added to it. By that I mean that florals, for example, seem to naturally emanate from a person's body when Oudh is added to them, rather than like an external application.
GGA does the same very well with layerings of Grey Vetiver, or with Polo Green.
Of course, it's very deeply wonderful on its own as well.",09/04/25 07:37,Katusatya
Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Against advice from just about everyone here, I blind bought Guilty Absolute, and fell in love the minute the first spray of the coffee-colored juice landed on my wrist.

Gucci has plenty of fragrances for the masses but sometimes they like to dance the line between crowdpleasing and niche. This one falls into the latter category (also see Memoire d'une Odeur, by far my favorite Gucci scent along with this one). On my skin Absolute is Jim Morrison without the booze: leather with a rock n'roll edge, mainstream sensation with an underground twist.

It's all about honest-to-god leather. It doesn't evolve much during its run (about five hours on me) but it has nuance and depth that gives it a fascinating and super sexy character. There's burning wood, there's tar, there's smoke, there's a hint of rubber. I cannot stop smelling my wrist and heaven knows I couldn't stop smelling an intimate partner's skin if they were wearing this.

With all that said, I concur with the majority here - you will be wise to sample before you buy. I lucked out but there's a good chance Absolute is not for you - it's very love-it-or-hate it, which is exactly why it works.",08/29/25 01:39,Dandy Perfume Boy

-------------------------------------------------------
Purchased sample spray book May 2022, a little later a 60mL then re-purchased 90mL July 2025.
- -
I realise I thrashed this one with my first review, but I've been thinking about it for at least 6 months. Hoping my taste opened up to modern style leathers with petroleum notes. I had to do it, and boy am I glad I reconsidered. This bottle is even more beautiful than last time. You need it in at least 90mL otherwise you got a pansy ass size. I'm even open to getting a 100mL Tuscan Leather considering the decant didn't blow me away back then either (decants don't really do the original product justice I've found), but gents! Allow me to get to the short and handy.

Today I rummaged through all the batch codes I can find and found two codes in total. I of course bought the earliest code out of the few options, AND having visited 5 locations for this I had to get it from the shop because online Guilty Absolute was still over $10 too dear for the 90mL/3oz AND no freedom of batch code checking *LONG SIGH*.

3.5 sprays just before getting back into my car, I had to rush at it. It's instantly nostalgic of something, also brutal. That opening blast is raw power maybe by The Stooges. Leather as fuck but it shortly gets even better, the moment of cloying gives way to a molasses, or booze syrupy goodness, or fresh hot caramel. I mean this baby is a liiil sweet! Then the dry down is PWOOOOOF woodsy leather. This one's for you uber mensches. Put this next to your Fahrenheit so you know you got a couple guard dogs for your enthusiast grade collection.

My past 60mL I didn't catch the batch but I believe it's the same as my new 90mL anyway, and this one smells EVEN BETTER! Sillage is monumental, projection is as expected of Fahrenheit, and ""fuck you for wearing it"" thought everybody around you ;)

Batch: 0157 from 5th June, 2020 - Coty, made in Spain.

(I believe there was a 018-something code too which is the July 2020 batch, I did some digging up today and the chick loved the idea and kind of inferred she'd buy it for a beau before I told her it's a strict uber manly scent that normal people hate. MAD KUDOS to BOLD Life&Leather with the sickest youtube channel for dude frags around. Helped me to force myself to grow even more hair on my sack before settling the score (I mean I already had decided it's time to re-buy before visiting his channel but y'know, motivation..))

EDIT:
In your faces! This sucker lasted all day. It was all I smelt, normally modern fragrances puff out about 3-6 hours before this does, including the mensch variety. I clicked on Eternal. You guys....no idea what happened to you or your bottle or your location you purchased it at.

Gucci has always been widely ripped off and faked. Buy from an actual brick and mortar, preferably batches 2021 and before (my one is June 2020 as seen above), and be done with the horrors of zero performance. I get almost no vetiver in this, thank god, instead it's much more patchouli and cypress.

BOLD Life&Leather, dude you missed out on this one. You actually nixed all Guilty Absolute bottles from your possession. Not sure if sad. But I've been on 3.5 sprays of this all day, which is why I've arrived at 5 sprays for anything to effectively combat poor performance, and this Absolute is ""still"" potent upon rubbing my fist onto my neck; it's my favourite place to spray. Your channel is awesome but having just read your review stating you've changed your mind is almost mindblowing.

I urge all you cats out there to reconsider GUILTY ABSOLUTE, because I'm guilty of changing my own mind on this one! Well, I'm not new to going from hate to love and staying there. Coty made in Spain bottles are legitimate and genuine and I don't wanna hear it.

2ND EDIT:
Deep down in the base it reminds me of Bentley Intense. Gents, if you're on the fence with Guilty Absolute then try Fahrenheit and Bentley Intense at the same time. If you can handle that then you may press the next chapter button.",07/25/25 18:53,SPNKr

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Did a blind buy after reading all the reviews. And its great. A made in spain bottle. But..

A lot sweeter than i thought (which is bad and not what i wanted) And nothing brutal at all as some say. Either I got a weak mix or people are exaggerating as hell. Reminds me of fahrenheit later on and d&g the one in the beginning. Longevity is moderate to weak. Sillage ok to weak.

Bought another bottle right away to see if the the Spain is bad. A bit disappointed because i wanted rubber, leather, medicinal and cow feces. Got any tips?

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"I bought a mini as I didn't know what to expect especially with people saying it was extremely animalic and barnyardy, but I the love fragrance. I don't get the animalic references at all but maybe I'm still a noob when it comes to notes. All I know is I smell smooth rugged (oxymoron?) leather, with incense like smoke and earthy patchouli with a slight note of something I can only describe as gasoline. There's also a somewhat similarity to a orange likeness to it (which suits the presentation). Now you might think yeah that's heavy as hell and maybe it is in some respects, but it works here.

This is for sure masculine and although it has slight sweetness, it's more of a end result rather than intention. It's not a monster projector but it's not weak either, it's more of a 2 feet scent bubble that has good longevity. So you wont be blowing up a room when you enter it but if people are near you they will get whiffs of it. This is the type of fragrance where less is more. 2-3 sprays is more than enough, because if you spray more and it will change it's charm. Sample first and make up your own mind, for me this is on my radar to get a bottle.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Absolute is a fragrance characterized by a distinct and linear scent profile. It is reminiscent of a well-worn pair of leather boot, evoking a sense of history and resilience. The fragrance combines earthy notes with a hint of oil, bandaids, petrol, wood, antiseptic disinfectant, and surprisingly, a touch of blood.

While this fragrance may not appeal to everyone, it is often perceived as a niche scent, only packaged in a designer bottle. Its boldness can be overwhelming, and it is typically worn by individuals who want to make a statement about their personal preferences and interests. The fragrance lasts the entire day, but its projection diminishes beyond 1.5 hours, becoming a moderate projection thereafter. My bottle is from the batch number 8173.

Gucci Guilty Absolute is predominantly masculine in nature, and its appeal may be limited to individuals above the age of 25.

But guess what, he is woke, and he is a liberal because he knows what human suffering is, he knows that there are bigger things than him, and he is a secure man who understands the concept of acceptance and basic human decency.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"I got Gucci Guilty Absolute as a present last year, I'm extremely positive about this fragrance. It's not an easy going, mainstream fragrance. This is for people who want to stand out. If this doesn't sound attractive to you, then don't get this fragrance.

With that being said. The fragrance is quite linear in my opinion. During the opening the leather and woods are very prominent. The leather leans towards the animalic kind. The woods smell fresh and sharp. Once the fragrance has dried down the vetiver starts to be noticeable. The ingredients smell like they are of high quality. The fragrance is long lasting, and the sillage is good. Call me crazy, but I like wearing this fragrance on hotter days: you simply smell wild, and extremely masculine. The fragrance can withstand heat with ease.

Seasons: All seasons, personally I love wearing it during summer (evenings).
Strength: 9/10
Sillage: 8/10
Remark: If you want you stand out, smell like fresh woods and animalic leather. Then this fragrance is for you. Wouldn't recommend it for daily use, rather for special occasions.

Grade: 9/10",03/18/25 11:22,Axel.O

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"This perfume is like drugs, maybe disliked at first try but a small dose after small dose gets people hooked for good.
On paper it is a weird industrial greasy leather factory smell but somehow, I can’t get enough of it, I could smell this all day.

The fact that it is produced by a designer house who typically makes mass appealing mainstream perfumes; and that it is sold for this price made me appreciate the perfume even more.

For Gucci to take the trouble and go out of their comfort zone not only to release it, but to keep it in production until now is a ballsy move that they deserve credit for.

I'd like to think that this is their way of giving back to perfume society, a non-profitable charity for the sake of perfume art.",02/19/25 15:13,AEyup
Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"This scent was the reason I had to make an account. It managed to come back full circle with me and fascinates me. One day a co-worker that shares the fragrance chasing interest with me brought it in. Now I'm no expert nose mind you but first whiff gave me nothing but gasoline. I hated it. Then throught the day for some reason I kept coming back to the bottle to smell it. It kept growing on me and I have no idea why.

Within one shift I went from absolutely repulsed by it to trying it on. The opening reminds me of like i said before, gasoline. However it's not jarring to me anymore. The dry down is where i definitely smell the leather but it gets more soft leather smelling throughout the day rather than just being that brand new leather smell that i usually don't like. Think of like a 15 year old car with well kept moistured original leather interior smell, it's very pleasant to me.

This scent is what i would say offensive at first whiff. This is what you'd want to wear on a day you woke up and chose violence. It's like flipping people off in scent form, but for some reason they might want to keep smelling the scent (like i did).

Longevity I'd give slightly above moderate (4-6hrs), sillage the low side of moderate after about 2-3 hrs it become a skin scent with me.

So, this was definitely an acquired taste for me but has now become addicting to smell. Just has me wishing for more performance, I will definitely be picking up a bottle though!",02/17/25 03:28,Nuka

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Perfectly blended leather woody aromatic.

At first this reminded me of a leather goods store. Then I sat with it and picked up the cypress and patchouli, and that's where I really started to enjoy this fragrance. This is a dry fragrance with only a crumb of that spicy sweet patchouli in terms of sweetness. The smokiness is there, but it's subtle and kind of in the background. I don't find it earthy or animalic, but from reading some other reviews, it certainly appears to trigger that animalic note for some.

The only downside for me is that projection drops off a cliff around the 6 hour mark, but that leather note sticks to my skin long after that. I'm still going to reapply this after 6-7 hours though, because the magic of this fragrance is in the composition.

You probably want to go light on the sprays with this one, as it is very strong.

Is this mass appealing? God no. Only buy this if you know you like leather fragrances. Is this safe for work? Absolutely not. Will it make you smell like a horse? Some people seem to think so :)

Edit: I've since come to learn that this fragrance is considered quite challenging for a lot of people, so I just wanted to add a heads up. I mean it, this is not for everyone.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Want to love this especially given the punchiness in the opening and the funk in the top notes, leathery with the patchouli and wood coming through to give a complex styraxy resin note reminiscent of the drydown of Bvlgari Man's Terrae Essence and an unusual, patchouli-leather stank which I found very interesting.

Unfortunately this only lasts a few minutes before it devolves into a combination of cheap shoe shop, burnt rubber, hot car interior, gasoline, and barber shop floor. Most of the interesting complexity is gone leaving behind a horrible chemical mess. It eventually dies down to a quieter tarred leather note on the skin which certainly isn't worth the journey.

I am experimenting with layering to try and salvage this perfume and its unique top notes. Although many have described this as a ""bold"" scent, gasoline and dirty cheap rubber slipper sole isn't the bold message I'd like to get across.

All in all, interesting concept, and I do love the unique, almost stanky funk before the gasoline strikes, which on first sniff do remind me of Trussardi Behind the Curtain Alla Scala or a more leathery Terrae Essence - both perfumes I do love, but the drydown is mediocre and middle period frankly unpleasant.

Once the top notes have faded though, it does get more wearable. Projection is decent and longevity is great! Definitely a unique mens fragrance, not something you come across often. This would pass as a niche perfume to my nose.",01/15/25 03:54,irisbowy

The incredible opening is there to hook you into the sale, if you're lucky enough to like it.

It settles down on the skin, to smell like suede, with the Band Aids still present and stays linear. Given that it's such a distinctive and possibly unique smell, I guess being linear is more than forgivable.

It's probably filling the room, but I think I've gone a bit nose blind. I have no idea how it would smell to anyone entering the space. Letting a little get on your clothes seems to keep this stuff kicking. A few more wears to see if I stay loving this punchy fragrance",01/13/25 16:29,Jim_Smith

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Premieres of the caliber of this perfume, happen once every decade or so, or even less frequently. So this snide, condescending and perhaps somewhat over-the-top title should come as no surprise to any of you. Let's face it, the chance that any of the mainstream brands (I'm deliberately excluding the niche here, especially its orthodox, non-commercialized faction) will present a fragrance as bold, original and ambitious as Gucci Guilty Absolute, is close to zero
What shocks and at the same time delights most is not the ambivalent name, but the fragrance composition itself. And what a fragrance composition! It smells of real, masculine leather, heavy and deep agar, wood and burnt and still smelling of fire and smoke barrels, after single malt whiskey! Something so massive, deep, masculine, uncompromising, bold, rich and avant-garde at the same time, I would expect sooner from an orthodox non-commercial niche - than from a brand that until a week ago I considered the archetype of a producer of extremely poor mass-market. And here it turns out that the last of the Guilty, the culmination and crowning achievement of the entire series (it's an EdP) - is its total negation, a 180-degree turnaround and, ironically, the jewel in the crown!
A gem that smells like the sacred and profane, niche and dark - like a combination of Fumidus, with Black Tourmaline and Petroleum, i.e. the niche of the niche! Frankly speaking, I would not have expected such an ambitious fragrance even from Hermes, Lalique (despite the existence of Encre Noire) and Mugler - i.e. brands bold and confident enough in their position to still treat the art of perfumery in a responsible and uncompromising manner. And suddenly among them there is a player from whom no one would have expected it - and whose launch has completely shattered the order, and the balance of power, in perfumery. Here appears a fragrance that is so sincerely and fervently sorry for its sins ( guilty), that it genuinely washed away and redeemed in my eyes all the previous faults of its brand... Guilty Absolute really surprised me, ba shook and moved me to the living - and believe me, it is difficult to surprise me with something else....
The scent makes an electrifying impression and surprises with its smoky and burnt (burntwood) bouquet, and after the first consternation, caused by its unusual cut - its further reception is surprisingly easy and pleasant... Here a big round of applause and tribute to the genius of Alberto Morillas, for presenting the subject matter, which is usually categorized as a difficult and extreme niche - in such a way that it became digestible and friendly, even for the average consumer. Of course, I realize that not everyone likes the scent of burnt wood, “black label ” whiskey and oud - but similarly tailored fragrances in the mainstream can hardly be found, and in general these perfumes have no competition in the mainstream. The rich and multifaceted aroma that these expressive and dry yet warm perfumes spread - consists of a great many, fantastically correlated details. Absolute is the smoke of a campfire and the interior of a noble gentleman's club, burnt wood or the fire-smoked and smoke-smoked interior of barrels - in which single malt whisky was matured .
But because the barrels were leaky, so the contents were drained rather quickly and did not lose much of their rich burnt aroma, itself gaining a noble alcoholic aftertaste. Finally, Absolute is a temple bonfire, where a pile of precious agarwood (oud) slivers were placed on the ceremonial hearth, which in a fit of fanatical barbarism were set on fire, in honor of some forgotten deity... The slivers burned only partially, extinguished by a large amount of alcohol, which the priest splashed on the fire, generating a huge amount of fragrant steam and smoke. Anyway, not even a thousand words can substitute for a single sniff of this rich in subtle nuances and arcy exquisite perfume... Added to this are sandalwood and a wonderful, rough, somewhat animal and incredibly masculine leather - which was finished with root and vetiver blades and softened with a touch of warm patchouli
Secondly, Morillas has accomplished something seemingly impossible. He has presented the evocative, specific and eminently niche scent of “burnt fire” in such an evocative and at the same time approachable way that the fragrance intrigues and delights even people with a taste for freshers and casuals (tested in practice on a group of colleagues, some of whom think Armani Mania is a good perfume ). This, of course, does not mean that lovers of the casual mainstream will abandon their fruity juices out of the blue and switch to the burnt Made in Gucci - but if such an unconventional and at the same time challenging fragrance is received so positively, you have to admit, it bodes very well for it. Guilty Absolute is expressive, especially in its initial phase, but at the same time it is not a nose-twisting axe, with crushing projection - so you won't hurt anyone with this perfume.
Absolute smells niche and specific as befits the resultant repertoire of notes used - but at the same time it does not terrorize, tire or overwhelm with an overly loud or overly ubiquitous bouquet. Admittedly, one would expect a higher level of volume from EdP and, given the highly intense ingredient used - at least 10 hours of longevity, but in practice one can count on at most 6 hours, a well perceptible presence of GGA on the skin. On skin, because on fabric the fragrance lasts much longer and is even less eager to evolve - keeping that distinct touch of woody-smoky burn in the foreground for a very long time. On the one hand, those 5-6 hours may be disappointing, but I've written more than once that in theory intense and maximally concentrated eau de parfum and perfume - in practice they like to smell shorter than theoretically less concentrated EdT. So Absolute is not a titan of longevity, nor does it drag behind the wearer, leaving a skyrocketing tail - it even stays quite close to the wearer, but this set number of clouds wears surprisingly nice, easy and pleasant - by the way, personally I could reapply this perfume to myself indefinitely... Alberto, Alessandro - thank you that Gucci is back in such beautiful style!

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Opening

Gucci Guilty Absolute kicks things off with an unapologetic blast of raw leather, like stepping into an old leather workshop filled with aged hides and well-used tools. The opening is bold, medicinal, and almost jarring, conjuring images of freshly opened band-aids or even motor oil. But just beneath the rugged surface, a subtle sweetness starts to peek through, likely from the patchouli. It’s not the kind of sweetness that softens the leather’s edge; instead, it weaves itself into the rough textures, adding a faint, earthy richness that complements rather than contrasts the leather's rawness.


Heart

As the initial leather dominance settles, the cypress begins to emerge, introducing a dry, aromatic greenness that plays beautifully with the earthy patchouli. Here, the sweetness hinted at in the opening starts to develop further, lending a slightly balsamic warmth that tempers the ruggedness just enough. It’s not overt or sugary—think more of a natural, resinous sweetness that feels almost woodsy in character. The fragrance at this stage is like being deep in a forest, where the scent of aged leather mingles with moss-covered trees and the faint mustiness of damp earth.

Dry Down

In the dry down, Gucci Guilty Absolute remains true to its opening, but there’s a newfound depth as the woody notes begin to take on a slightly smoky character, courtesy of the vetiver. The patchouli continues to add that touch of sweetness, but it’s well-blended, always lurking in the background, enhancing the leather's natural warmth without ever becoming cloying. The result is a linear yet addictive scent that maintains its rugged identity throughout, while slowly revealing more nuanced facets.

Longevity

Performance is impressive, with the scent lasting easily over 8 hours and projecting strongly for the first few. Even as it dries down, Gucci Guilty Absolute refuses to fade quietly; it lingers in a way that ensures you’re always aware of its presence. It may soften, but the leather never truly lets go.

Versatility

This is not a scent for all seasons or settings. Gucci Guilty Absolute thrives in cooler weather, where its boldness can be fully appreciated. The fragrance is best suited for evening wear, leather jackets, and chilly nights—perfect for when you want to leave a distinct impression. It’s too rugged for a casual day at the office or a summer outing but shines during moments when you want to express individuality and confidence.

In Short

Gucci Guilty Absolute is a bold and unapologetic leather fragrance with a touch of earthy sweetness, courtesy of the patchouli. It’s a statement piece that stays true to itself from start to finish, appealing to those who appreciate rugged, masculine scents with a refined edge. If you’re looking for something versatile and crowd-pleasing, look elsewhere; this is for the wearer who dares to be different.",10/15/24 22:06,chrisivE

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"I just got a test bottle of this………
4 sprays to the chest and arms:

Somewhere in Northern Europe, a tall, strong, bearded, gothic looking man in his mid 40’s has been expertly splitting logs with an axe in a dense forest in October and he is now sitting inside a moss covered wooden cabin peering into a medicine cupboard, looking for fresh bandages after cutting his hand 2 days ago fixing his truck. His cabin is warm and a wood stove burns brightly, next to a neat stack of seasoned birch logs. The other end of the cabin is adorned with whole fresh animal skins he has trapped or hunted…..fox, weasel, beaver, deerskins and little piles of prepared leather he uses to make knife sheaths and belts and small bags. There is a well used chainsaw there also next to a can of gasoline, 2 stroke and chain oil. Plenty of hand tools…knives, chisels, spanners, hammers, a socket set (metric 🤣) animal traps etc.

That’s what this smells like straight out the gate.
I like it.
Not surprised that it’s discontinued though. It’s very much a niche profile I would say. It’s going to suit some people, in some places, at some times, but you definitely need to get a sample before you buy a full bottle.
Definitely not for all guys and I’d say the situation in which you wear this is equally important to the kind of person wearing it.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"This is the leather perfume I have been searching for. Dry woody spicy well worn leather, not new leather like Ombre Leather or fruity like Tuscan Leather. Maybe more like a saddle, an old arm chair in a smoking room. Part of that leather smell can be a bit gasoline, bandaids depending on your scent associations. I get those but I don’t find them off putting in any way.

It lingers a long time but doesn’t project massively after the initial blast. Then it’s a light aromatic patchouli and leather.

Not for everyone, but then if you don’t like leather you are probably not in the target demographic. This is one to spray on your motorcycle jacket or when you don’t feel like some sweet smelling mass appealing elixer.",09/29/24 11:28,JaySentz

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"""How much leather do you want?''; ''Yes.''

Super cool fragrance. It reminds me of the most worn out brown leather belt that my dad used to beat me with. No, I'm joking lol. But it does reminds me of a very old skool genuine leather belt. Cool and unique. Not overly complex. Generic woody structures, slightly smokey earthy vetiver adding slight nuances to that very dominating rugged leather. A very present patchouli ''dank''. But you're getting that leather from start to finish. Not something I would wear but I can respect it.

You have to really wear that leather with confidence or else it will wear you. You gotta be ready for it. Good projection and lasts very long

Legendary, bold, iconic leather!

EDIT: I just realized I am getting a type of leather that was present in PP No Limit... no suprise, considering it has the same parfumer behind it. Even tho its strong it is not at all annoying and messy like No Limit. I find that one absolutely atrocious. Alberto is a veteran parfumer that is very loved by fragrance houses for his ability to really capture the brands image and create what is asked to the letter. While this is very stern and bold as well. It got the italian gucci flair written all over it. Meanwhile PP is a brand catering to a more... ''obnoxious'' crowd for lack of better term lol. I think it's not really his fault for making atrocious scents here and there. He's a machine that creates things for whoever can afford it.",09/24/24 12:10,fragrantlyenhanced

I only find it practical to wear Gucci Guilty Absolute (GGA) for cruising at a bar, just two or three sprays max under my thick black leather shirt and pants to amplify the natural odor of the garments.

Absolute virility with no sweetness, fruitiness or the like. Can't go wrong with cowboys, alpha men and badass bosses with an attitude. First hour is way too potent, then subsides but does last well over seven hours. Try before buying. GGA is low on versatility yet high on distinctiveness.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"Gucci really went all out on this one, and I’m loving it! I know I’m late to the party, as it’s been released and discontinued before I ever got the chance to try it. Luckily I managed to snag two 150ml bottles on eBay of this beauty—or beast, depending on your perspective.

To me, it’s perfection with a few limitations on usability. It's definitely not an office fragrance. It’s unapologetic, bold, raw, masculine badassery in a bottle, guaranteed to put some hair on your chest—and probably everyone else’s within a 10-foot radius, man, woman, or child. Some describe it as smelling like chainsaw oil on leather or old leather mechanic gloves found in a vintage Harley Davidson’s toolbox, and I totally resonate with those vibes.

It lasts for days, so be careful not to overspray. Even 90ml will probably last you a lifetime, but I just love having backup bottles of my favourites, especially the discontinued ones. I’d say it’s Definitely not a blind buy even to I blind bought it . I kind of know what I like , one of my favourites is Tom Ford noir anthracite and dry darker frags . in general I mostly end up liking the controversial stuff so I went for GGA . I’d say if you liked the OG Dior Fahrenheit edt the chances are you will love this one too. In conclusion , it’s magic in a bottle, proceed with caution.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"This fragrance, like dior Fahrenheit, It is a hit or miss. This is one of those “test before you buy” try to get a sample decant or at least spray a tester on your skin or paper first to a nearby retail store, if you find one. To my skin, it smells exactly what you would expect. Pure Masculinity in a bottle, it is leathery which would comes off putting to a person who usually tend for modern, brighter or safer fragrances i.e; blue, bubblegum, aquatics etc.

This is the same category as Lalique Encre Noire, Mancera Red Tobacco, and Tom Ford Tuscan Leather, in my book. Ombre Leather can easily be passed in my opinion but Tuscan Leather, much like this fragrance, you must be someone who tends to love these type of scents.

Personally, I actually love it, even at first sniff. I bought one in discounters, it was fairly cheap for a big bottle so why not? Ever since then, I love the smell even more, although, personally my girlfriend seems to not like it. Which is understandable, due to its vibe it exudes. However, I wear it time after time, it performs great on my skin, overall a nice fragrance for me that is unique, mature, and masculine.

This petrol smell is a hit or miss for people, definitely not a compliment getter. Some people may find this scent interesting and some may find it too animalic and harsh. To me, I find the scent interesting from a technical standpoint but I would never wear this. I sprayed this once and it filled the entire room with a petroleum smell and completely out projected anything else I had on my skin. If you are buying this, I do advise be careful. It’s not wearable in almost any scenario. I don’t even know where you can wear this other than a drag race. To be fair the dry down isn’t as petrol like as the initial spray, you get more of that woody note later on but even then it’s very very hard to wear. I don’t recommend you buy this unless you truly do want to smell petrol like.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"I see a lot of comparisons drawn between this fragrance and Encre Noire or Dark Lord, which I understand. After all, there's not much to compare this to in the designer realm, especially in this era.

It shares the earthy vetiver note with Encre Noire. And it has a medicinal accord similar to Dark Lord. But it doesn't smell exactly like either. Guilty Absolute is much more wearable than either, in my opinion. It has a sweetness that tries to surface occasionally due to the patchouli. But make no mistake, this is anything but a sweet scent. The opening is a punch in the face-- it smells strongly of leather and camphor, which I suspect is the cypress note. After the dry down, however, the scent becomes slightly woodier and earthier. It's still all about the leather though, and although it's listed as a top note, it lasts all the way through. This fragrance isn't super complex and it's fairly linear.

I find this fragrance oddly addictive, but it's definitely not for everyone. I've heard it described as a classy scent by a couple other reviewers, which I find a bit amusing. If anything, it's the opposite of a classy scent. It's raw, intense, dry, and dirty. I don't think a corporate suit will be wearing this to a board meeting anytime soon.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"It's a good thing I bought this when it first came out. Before the shutdown and prices were jacked up at levels unheard of, almost at niche price fragrances.
At first spray, I pick up a rubbery vib mixed with leather and a spicy blend. There's an undertone of a clean, slight sweet, almost floral note. It has a slight complex blend with a vintage aroma which has been turned into a more modern frag.
The only two notes I don't get is vertier and mint? Idk whether it was added in such a minuit amount, it's not even worth post it as an ingredients.
Longevity and Sillage is excellent! If all fragrance had the Longevity like this juice, I might consider spending a few $$ more.
This is a most suitable for evenings and fall/winter months. Too strong for the day, but excellent if ure clubbing late in the evening.
This is confident frag which tells everyone, I'm secure of who I am. Most definitely 9.5/10",04/10/24 22:47,aqua_de_la_vita
Gucci Guilty Absolute Gucci,"AWESOME, testosteronic man juice, very dry, without a hint of sweetness. This scent is to the grape juice/bubble gum boys what garlic is to a vampire. lol Main scents I get here after dry down are leather, let me repeat, LEATHER, mineral spirits and subtle smokiness and earthiness. No gasoline or petrol scent (as in Fahrenheit) but mineral spirits. If you've ever cleaned paint brushes in mineral spirits, you'll know what I mean. Overall, this scent reminds me very closely of the scent of oil based Color Putty®, for those of you who have done finish carpentry with stained hardwood trim.

For such a hyper masculine fragrance, muscular performance is expected and Guilty Absolute does not disappoint. Excellent longevity, projection and sillage. Up the sprays and they'll know you walked in the room or maybe you'll knock 'em dead. hahaha And no surprise - another awesome creation by Mr. Morillas. Dude is a genius.

It’s a little curious. Spicy and projects well, yet wood is laid back and soft up close. What’s peaking out from behind? Dusty musk is an off-putting chore to work past. It dominates the foreground. No thank you.

Faint, yet much needed sweetness balances out dry down. Grungy oily leather in an exotic sandy desert.",04/05/24 14:31,weazal

Think of a scent Indiana Jones or Lara Croft would wear whenever they are on a quest in a temple looking for an ancient artifact that can bring Lovecraftian horrors to our world
Leather jacket + all black jeans and combat boots would be a great outfit (for either gender)
You won't have any issue with the performance, 3 sprays is all you need for solid 8 hours

I'll happily take this well-executed Russian leather effect over any Aventus-style Del Monte tinned fruit cocktail à la blowtorched bitumen roofing felt I've smelt. Wild guess--maybe don't spray it on as if you're trying to kill Godzilla. You're probably less likely to detest it if you walk through a mist of just a few sprays of it a few times. Four sprays total is probably enough. Spraying this directly onto anything may be excessive.

As for Kouros--fine, you don't have to like that either, but its position as an epoch-making classic is assured. That's why you get to rubbish it several decades after its release.

Gucci Rush Summer Gucci,"Here’s a revised version of the review:

---

Gucci Rush Summer is all about that burst of bergamot—it’s crisp, lively, and gives the fragrance a unique edge. The bergamot really stands out, making the scent feel fresh and invigorating without being too sharp.

There’s a perfect balance here, where the bergamot leads, but the other notes blend in seamlessly, creating a smooth, well-rounded scent. It’s light and easy to wear, with just enough staying power to keep you smelling great throughout the day.",08/23/24 19:38,BobbyShawarmah
Gucci Rush Summer Gucci,It’s like a lighter version of rush 2 with a slight hint of the og rush. Almost no projection it’s a skin scent. I always loved the projection and longevity of 1&2. It’s nice and soft with some added freshness,05/04/23 10:32,Gigi7891
Gucci Rush Summer Gucci,"I was able to get my hands on a brand new bottle of GR Summer as a total blind buy and I must say I am in love.

I am truly in love with this one. And now to use it sparingly cuz I don't want to run out!!! lol

The original Rush is full of white flowers, however there patchouli and peaches take the stage. Here, white flowers have their chance. Smelling Rush Summer is like smelling Rush which is missing its addictive spicy coriander, sweet vanilla, fruity peach and herbal patchouli. Rush Summer is 20% original Rush and 80% bergamot. It's basically the floral side of Rush in a bottle, great, logical choice by Gucci.",04/09/20 15:45,bel.gravia

I really like it and I can totally see this on me in the summer but there's no way I could switch to this over the original.

To me, it reminds me of TM Alien, probably the jasmine, but if that were in a soap bar. A strange way of describing it, but there is a lot of florals in this that come across as soapy to me, not that it's a bad thing. What I'm left with is a beautiful, clean floral scent that lasts most of the day and lasts for days on clothing, it seems!

Wear with caution to work, it might be headache-inducing, just a little goes a long way, great for the cooler weather I think. Still not sold on these, in my opinion, plastic-looking bottles, but thats only a minor thing.",11/12/25 20:23,hysteria1988

More of a skin scent, it’s a cozy, soft, rather soapy Jasmine. Very calming and classy smelling. If there was a shampoo & body wash that smelled like this I’d buy it in a heart beat - I wish I could smell like this from head to toe 24/7. I love it!",11/10/25 10:51,JesScent

I remember smelling a GOURGEOUS green Gucci perfume called Flora looong ago, and I couldn't afford it or wouldn't buy at the time. I thought I had secured it now. But I see that what I have never forgotten was an older perfume called Gucci Flora, perhaps Eau de toilette or perfume, possibly 2009.
This is not that.

This smells like Earl Grey tea in a British garden in the afternoon, a sunny day in southern England. But really weak, even though I have oversprayed it to sense something.
(Which in a way I am grateful for after having had respiratory panic recently from trying on La vie est belle again and trying Roberto Cavalli le parfume).
It is winter now so this is obviously the wrong season.
I must say this would be perfect for a wedding, a Midsummer party, any kind of nicer event in the spring or summer. It is not going to make those that hate perfume cough or side-eye you.

Smells apart from the Bergamott, slightly peppery and very subtly floral (Jasmine and Magnolia). Hm. Not something i will buy again but it would suit those seeking subtle, floral, fresh, summer, nicer garden parties.",11/06/25 04:48,The most freebies

The florals do start off really strong and I can understand the air freshener comparison, which was not an issue I had when spraying lightly and smelling it on clothing? As it softens, it gets so much better lol It becomes a soft white floral scent with a hint of rose and woody undercurrent

It's best for spring, it would be too cloying for summer!

I get a bit of citrus but it accompanies the jasmine note in the most perfect way. I envision a child of the forest to smell like this, something that was once a blooming field of flowers transformed into a living and breathing creature..it's wonderful. on the skin the bergamot note shines and casts a lovely bright glow over the fragrance!

It’s a very clean jasmine scent overall, the smallest touch of sweetness but aldehydic. It’s a softer jasmine too and has a very soft citrus dry down overall. I was given this as a gift from my mother as a “you’re a grown woman now” gift because I moved abroad alone in a country with 0 family, it’s the perfect scent to capsulate this mature period of my life and similar moments.

I'm not normally a fan of citrus smells but the jasmine mixes with the mandarin so nicely, it gives more of a bergamont/tea/cozy smell than an orangeade/summery/beachy citrus feel.

A cold, mentholated jasmine bush. A high-end bathroom freshener. The smell of cleanlyness with a hint of Mugler Alien.
I usually like jasmine, but while this is relatively genetle, it has a certain powdery skank about it. It smells quite off on skin, like something diry under something clean, but in the air and on paper it smells just like a high-end soap.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Out of the Flora range, this might be my favorite so far. The jasmine here is soft and mellow, nothing like the sharp jasmines I’ve recently sampled. It’s been blended into a much gentler, more atmospheric scent. It has a rainy, fresh-green vibe, it feels like a bouquet of wildflowers after a spring shower. For some reason, I get a violet note, even though it’s not listed. Maybe it's just nostalgia, as it reminded me of picking tiny violet bouquets as a child. It has that tender, dewy innocence.

The scent is simple, but in a way that works. Lovely, but very one-dimensional. This doesn't smell like a designer fragrance in terms of depth or complexity. If I found this at a drugstore for €20, I’d buy it without hesitation. But at full price, it doesn’t deliver on the luxury front, especially considering the poor longevity.

Still, it’s a beautiful option if you prefer fresh florals over sweet or gourmand scents (like I do). It’s elegant in a quiet, soft way. I haven’t tried Gorgeous Orchid yet, so the verdict on the full range is still open, but Jasmine definitely stands out for now.",05/10/25 04:11,MetaMystic
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,I probably will not buy this unless I get a good deal because of the aforementioned laundry/artificial smell which is more obvious when it dries down.

It has a rather one-dimensional quality, which was ultimately disappointing. The scent is bright and floral, featuring fragrant jasmine. While it’s not bad by any means and I still find it quite pleasant, I don’t find it particularly interesting. I often find myself reaching for this perfume on mild spring days when I'm unsure of what to wear.

The opening citrusy notes clash with the patchouli, giving a sharp cheap undertone to the whole thing right at the start, but after that cacophony dies down, I get a the most plain boring woody flower scent I can imagine.
The scent is quietly sitting close to the skin as if it was ashamed of itself for resembling a cheap Avon fragrance, and quite frankly, it should be.",05/06/25 04:03,ElinfromtheMoon
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"i honestly love this perfume, its a unique scent to me because you do get the clean jasmine smell but you also get hints of rose and there's a little ?kick? idk how to describe it but its a good type of ""kick"" i never knew what it was until now, its the black pepper. this is my favorite jasmine perfume ever and probably top 5 floral perfumes with gucci bloom and gorgeous gardenia. its very soft and feminine i saw a review saying its unisex but i dont think so at all, its a bit overpriced but if you can splurge buy the big bottle youre going to want to pour this all over. it has average longevity and projection i wish it lasted longer.",05/02/25 20:48,nuniBOenthusiast
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I liked this on paper, but on my skin, it really just smells like baby wipes. I'm generally a fan of white florals, but I think this perfume showed me that I need more greenness and freshness with them than I'm getting here.",04/28/25 17:59,ill made knight
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This is my least favorite fragrance in the range so far.

Not because it’s bad, but because I find it quite dull and flat: Flora Gorgeous Jasmine smells like clean jasmine, nothing more, nothing less.

I think it will appeal to fans of subtle, clean, or white floral fragrances, but it’s missing something to truly excite me.",04/28/25 02:19,Saveria
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I just could'n belive my luck, cause l got this beautiful perfume for a steel, for only 20$ (200Nkr), the shop was moving, so, l also bought another 4 different bottles...

And, it's a BIG, full, 3.3FL.OZ bottle! -Shit always happens, but sometimes dreams come true, l have been sniffing and sniffing this gorgeous perfume for so many ys now, and friday 11th of april was defently my lucky day!

This perfume is sjasmin, and moore sjasmin, and l absolutely love sjasmins, l have a few bottles of sjasmin-perfumes, but this one ""take the cake"", norwegian say, and, but/hmm/yes, there is this slightly public toilett smell to it, but in fact it's a compliment, cause we all love this (fill in) good stuff!",04/13/25 01:40,Mona Lygre
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This perfume smells like when u just open a water bottle and jasmine, in a good way! It’s incredibly refreshing, wonderful for summer days, it smells like fresh linen and jasmine or idk it has a very nice clean, morning dew smell into it that makes it different from other jasmine smells and that I personally love. I wouldn’t blind buy this fragrance bc of how overpowering the jasmine + mandarin combo might be for some, but if you like jasmine scents then definitely go to a shop and give it a spray!",04/12/25 10:20,Giapavonini

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I thought I would love this because I absolutely love anything jasmine-forward, but I didn’t get the jasmine at all, mostly just the citrus notes and rose.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,I can't believe I contemplated returning this! It was a blind buy from Costco. Out of the box I sprayed it and thought I will return this. I usually go for gourmand scents. I decided to give it a chance on my Saturday at home. I used it after my shower and it has been so beautiful all day long.,03/15/25 16:41,pammyhoney
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,This is like a jasmine assemblage. This also screams heavy floral and is more of a grandma-ish scent to me. I get a lot of the jasmine but not much of the citrus. I love how 'old' smelling this is.,03/15/25 13:10,miakat888
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Jasmine flowers without anything earthy or green, very clean white floral. Dries into a buttery sandalwood on me. Unique and 100% unisex. Citrus? Pepper? Rose? Patchouli? Not really. This is a white floral forward.",03/08/25 16:07,torreykongjr
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I tried it at the Gucci store and I decided to buy it for my wife, because I knew I would love to smell it on her.

A pure white floral scent, luxurious and elegant, it enhances her gentle beauty.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I sprayed this once onto my shirt today at around 2 pm. The jasmine smelled a bit artificial, in that it was not photorealistic and one dimensionally sweet/floral. However, it's now 10 pm and I keep getting whiffs of One Day's Jasmine Tea (a favourite of mine), even though I've not applied it. I suppose the dry down might be similar? Either way, I'm pleased.",02/23/25 22:02,GrenouillesNase
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I absolutely LOVE this fragrance. It smells like fresh laundry on a warm summer day. Jasmine at its very best form !! It’s warm, soft, clean, skin-like, day time, night time, all seasons; I LOVE IT. Good sillage and lasts long too! 10/10 !",02/22/25 13:24,Lenniecha

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"A beautiful elegant floral with a vintage vibe and a hint of fruits in the background. Reminds me a lot of La Prairie Life threads silver but less sharp, no aokmoss and easier to wear. Finished my 10ml decant and ordered a full bottle. I have some issues with the longevity as many fragranticans reviewers have pinpointed but still I like it a lot and I think it's worth the money.
So far, my favorite from the Gorgeous Collection, still got the Orchid to try out though.",02/03/25 13:47,dina
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Soft but fresh lovely floral. I had no expectations when I sprayed it, so it was a pleasant surprise. Not the biggest fan of those notes usually, but in this perfume they come nicely together. Would rate it 8/10.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I went into this fully expecting to hate it because I dislike every single top and heart note listed, but I can definitely say while I didn’t love it, it wasn’t unpleasant at all. This reminds me of walking through a flower garden after a spring rain; it’s very light and clean smelling. I am one of the people who thinks this is reminiscent to cleaning products or bathroom air freshner, but it’s not nearly as astringent or bitter. This one isn’t for me but if you like fresh/light citrus and sweeter jasmines, you’d probably like this.",01/23/25 11:47,conquerorofgargoyles
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This is now one of my staple perfumes. I love that it smells fresh and floral, but not overpowering. Most floral scents I've smelled in the past gave an old lady vibe.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"i've made a review on this scent before but i love it so much im making a separate update. i will literally forever defend this fragrance. as a jasmine lover, this is truly the most beautiful, elegant jasmine. the black pepper note didn't make sense to me when i first sampled this, but it actually ended up being pretty prominent in a surprisingly good way. it gives a little kick to the fragrance, making it just unique enough but still wearable for daily use. i can see this fragrance working in all seasons and occasions too. the best out of all new gucci flora line imo!",01/19/25 19:41,000.rla

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Judging by the list of notes, and my overall appreciation of Mr Morillas's artistry, and especially his many great creations for the house of Gucci, I should be enchanted by this fragrance. But, somehow, I'm not - in fact, I absolutely despise it. As several other reviewers have observed, this supposedly 'Gorgeous Jasmine' smells very synthetic, loud, syrupy even, with the note of sweet mandarine mixing horribly with jasmine and magnolia - they seem to highlight each others' worst facets. Although it's not listed, I could almost swear that there's some sweet peach in the mix, because my overall impression is that of a 1980s obnoxious scent to be worn with fuchsia power suits with enormous shoulder pads.",01/15/25 09:04,LadyIva

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I don't want to be a hater, but this is the worst type of jasmine perfume to me. The word that comes to mind is stinky.

Sorry Gucci!",12/21/24 20:24,HoneySmoke889
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This is a very ""perfumey"" perfume. So technical, I know. I got this as a blind buy on discount, and couldn't pass up the deal. I'm deciding what I think of it for a scent for me. I like it on paper- but when I spray it on my person it's very overwhelming. Strong floral, strong perfume scent, and hits me very hard. I'm hoping the dry down reveals more layers. The bottle is very classy, and the perfume is well constructed. I tried the Orchid and I loved it, so I took a chance on the Jasmine.",12/18/24 12:15,slainfeet
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I've been working on going thru my already-owned fragrances before purchasing more, but as soon as I'm back in the market for spring/summer fragrances, I'm 1000% sure this is going to be my choice. Whenever I'm near a perfume counter (even with much more ""interesting"" perfumes) I always make sure I get a spray of this. It's so bright, but not too light, and refreshing without being a freshie.

It's like the most beautiful jasmine soap scent. If you're someone who wants to smell like you just took a shower with a luxury soap all day (like I do), this is your girl. She'll make you smell clean and put together. My dream fragrance for the past year or so. I'm so excited for when I get to finally buy this.",12/15/24 04:00,96am
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I typically gravitate toward dirty, indolic jasmines, but this fragrance is absolutely STUNNING. I fall firmly into the ""smells like fresh laundry"" camp—but imagine the most luxurious, bougie laundry scent possible. And really, who doesn’t want to smell like fresh, clean laundry? It has that white flower creamy quality that elevates it even further.

I pick up more magnolia than jasmine here, but that’s not a bad thing—I love magnolia too. While magnolia can sometimes feel more mature in fragrances, that’s not the case here. This scent stays close to the skin, but I can smell it on myself all day, and it lingers on my clothes into the next day, and I'm a smoker. The first time I smelled it, my eyes practically rolled back in my head—it’s that good. I adore this fragrance, and it’s easily one of my all-time favorites.

That said, it's a bit expensive for the longevity and silliage. But I'd buy it again and again just so I can smell it all day.",12/14/24 09:03,JasmineAndOldLace

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I know there are other notes here besides jasmine, but they’re very subdued.

Might reach for this again to try in warmer weather.",11/25/24 11:00,KaitM
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Beautifully done, not the most scandalous or provocative but unique enough for me to have reached for the deluxe bottle and to keep my nose where I sprayed. I have my fair share of jasmine perfumes and this one is calmer on the note, like literally jasmine hit a xanax and is relaxed. The florals are soft delicate round no edges smooth just shaven BIKINI WAX, but again not provocative just smooth. Dare I say it's almost lactonic how creamy these florals get.",11/25/24 03:57,MissFortune
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I like the dry down on the perfume better than the initial spray, but after a couple of hours my spray is nearly completely gone. I usually love vanilla perfumes, but the other perfumes in this line are a lot better. And if you are looking for a vanilla based perfume there are better options. Again it’s not horrible after the dry down, I could see myself using the rest of my travel size just to get through it but I don’t see myself purchasing this again.",11/24/24 22:51,Gabburrito
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I get almost a gardenia opening, then it settled to White Shoulders with mandarin and other citrus notes. There's a nice tart edge as it dries down to a tartly floral spring feel, but be prepared for Big White Floral, which is really what this is from start to finish. But it's a nice entry in the BWF pool.",11/24/24 16:30,tessture

It's a fresh scent, a little soapy, some bubblegum, airy, sweet.

This is a beautiful, RADIANT jasmine cantered fragrance with high projection and silage.
It's a little fun, very feminine. Absolutely captivating.

This one will totally encapsulate you and everyone around you in a glorious bubble of fresh & fizzy jasmine.. you will get compliments, people will stop and ask you what you're wearing.
It lasts on my clothing for days.
This is a perfect fragrance for the warmer weather or just sunny winter days.

This is a fragrance that I will be repurchasing again and again.",11/05/24 11:29,eligefashion

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"sweet opening notes, but nothing special really. kinda smells like clean laundry, I guess becauss of citrus and white flowers. but not in a clean way, more like strong detergent. Too expensive for the non originality of the scent. It lasts couple of hours on the skin , though, that's the benefit.",11/02/24 12:51,sacralogica
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This smells so good on paper, it has a fresh, clean, jasmine scent that's reminiscent of fresh laundry detergent (in a good way) and I love it. Out of all the gucci floras this is my fav

However, on my skin, the initial fresh laundry smell fades and I'm left with just straight jasmine, which is not a bad thing but it smells almost exactly like my oakcha jasmine blossom, which is a gucci bloom dupe. My oakcha perfume has a slightly sweeter jasmine scent compared to gucci flora jasmine's dry down.

I really did want to buy this because I absolutely love the initial spray. Sadly, the fresh and sweet smell doesn't last on my skin and I might as well stick with my oakcha jasmine blossom.",11/01/24 03:47,Leggo Eggo

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This is the best out of Gucci's Gorgeous line, IMO. Very sweet, extremely soapy jasmine, and I mean that in a good way. This has a very expensive, elegant smell to it that's perfect for when you want to smell like feminine floral perfume.

No, Gucci didn't reinvent the wheel with this one, but some days I want a break from the more unisex/niche/clean fragrances that have been popular in recent years and just smell like a fancy lady.",10/17/24 18:56,Jadelynn
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This is STRONG. One spray to the chest from a sample vial before bed, and this morning I keep smelling jasmine-forward fresh laundry still at 10 a.m. When I first sprayed it last night it represented pepper so well. The pepper is there, not merely listed. GFGJ smells verrrry similar to Viktor & Rolf Good Fortune- just swap the vanilla in GF for a pepper note. In full drydown the pepper is not as noticeable; but gosh darn it's so interesting while it's there! Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine honestly kinda surprised me, because Gucci Flora fras are typically so tame- and dare I say... boring? It's a perfectly inoffensive, fresh, clean laundry white floral bouquet featuring jasmine, gardenia, tuberose, magnolia, and freesia. ALL the fragrant white flowers. Hyper feminine- I can see Lana del Rey wearing this when she wears a crisp white blouse or T-shirt, jeans, and her famous 🩰. 🕊️",10/17/24 07:55,Autumnal Elf
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I absolutely love this scent. Fresh, literally gorgeous Jasmine. Hand soap, laundry detergent. This will make you smell like you just showered with citrusy Dr. Bronner's after a long day of laboring behind the counter in the flower shop. I wear it every day when I can.
That said, absolutely not worth the price for how long it lasts. Will get you compliments when someone's close enough to smell your neck, but with the measly amount you'll be applying to make it last the sillage isn't going to be much more voluminous than that.",10/13/24 21:16,botanicachan

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"As others have stated, this scent is reminiscent of a generic, jasmine scented dryer sheet. I appreciate a cleaner take on jasmine as sometimes it can be overwhelmingly indolic, but this scent just doesn’t hit the mark for me. Not awful to the nose, but not something I would be willing to spend money on. Appropriate for a work scent. Your coworkers will just think that you went a little crazy on the fabric softener.",09/04/24 22:39,camskye_937

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Really love the scent, right after spraying you get the mandarin and the bergamot but once it settles you start getting the gorgeous jasmine notes, a very creamy white flower scent, id say plus the dna of gucci makes it feels expensive and rich (there are some cheap fragrances with jasmine in it ive smelled that i cant stand bc of how sweet and powdery its cloying) but this one keeps it classy and i love that, for me its not an old lady smell since its not very powdery, i think what keeps it lively and youthfull are the citrics and the magnolia!

What is very sad is that it doesnt last much longer than maybe 3 hours for me, the silliage was okay for the first hour or two! Thanks to that i dont think its a buy for everyday use like the only one thing to have on your vanity but if you are a jasmine lover it could do it for collecting it!!!",08/16/24 18:11,roseekilljoy
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,Very nice and pretty Jasmine scent. Appreciate the spiciness coming from the black pepper as well. Quite reminiscent of Givenchy’s L’Interdit. Lasting power is OK but it’s definitely a safe blind buy.,08/07/24 14:01,Andy224
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This perfume was nice but it didn't wow me in any way. It's what some would define as an ""older lady"" scent, predominantly white florals and a hint of fresh pear here and there. It has mediocre staying power on the skin and doesn't project much. It would be hard for me to pick this out from a crowd of florals, as the scent is not memorable. It's not bad, just not great.",08/06/24 18:13,GinkgoLeaf
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"An easy reach in spring. This is an *almost* loud jasmine fragrance, with virtually no other notes. I don't pick up the citrus in this at all. And while it may be a bit cloying in the beginning for some, I do think it settles into the skin really nicely. There is little to no progression with this fragrance; it's very linear. It smells floral and warm to me without feeling super heavy or old lady. That being said, I wouldn't buy a full bottle of this. I think it's a nice, straight-up floral fragrance, which is why I bought it, but it's not something I'd wear all the time.",08/06/24 11:05,leaves.n.rain

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Not something that I'd usually wear, let alone buy, but I was sent a sample of it and I decided to give it a sniff. I think it's a very nice, well-rounded white-floral scent, but the benzoin and sandalwood at least make it moderately balmy and perhaps a little creamy. It smells fairly full and round and borderline old-fashioned--let's say classical. It's probably only about half as balmy as the hyper-balmy Clinique Aromatics Elixir (and barely a tiny fraction as complex), but I did initially think that this might, like Elixir, contain myrrh or something similar, as opposed to--as I now see--benzoin. There is a certain sweetness to the ambery aspect but it's all in keeping and not at all obtrusive.",07/28/24 17:32,woomanmoomin

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"nothing special just a little generic clean floral perfume. not too citrusy, not fruity or sweet. little bit soapy and creamy.
good for summer/spring or daily use. ok for office or public transport. Jasmin sambac is a note which i am not a fan of. i didnt dislike it but i am not going to buy a full bottle also. tried from a sample.",06/30/24 11:59,leautheone

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Jasmine sounded great but I was extremely disappointed by the scent. It smells a lot more synthetic than anticipated.
It’s not that it’s a bad smell, it’s that I feel like I smell nearly the same wearing clothes fresh out of a dryer that had scented dryer sheets. To me, this perfume is a bottle of designer dryer sheet. I do enjoy the smell occasionally, but to me it is pointless to spend such a large amount of money when I can get that same florally synthetic scent from a $5 product I buy regardless- the sillage and longevity probably being the same or longer.",06/24/24 16:19,Cauliflowers
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"i really want to like this scent and feel a bit bummed i don't like it. on me it smells very synthetic and while this description feels a bit crass, it really reminds me of public bathroom air freshener. i just feel overall disappointed, it's nowhere near as fresh and light as i was expecting, it's oddly heavy and overwhelming.",06/23/24 01:26,seeslugz
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"It's just ok to me. Reminds me of every other popular fragrance right now: paradoxe, voce viva, born in roma, but with the addition of a laundry sheet scent. It's nice enough, but doesn't stand out.",06/16/24 17:44,VioletScented
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"GJ is soft, sueded, lightly spiced without indoles. Skin friendly, sweet(ish), beginner friendly Jasmine. Smells classy, expensive and sultry. This is the perfect jasmine for those graduating out of gourmand or very sweet perfumes and want to branch out a bit. The jasmine sweetens on the skin in a very vanilla type of way. A reviewer called it a Jasmine milkshake and to my nose I agree with this. The pepper smells nutty but not cloying. The drydown is almost but not quite lactonic and nutty, despite being clean and not being indolic or having musks there are sweetly erotic undertones that will have people sniffing closer. Smells like a high end department store perfume.",06/08/24 16:29,KristinaAlexis
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I much prefer Magnolia because it’s just more of a standout, slightly stronger and more soapy. In comparison, Jasmine is still beautiful but not mind-blowing. Regardless it is a lovely, dainty scent. I highly recommend the entire Flora line as it is inoffensive, delicate, and beautiful for warm weather.",06/07/24 17:45,woodlandwitch
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,What a gorgeous scent. Everytime I wear it I get compliments 🩵💙,06/06/24 19:13,MigenaG
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I’m reviewing this right after Gorgeous Magnolia. They’re nothing alike besides being white floral fragrances.

Opens with jasmine and citrus. It has a strong white floral that is the fresh, projecting type. It does not go laundry detergent, too green, or creamy. It’s more like petals. For some reason, my nose thought pink pepper may be in here but checking the notes, there’s actually black pepper! It adds some warmth.

After the opening, I’m detecting more florals other than jasmine. They’re a bit nondescript. I think a bit of a fresh yet edgy rose. Plus it starts developing an ever so slight smoothness.

In the drydown, it’s sweeter and even smoother. I can’t say it’s creamy but it is smooth, slight powdery, vanillic, slight woody.

I do enjoy this more than I expected since I’m normally not a white floral fan. This treats the jasmine well and never lets it get overpowering by balancing it with bright peppery citrus and smooth ambery warmth. While it doesn’t seem unique, nothing comes to mind as a close comparison. I can see how people would say YSL Libre since the jasmine gets a radiant quality into the drydown that smells like the jasmine in Libre. However, the lavender in Libre makes it very different. This would be a great signature scent for a white floral lover.",06/04/24 13:08,YourFragranceFriend
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,Beautiful Jasmine scent. reminds me of the transition from summer to fall playing in my parent’s front yard near the garden. sits beautifully in my hair and on my clothing so much so that your hugs linger longer because everyone who smells you will feel a little nostalgic too. grandma-ish in the best way possible.,06/02/24 19:08,ambergrisangel111
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Smells just like Downy Unstoppables Fresh scent beads, but in a good way.

My favourite out of the three in this line.",05/28/24 14:35,jurassic-can't-park
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"My mind is recollecting something very familiar from '80ties when smelling this one - haven't yet found what it is, though. I like this a lot, jasmine here is subtle yet detectable and not pungeant or harsh as in some perfumes it tends to be. Well made, vivacious, spring-like scent. The staying power could be better though.",05/22/24 11:54,lemmenkukka
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I bought this one about a week ago, sampled it at the store first and wasn’t too sure about it due to it being a straight up floral. I’m a jasmine lover, all of my perfumes have jasmine in but they are mixed with fruits and sweetness. My only other floral jasmine is alien EDT which has mandarin and orange in there which you can really detect. That is not one I would wear for the day time though…

but when it comes to gorgeous jasmine it is just one big jasmine BOMB from start to finish on me, (the clue is in the name but a lot of people have said the jasmine isn’t that strong) I can also notice the rose though as it dries down but mostly the jasmine. I kept getting whiffs of this all day from the sample and really started to like it more and more. So much so that I went back and purchased the 100ml gift set.

It’s fresh, clean and reminds me of holidays. It reminds me of being in the sun all day, getting showered, putting a beautiful floaty dress on and spritzing this before you go out for food and drinks in the evening. We have reached summer in the uk and are having a few days of nice sunny warm weather and gorgeous jasmine is perfect! I’m wearing it a lot during the day, it’s really refreshing. I know a lot of people have said it smells like soap or laundry detergent and I might be the only one who says this….but it also reminds me of suntan lotion, I think it’s just because it has that summer vibe too it.

On me this is absolute beast mode, I only need a little bit of this because it projects like mad and it lasts soooooooooo long on me. I can smell it for hours and hours!

If you’re not sure about this one at first, spray and let it settle, don’t write it off too quickly because if you are looking for a fresh, clean, summer scent then this could be what you are looking for. 😊",05/11/24 03:39,samantha83
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"i am a big jasmine lover, and im always on the hunt for jasmine-dominated fragrances. flora gorgeous jasmine is a fresher type of jasmine rather than indolic and animalic to my nose. i have a sample of this from last year and she was fresh, light, and soft from what i remember. i just sprayed it again recently and it was surprisingly sweet? i dont recall it being this sweet from when i first tried it. overall, very soft and safe jasmine scent (obv for jasmine lovers and not people who despise white florals) that is a bit soapy. currently looking at my bank account figuring out how to afford the full bottle one day :(

edit: finally got a 1oz bottle and im absolutely in love. the scent is soo soothing and relaxing to me, its just very pleasant to smell. it also last a pretty long time, i sprayed in on a test strip that i left on my desk — i could still smell it whenever im walking past my desk for at least the next 2 days.",05/05/24 08:24,000.rla

I get a cross between an orange and a sweet-tart. I'm glad it is starting to fade into a good quality, albeit boring, shampoo by the time I've reached the office because my work place is somewhat conservative. It is almost perfect that the initial burst is bright and awakening for my morning commute yet so short-lived that most of the day is spent with a the completely generic shampoo smell so I am completely worry-free about offending anyone.",03/10/24 15:34,Ralison71

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I love jasmine flowers but I don’t love this. It made me nauseous and I had to scrub. It’s not a natural smelling jasmine. I have a cheap jasmine body spray that cost me a dollar and smells like this.

It smells like waking up one morning during your honeymoon in a big green European province. Clean sheets and a flowery breeze and your husband making your favorite tea while you plan what adventure you'll go on today. I have the mini version, I think it's cuter (and cheaper). Longevity could be better for Gucci. My boyfriend loves it and associates it with being 'my smell' since I wore it a lot in the summer when we met.

Pero educadamente agradecí el detalle.
Sin embargo, ¡oh grata sorpresa! Qué perfume tan agradable. Dulce, no exageradamente floral, con un toque cítrico y con un fondo con un toque, no se cómo explicarlo... ¿herbal-amaderado? que al menos para mi gusto, lo vuelve una fragancia un tanto unisex.

Unfortunately not the type of perfume that I like, if it had a citrus touch that would balance the jasmine, it would be nice, but it is so dense and creamy... It reminds me of the smell of flowers in a cemetery! 😓
If you have been to one of those Chinese stores and smelled those jasmine air fresheners you will know exactly what this perfume smells like.

To me, I got the smell I would get when I'd ride by bloomed Jasmine on the lawnmower. It made mowing exciting. Very realistic to me. TFJR is a beautiful Jasmine/Orange Blossom scent to me. That's the difference. Both are stunning. Please research all of these fragrances & don't buy from places like ""Ulta"" if you don't need it right away. That's what drives the costs of these up so much. If people pay top dollar, they will keep going up. Perfumes like this are too much trouble to make a fake.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I typically would never like any jasmine themed perfumes, I do not like white floral perfumes - period. The longevity is two to three hours and the sillage is minimal, two strikes that would usually turn me away.

But this one took me by surprise. I got a sample and wore it for a week straight as I sat at my desk working. I had to keep reapplying every few hours but I didn’t care bc the fragrance brought me so much joy every time I smelled my wrist. As hard as I tried not to like it, by the end of the week I was absolutely in love with it. I wish I could make my entire body smell like the first 20 minutes of this perfume, from head to toe.

The final test of whether it was true love or not came when I had my boyfriend smell my wrist. He pretty much hates all perfumes, it’s extremely rare for him to like any scents. I let him smell the first wrist, which i had freshly sprayed Gucci Gorgeous Jasmine on, and he looked pleasantly surprised & admitted he liked it. Then I had him smell the other wrist, which I had sprayed Gorgeous Jasmine on an hour prior so that it had time to settle in with my chemistry. He grabbed my wrist an exclaimed how much he liked it, he said he liked it even better than the other wrist. I instantly knew that no matter how much it cost I would immediately purchase it.

The scent is great indoors, although reapplying frequently is something you just have to deal with (the fragrance really is quite lovely on me). I think the scent profile best suits daytime in the spring & summer, but is also very nice to wear around the house before bed. I’d even say it’s sexy and would be great to wear as you snuggle up next to your lover in bed.

However, I wore this at Disney World in the summer heat of August in Florida, and even though I reapplied at every bathroom break, the longevity just couldn’t keep up. In the sweaty heat the beautiful scent would disappear literally after 15 or 20 minutes. This scent would be absolutely perfect to wear to the beach or for any outdoor activity but honestly it wouldn’t last in either of those situations, although I wish it would. What is going on with perfumes these days? Nothing last like it used to. I don’t understand why the price point is so high if you have to reapply every two to three hours INDOORS (outdoors, every ten minutes).

Overall, I truly love this scent and anticipate purchasing another bottle when mine runs out. That’s literally how much I love Gucci Gorgeous Jasmine.... I tried all of the other Bloom versions and none of them even came close to smelling pleasant on me!

It is pretty and light, and like other people have mentioned, it gives me a distinct laundry soap vibe. That isn't a bad thing, but not sure if it is worth the price point if that is all there is.

The performance isn't the best on me. It is down to a skin-scent on me in less than an hour, which is a bit of a shame. Probably not one I will be quick to add to the collection if that is the case.",11/08/23 15:23,Kaleigha

The smell on the mouillette was extremely ""jasmine-y""; on me, it turned extremely green; on my mother, rather sweet, as if there was kind of a hint of vanilla to it.
It's worth to note that the sillage is heavy: one spray was enough to full the entire living room.
30 mL, almost €90: quite high price, but it's strong and it has an interesting evolution on different skins: it's not so female-directed in my opinion; it has more of a unisex vibe.",10/15/23 07:43,Luchitos27
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I like Gorgeous Jasmine better than the other two fragrances by Gucci in this line, but it is still not my favorite perfume.

I find the opening too citrusy and detergent like for my sensibilities and liking and the pepper note just made me sneeze throughout my wear of this fragrance. Thankfully this does get toned down fairly fast (within 45 minutes) throughout its wear though.

The heart notes are probably my favorite part of Gorgeous Jasmine, but I wish that the jasmine note was a bit stronger and the magnolia note a bit more subdued. I also didn't find the jasmine in this particularly natural smelling, though I wouldn't quite call it a synthetic jasmine either. I did not smell any rose in the heart notes really.

I didn't appreciate the really strong patchouli in the base and its combination with the very strong smelling and incense like benzoin. The amount of woodiness in the base was just right, though.

Gucci's Gorgeous Jasmine lasted precisely 6 hours on me and its sillage was moderate. It is a very feminine fragrance and a scent I could imagine a young woman wearing in either the spring or summer during the daytime, bar the office because of its pepper note.

This perfume was an almost like for me, but the citrusy notes, patchouli and especially the pepper ruined things for me a bit. That is why I'd give Gorgeous Jasmine by Gucci a 6.5/10.",10/12/23 23:24,WhiteFlowerPrincess
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"At first, very floral-sweet .. I actually thought, “Oh! Honeysuckle!” But as it dries down, it gets a little headier, more indolic, and a bit spicy. Once most of that indolic quality fades, I was left with a very jasmine-rich laundry product scent (detergent? softener?) .. Fancy, designer laundry products, but laundry products nonetheless.

The cloud only lasts for about 4 hours and then it becomes a skin scent. But I’ll say that while that cloud’s around, it PERFORMS. Very strong, at least to my white-floral-sensitive (scent-sitive? haha) nose.

Fine but an easy pass for me.",10/11/23 18:29,supergirl9412

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"A clean, refreshing light floral, perfect for spring and summer.. I bought it on impulse before my vacation as Gorgeous Gardenia has been a spring/summer favourite for 8 years now.

First impressions were good… soapy, citrusy, light jasmine but very faintly detectable darker woody undertones. I am a jasmine lover so I was expecting with more intensity. It’s not really my style as I don’t really go for fresh and citrusy fragrances.. but I make it work.

If you are into light and inoffensive floral fragrances then I really recommend this.

This is not a ‘grand gesture’, it produces light sillage and sits close to the skin, doesn’t last so long to the nose but sometimes I smell it on my clothes after a few hours. I’m often in the mood for skin scents these days anyway especially during the warmer seasons and casual days.",09/27/23 14:13,Softpeacelily

It’s very clean floral, but it’s a scent that’s way too synthetic, and without much depth. The citrus and jasmine notes compete here rather than balancing each other or having any kind of opening effect to the fragrance. Very weak longevity on my skin.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"This smells like very nice laundry soap. The waxy, green, realistic jasmine scent is in there, but I genuinely think Gucci used aroma molecules traditionally reserved for soaps and detergents in this.

At first blast, it’s fresh and floral – just what you’d expect. Then, an hour or so later, jasmine blooms into more intense, soapier self that I would whole-heartedly recommend to all white-flower fans. Then rose joins it producing warmer, sunnier impression, and jasmine begins to remind me mock-orange flowers, which I adore, with slight accents of solar notes and green leaves. Then I begin noticing magnolia coupled with benzoin, reminding me a bit of Zara Violet blossom or even Mugler’s Alien. Then sandalwood adds substance and creaminess, making it warmer.

Also, ever-so-delicate patchouli keeping it mysterious with a cool waft here and there! The tester leaflet didn’t list patchouli note and I thought I was imagining it half of the day, until I looked GFGJ up here and was reassured that I’m not hallucinating.

This is the best jasmine that I ever tried – not too intense, but not obscured by other ingredients, rather, tenderly supported by them, like a flower floating in sweet nectar. Other jasmine scents often peddle jasmine so much that you would be better off just using essential oil instead. Yet Gucci Flora creates an impression of a fresh delicate flower on a green branch, and it’s lovely. It makes you feel lovely too. Very inspiring perfume.

If I had to ascribe a personality to it, I would say it’s a young girl walking in the morning to her first office job, full of hopes and ambition, willing to impress, but also daydreaming about love. She wears white blouse, minimalistic sparkles of jewelry, and wind is playing with her shiny loose hair.

I perceive it as a perfect day or even morning scent, lovely for spring, cooler summer days, and early autumn. It has the freshness and the warmth enough to cover most of the year except the dramatic extremes. I am so amazed by it that I must post it right away, so no comment on longevity yet, but I plan to update.",09/08/23 03:15,Julipet
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,Beautiful jasmine. Puts Tom ford's jasmine scents to shame. I would still say diptyque's Do son is the best jasmine scent but this is also a bit more stronger of a jasmine that subsides relatively quick.,08/26/23 11:17,junidasom
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"i really love this perfume... but the longevity on this one is weak!
3 hour wear for that price point? no no no!

it's such shame because it is beautifully blended with the magnolia, jasmine, citrus and rose!

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"At first spray, I could smell alcohol, mandarin and bergamot. Then after a while the magnolia and jasmine notes take over. Pretty floral innocent scent, which I like to use on summer days. Nothing particularly remarkable, it is overpriced. It doesn't last long either. The bottle is really nice though.",08/15/23 16:14,Lilah_lilah2023

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"According to Gucci, the new Gucci Flora's bottle is more elongated and is made with 10% recycled glass and lacquered with a water-based painting, now in turquoise. The floral pattern was created by artist and illustrator Vittorio Accornero in 1966.

The fragrance carries top notes of mandarin and bergamot from Italy, as well as black pepper; heart notes of Grandiflorum Jasmine absolute, Sambac jasmine absolute, magnolia, and damask rose; base notes of sandalwood from Australia, benzoin extract, and patchouli from Indonesia.

Upon touching the skin, Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine explodes with a bright, clean floral bouquet. The citrus notes give vigor and transmit the solar and daytime side of the fragrance. And that's great, because most of the feminine fragrances that explore jasmine as the main ingredient, follow the sensual and nocturnal style that abuses the more indolic facets of the flower.

In Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine, the freshest and greenest nuances exude without parsimony and gain the watery reinforcement of magnolia. But, for me, the rose note – little exalted in the concept – deserves a lot of praise. It brings all the cleansing content of the fragrance, working as the base of a luxurious and fragrant soap.

On my skin, everything is very linear and there is a feeling of losing strength during the evolution. But at different times, Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine insists on exhaling and manages to prove itself resistant to time. And the sandalwood, in the base, sustains the smooth creaminess of this beautiful floral creation. Medium projection, but with good durability, at least on me.

Finally, I want to state my satisfaction with the floral packaging and the beautiful bottle of these new fragrances, which remind me of lacquered ceramic vases, stand out in any collection, and are far from conventional.

Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine is not your traditional opulent jasmine scent, but a delicate and stimulating approach that lifts the mood and exudes quality. Gucci hit the nail again!",08/03/23 11:05,Cassiano
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"I pick up on a spicy mandarin/citrus at first spritz. Then after a few minutes the jasmine comes out. It has more of a refreshing feel than I was anticipating. Overall this is polite and pretty, and not too soapy to my nose. This would be a nice spring/summer daytime scent. On me this became barely detectable after 3-4 hours. I like it and would be tempted to get a bottle if it lasted longer.",07/27/23 06:14,Thykes10

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine Gucci,"Upon first spray FGJG had a promising opening. A bit too sharp for my taste, but still tolerable. Later in the dry down, the jasmine is clearly present along with the magnolia. I actually found the dry-down somewhat soft and enjoyable. Unfortunately, it's still not enough for me to pull the trigger for a FB.

smells like a dentist cabinet and the medicinal accord does nothing for this uninteresting perfume, it's so badly blended it's almost a joke. I tried to find my old review just to see how much I was gaslighting myself into liking this mediocre fragrance lmao.
Everybody that commented on It was to let me know how bad it smelled :)
Doesn't smell like peonies, or spices. Or whatever floraly thing this was supposed to evoke, it's just cough syrup.
Gardenia, Pink pepper and some chemical underlying Accord. The florals are not even clean or creamy hahaha.
Coming back to the worst ofender here, the underlying osmanthus-medicinal accord that tries to infuse ""complexity"" on the creation and actually renders It UNWEARABLE goes to show that It IS just a mediocre floral taking Itself too seriously. Pick me shenanigans.",05/31/25 11:33,fiouu

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"A subtle, light citrus-floral. I am surprised some find it strong or with big projection. It is among my mildest scents. Very safe for every occasion, especially for spring-summer. Pretty, happy and gently fresh. In a gorgeous bottle. I like the gentleness of it, as I not always want statement scent, sometimes I like a pretty subtlety just for myself. When I feel like wearing nothing I reach for this beauty. The current Floras are stronger than this. But this makes me smell great - a cute floral aroma thats not simple. It is a skin but better scent. It lasts well on the skin, easily 12 hours of this subtle projection. And 2 days on clothes. Despite the gentleness! And it creates a scented bubble, even on a bike I feel it, but it feels so natural that I welcome it. It makes the scent a legend.",04/04/25 05:23,MademoiselleMaya

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Im so glad I do own a full bottle of this gorgeous complex fragrance altough I have a very conflicted relationship with it. I love how the fragrance opens up very rich and develops very interestingly toxicating and sexy, how osmanthus shines through uniquely, I can not wear it because its giving me carsick feeling. It was a love at first sight at the store, i just bought the bottle but joke was on me when i actually try to wear it throughout the years, I never could, tried in 4 seasons, day and night, to bed and to office but no, it just too overpowering to me when its on me. However its not an obstacle to love the scent, reminds me also that back in 2000’s and 2010’s designer parfumes were so complex and distinctive, not like many similar to eachother like nowadays perfumes, more like todays ‘niche’ perfumes and we didnt have to pay min 300$ for a bottle.

Why, oh why did they discontinue it? I have a couple of back up bottles of this, and when those are gone I will be so sad. You can still find this gem on places like ebay, but the price is usually ridiculous. I know that Soki London did a perfume that was supposedly inspired by this one, and I have it, but it's not nearly as beautiful as this old favorite. If Gucci ever brought this one back I would be at the front of the line buying it. Beautiful perfume.",01/29/25 00:47,Sssmilinhart

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"When this fragnance came out my mother bought it to me as a birthday gift.
Why? She knows I love perfumes and own bunch of old bottles and testers and that I bought to her few also. I attached her to few fragnance actually. So she choose this because it was ""just out"" and saw in my room open magazine left on the page where it was commercial for the perfume. Thinking I probably like it. Rest she didn't know. She didn't study composition or anything else. So there you go. We can call it blind buy. Was I happy? Did gods spoke to my mother? Probably. Because I did accept it, not because it was birthday gift, but because I find sense in this simple composition. Yes, that's how I am.

Do we must start with complaining? Yes. Because they discounted this scent and invented something ""new"", endless rows of variations, like trying to throw something at us to stick. What sticks to sell it stays. Frauds! Shameless frauds! How long will people put up with their madness? I have to stop here, before I get way too honest, or angry... Reason I boycott Gucci is in facts that they behave reckless and opportunistic, like others. Despucable and disgusting. Suitable to the world order we live in. The collapse of the civilisation. Where greed grabs and runs...

I have first addition bottles. Yes, still one from mom and 2 others. Which of course I don't use much. Reason is obvious. One almost empty is from mom.

Flora is by now a legendary pattern from Gucci archives. used on their scarf, designed for Grace Kelly, year 1966. The similar elegant design followed decoration of the very very nice bottle. Black and white. That black cord ribbon. I just love it so much. Made to to give attention to the contrast inside the composition of this wonderful perfume. Oh yes, the contrast. That's why this perfume is good. It celebrates the contrast, that exist in every female. It's part of our nature. There you go. If I can find our feminine born nature in the composition of the fragnance and I mean in the way notes are chosen I can respect that. Even if I don't like it. Because I understand some other female will like it and wear it with pride. Perfume must reach level of being parfumery art. This one does. In every aspect. Did you ever pay the attention to Sandro Botticelli's 'Primavera' painting? You will see Flora there. That's exactly what this fragnance is. It's a happy perfume even tho it is in its spirit contrast. It's like ""I have ovulation, my skin is more dry today... But I love to be a woman."" That's Flora. BTW. The ""Flora"" on the painting is pregnant. Bringing life. Bringing future. A miracle of living.

Did Frida Giannini though of all this, that I wrote, or any, I don't know. I can and do hope she did. The blending of this perfume is perfect. The layering is perfect. The penetrative power, one note into other is perfect. The silage is perfect. The lasting is perfect. The dry-down is perfect. The radiance of color is perfect (deep amber color). The decency of the composition is perfect (not sexy, not vulgaire). Big mayority of so called modern perfumes you can't layer during the day. This one you could. And NO. Flora doesn't have dupe or similar scent to replace it. Forget that. It's unique fragnance.

Top notes are Peony, Citruses and Mandarin Orange, calm aldehydes...
I want to write about Peony. If you have garden. I do. Then you know how hard is to grow them. How different they all smell. I dare to write, that inside Flora it's not pink peony, most known color. I think, because I have them in the garden and I can smell them, inside Flora it's yellow ones. They smell slightly of vanilla/honey. But why would fragnance open with Peony splashed with adorable skin of Mandarine, Orange and some other citruses, the pretty sure Bergamote and Kumquat. I smell bitter Orange also and a bit of neroli. Beautiful. Ohh sooo beautiful. Such a magnificent opening. That itself could be simple nice Cologne. Or soap. There you go Gucci! Make the soap. Then I will change my mind and support you by buying it. Just imagine taking shower with this opening soap. Ohh yes. The opening last around half an hour. Sinking into skin. Acting with your skin. Then it becomes even more beautiful. Peony floating. Did you ever think why Peony?
The ancient Greeks believed that it was an emanation of the Moon that glowed at night to drive away evil spirits, giving protection horses wherever it grows, safeguarding shepherds and their flocks, keeping the harvest from injury and preventing storms. However, much like the mandrake, its collection was surrounded by taboos and danger. Pliny said, “that of necessity it must be gathered in the night for if any man shall pluck the fruit in the daytime being seen of the woodpecker he be in danger of to lose his eyes“. Oh yes. Plants are magical creatures. Ancestors knew that. We forgot that.
In the mediaeval period, the peony was used to ward off evil in its various guises. Culpeper said it was an antidote to any sickness caused by demonic possession, such as epilepsy. Gerard said it healed those who had been bewitched. The seeds steeped in hot wine were believed to prevent nightmares or strung onto a necklace to protect children from convulsions, ward off evil spirits and madness. Pennsylvanian Germans also used it to prevent fits, washing with a rag that had been tied to a peony. The plants were often grown near the door of cottages as they were considered to be able to drive away witches and storms, fairies and goblins. Peonies were widely believed to prevent nightmares, advocated as such by Pliny, and even Francis Bacon who said that it protected against “the incubus we call the mare”.
I grow one infront of our house entrance. White blossoms.
Peonies have been used medicinally since ancient times. In Chinese traditional herbalism, peony root (Bai Shao) is still used in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including gout, menstrual cramps, migraine.
(klinheartwitch)

Do you understand now WHY the Top note is magnificent witch Peony?

Let's continue...
After citruses calm down completely and settle themselves to stay till the end and they do, particularly Orange, we sink into
middle notes. Osmanthus and Rose with aquatic additions and green notes (I assume fresh grass). Not much some would say BUT if made good and with sense and quality, it's enough.
I adore Osmanthus. Again. Do you wonder why Osmanthus is Middle main note of Flora?
In traditional Chinese medicine, Osmanthus tea has been used as an herbal tea for the treatment of irregular menstruation. Still believe parfumery is just a business? This Oleachea plant (gods plants) is telling us the story of ""Breaking the osmanthus twig and mounting the dragon"" another euphemism, in this case, for sex. Osmanthus is beautiful. Alluring. Confident. Slowly intruding... Captivating everyone around, leaving them wondering ""what is that?"" Together with Rose of which we know no name I can definitely say It's not Bulgarian rose. Typical for the so called floral fragnance otherwise. It's more calm Rose. I have a lot of Roses in my garden. I raise them as hobby and collect rare ones, yet I can't smell out from Flora which one they used to compose it with Osmanthus. Definitely it doesn't overshadow Osmanthus, which is fantastic, because Flora is, let's be honest, BEST modern Osmanthus fragnance.
Lying peacefully on the base notes of Sandalwood, Pink Pepper and Patchouli... Is there some vetiver? Possibly. A hint. This base is so nice. It's so fitting. It's so wonderful...I am in sorrow for this fragrance. Gucci shame on you for the eternity. Because this fragnance could be a perfect gift to a woman after giving a child to her husband.

Let me finish with... Osmanthus.
Fragrant plant symbolized True Love and Faithfulness and the fruit tree - Fertility and Peace, and the custom had the meaning of ""giving birth to noble children"" and ""many children and many grandchildren"".

That's what Flora is.",06/27/24 04:00,arnela

I was really excited, but it just goes to show that no matter the reviews and no matter how wonderful it smells on the card, just don't do a blind buy - especially when one has funny chemistry!

I can really describe this fragrance because on me, it was so blah. No peony, no rose. Just some vague floral something. And just powdery.

Had to let it go ✌🏽,08/19/22 12:21,Eveningrose
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This perfume was amongst the first perfumes I bought when I started working, it wasn't that expensive for someone who just starting working on entry level pay an yet still a designer perfume haha...

I bought 50ml if I'm not mistaken and finished the whole bottle but still keeping the bottle as display because I wasn't planning to repurchase. Then I heard this perfume is going to be discontinued or maybe already discontinued by now, decided to buy full bottle. Now I remember why I bought this at the first place...such a gorgeous floral scent, it doesn't scream feminine but still smelling feminine. I can't describe it exactly with words. I'm gonna enjoy this scent until the last drop and might purchase a back up bottle if I still see it being sold.",07/31/22 22:40,Nichole FZA

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"🌼powerhouse that does not last🍊
this is a beautiful powdery scent, you can really smell the osmanthus. such a shame it has been discontinued, I liked using it every so often to lift the mood. it is very sharp though. if only it lasted longer on the skin - sadly the latest formulation disappears within a couple of hours.",05/18/22 00:33,ladyofwinter
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"WHY must brands discontinue the best from their brand always? Gucci is being added to the infamous discontinue list along with Guerlain, Versace and Thierry Mugler. This scent is what I would pick if I had to choose a signature scent. This fragrance has niche quality to it. It projects like a beast, lasts forever on the skin and gets major compliments. I have gone through maybe 8 or 9 bottles at this point in my life. I hope they reintroduce this scent in the new bottle design, otherwise I will have to stock up.",05/09/22 14:59,DWCMUA
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Tried this once in store and can't quite forget it so I quickly grabbed a bottle when I heard it's getting discontinued.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is SO pretty. I’m not a floral girl, but one sniff of this and i KNEW i had to have a full bottle!! It’s light, dainty, and a bit shampoo-ey without being soapy. It just smells so… PRETTY!

On first spray, I immediately get hit with the pear. It’s gorgeous and juicy. The citruses are not loud, but they complement the pear so well and gives it a bit of a sparkly, bright edge. The osmanthus really shines through for me even at the opening, and it’s what made me immediately decide to get it. I love honey oolong osmanthus tea, and this is definitely reminiscent of it to me!

Love love love. I’m definitely looking forward to buying the biggest bottle. I can already see myself going through my 50ml quickly—and I only just got it today! Thank you Rhonda Lareese for the recommendation!",04/09/22 22:04,pincurls
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I can't believe I missed this perfume so many years ago. I was looking for the perfect all year round work scent that matched my taste and style. I smelt Gorgeous Gardenia EDP tonight and yes it smelt nice, sweet and creamy which is my type of scent, but I needed something a bit more serious, so the sales person brought me this and it's so beautifully balanced. It's elegant, just sweet enough and with that citrus note, it gave the fragrance some sharpness but non-offensive. Others might think it's just another floral scent but as a work scent, this has it all. I would wear this for other occasions also.",03/24/22 07:14,Bopha85
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Received this perfume as a gift twice for some reason? It's not personally one of my favourite scents, if anything a little too strong for me.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Its got a nice soft fruity floral smell, but the more I think about it, it starts to remind me of something a young nurse/highschool teacher would wear.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This Perfume when I first spray it, brings the promise of a great citrus floral fragrance, however not long after I spray it (I'm talking under an hour), It becomes an Osmanthus skin scent on me.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Not really a fan. It is floral, yes, but it's more sour than it is sweet. I understand that it has citrus notes – and I love citrus scents. But not this kind.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This scent is just magical and it makes me feel optimistic, charismatic and sensual all at the same time. I live in a cold climate where it rains alot and this cozy, uplifting scent works perfectly during fall and winter. The citrus notes paired with the osmanthus creates a fizzy fresh citrus peach like scent. While the sandalwood makes it woody and creamy. I find the edp to have almost an amber like quality to it which makes it super long lasting and sophisticated. I have both the edt and the edp. I like using the edt for work since it's not as loud and is a bit ''see through'' while the edp you get such a luxurious long lasting blend, and a versatile perfume for your money. If I could only have one I'd go for the edp.

So I sprayed two spritz of this at 2pm, and later in the evening at 10pm I walked passed my boyfriend and he was like woow what are you wearing? He said it smelled like a breath of fresh air, as he smelled closer on my wrist he said it somehow also smells like caramel, like a caramelized orange without being too sweet or synthetic.",08/15/21 07:29,norhal96

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Thick and syrupy but not cloying or too sweet. This is a beautiful floral orangey fragrance to my nose. It's not my usual kind of smell, the notes were weirdly addictive when I tried a tester in the shop. I could not stop going back and sniffing the paper! This is good in all weather, apart from really really warm days i think. I think its more daytime appropriate. I've not had compliments when wearing it but I like it, and thats what is important that you like your fragrance. Its really long lasting, couple of sprays will keep you going all day.",08/07/21 13:38,Project Nostalgia
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The first time I wore this, all I got was a watery peony with a few whiffs of creamy osmanthus. On the second wear I picked up on the pink pepper note which was a little too sharp for me. But on every other wear, it's a beautiful creamy floral right from the start, and it stays that way with no unwanted sharpness or surprises. There isn't much to say about this one. It would be easy to say this fragrance is boring. Very pleasant, great for year-round and day or night. Flora doesn't have the ""wow"" factor I normally look for before investing in a full bottle. That said, I'd love to have this in my collection someday as it's a truly lovely scent.",07/18/21 23:42,clairesque
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This fragrance is amazing. In my top ten. It's a beautiful warm orange and fresh osmanthus fragrance, with a lovely.... brightness. Maybe from the pink pepper? It is the fragrance I reach for when I have an important meeting, or want to feel optimistic.

Simular to Givenchy Ange Ou Demon Le Secret, but more professional. So if you like that fragrance, you would probably like this one too.

Perfect for work. Great projection. I always get complimented when I wear this fragrance.

Makes me feel happy, classy, and sophisticated.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Flora has been an unexpected disappointment to me.
I thought I would love it judging from the notes and the glowing reviews but it does absolutely nothing for me.
It's by no means a polarizing or challenging scent - it's what I would describe as inoffensive and vaguely pleasant.
Like others, I get a warm orangey/apricot note - not really citrusy, more of a honeyed sweetness.
That is all I get though. This is how the perfume goes on and this is how it stays. It fails to develop and is completely inert on my skin. Another reviewer described it as champagne. Well on me it is flat champagne unfortunately.
It's quite a saturated smell but it doesn't project and leaves no sillage either
I've given Flora more than a handful of chances, in all kinds of weather and nothing seems to change my experience.
I wish I could smell what others do.

Edit - 1/5/24 - so I've discovered, from smelling other osmanthus forward scents, that what is happening here is that the osmanthus is just overtaking all the other notes. I really smell only the osmanthus here. Nothing else. What a shame.",05/23/21 00:28,cookygirl
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This a very warm, sweet, almost gourmand floral. There’s something about it that I also smell in Bamboo, which must be the sandalwood. It’s very creamy and almost vanilla and powdery.
I get none of the citrus.",05/14/21 15:40,Peacelovecolorart
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Fresh champagne in a bottle. This fragrace is really pretty. I would describe it as a very perfumy fragrance thats smells very realistic of citrusses. Its like cutting into a citrus and smelling the juice. Then the florals come in. The fragrance overall has a sparkling (champagne) type of vibe to it. Still not anything special.
Lasts all day",04/19/21 08:20,essiesfrags
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I absolutely love this perfume, I am really impressed by all Gucci fragrances (I honestly can't say I dislike any of the ones that I have smelled). Their creations are so well balanced and this is so rare nowadays, I don't like perfumes where I can pin-point one scent or the other, or the ones that have a messy multi-smell that ends up smelling like ""the Mall"", but Gucci does the exact opposite. I don't know how they manage to create such perfect accords.

I got Flora in a set of minis and it was the one I used last (I tend to conserve the things I like so this was the hint that I love it). Besides the extremely pretty bottle, I think this scent is to die for. It is indeed floral but not heavy on the roses (which I do smell, but the top notes of fresh yellow or white roses, no the deep smell of red ones), the flowery parts (must be the peony, although I can also sense some fresh violets) blend well with the citruses which are not lemony at all, but rather more prominent as the delicate fresh-sweet smell of mandarin peels. The sandalwood is there to support everything, while the osmanthus creates a savory middle you almost want to eat. All these smells are somehow equal, with neither battling for dominance, again a rare find at least on most perfumes I've tried.

I am thinking of buying a full bottle but an EDT not EDP, as I feel this perfume works better will less sillage, the EDP I have would fill the room and choke me if I spray it (I currently just dab the mini-bottle on my wrist and neck and it's enough). The dry down is not instant, I love how I can still smell the top and middle notes for hours which usually does not happen with a lot of perfumes. The scent follows me all day and I can't get enough of it. It's such a complex perfume, I love how I can find in it a bit of everything: a daytime perfume which can also go well on a summer evening date. It's so versatile that it can make you jump for joy and works well as a pick-me-up, but it also gives a boost of confidence and femininity to make you feel sexy and ready for anything.

Definitely recommend, even as a blind buy. Unless you are somebody who likes strictly oriental perfumes, you would love this. It's also perfect for a gift, you really can't go wrong and I can't imagine somebody not liking it.

Later edit: I found a dupe (based on reading a thread here), it's La rive - Madame in love. They are very similar, unfortunately the dupe had a bit of stickiness when I sprayed it on my hand, typical of drug store cheaper perfumes. The scent is not identical of course, the dupe is heavier (especially the flowery scents) while the original is more open, clean and more fresh (citruses prevail), most likely due to the quality of the ingredients. But considering it's 10% of the price, it's worth it. I have to say the dry down, after several hours, is identical: a sweet, fresh violet scent.",04/11/21 01:20,cristinap9587
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I absolutely love this perfume! It smells delicious on my skin as it's very fruity and just a little bit floral!

Next was a lovely powdery rose scent that is just lovely, beautiful. My husband said I smelled yummy!! These are the notes, including the, pink pepper and patchouli, that I smelled the most on my skin. It has a long sillage for me with over 8 hours of longevity!! I love it so much that I will most likely get another bottle which I enjoy looking at, for it has a vintage design, Safe blind buy for floral lovers!!

I haven't tested the EDT version but maybe it will have a different kick to it than this EDP version anyway I still love/like it and think it is a must for floral fragrance lovers.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci Flora is just beautiful. It screams perfection in all ways, it's just the perfect fruity floral perfume. It's my favorite scent in the whole world! I'm just afraid this is discontinued... They sell Gucci Flora EDP in online shops now and then but I'm not sure it will last. Last year I couldn't find Gucci Flora anywhere and just now found it online for a perfect price! I then purchased the Eau Fraiche version instead, which is equally beautiful.

If you're like me and can't find EDP anywhere, really... go for the EDT! It's not a weak or watered down version at all. It's slightly more fresh but still great performance trust me! Flora EDT has better performance than many EDP's out there. Even better performance than most fragrances from Chanel and Thierry Mugler.

Edit: The EDT actually has slightly better performance than this one. I love both scents but I will keep purchasing the other one since it's more inexpensive and slightly more fresh.",01/22/21 05:32,mimissekat
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This. Is. A. Masterpiece.

Being the miserable geezer that I am, I submitted a review of ""Flora EDT"" many months ago where I think I stated that it was too weak, and I couldn't smell much of anything. In the name of transparency, I did have a tiny sample, and suspect there are some minor differences between that and this here EDP.

""Flora EDP"" is, however, the most beautiful, feminine, elegant, kinda-sexy scent. Yes, Perfumites. I actually find this a little bit sexy. Is it weird to say: If I was a guy, I'd love smelling this on a girl?

The opening of citruses and mandarin orange is - no joke - possibly my favourite citrus opening. It's probably tied with ""Coco Mademoiselle"" is that respect, actually. But - by Jove - it is heavenly. It's beautiful, soft, vibrant, and glamourous.. And warm! Did I mention warm?! That orange is warm and enveloping with zero sharpness!

How is peony such a perfect floral note? Gentle, sweet without being cloying, and ever-elegant! The added osmanthus does have that gentle slight apricot smell that is a little syrupy and bloody divine! The rose is very subtle. For those terrified of choking, heavy rose - FEAR NOT! ""Flora"" cradles you in her soft, sweet, gentle hands.

The patchouli really helps this last! As gentle as the scent itself is; it actually hangs around. Rest assured, you never get that dirty patchouli scent here; all the patchouli does is help this last, and GOD BLESS IT FOR THAT! The sandalwood and pink pepper are present, but don't overwhelm. I honestly think the pink pepper stops this from devolving into something boring. When you sniff yourself a few hours into wearing this, you get a nice, gently-invigorating kick from it.
The sillage and projection aren't monsters, though...but, in this perfume …I feel if it invaded your nostrils, it would ruin the gentle nature of ""Flora"".

The bottle is perfect: Heavy glass, unique hexagonal shape, delicate cap, and adorably pretty black bow. I also completely acknowledge this is a PERFECT spring scent, but it's so damn comforting and warming that I'll wear this year-round.

One of my absolute favourite floral scents: A gift of warm orange with fresh peony.
A modern classic - and deserves to be recognised as such.

Stunning! Stunning! Stunning!

The cream is subtle, it’s not gourmand cake-strong, but I’m glad it’s there. This fragrance is both warm and cool, like one of the first nice days of spring where the sun feels amazing but the breeze is cold. Gucci Flora initially made me think of Princesse Marina de Bourbon Reverence, even though they have little in common note-wise. So, I sprayed Reverence (which I am fond of) on my other arm for comparison. Both perfumes definitely smell juicy-floral in the first hour. Though they are like sister scents to me, Reverence smells more green/woody.
Gucci Flora dried down to a beautiful peony-Osmanthus-whipped cream scent on my skin. I will strongly consider buying a full bottle when my sample is gone. I could see this being a new signature for spring and summer.",03/02/20 14:37,CreamSunshine

I am excited to try the edt!
I imagine a lady from the 1800’s wearing it. She is beautiful and feminine, loves to have fun and has a captivating naughty laugh.

But for some reason Gucci Flora EDP does an OUTSTANDING job preventing this from happening.

First spray a burst of peony, oranges & citruses (no lemons) which quickly settles into the sweet osmanthus and later into a slightly peppery candied patchouli.

Basically a sweet, summery floral with a dash of citrus and patchouli, actually smells very very sweet like candy on my skin.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"If I'm being honest, I find Gucci flora EDP very generic. To me it smells like light fruity floral shampoo/hairspray, but not in a bad way. Overall it is a like, but not a love. I will use up my bottle and probably not repurchase.",08/15/19 13:22,pjspaceshit

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is smooth, but still flowery. I mostly get the flowers with a faint vanilla like sandalwood and peach (osmanthus), these notes keep it from being sharp. It's almost creamy. It still smells like something that could've just come out today. Gucci Bloom gives me a headache, it's too sharp, but Flora is perfect.

I bought Flora EDT right when it came out in 2009, and it's the only perfume bottle I've ever finished. I just bought a new bottle of EDP with a December of 2018 batch code and it smells so similar to how I remember. The EDP is just stronger, creamier, and less sparkling... which is perfect for me. I forgot how much I love it. I'm buying a backup, and I don't currently own backups of anything.

Yay for finding a new signature scent, even if it's not ""new"" to me!",05/08/19 16:01,HumesMistress

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I have the EDP an at first spray this seemed like it would be too much--it's a little like flipping on a light in the middle of the night--a bit startling. It settles down quickly though and feels like a proper, confident woman's scent. After it settles in, it's neither too sweet or too sultry. It's unapologeticly feminine in a bold way.

I have a soft spot for peony and rose combined and those two notes come through well on me. Anything with sandalwood is typically appealing to me too. I do find that this changes as I wear it, but it's a powerhouse of longevity on me (rare these days) and the changes are subtle and slow, with the sandalwood and pepper featuring more than the patchouli. The slow pace and subtle change after bold opening might make these changes hard to detect on some skin though.",03/18/19 10:21,Yasue
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"It's kinda generic. It's kind of a sugar bomb. And for some reason I still like it. It reminds me of walking past a Victoria Secret, and not in a good way. But I'm still wearing it and have been all week so there's something to it. I like the way it wears down, but on first spray it's overwhelmingly underwhelming.

I don't get citrus off this and I wish I did. I wish the citrus was sharper. I definitely smell peony, pink pepper and patchouli though.",02/13/19 09:48,princessmorbux

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Im pretty picky with florals. I like them fresh and natural. Im a keen and very experienced gardener so I like to think I know my flower scents after all these years. My gardens are dominated by scented plants and shrubs.
This fits the bill. Very ladylike and it will very much appeal to the English roses out there.
The peony, osmanthus and citrus dominate on the opening. A delicate fruity floral scent that reminds me of one of my David Austin roses. No surprise that there is some rose in here. It's very low key though.
There is a nice bit of kick from the pepper. I can just about detect the patch at the back.
A lovely casual scent for warm and lazy days. Very feminine. It's a shame it retracts to a skin scent so quickly. Moderate longevity but mostly as a skin scent.",05/21/18 02:38,shushkin

For some reason this 'metallic' reminds me swimsuit, therefor for me it is more as summer perfume. EDT is more fruity, but EDP more floral and airy. It is feminine, elegant, lovely and dreamy. There is something that makes it classy. Sugary, but not too sweet. Pepper and citrus note in background. I wish I could like it more, but alas too synthetic resinous for me.",02/18/18 11:40,muahah
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Love the peony opening! The citrus can seem overpowering at first but fades fast for me. I get a very warm, woody, floral. Not cloying or powdery to me at all, just very straightforward floral with those warm undertones. Received compliments almost immediately after putting it on. Still, if I had to pack a suitcase of perfume to take to a deserted island, this wouldn't be one of them. For me it is lacking something- maybe because the citrus doesn't come through so much. I also find that it doesn't last long and I go through it pretty quickly if I am wearing regularly.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"An underestimated one. Not unique. Not groundbreaking. But somehow it's beautiful and has quality in its simplicity. It's far from Bloom, their newer release, but it's not that much lower.

What I smell is a softly sweet balmy scent, sweetness that couldn't bother anyone, very feminine, a moderately sweet peony. The perfume is not as citrusy as the notes indicate.

A lot would state it smells shampooish. Just like Chanel Eau tendre. In fact if you like the latter, chances are you are going to like Flora too.

The osmanthus does get prevalent, with its fruity apricoty ascents, does not dissapoint. Simple and cute. Sweet and sour.

The scent deepens with carefully measured additions of santal and patchouli never becoming overpowering. Basically it's how Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet should have smelled like, but instead we got a mih meh smell.",12/11/17 13:46,iamoir
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Super fresh and powerful fruity floral scent. Perfect for uplifting mood. Maybe sharp at first sniff but it gets softer later. Every time I'm wearing this one I feel like I'm laying on a field of peony and osmanthus and has citruses juice splash all over you. Hahaha

I keep going back and trying it again and again as I would really like to love it! Flower Bomb does more for me!",10/06/17 16:16,lizzie2
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Flora for me was like when I first experienced Si by Armani and Flowerbomb by Viktor & Rolf. Like those perfumes it's a mature grown-up scent with more complexity and a little more 'shade' than the colorful sugary sweet girly trashy celebrity gourmand perfumes out there. I've gone through many perfumes like that and just like you stop wearing clothes that don't fit you anymore because you're in your 20's and not in junior high or high school anymore you finally decide to wear more sophisticated adult fragrances like this one.

Like it's Latin name Flora this is a floral. It opens up with a citrusy rose top, all green, leafy, herbal, rose-scented but with those citrus notes around it. Smells almost like neroli but more subdued and more green and herbal. The pepper note is noticeable and the patchouli which gives this that green coloring. The sandalwood is also coming through and some musk. It smells more unisex than feminine and has some pretty good longevity/sillage if you get the Parfum. The Toilette is more like green floral toilet water and lasts a shorter time. It's a clean but not soapy herbal aroma.

Flora might be too 'mature' for some 18 through 20 something year olds chained to the gourmand celebrity fluff but it's easy to enjoy and appreciate. This is good for autumn and winter and can be worn with like a formal black evening dress, a coat, or business suit. She takes herself seriously and exudes healthy confidence as opposed to assertive-aggression, she is peaceful, secure in her world, a little dark but more in the contemplative sense, calm, intellectual, bookworm type. Think Belle from Beauty and the Beast. This is an awesome perfume. I don't see it in any Macy's so I would look for it in the online sites like Amazon.com or eBay",08/24/17 04:14,shauna.parra
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"@toni64 the current bottle & packaging are the reformulated version but still has all the notes that the old one does.

But if you love this EdP, go get the gold cap version as a back up, as much as you can & you will not regrets. My personal rating, BIG 10 TIMES LOVES FOR THE EDP GOLD CAP VERSION & just a like for the EdP black cap version.

However, on me It pulls an ever-so-slight ""cleaning product"" smell and has a bit of a ""burn your nose hairs"" pungent quality to it especially at first so that would prevent me from wearing it really often.
Overall though, It's a nice non-offensive perfume that I could see working on any age woman. I just wouldn't personally wear it very often.",06/27/17 06:20,mhill461

Right oh.
I very much liked the beginning and heart notes of this fragrance.
There is a sweet note in the base which annoys me.

I've also tried on Gucci premiere EDP today, which is in the same strain as this, escept premiere is more peppery and floral.

See I'm at the base note stage and I don't know if I want to open my new flora, as I could still swap it at this point.

I wish everything was made in 30ml sizes!
Premiere was a rip off $230 for a bottle, flora, about half that, and I got mine on sale further reduced. That's the only reason I got it. Four letter word: sale

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I don't know why I've been avoiding Gucci perfumes all this time. Recalling in my memory there was this episode 4-5 years ago in the perfume store. Gucci Flora line had just reached the market and everyone was so excited about them, so they were way too popular at the time and mainstream. That's something I dislike because people want the same product and we end up smelling all the same which is boring. Long story short, I sniffed all of them and found them very alcoholic, but I admit it was my fault because I was sniffing them all at once without leaving the right amount of time to my nose to relax.

During all this time Gucci Flora meant nothing to me and I was not even interested in them. But one day my female cousin told me she had smelled Flora on her friend and loved the perfume. That's when I started to gain interest in it. As soon as I found my self at the shop I went spaying it on my arm and paper strips and guess what? I loved it even better. This is so feminine and elegant and classy. It is a fruity floral to me. I love the peach note and peonia. But this frag wouldn't have been so special if it didn't feature the pink pepper note. You see there is this sort of continuum between Gucci Flora, Guilty, and Première and the element that acommunates them is the Pink pepper that confers the sour, tart feeling. It it wasn't for this note they would be floral or oriental scents like so many others in the market.

I've smelled both the edp and edt of flora but the edp is way better and with more character and more longlasting. The edt lacks something, it's not that deep and the peach note that I love so much is not prominent. Flora edp is perfect for any occasion and season. Whether you're wearing a casual and chic style, a dress, a tailleur this perfume will always go perfect. Definitely a great frag to have.",10/13/16 10:45,lulami

Base Notes Patchouli Sandalwood Pink Pepper

Flora was the Roman goddess of the spring. Each year on the vernal equinox when spring arrived into the city of Rome, the citizens adorned themselves in flowers and laurel leaves and scattered flower petals on the streets. The Floralia held around April 27-28 was the Spring Festival in honor of the Goddess. Of course it was just a drunken and debauched feast day, and there were grapes being fed to Senators and soldiers by pretty maidens in gossamer gowns. It was a toga party. But can you imagine that aroma of flowers everywhere? There would have also been the smell of incense. I wanted Flora to smell like the Floralia, a hedonistic cornucopia of fruits and flowers, woods and incense. But no such luck. This is only a whisper of the Floralia. When I closed my eyes and inhaled the scent, I thought I smelled green leaves. And I did. It's patchouli. This has a green herbal patchouli but it was not very aromatic, it was faint and in the distance. It smelled like green grass as well, and it reminded me of garden bushes and shrubs. It was also reminding me of the opening to Quelques Fleurs with those green notes and citrus. This also has green notes and fresh citrus. There is a pleasant mandarin orange scent at the first spritz of Flora. Then the osmanthus scent wafts into the air. Aromatic, green, but again, a whisper, almost like we're leaving the Floralia on one of the roads outside of Rome, or about to enter into Rome and can only vaguely make out what's going on. The osmanthus is a note I enjoy in fragrance and it's the biggest accord here. Then I smelled some rose and peony flowers very pink and soft, delicate and dreamy. The scent of flowers gives way to the sandalwood in the dry down. It's a linear scent as in it does not develop into other scents nor does it every become heavy. For me the true Flora or Floralia scent is Paris by Yves Saint Laurent and Quelques Fleurs super floral fragrances. This is not floral enough for me. Someone mentioned that it smells like herbal-floral shampoo and it does. I have a shampoo and conditioner that smells just like this. I do enjoy it. It's refreshing, it's a quiet little spring scent and very relaxing, soothing and sweet. I enjoy putting it on after a shower. It does not have a long life in fact sometimes it's on me 2 hours other times 5 but that's not enough time for me. I would say it's moderate not too weak but the longevity is not to my liking. I also feel it sits close to the skin and doesn't throw out much sillage. It's pretty.",05/13/16 17:53,Gigi The Fashionista

If I had to choose just one word to describe it, that word would be ethereal. Maybe it's the combination of the base notes and the osmanthus, when it dries down is simply perfect on me. The patchouli, which can create olfactory tragedies, is smoothly blended with the sandalwood and together they add depth to the scent. The projection is good, not too invasive but noticeable.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This somehow gets me a lot of compliments. I used to love it very much, but it's one of those things that I get tired of eventually. Gets rather unpleasantly sour during humid days. Maybe it's just me, though.

It's been nearly a year since I last used it. I'm sure if I re-visit the bottle on cooler days, I would find that I like it again, even for just a season.

In any case, I'll give it a thumbs up for all those days past that I loved it very much.",12/17/15 15:47,tessaeastgate
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The fresh florals are very apparent, which pleased me. Most florals give me a headache but Flora smells like a clean spring. It's clean, slightly bitter, and not heavy at all. The dry down is warmer and the rose is slightly overpowering.

There is one thing; I applied this to my wrist, and my skin immediately itched and formed a slight rash. This is not something that has ever happened to me before, so perhaps Flora is just not right for my body chemistry.",12/10/15 05:29,fleur fragile

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This perfume is not what i expecting to love. I've imagined of a sharp and heavy floral scent with a citrus opening. I was wrong.

All i can smell is sweetness from osmanthus flower, peony and rose come together at middle. It's a warm, sweet, happy scent. I'm very enjoy this. It's easy to wear, suitable for all weather. Not too in-the-face scent, no harming. Love!",07/30/15 07:53,AgentEffex
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Flora is a welcome change from a fruitchouli or a vanilla-based scent. It's a heady, warm and very sweet floral.

The opening is characterised by a juicy floral centered around the fruity, apricot-like osmanthus, which was lovely when combined with some slightly sharp citrusy accords. This developed into something a little more soapy and watery, until the scent really started to unnerve me. I then checked the notes and realised what it was: patchouli. That horrible, stomach-churning funk when combined with very sweet notes will always be my nemesis. I did not enjoy the dry-down of this at all. Soft to moderate sillage; longevity is for about 5-6 hours.",07/29/15 23:57,RosieRachel
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,Very similar to the others of the flora range. I think this scent is a bland watery floral sort of thing very much like D&G The One which I also don't particularly care for. I think it is the rose in it which ruins it for me as my nose is very much put off by anything rosey. Lovely scent but not for me.,07/12/15 20:36,Jmalone84
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This perfume was totally not what I was expecting when I went to spray it. I was imagining some kind of heavy, yet conservative ""Anais Anais""-style floral. Gucci Flora EDP is a sparkling floral fragrance. It smells like an old-school chypre without the animalic elements. Flora is rather linear in its progression, slightly soapy and more fruity than floral in my opinion.

A nice scent of citrus, osmanthnus and peony. Acidic and sharp, it reminds me a bit of sherbet lemons (some say cat-pee, which I sort of understand how this could evolve as such on certain people's skin but not on mine). Obviously skin chemistry plays a big role in the evolution of this fragrance. This is definitely a try before you buy.

I also don't know anybody else who wears this fragrance, if that's something which matters to anyone.

Unfortunately, like most other Gucci fragrances I've tried, the silage and projection is not good. As an eau de parfum, there is a nice scent cloud for around 2 hours or so, but then the scent dies off considerably. By around 6 hours in it has become a skin-scent.

Overall complete longevity is 7-12 hours, but like I said this fades considerably in silage during that time.",03/12/15 11:02,CatherineLaundon

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I love this scent. A juicy beautiful floral, which is clean rather than sweet. A little powdery, but not too much. I always get complimented on my perfume whilst wearing it.

I wouldn't really say this is overly floral, as the name would suggest - this smells more fruity to me. It packs quite a punch and lasts all day quite easily, but the scent isn't too overpowering.

I wear this all year round and either day or night, it really is lovely and a perfume that I have purchased again and again.",12/29/14 08:41,Leximackenzie
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This was close to a ""want"" for me, but I found it is MUCH different on skin than on paper. Perhaps it's just my chemistry, but -

Flora EDP starts off with a fuzzy, sweet, floral, citrus combination - and that's where it loses me. The citrus is lemon & something more along the lines of shampoo-based-soapy mandarin, and the peony is undeniably sweet & strong. The sweetness is very much on the sugary side - not gourmand, but sickly sweet & sharp. The drydown is just a slightly softened version of the initial jumble. So, while it's linear in it's progression, it's still feels like a clustered, clumsy mess.

For a refined & more blended scent that shares similar characteristics, try: Creed's Asian Green Tea, or even Miss Dior EDP for that sweet citrus!

I'm wondering if the EDT is more polite, because I was really hoping to make this 'fume work!",12/16/14 19:01,Bloodlust
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I have always loved the Flora scent, so when Gucci released the EDP version I was like YAAAAY because it had to mean that the only thing wrong with the EDT version - it's longevity - would be fixed.

WRONG!

This version of Flora is more rounded, more deeper, but still that feminine, fruity/floral, scent that is like heaven in a bottle. I imagine this is what running in a field with flowers in my hair would smell like (I live in suburban australia, so forgive me if running in a field of flowers smells nothing like this)

but COME ON you would think being an EDP it would have to have decent staying power, or at least be miles better than the EDT. I sprayed at 8am, by 10am it was very weak. Might as well have saved my $$ and bought another EDT bottle. I even layered the body lotion with it aaaaand nothing :( I shouldnt be that surprised, Guilty Intense was not much better than regular Guilty in the longevity department.

I am thinking Gucci is jumping on the ""make it weak, customer sprays more, customer uses more, customer purchases again sooner"" bandwagon. At least there will always be Chanel.",11/17/14 04:22,SweetHeart90
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Lovely, sweet, green leafy floral, not to be mistaken for a fruity-floral. The juice is actually quite rich and thick. Longevity on my skin is 8+ hours and projection can be loud if sprayed with a heavy hand.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Dreadfully boring. A very sweet floral. Overpriced and overrated. It fails to inspire any sort of mood or emotion in me. Just the regular bunch of flowers, in a done-to-death combination of rose + peony + citrus + some sweet watery floral...but wait, it gets worse...in Gucci Flora that generic (but usually lovely/fresh/pleasant) combination is intensified and made cloyingly sweet by the addition of patchouli.
So I guess that just makes Flora even more intensely and in-your-face generic than the regular, lighter rose/peony/citrus combos.",04/27/14 14:25,CozyCat
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I feel it a little bit too sweet and a little too acidic. Maybe it's because my skin type and pH. Anyways, a beautiful blended scent. Young but immature. For girls between 15-25 years. I may say that I prefer more deeper scents such as Bvlgari Jasmin Noir or Very Irresistible Givenchy. For those who want to keep it simple, in a white laced medium length dress and some flats or a fine sandal, in the summer sun, this will be a well balanced perfume.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Follow up to previous post;

Having worn this for 2 days now, I can say I really do like this. I do not like any fruit in perfumes, and looking at Osmanthus in the notes info, I see it is apricot/leather. I guess I am picking up on the leather/patchouli/pepper as opposed to fruit in this perfume.

It is almost chypre like. Slightly mature but also wearable by women, but probably not teenagers.

I would call this a ""business"" scent, elegant, refined and classical, and is close to the skin but I find that appealing as my husband has to get close to smell it !!!

However don't let that put you off, it is well constructed and I will be sampling more Gucci's as a result.",02/04/14 21:18,ginawadsworth
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I am very fortunate in that my husband likes me to wear perfume, and if he goes to the city he often returns with bearing perfume gifts.

I was given his last night, at some ungodly hour, on his return. As I was wearing Obsession, I chose to wait until after my shower this morning to try it. I have never purchased Gucci before, so this gave me an opportunity to test something I would not have bought. My husband has a good ""nose"" and chooses such lovely perfumes for me.

Once again, he has brought home an Olfactory delight. I often get so caught up in doing research here before I buy that I prejudice my choice.

PS! I've finally bought me a Flora EDP 50 ml. and I enjoy every bit of it! I can't really understand some of the harsh reviews below, but I'll tell you one thing. If you've smelled Flora from the bottle in perfume stores and it smells weird or sour, please don't let it scare you away as the testers are often treated badly and lights and warmth will destroy the fragrance.

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is a unique, young lady.

At first spray it's very light on the floral and just sweet, lemon candies, the chewing kind. After a while, it's like I don't understand why it's even called ""Flora"" in the first place. The different kind of sweet citrus fruits, patchouli and the ever so slightest hint of peony is what radiates softly from where I sprayed it, after about 10-20 minutes of dry-down time.

It's unique. Definitely. Many times in the past when I've walked past someone I've detected the subtle traces of this in the air, and since this was a blind buy, I smirked and went ""So THIS is that perfume!"" when I sprayed it. It's almost as if it sparkles and tingles slightly in your nostrils when you smell it, as if beaming a smile of citrus and bright florals. It's beautiful and everything you could possibly ask for in a signature scent.

Unfortunately, while it has outstanding lasting power, its sillage is so soft it's near indetectable. I'd had hoped for something more potent from an EdP, but I guess that's the charm and personality of Flora: The sheer tenderness of it.

I'm in love.",01/18/14 22:37,Thurea

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Seems I'm just one of the few here who got vanilla from this EDP after I tested this from a department store. I liked that it was a fresh vanilla as opposed to a warm one (a warm one would be cloying here in the tropics), which I found quite unique and more attractive than the sweet vanillas which abound nowadays, but was surprised upon looking up the notes in fragrantica that there is no vanilla. I was even more surprised after purchasing a bottle that it was totally different from how the tester in the store smelled on me. Perhaps the tester was spoiled? But funny that I liked the ""spoiled"" scent better than that of the fresh bottle. Flora's scent is off-putting and I almost couldn't stand sniffing it on my skin. I don't kmow for sure what osmanthus smells like, but if that's the strongest note as voted by reviewers here, then I'd be more wary of that note in future purchases. I don't get any citruses on my skin, but I do smell citrus and mandarin orange when sprayed on clothing. Too bad, because the citruses are the only thing that balance out the cloying (osmanthus?) note for me. Flora is just okay for me but I wouldn't think much of parting with it.
EDIT: I live in the tropics and I tested this frag in the rainy season. It was much more humid then; but now in the cooler and drier months of January and February, Flora gets much better. The citruses become a bit more noticeable and balances out the osmanthus.",09/08/13 08:43,janelle70
Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This bottle has a lovely design. Everything about him is perfect and good quality. Since the hexagon has a heavy glass, finishing first and when we open the box, the internal black pattern with flowers on white makes it an elegant and delicate gift.
The scent is mild, springlike absolutely accepting a good summer.
I'm already famous for citrus detest, but here's an intriguing citrus, the top notes, citrus and bergamot does not scare me, the pink pepper is very calm this scent, his only fault is that 'strangely' is called Flora (me sends the flower, but feeling he came to understand this name in the broad sense of the word), is classified as a floral, but the flowers are so shy that you hardly feel them. Its floral notes are very timid even, you know they are there in the whole of the work, but do not feel alone.
And seeing the review below, I'm not the only one who thinks that it.
In the evolution allows the combination of patchouli, sandalwood but that makes a marriage work with citrusy.
It is very comfortable, there is a striking floral, or a perfume that goes a trace or something, who will only feel approaching.
He makes the kind gentle, meek and gentle, for those days when you're dreaming and needing to see everything in pink
Well, there is a floral that is not floral, citrus is no burning nostrils, soft and lovely.

Este frasco tem um design lindo. Tudo nele é perfeito e de boa qualidade. Desde o sextavado, tem um vidro pesado, acabamento de primeira e quando a gente abre a caixa, a estampa interna preta com flores em branco faz dele um elegante e delicado presente.
O perfume é suave, absolutamente primaveril, aceitando numa boa o verão.
Eu já sou famosa por detestar os cítricos, mas está aqui um cítrico intrigante, as notas de saída, cítricos e bergamota não me assustaram, a pimenta rosa está bem calma neste perfume, seu único defeito é que 'estranhamente' se chama Flora ( me remete a flor, mas sentindo ele passei a entender este nome no sentido amplo da palavra), está classificado como um floral, mas as flores são tão tímidas que você quase nem as sente. Suas notas florais são muito tímidas mesmo, vc sabe que elas estão lá no conjunto da obra, mas não as sente individualmente.
Na evolução permite a combinação do patchouli, mas é o sândalo que faz o casamento funcionar com a saída cítrica.
Fica muito confortável, não é um floral marcante, nem um perfume que vá deixar rastro ou coisa do tipo, só vai sentir quem se aproximar.
Ele faz o tipo delicado, meigo e gentil, para aqueles dias em que você está sonhadora e precisando ver tudo em cor de rosa

Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Initial Spritz: Lilly is the most prominent
5 min later: it's a very light & clean; I smell lemon and white flowers
30min later: That harsh lemon /acidic note has disappeared ...it reminds me of J'adore with a drop of vanilla or a lighter version of D&G l'eau The One
1 hr later: a shy rose tried to shine amidst white flowers, vanilla and lemon
5.5 hrs later: apricots and white flowers, still very similar to a less acidic less musky J'adore
9 hrs later: a nice warm apricot scent

On my skin there is no patchouli ,sandal wood or peony.

Overall Gucci flora is light but long lasting. It stays fairly close to the skin and I keep having to put my nose right up to my arm to smell it. It is not linear so if you are repulsed by the initial smell give it some time to develop. It is a good scent for those who don't like strong perfumes and those who gravitate towards fresh / floral scents.

Skin Type: oily
Office safe: yes very
Potency: Medium ( 3-5 sprays)

I first smelled Gucci Guily EDT on my sister. She used to wear it when she went out on the evenings. It was through her fur coat, curled hair, statement necklace 'glamorous phase' :) so to me this will always smell like those things.

Gucci Guilty Eau was a gift from her to me, as she knew I loved the smell. Although this is a different flanker, it smells enough like the original to me. I really like it for when I am wanting something clean and soapy that smells classy.

Gucci Guilty Eau Gucci,"An underrated, easy-going white-musk-based perfume. The floral note in the pyramid above shouldn't be (Lily), but (Lilac) instead.

It begins so musky, but after leaving it to rest this perfume resembles the smell of (baby powder) in a refreshing manner. It isn't dusty; it rather feels aquatic and cold.

It smells feminine, innocent, clean, fresh, soothing, and charming for casual and sportive wear during spring and summer. It's really refreshing, and that special fruity sweetness is quite addictive. The sillage and lasting power are both amazing, from full bottles--at least from my bottle. Even after you stop noticing your sprayed scent, it remains a compliment getter.

P.S. It seems some production batches have performance shortages, as I can realize that from few reviews, and that's a common issue in the industry. The performance from my bottle is adequately loud and very long-lasting, 8+ hours. I'm sad for reviewers with non-satisfactory experiences.",06/21/17 08:34,perfume_infatuated

Gucci Guilty Eau Gucci,"I'm not opposed to aquatic notes that so often smell synthetic or like hairspray, sunscreen, cosmetics, etc. For example, Gwen Stefani's (discontinued) perfume was VERY synthetic, and it was just fine by me.

Gucci Guilty -EAU- is more than I can take because it goes beyond smelling synthetic, to me it is overwhelmingly medicinal, like an antiseptic. I feel as if I smell like a first-aid product, or maybe I smell like a hospital? That antiseptic accord is so strong I can almost ""taste"" this fragrance in my mouth; it's medicinal on an institutional level. Meaning, it smells like a disinfectant cleaning product so strong, you can't buy it at the grocery store, only hospitals, asylums and prisons can buy it from some industrial supplier. In this sense, the name 'Guilty' is fitting.

There's a soft floral dry down (more powdery than creamy) but that school nurse's office smell lingers in the background even as the lilac takes the stage. The lilac stays very close to the skin and is gone fairly quickly. All I'm left with is some powdery musk very close to the skin, and then a short time later it's completely gone and the only thing that remains is the feeling of inflammation in my face (my sinuses).

I haven't had a perfume physically irritate me this much, ever. I don't think I can even finish this sample, and that's unheard of for me. Yikes.",05/12/16 17:23,ICIchrissy

Like a natural sweet smelling skin scent. This is a warm fragrance. Also there's something powdery in there. Not listed in the official notes, but definitely there none the less. I have a feeling that this might become one of those ""I'm not sure she's wearing perfume or if that is her natural scent but she smells so damn nice!"" ...types of scents. Precisely because of that characteristic I have now moved from like to complete love with this fragrance. I tested it today, if I can't shake it off my mind by tomorrow I might have to splurge and add it to my collection. It's very different from anything else I own. Tbh I can not smell any of the individual notes listed. Call me crazy but I almost sense an old school makeup-y/baby powder/ facial cream kind of smell to it. In a Good way!

It dried down to a really powdery light skin scent. I expected something really fresh and aquatic but musky and angelic at the same time. I feel cheated on by Guilty eau.",04/25/16 23:04,chakalitpasshun
Gucci Guilty Eau Gucci,"So initially i wrote this review for the Gucci original but its actually for this one!
Ulta had a good selection of the Gucci guilty team and other Gucci perfumes, so after testing them all on paper, this one won a place on my wrist. It instantly reminded me of these elegant perfumes mature ladies wear to fancy events, of course a more youthful version - I used to go to the opera a lot as a kid and this scent brought me back to that amazing spring night atmosphere with ladies in sparkly dresses and with their mink boleros on, where their perfumes would all blend together with the scent of the white flowers of the night - must be the lily. As time passed by it became more intense, in a good way. It def distracted me while working out - at first I thought maybe a window is open and this aroma is coming from outside because that flower note smelled so real. I love it and prefer it over all other Guilty scents.",03/19/16 19:30,sassa7
Gucci Guilty Eau Gucci,I love this fragrance. It's very warm and inviting...the musk and the white floral are perfectly paired. Lasting power is so-so but overall it's a beautiful perfume and my personal favorite from the Guilty collection of fragrances.,02/09/16 08:44,Chicagobelle

Lilacs, powdery and spicy notes are almost gone completely.
It's still kind of nice, but there's not that essence in it, that I liked about Guilty. I think Guilty ifself is a light fragrance, it's doesn't necessarily need an Eau version.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"Gorgeous scent, this is a big love for me. This is a very approachable clean western Oud that still maintains a middle eastern vibe. There’s no cumin or “funk” in this unless you think leather is funky.
In the initial opening there’s a lot of sweet rose and tart blackberry, it’s a little naturally sweet and jammy, not overly/synthetic sweet. Around 30minutes the leather and Oud come out more, the patchouli is light but detectable. Everything here is pretty evenly blended, no one note seems to dominate, and it stays in this realm for several hours with better than average projection. At the 7 hour mark this has become a warm dry amber with a 1-2 foot scent bubble.",05/10/25 09:29,PhonePotato
Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"Durty, fonky cumin-laced oud. Yes there's patchouli, berry, and rose, but they're challenging to detect against the strong animalic backdrop. For advanced noses only - if Ombre Nomade is too much for you, back away slowly. I like the smell per se, but I'd rather not have it represent me in the world. Good for dirtying up too clean frags in a layering combination. Voice of the Snake and Guilty Absolute Femme offer gentler and more wearable remixes of this DNA.",04/09/25 13:27,ameda

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"This bears a shocking resemblance to Arabian Oud Royal Oud (which is $1500 retail). I wouldn’t be surprised if Alberto Morillas drew his inspiration from that cologne on this one as Gucci Intense Oud is similar to Black Afgano.

This is the best masculine rose I’ve ever smelled and the only rose scent I’d actually really wear. It’s a smooth fresh rose with blackberries smoothing it out. This one is very underrated years into collecting I’ve only found one other fragrance like it. It is unique and smells awesome.",01/26/24 03:45,POTFORTY2

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"So this has a similarity to Guerlain’s Oud Essential. I’m a Guerlain addict, so this pains me to say, this is better. The blackberry puts this over the top. THIS IS IMPORTANT. This is a total departure from the rest of the Gucci Guilty line. If you get this thinking there will be even a hint of the Guilty dna you will be disappointed.

Saying that; this is my favorite in the entire line. It’s predominantly Blackberry, rose, and oud. It’s a bit mysterious on a masculine wearer. Black tailored suit, black button down shirt, no tie at an evening out. It’s also perfectly unisex. If this was in a niche bottle, people would love it. I think the fact that they included this in the Guilty line may be where some of the criticisms stem from.

If they had called this Gucci Blackberry Oud, I think, knowing what you’re getting, people would’ve raved about it.
I don’t wear a lot of rose fragrances myself, but this is my favorite. The performance all around is solid.",08/25/23 14:37,JohnMurrell

Performance is weak and that adds to the reason of passing out on it",08/06/23 05:00,Fragaddict123
Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"Pretty similar in vibe to absolute pour femme, but with some notable differences. The rose accord in this takes a more powdery slant, whereas the rose in absolute feels more citric and sharp alongside a more prominent patchouli+cypress accord. I wish the cypriol was bumped up to take the role of cypress, because that balanced out the juicy berry+rose in the absolute. The end result is more powdery and soapy, but with a clean and deep oud accord + soft leather running through it. It is marginally more masculine than absolute pour femme, though I find the two are firmly unisex based on my skin chemistry. The gucci guilty absolute series (male + female + this oud) was an incredible set of flankers that came as close to niche as any designer has gotten in the past decade or so. It's a shame its been discontinued, and I recommend picking this one up but under a 100 dollars, it's definitely niche quality but not worth breaking the bank for.",03/25/23 13:25,ameagari
Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"This is my second comment/review, just to tell you how much I love it! Smells like berry liqueur or a berry (fruit) punch. The blackberry here is predominant and sweet, but the oud adds a sour/slightly bitter kick that drastically calms down in the drydown. It has a boozy smell-the same sour effect alcohol would add to a sweet berry punch, perfect to balance out the sweetness. It smells like it has vanilla, something not creamy but smooth and round must be the amber. I would honestly wear this on a night out. Black dress. 1 gentleman in the comments below said this was too sweet for him to wear and it leans way more feminine to him, which I can foresee many men thinking the same, but no doubt, men would love to smell this on a female",02/03/23 08:44,Ambrocia scents
Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"Love it. Maybe its the pepper, but something makes this just unforgivable in the beginning. But after the opening, it apologises, and you forgive it. Starts off putting, musky, old, bitter not sweet smell with a bit of oud. Then later becomes a soft, soft sweet(not enuf to say jammy but almost) rose and oud combination.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"I blindbought this, hoping to get something with the Gucci Guilty Absolute DNA plus Oud...but...just like Patrickchula (below) this started out as a hate/refusal.

As soon as I sprayed it on, it smelled like a bush of roses in which a dog had pooed. Fortunately, the potency of the oud and rose combination wore off quickly...and 20-30 minutes into it, it smelled like an old lady which had stepped on dog poo...1 hour into it, it smelled very comforting, like my grandma smelled when she put on Bulgarian Rose Moisturiser. By the time I got smelling the drydown ... I was hooked. It's quite creamy and rosey but once you finetune your nose to it, it's classy, refined, undefiantly bold...as in it definitely shows confidence without being arrogant.

This is the first Oud fragrance I’ve ever worn, so that smell was a little weird to start. I have so many Gucci Guilty. My first ever bottle was EDP this time last year, and now I’ve got 20 bottles.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"There is no better oud out there for this price*!!! I can admit that I was initially put off because it's in the gucci guilty line, but once I tried it out I was immediately in love!

This fragrance is powerful, without being overpowering. The oud is very present while still allowing all the other notes to shine through, and it has the perfect amount of sweetness to keep it on the sensual side. It is my go-to for a night out because I feel sexy in it and it LASTS- it will definitely be present, not just lingering on me even after a full night of dancing!

Both me (female) and my boyfriend can wear it and get compliments. Great value, great versatility- if you have been looking for a good oud but aren't quite ready/able to spend 300+ dollars on one this is your best choice.

10/10- will hunt it down and repurchase when my bottle runs out even if it gets discontinued.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"Add some oud and rose to one of my favorite long lasting aftershaves, Pinaud Clubman Special Reserve, and you have Gucci Guilty Oud!

The oud isn't overpowering. I get a fruity opening with some oud. As the fragrance rolls on, you smell the oud but the rose, despite being a top note, doesn't really become prominent until further into the dry down. It's one of the more interesting fragrances I own for that reason.

Others here write that they're getting great projection. The projection is ok on my June 2018 bottle but the scent hangs around for what seems like half a day!. The longevity is excellent and surprised me to the point where I had to edit this review several times. I find myself smelling whiffs here and there 10 hours after applying 4 sprays.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"So, when I got this when it was still kind of affordable, and given the quality of this fragrance I still think it's worth the price even if you have to pay $100 for a 90ml, it's so good that I would say that could be worth it if you're into fragrances like this. I would describe it as completely unisex but I would warn that initially I was turned off by the fact that I think it even leans ever so slightly feminine which will turn a lot of men away. It's very slightly smoky with the oud, but it's blended so well with the rose and the blackberry note that it doesn't give off too much of a smoke vibe. It's fantastic though, I think this could eventually become a favorite but as of right now it's maybe not quite there yet. It's a good signature scent though because it has more versatility than your average oud fragrance, it's very office friendly, and I think you could wear this almost anywhere although maybe it's not quite sexy or obnoxious enough to wear to the club or on a night out where you're with your buddies. It is, however, very romantic smelling and I think it'd be a very good fragrance for a night with your significant other to a very classy restaurant. It's very, very elegant in a way that Gucci seems to excel at with their fragrances.

Buy this is you like fragrances in the style of Tom Ford's Black Orchid or Dior Homme, or other highly unisex floral fragrances that are popular with men. ~$90-100 is probably the sweet spot for buying this one at the moment for the 90ml. B+ to A-, I'll have to wear this one more though because it's so interesting.",12/02/21 13:53,Marcjohn86

It it smells like Gucci absolute pour femme with an added light oud vibe, the blackberry and oud blend very well together, not your typical oud/rose smell.

This composition has been done many times, rose oud, the two notes play well together obviously. This is a A M creation and I can tell. These designer houses want to put all the money in marketing and seek genius arts such as this one to create a “high quality” smell for us. If you want true quality and art , go niche.
This stuff has only been on my hand for a couple of hours and it’s not backing down, projection is out of this world and the smell is starting to change , top notes are heavy on the rose and it plays well so far and isn’t going anywhere soon. The leather amber and oud are starting to dance and I like it. I haven’t owned any Gucci Guilty frags and don’t plan on it YET. I will try absolute as it’s right up my ally note wise .

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"I can see how this really stands out and for anyone accustomed to the typical designer lines carried at the dept. stores seems exotic. In its most basic form this is simply an oud rose, and a far cry from anything original although perhaps a new marketing approach. By comparison to the popular fragrances, it's mysterious, middle-eastern, and dark. If you are more accustomed to middle-eastern fragrances then this will smell fairly common. The juice may even have a few drops of oud in in which are detectable in the opening, which is fairly compelling, but underneath lives a typical leathery synthetic oud that is common in most of the decent oud fragrances available. The rose is sweet, and there is a noticeable jasmine-vanilla-patchouli combo that rings the Mugler bell and makes this in my humble opinion much better suited for a woman than a man. A fruity berry note is tucked in there, and a typical salty synthetic ambergris and musk that smells very 1998. A warm sandalwood is overcrowded by the glut of notes. As it dries down the composition reveals itself to be overloaded and a bit sloppy.

And I must say that I am not disappointed.
It opens with a sweet blackberry and a hint of spice. However these top notes are short lived and in the middle, rose and oud takes over. The oud here is not bitter but has more natural woody feel to it. In the end a touch of leather gives it a slightly mysterious heaviness.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"Well!! my experience with the Gucci Guilty Absolute for both genders wasn't successful at all! I couldn't endure the complexity of the so fruitful blackberry note next to the annoying woodsy note in Gucci Absolute pour femme at all, and found the men's version so harsh for my taste!
So when this came out I was hesitant to try it out, But I did,, and,, OH MY GOD! It was an easy LOVE for me with no doubt!!!


Comparing it to its sisters:
Gucci Absolute pour femme
I guess it does indeed share the same Blackberry note in GA pour femme, but its so smooth, so pure, and lovely here, but it doesn’t stay for the whole life-span of the fragrance, however it keeps the scent sweet along with the roses; and I'm glad, actually so glad that I don't get the cypress and the other annoying woodsy notes that are included there!! instead, Alberto Morillas replaced these notes with a heavenly luxurious oud note!!

Gucci intense oud:
Both are extremely successful oud fragrances, Intense oud is more subtle, less sweet, and more smokey, has a perfect niche quality, pure ingredients and for that I give it 4.5/5, leans to be more masculine than unisex, but I wear it no matter what.
Gucci Guilty oud is an easier, less serious concoction!! a beautiful mix between oud and sweet fruity notes, I give it 4/5, and finally a perfectly unisex fragrance!",01/31/19 23:08,rola.asad
Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"This was an immediate love.

Gucci Guilty Oud gives you a light, sour oud from jump. The blackberry is prominent, providing a sour sweetness that comes off a little playful. It’s not overbearing by any means - and I think this is aptly marketed as a unisex scent. I can’t say that it’s an extremely unique scent - but it is done very well - and is pretty true to the note breakdown. Unfortunately the blackberry goes away a little quickly - and the scent itself seems to breakdown rapidly. With that said, the scent that remains is nice - mostly oud and rose. It’s a nice entry for oud lovers and newbies. Not scary, not risky. I would recommend.

This is a well-blended, hearty-yet-fresh fragrance perfect for the winter. The leather and oud combine to give this an old-school lightly animalic opening, and I told the woman at the counter that ""I'd bet there is a decent amount of patch in here because it would fit right in as a Tom Ford private blend fragrance."" Sure enough, there it is, adding to the rich, indulgent base. Very nice touch.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"I confirm: Morillas is back, and Gucci just had a (needed) earthquake!

When I tried Guilty Absolute, it has been a ""coup de foudre"" (litterally a ""thunder hit"", meaning love at first sight in french). One week later, it was on my shelf. (Yes... despite the love, I m patient enough to buy at online discounters for 1/3rd of the retail price)

With Guilty Oud, it's an encore. A beautiful fragrance with good projection.
Rose is present, but no worries, it's subtle (I hate strong rose oud fragrances).
Berries on top, then a subtle rose and clean patchouli (no worries, it's very light, no Zino here, haha!), and then an amber and oud finish. Great frag, even if the oud is the usual aromachemical, and clearly not the major note here. Gucci Intense Oud remains the best choice, but at current ebay/discounter pricing (~$60), it's also a winner!

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"The third Alberto Morillas composition of late from Gucci, Gucci Guilty Oud, follows two successful releases (at least to me) in Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme and Pour Femme.

Certainly the most-recent Oud feels like a logical continuity from the next-most-recent Femme, as there is an overlap of berries, rose, patchouli, and amber (in order of descending prominence).

With Femme, we get red berries, but in Oud, we get a sharper, more distinct blackberry note that sings from the top, surely the brightest part of the entire fragrance, but nevertheless (similarly to Femme) quickly drying down into a rose/patchouli/amber blend, with very subtle hints at leather and woods.

Oud's performance is strong, a bit denser than Femme (and perhaps even slightly edging out Homme), with a couple hours of great projection followed by another 6+ on skin.

Certainly these latest releases feel of niche quality and execution, and in the case of Oud specifically, a synthetic, smooth oud serves nicely in lieu of a richer, albeit more animalic or medicinal, counterpart, seen in higher-end offerings.

Pricing ($137-$146 for 90ml via retail) is higher than Femme and a lot higher than Homme, but I'd expect Oud, like its predecessors, to be available on the secondary market at a significant discount. It's a bit of a tough sell at retail, but under $100, it may turn a lot of heads like Gucci Intense Oud did years ago.

Gucci Guilty Oud Gucci,"Opens juicy and sweet with the blackberry and oud combining for a (sadly) fleeting boozy aspect. There is nothing stale about it, as the overall impression is fresh. It loses its fruity top note quickly (as in Lalique's Rose Royal) leaving behind bright dry woods and what smells to me like rose d'mai. It wears close to the skin, and if you get close; you'll smell the pink pepper. This is a great grab-and-go choice for me. It's very pleasant and totally inoffensive. I'll probably wear it a lot, but I think on a man this would be really sexy.",09/30/18 02:24,Bstefcorbin

After maybe two hours, my hand smells like straight OUD... so disappointing. 3 hours later I go to retrieve the test strip from out my pocket. Wow somehow it smells better on the test strip. It actually smells like a blend of notes. I guess this composition doesn’t seem to agree w/ my skin chemistry AT ALL. But even on the test strip the fragrance is a 4/10.

A Forgotten Rose Perfume Oil Gucci,"This had a lot of potential and also the rose here is very pretty, but the musk has some smoky/barnyard nuances, which makes this rose smell dirty, but in a bad way. It is compared to another Gucci A Song for the Rose, I would say A Song for the Rose is a bit lighter, brighter rose, which projects nicely, doesn't just sit packed on your skin as Forgotten Rose.

If you want an idea of what it smells like, try Yardley English Rose or if you want something that's a full on, realistic rose scent that really lasts; get Tea Rose from Perfumer's Workshop.",05/02/22 15:30,Scent_Insensibility
A Forgotten Rose Perfume Oil Gucci,"This smells lovely but has absolutely no longevity on me. After 3 hours the perfume has disappeared completely (no exaggeration). I can only write that up to either a bad production batch (unlikely) or weak formulation (probable).

Comparing this to Dior's Rose Elixir Precieux it is like comparing an 'eau de cologne' to an 'eau de perfume' where the latter lasts for 12 hours or longer. As an experiment, I put both perfume oils on this morning (11 hours ago). The Gucci perfume had no scent left after 3 hours. The Dior perfume oil is still smelling as if I put it an hour ago.
Oddly, both perfume are based on the essence of the same type of damascena rose although from different countries (Gucci uses rose from Bulgaria and Dior from Turkey) so the difference shouldn't be big, save for differences between manufacturers. The Gucci perfume oil is a very light formulation of the rose, almost as if they were holding back on the concentration, and the pink pepper is quite subtle but just enough to add some spiciness to the oil. The dry-down leaves a delicate rose with a soft musk but disappear much too soon.
This is a shame because I added this to my collection in order to have a rose perfume oil that was a little lighter and smoother than my Dior and would provide me with more options when layering. However given the high price for this 20ml perfume oil, I must confess that I'm terribly disappointed.
I had high hopes for Gucci's new exclusive range and to be honest, I really do love the violet/orris perfume oil but there is nothing in this rose perfume oil that justifies this high price.

To save you from the disappointment I would steer clear of this one. If it is a rose perfume extract you're looking for, the 'Dior Rose Elixir Precieux' is a better option.
That notwithstanding, I do suggest that you try Gucci's other perfume oils like the violet/orris ('A Kiss From Violet') which is both rare and beautiful or the woody ('Ode on Melancholy') perfume oil where cedar and sandalwood plays softly together.
Unfortunately, this time and with this perfume, Alberto Morillas let me down.",05/13/19 11:52,Cragrat

Gucci No 3 Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Gucci No. 3 starts with honey and sunshine, rays of aldehydes and ribbons of dry coriander. My nose reads the rose and narcissus as intertwined, a duet of dew and oil, velvety and waxy, pretty and funky, both sipping icewine and getting their toes dirty in the earth. They dance seductively to Prince's ""Cream""—'you're filthy, cute and baby you know it.' The air is soap and sweat and leather and hookah smoke.

Things get amorous in the horse stable, and under the stars there are 23 positions and a one night stand, and it's woody in the woods—patchouli and vetiver, so it starts off light and proper and settles hot and heavy. To be clear, this is not an aggressive scene—it's sensual, the peignoir is on the floor, yet it's discreet at this stage.

Gucci No 3 Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I have two bottles of Gucci III. One earlier without the green dot symbol and one later with the green dot. Both have gone slightly bad in the top notes: the earlier one seems higher in alcohol and has an acetone like opening while the later is more oily and has gone rancid. However, in the earlier bottle the alcohol/acetone note disappears after some minutes while the oily/rancid note in the younger bottle sadly lingers on.

Once the bad opening in the old bottle has disapeared, the scent is remarcably well kept. A wonderful earthy green pine forest punch, where the damp mossy ground smells both chalky dry and mysteriously deep like the bossom of the earth.

In the old bottle I can't smell any flowers, while the younger bottle is a bit more cheerful with early spring flower vibes. But I like that strictness about the older bottle.

Because it is conservative, regular, balanced, and especially polite.
The fleeting fragrance and lack of tension have not changed the aesthetics of the era. №3 is difficult to impress the public and set off a trend.

Gucci No 3 Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I’m finally excited to post a review about this one.

Some might not agree but this is based on my wardrobe. This is Fendi Donna’s tinkered and attenuated version. But do take it with a grain of salt. Attenuate doesn’t mean a poorer iteration. To me Fendi Donna is much potent of a combination of leather and coriander with hints of rose.

The Italian houses really did make good use of this mulled wine and leather accords but this one covers up the glamor with aromatics and greenery. I’ve heard this being compared to Givenchy III or even Miss Dior. Let me make their distinctions:
-Givenchy III - coldest of the three and with the highest amount of galbanum.
-Miss Dior - warmest and muskiest of the three. This is wonderfully herbaceous.
-Gucci No.3 - rosiest with a nice emphasis on leather.

In no way the three are similar but they can be used as reference points as green chypres. Gucci No.3 is the sum of all the wonderful aspects Made by chypres during the 70s.

There’s a beautiful fruity pink rose in its opening. There is a honeyed aspect just like what the olden Givenchy III had. It has the beautiful and gentle herbal nuances Miss Dior has. It’s really impeccably done and well rounded, smooth.",05/29/20 01:38,jung_yunho26

Mostly a skin scent on me, this is lovely, but not unique, and given the price I prefer it's smell-alikes. Scherrer 2 hits that honey note, with greater sillage. On my skin, Givenchy III's heart matches Gucci 3's heart accord, with sillage in the 1 foot region.

This is a great scent, but I have issues with the idea of spending $40+ for a partial bottle, when the alternates cost less ($18 for a FB of S2, GIII a little more), and have more sillage.

When I was younger, I would smell it from the bottle and think it was too green and strong, but after a half hour on the skin, it becomes wicked. Definitely for a woman who is confident and sassy and can handle the attention. Not a girly fragrance. Much too seductive.

""-No, really! I don´t like that very much.""
""-eeeehh, shut up and enjoy!""
""-Does it suits me well? You think so?""
""-Good enough to stop pretending you don´t like it THAT much!""

This is kind of dialog was going in my head while i was wearing this perfume for the last 30hrs.
Have you heard stories that perfumes don´t last at all, or max several hours? Well, forget it with this one!!! It´s been almost 36hours on my skin now, i have had a busy day at work and i can still smell it on my skin! After 24 hrs it was still going quite strong! 2 sprays only!!
The scent itself you ask?
Well, i have both EDT spray and pure parfume and back in the days i started with a parfum. I liked it very much. I found it to be beautifully floral with an interesting undertone of green notes. It was a summer period.
So i went for a EDT now during an early springtime. A bit different. It starts as a sharp green one. Maybe too much green even, more than i expected it to be. That bothered me, so i was undecided. Vetyver is sharp, but it battles with tuberose. Vetyver wins, tuberose (and some other flowers) fades away defeated very quickly. It stays green BUT turns after an hour into deliciously leather scent. This is a worn leather. It has been worn for a long time and became soft, worn and inherited all the scents of the owner (in a good way, you know that smell when you put on a vintage leather jacket). She has been using some rose perfume by the way while wearing this leather jacket and even maybe some ""Magie noire"", so all those scents are mixed together give you an impression of what it smells like on a drydown. Bold. Outstanding. Vintage.
I would say this one has even more of a vintage feeling than some other vintage scents even older than this one. Still undecided about the weather, which one it suits the best, must be autumn. Can be perfect for a girl in her late 30´s i think, but it is not a written rule.
This classy Gucci along with Gucci Arte ARE the top scents of the house of Gucci in a matter of quality.
Aplause! Bravo!

UPDATE (a year later, late winter in cold northern Europe):
I have been using it since quite some times and i must admit that this perfume has moved from ""Like"" category to ""Love"" category. This is finest quality Gucci which is one of my all time favorite Gucci´s now ever. Exceptional lasting power (i have EDT), great potency and simply unique. Don´t overlook it because it is chypre and you mucght dislike chypres. If you like/love ""Silences"" by Jacomo, then this one is even much better. I love them both but ""nr.3"" is way over in terms of quality and composition to my nose. I personally prefer it to ""Silences"" because it has tuberose and leather amazing combination. I do have severeal bottles, but i would love to get some more whil i can to be sure i never will run out of this supreme masterpiece.

It is such a shame that it is so hard to find and when you do you are looking at paying well over £120 for this size. I was very lucky when I got this as I swapped it for an item I had on an online site and this bottle hadn't been used or if it had it was only once or twice and was boxed. On receiving it I checked it was genuine and sprayed it and thankfully YES it was genuine and had the lasting power that I remembered. Like most wonderful, long lasting, popular fragrances the manufacturers seem to discontinue them at the height of their popularity and then make a similar fragrance that isn't as strong or long lasting. It's such a shame this has been discontinued and no doubt if it is brought back (which i'm sure they will) it will prob not be as rich and long lasting as the original (but I could be proved wrong? Fingers crossed! Lol) This fragrance is for a female in her 30's plus who knows what she wants and feels secure in herself (or wants to give that impression! Lol) and also wants to turn heads and is (or wants to be) a little bit flirty. It is an intoxicating fragrance that even though it is strong is somehow not offensive during the day in the office but sultry enough for the evening to let people know that you are there but once again NOT in an offensive way (if that makes sense? Those who have this or have had this or smelt it will know exactly what I mean) If people are desperate for this I would say check on ebay or some on-line fragrance stores as some stores on line do seem to have it (from looking on-line in the last few days) Luckily for me I (as I have said) have the 120ml spray bottle so this will last me quite a long time especially as I will not have to spray it during the day also. If you can get this fragrance it is well worth the money (there are some on ebay at the moment selling 30ml, 60ml and 120ml just for your info) I am holding onto this baby and will wear it when I need cheering up, want to feel sexy/flirty or when I want to feel like I can achieve and do anything and no-one will or can stop me (so quite often then)! Lol! The fragrance actually reminds me a bit of Estee Lauder Youth Dew (the original NOT the amber although that is lovely also)as it has similar notes but doesn't have as much of the powdery smell. xxx",11/29/11 20:38,liverpool2sex

Thank you to the review that talks about working with horses and how this fragrance completely reminds you of that experience!! I am going to wear it next time I go riding!! The more I think about it, the more your description is totally accurate of what this perfume smells like. I wonder if the makers had that in mind; especially considering that is used as one of their primary symbols.

Also, after 3-4 hours I smell fresh tobacco. Not smoked, but the kind that sits in a bag waiting to be put in a pipe...interesting.",11/04/11 21:29,Hellokt

Gucci No 3 Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Gucci III reminds me of when I was a young girl. At that time I had a great interest in horses. The soapy leathery smell resembles the care for the saddles and bridles.

We were a bunch of girls in the saddle room. First we used a hard yellow half translucent leathersoap and with that worked up a foam. After that we gently washed the dirt away with damp cloth. And then after drying, we used a lot of red-brown colored leather fat, in order to make the leather soft and smooth. The smell in that room, just next to the horses, was just amazing and represented everything we loved.

So, what I get most from Gucci III is a beloved soapy leather combined with a large amount of patchouli, which in this metaphoric description actually would be the warm, sweet, slightly animalistic note from the horse itself, or the dirt from it. The floral notes then? Well, on my skin, the flowers are very weak. Weak, but also delicate and beautiful.

Try before buy is my recommendation. I love it and I will buy it but I'm having a hard time to find out when to actually use it. I'm going to finish my mini first, and use it in different occasions to see where it actually works for me.",06/13/10 05:59,mymlan
Gucci No 3 Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I decided to test the Edt

It does smell the same as the parfum only less intense and the lasting power is not quite as good (as is to be expected).

On me Gucci 3 is very fresh but at the same time inviting, the adelhydes and bergamont are very dominant in the top notes lending a soap like characteristic to the composition but it is very pleasant. these notes are present throught the perfume though they loose some of their initial strength.

the rose in the heart is completely lost to my nose; on me there is nothing floral about this compostition.

I clearly detect the musk, leather and amber in the dry down which give the fragrance a sexy sophistication.

There is nothing pretty or girly about this scent but instead there is a mystery, the scent dares you to invetsigate further and eventually seduces you with its uniqueness.

It is not a fragrance for girls but is a potent weapon in the hands of a mature woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it.

Here's a little secret: I plan to wear Gucci 3 on my honeymoon.",10/13/09 12:29,mandi
Gucci No 3 Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Warm aldehyde opening that feels a bit old fashioned, but elegant, mysterious and powerful... I guess phase when Gucci was releasing their old perfumes was the best thing they've ever done. I admire their one of latest Gucci by Gucci (it has some interesting edge), but Flora- it might be nice, but no, definitely not Gucci. It doesn't smell Gucci in my opinion- it's bad example of wasting good name on such bad compote. Which smells like perfume named Kristine N.2 and costs like 3$ for 15ml.
Gucci 3 is such perfect leathery chypre. Warm aldehyde with green notes and later I detect soft beautiful lily of the valley, jasmine. Warm, comforting and expensive it is.
Shame they discontinued it... I guess if it would be available now they would ruin and reformulate it (due to it contains oakmoss, bergamot and jasmine).'-'
Later it continues to develop and is balanced sour and sweet accompanied by leather and woods soaked in sweet floral oils. It runs in my memory wardrobe and picks out various memories- elegant evening dress and massive gold accessories (where did they come out? o_O). I am sitting on a bench in garden and enjoy the smell of various flowers there. Other, I am in forest and there is place where lilies of the valley grow, I pick a very fragrant bouquet and take it home. Yeah, this fragrance smells of my childhood.",08/18/09 07:07,Trvevil

Gucci No 3 Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Deep, dark, somewhat leathery and strangely woody. This is a sexy fragrance and is not for the shy. If you do not enjoy aldehydes, this is not the one for you. It's an '80's' perfume to be sure. I don't get any tuberose or lily from this. To me, there is a good deal of bergamot-green-smell at first spray (but by no means is this light or citrusy-it's all heavy) and after that, it is straight to dark and sexy. By the time it dries down, you have a lovely amber patchouli mix. I love this one and feel very confident when I wear it but it is certainly one to be applied lightly.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I really enjoy this scent: it’s sweet, powdery, floral so it’s fairly easy to love if like me you like that classic style feminine scent. Lasts a good amount of time for a white floral as well. However, for the price it isn’t super interesting, I’ve smelt cheaper perfumes that would be just as nice for daily wear. This is also one of those perfumes you’ve definitely smelt before (or at least it’s similar enough to the other Bloom flankers that it feels that way). I’d shill out for something like Do Son as a warm, smooth floral over this one.

Edit: So I’ve actually come to really like this scent, and found a discounted bottle so have bought a full size. It’s like wearing a cashmere sweater, fluffy and comforting. Because it isn’t super complex, it’s easy to wear at any time and stays on clothes smelling nice for days. Maybe I was a bit harsh in my initial review 😅",05/02/25 10:47,rosemary.milk

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I have lived within the 'clôche' of this perfume for two days to form an opinion about this, what appeared to be and really is, a lovely perfume. by a 'deed' this morning, chosing my perfume for this day, I never anticipated what happened. I chose Chanel No.5 and by spritzing that classic perfume to pulse and nape of the neck (I have to formulate that somewhat elegantly, isn't it) I suddenly got a 'vision' about No.5 and 'Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori' (Ambrosia hereafter). they both got a lift. I love flowerperfumes. I immediately smelled the superiority of No.5 but this didn't diminish the Ambrosia. I noticed the No.5 was superiorly mixed and macerated, to form an elegant and well-known, nevertheless again, superrrefined perfume and herewith we see that, for me, Chanel No.5 isn't yet, obsolete or oldfashioned. it superimposes itself on those blatant categories. but by its very chiqueness and sophistication it also affirmed my thoughts and feelings about Ambrosia. that is also a very well blended (now I have the right word) and enduring perfume. because I tested it for two days I noticed that the best thing to do was to just let this 'clôche', this bubble perfuse everything around and in it, which it did in an at first, lovely loud and pervasive tuberose intrusion and then, with the more molded and suffusive caprices of the white flower-indole scent. Jasmine and Tuberose are difficult to evade. I think the Honeysuckle was swept up by the hardheadedness of said Tuberose and Jasmine. it was a pity I never noticed the Rose and Orris, but they were of course also enveloped and on the other hand, also 'informed' the Tuberose and Jasmine. when then you compare that with No.5, here is a Jasmine and Rose that live happily ever after, with a clear and separate Ylang perfume, yet all blended to this powdery and flowery presence of a Haute Parfum. I think Ambrosia is just a perfume for these times, heady, present, 'harmonized' by Alberto Morillas. then everyone has her's, his's, own perfume history and I started in 1974 and then came of age in the 1980s with Coco, Poison, Obsession, Giorgio, Knowing, Opium, Gem, Rouge d'Hermes, all the bewitching flowery over-the-top perfumes which I loved and loved and for which the end is (for me) nowhere in sight. yet I was able to separate Ambrosia from these legends and find it a harmonious, lasting, Tuberose friendly perfume. But it also redefined No.5 for me because I suddely smelled its femininity, its Hauteté, its well blended character, and its timelessness.",08/19/24 03:38,jaguarundina

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Goodness gracious -- sweet, absolutely intoxicating blend of honeysuckle (Rangoon Creeper is Chinese honeysuckle), tuberose, and jasmine. Voluptuous, decadent, indulgent, luxurious, it's beautiful but quite heavy, so I'm thinking it's best applied with a light hand and may be too heavy for hot summer months (will try it once it gets hot here, to test it out my theory). I'm not exactly sure I detect the orris specifically, but I'm thinking it might be what gives Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori its heft and significance compared to the much lighter original Gucci Bloom -- pretty but way too light and fleeting for me. I really love GBAdF but it's definitely a very specific smell; you have to be in the mood for a very thick, sweet, delicious-without-veering-into-gourmand territory, floral perfume with a LOT of character and large presence. In spite of its beauty, I could see how it could be just TOO much on very hot days, in close quarters, or in office environments (don't want to choke people out!). Even though it doesn't smell at all the same, GBAdF has some of the same lush, over-the-top character of a #1 favorite of mine, Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds, which I find myself most often wearing to bed, to be enveloped in its overpowering dreamy beauty.

Interesting fragrance, but not as unique as the yellow one. It has some generic feminine notes that are present in lot of fragrances. Still good if you are going for seductive dark/mysterious mature vibe.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"The Bloom line has been, without fail, very sweet—each flanker being an episode of a warm, feel-good comedy series, with a different set of memorable guest stars each time. Tuberose is the star of the show, with jasmine as the quirky deuteragonist that everyone loves. However, tuning in this time, Tuberose has a formidable co-star—Orris root. The rose is a subtle support player with a few memorable one-liners, and honeysuckle is the plucky, cheerful comic relief, but it’s the orris that steals the show.

Ambrosia Di Fiori is a subtler, more sophisticated, powdery affair than the rest of the Bloom line. It’s also the least sweet, at least on my skin. The rose adds a bit of aromatic flair. The tuberose is more understated here, less bubblegum and sexy and more subtle and mild, adding softness. The drydown is semi-sweet and powdery, though not quite cosmetic powdery—more root-like and earthy. I’d compare it to Chloè but without the fresh or sweet accords.

It performs decently well, lasting on my skin for about three or four hours before fading. If you like the idea of a less overtly sweet white floral with a mature and earthy edge, I say Ambrosia Di Fiori is worth a shot.",09/23/23 21:03,HannahRosesAreRed
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This flanker of Gucci Bloom is so much better and more realistic smelling than the original perfume from this line... the original Gucci Bloom smelt so synthetic and sickly sweet to me but Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori smells like a lush bouquet of white flowers!

If you like honeysuckle and tuberose, you will LOVE THIS!!! It as all about these two white florals in this fragrance and all of the other notes in this just buoy the smell of these two flowers up and enhances them. I next get a good dose of jasmine, but it never overpowers anything else in this perfume and I find this really well balanced.

I also think that the addition of orris root in the base was a BRILLIANT idea and it added some depth to this perfume without drowning out the florals with woody notes. I get a tiny hint of a very romantic and lush pink rose too, but it is only just a hint.

This fragrance also had a moderate sillage on me and was not too strong or too light a sillage and it lasted just over 7 hours on my skin. I thought that it was a lovely and feminine fragrance and I could imagine wearing this either day or night during the spring or the fall to really enhance those floral notes.

I give this fragrance altogether an 8.5/10. It is worth spending money on a full bottle of this and I think that it is the only Gucci Bloom you will ever need!",09/21/23 02:22,WhiteFlowerPrincess

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Absolute love, my go to clean feminine but not to green fragrance. The tuberose is perfectly balanced with the jasmine.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I apologize to everyone who genuinely loves this perfume but to me it smelled like chicken or instant noodles seasoning upon initial spray. I put it down right away but it was very amusing. I checked on the dry down some minutes later - generic green slash floral scent, very uninspired. The last chance I gave Gucci after the mess they call Gorgeous Gardenia. I just don't smell any sweetness in any of their perfumes at all, as if they take a firm stand against sweet perfumes. A world famous brand trying to appear niche would predictably end up with something... Like this. Oh well. Farewell Gucci!",08/10/23 04:23,kittenpawz
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"On my nose, this Bloom variant smells brighter, juicier, and more luxurious. It is an alluring blend of tuberose, honeysuckle, and powdery iris notes. Smells very modern and poise, yet has commendable longevity",08/06/23 03:19,gandrasta

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This is a treasure find for me.
I remember that first commercial for Gucci Bloom ambrosia.
They built it up with advertising a few months before it hitting the shelves.
They did it sneakily. First the occasional billboard type with no text Just beautiful bohemian style setting with flowers and vines trendling down. In what appears to be Eutopia or Eden. While a natural spring water pool/pond have exotic blooms floating asa few lucky lovely ladies get to bathe in what is the most intoxicating floral bath one could imagine. Then, it just says BLOOM. It was only here and there at first But then the adverts subliminally hit television usually evening. Magazines, of course advertising posters. Increased gradually. All I know is I had my alarm set for the day it came out and the time. Believe it or not. The only store that carried it was Macy's. The Gucci store didn't even have it. Nor the website.There were no samples available. I got .y bottle. It's worth every single penny. It doesn't have just Honeysuckle. It has Rangoon Creeper. (In the same family) Where generic Honeysuckle smells like a straightforward white flower. Rangoon smells like white flower, creamy jasmine, and a slight maraschino undertone way down deep. It's also made with Orris butter. That gives it a briocche sweet bread, sweet cream scent.
Yes you get Tuberose A nice floral, creamy and smooth tuberose. (Nothing heavy, animalistic sk*nky-type) Jasmine is a fresh green, and wet jasmine. The Quality, Silage, projection and longevity are phenomenal. Especially for a designer fragrance. This could compete with a nìche house easily. If could compare it to any other perfume. It would be very very close to Amouage Love, Tuberose. If you have one you don't need the other.
IMHO, the selection pyramid is not accurate I think because many people may be familiar with essential oils and not the actual flower. Also, Maybe they are not familiar with the Rangoon Creeper scent and it's notes Or the difference between Orris and Orris butter. I think it would change the pyramid a bit. Because the Creeper and tuberose are evenly matched. But the creeper is most noticeable of all the flowers Especially at first. The orris stands out very well. I think it's overlooked because it's Orris butter from living Orris. Which gives the perfume a sweet, cream delectable note. Unlike ""garden-variety""
orris. Which is powdery scent most people are familiar with. This is definitely one of my very favourite perfumes.",07/21/23 05:27,Celestial Bleü66
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Echoing what a lot of others have said, this fragrance just doesn't have anything special going on for me. Maybe it's good for layering, but honestly it's very strong, so I can't imagine layering it with anything else. It isn't necessarily unpleasant, it's just nothing special imo. It's a very heavy white floral, which I do normally like, but this one just feels like too much and too little at the same time for me.",06/30/23 05:30,juwlie

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"It's uh... Powdery, watery and mostly a dance between honey suckle and tuberose. Dries down sweet and creamy, but not too much that it comes off like a child's candy-scented cologne... The jasmine isn't as straightforward as that of the original Gucci Bloom, but still a very pretty scent. A sunny floral fragrance, but ironically might not be able to withstand the heat from sunny weather. The whole bloom line is pretty light, but the staying power of this one is pretty weak. Also, if you don't like the combination of flowers with cream, this might not be for you. If you want a slightly more mature watery floral scent, this is definitely not it.",06/06/23 09:33,River.c
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,I love the Bloom line. My mom gave me Gucci Bloom Gocce Di Fiori and that was my introduction to Bloom. Then came this decant of Ambrosia.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I really like this perfume, the tuberose and the honeysuckle is really overpowering so it gets a little boring after a few hours.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This is essentially the sweetest, most rosy, and powdery out of all the Bloom flankers.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Gucci is absolutely KILLING it with these releases. Morillas is a damn genius.

Although I *think* I prefer Profumo Di Fiori slightly, I adore this as well and I'm thankful to get to try it on! Longevity&sillage are good.

Profumo is like...a languid, sticky tuberose affair on an early September evening. It's golden, naturalistic, hazey, and a little narcotic.

Ambrosia however, is a gorgeously romantic, chilly evening spent indoors with your paramour on the end of winter and edge of spring. It's velvety loveseats, fresh bedding, open windows to the brisk night air, and wafts of manicured gardens.

I easily detect as much jasmine tuberose, but not nearly as much honeysuckle. This one smells a little more like the original Bloom than Profumo does. The florals are everything, and they're beautiful, but not too *prettied up*, you know? It actually makes me feel some type of way...it's truly lovely.

Just...lovely. 🥺",03/28/23 19:21,ShadowsofLight
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This is a phenomenal fragrance that I had a tango with at first. I sprayed in store, fell in love, bought it , but when I got it home and sprayed it amd went in for work, my first impression was that I couldn’t pick out any single note from the incredibly well blended floral composition. So creamy, tiny dusty heavy floral. Beautiful but so blended that in the first week I couldn’t imagine wearing this and not really being able to smell the notes in it. It was like i was in the scent cloud and couldn’t smell it from inside. And something felt stuffy to me that week. It bothered me that there wasn’t a stand out scent so I impulsively gave the bottle to my coworker when she complimented the scent. When she started showing up to work wearing it I was like what is that gorgeous smell on you?? … it was the bottle of ambrosia I gave her 😂🤷♀️💀so I found a small one on super sale and picked it back up again. If you’re in to floral like me, this is the perfect date night cozy winter feeling floral that almost feels like a vanilla amber but isn’t at all, and has nothing masculine about it. I needed to just use correctly to appreciate! And I learned not to layer this one… Anyway 10/10 for me.",03/23/23 03:38,HeatherMuffin

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"White florals with creamy natural smelling tuberose (eg. as opposed to So Scandal which is nice in it's own way but just not as actual bouquet floral but artificially sweetened) pretty simple but quite heady.. one to use with a light hand.

This is OG with more dept, definitely creamier.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Short: Creamy, slightly green and dewy white floral, similar to the original Bloom, but bolder and more mature. There is quite a big projection and longevity is great.

Long: A clearly tuberose dominated perfume with some influence from the jasmine and some other delicately sweet florals (rangoon creeper? - I am not familiar with it). It smells creamy, but not dense (Love Tuberose, Cocaine, Orchid Soleil are sweeter and thicker in comparison), it's softly dewy and slightly fresh too. Doesn't seem like the nightbloom florals, there are no indoles, rotten qualities, anything grape-y, no vegetal, tropical humidity or sweetness, no strong animalic sides, the only thing I notice is a bit gasoline-like and rubber undertone. Some greenery from young flower buds too. It's quite bold and statement like, but not full on that. No strong golden vintage opulence about it as well.
In comparison to the original Bloom - Ambrosia di Fiori is a more mature tuberose, whereas Bloom is softer, brighter, more youthful and jasmine dominated (clean, sterile, morning type of jasmines). That same jasmine note doesn't leave Ambrosia di Fiori composition throughout, giving it a weird, sharp and synthetic mutter. Not similar to My Way (that one is sweeter and there are string grape-like tones), slightly similar to Do Son EDT, EDP and current formulation of Fracas (though Fracas is noticeable on orange blossom and fruity tones too and I'd say it is slightly softer perfume as well).
As I am not a huge fan of lush, strong tuberoses, this is too bold for me.",10/09/22 05:08,violeteme

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I wasn't into the OG Bloom, but ordered a couple minis of different flankers to see if they may have the tuberose I desire. I ordered this one and the Profumo flankers. I immediately liked, and on subsequent wears, bought a full bottle and backup of Profumo, as it performed way better and smelled more pleasing to me, and was the only one I could distinctly smell real tuberose in. I liked this Ambrosia flanker as well, and ordered a FB, but after a few wears decided this one isn't for me. I mostly get a sharp jasmine, honeysuckle, and rose blend here, which comes off as very soapy, a bit mature, and a bit harsh like bug spray in the opening, and dries down to a barely-there skin scent that disappears way too fast for me. To continue being able to smell this scent, I need to reapply every hour. I felt the performance was the same in the original Bloom as well. Profumo will last 3-6 hrs on me, depending on weather, and will linger in my hair or on my clothes overnight til the next morning. I don't get noticeable tuberose in Ambrosia at all, at least not the type of tuberose you'd expect from Carnal Flower or any of those similar smelling tuberose. If there is tuberose here, it's that overly sweet neutered one like in My Way that unfortunately seems too synthetic and different from the quality tuberose I love for my preference. This flanker may work beautifully with other peoples chemistry, but for me, I prefer the yellow Profumo flanker, as that one smells the best IMO, has hints of real tuberose smell, and gets me the most compliments.",07/05/22 11:23,wondervalley666

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This is a beautiful fragrance. The florals are so realistic that they almost make me melancholy, like a beautiful, hot, lonely summer afternoon with nothing to do.
I love Ambrosia and Profumo equally. Ambrosia is sweeter and the tuberose is potent whereas Profumo feels greener to me. Both gorgeous, just depends on my mood. The bottles are also so gorgeous! Ambrosia isn’t a gourmand kind of sexy, but its smooth and creamy florals are so beautiful that it has an undeniable sensuality all its own. In the deep dry down the Ambrosia is reminiscent of a luxurious lotion or soap-not in a super clean or aquatic way though. It just blends so beautifully with the skin. Even when I’m not in the mood for this I can still appreciate what a gem this is.",06/14/22 14:13,sarahtheperfumelover
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Super-floral floral!
I think GBAdF is the only perfume I have that has 100% floral notes in its top, heart and base. But it is predominantly a tuberose scent and a glorious one!
It greets you with a fresh, clean, non-indolic jasmine but soon the lush tuberose reigns! It overthrows other floral notes to be honest. I cannot sense the rose or orris except in the very late dry down. The tuberose here is more creamy than in the original GB, a tad sweeter and has a less (but still has) green facet, so I probably didn’t need them both simultaneously as the differences are subtle, but I am obsessed with white florals.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"A randomly received (unwanted) sample of this in a Sephora order is what got me sticking my nose into perfumes after decades of avoiding them. To me, this is stunning. It is so unabashedly floral, a true ambrosia of some of my favorite flowers in all their beauty. I feel like this evolves to give each flower a turn to shine, sparking a lifetime of memories and associations. Such beautiful scents bring memories of happy moments, as the gardenias of my childhood, the jasmine growing outside a former lover's window, the honeysuckle of a single sun-soaked summer, roses which have sprinkled my life on various occasions. These are not memories of perfumes but of the flowers themselves, gifts from nature that have given me real happiness from their beautiful existence. It's difficult for me to express exactly what I mean, but some of those memories were moments of beauty and happiness stolen from darker realities. Whatever else was happening, my gosh, those flowers smelled glorious.

The florals are rich and beautifully balanced, the evolution is a kaleidoscope of exquisite specimens brought forward in turn until they combine into the sparkling sweetness of buttery orris. I can feel something like pollen on my skin. I am savoring my tiny sample, and every time I take it out and apply it, I have to stop everything I'm doing and drink in this precious magic. I get drunk on its beauty and whatever else is happening, my gosh, this fragrance smells glorious.

I haven't tried the original or any other flankers and I don't want to, I'm not willing to risk how this makes me feel. I love white florals and have others, but nothing like this. It is all floral and quite sweet on my skin, but it lives in a class all its own.",04/27/22 04:46,BotticelliBlonde
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I was out shopping today for birthday presents for our friends' daughter in Kohl's and of course I'm going to take a peek in Sephora. I haven't been able to sample to many of the Gucci Bloom line because they are always under lock and key at Ulta and the last time I was at Sephora Bloom Ambrosia is always sold out. Now I like the original Bloom but I thought it lacked depth, and the one in the yellow bottle gave me a headache w/ all the solar notes so I hated that one. But when I smelled Ambrosia, I knew I found the Bloom flanker for me, and I bought the last bottle they had on the spot. The salesgirl said it is one of their best sellers and I can see why. This is a divine tuberose perfume and blows most of what is for sale at the beauty counters out of the water. Gorgeous honeysuckle and jasmine start you off but when you get to that creamy and lush tuberose in the heart it is like pure heaven. The buttery orris and slightly powdery rose give a nice and lasting finish for this heavenly perfume. This is gorgeous and well worth the money. This is a year round signature scent. Ambrosia is buttery, lush, floral sweet (not candy or fruit sweet) musky and divine. A very feminine perfume. Beautiful.

Lasting power is amazing!!! Sillage is also great. Definitely a I’m here and this is what I’m wearing type of fragrance.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Honestly? This is like a little slice of heaven for me.
Heaven.

This perfume centers around a spiced tuberose. Along with that I can smell mainly honeyed white flowers (lily, jasmin?) and woods. It's so fresh, I could swear I can actually smell the pollen. I become a bee.
I find it vegetal, dry. Botanical, humid, exotic.
I see little red and black frogs on pods. I feel engulfed by tropical greens.

My best friend finds a heady incense and rose.

Two sides of the spectrum?
Maybe that's part of the magic.

Signature scent worthy.

Love it so that I sought and bought the main, original GUCCI Bloom along with the yellow (mustard) coloured version, Profumo Di Fiori.
Neither smell enough like this.
The original actually makes me nauseous shortly into the wearing. At first I can handle it (petals in water, captured by the ad campaign) but after a short while it becomes unbearable for me (muggy, muddled, too sweet). We're incompatible. Something in the original doesn't mesh well with my senses and makes me feel incredibly queasy. The mustard is nice enough but perhaps too much like a mix of this one and the original, along with a laaaarge helping of Ylang-ylang. Too much of the original in there and not enough of this one. They're both very dewy and pitch potent.

This version is perfection for me.
Other than being comparatively soft in projection.
It is a concern that if it were stronger I may not find it quite so alluring.
This is special to me, genuinely like a little slice of heaven. This is the only way I can describe it.
I have honestly dabbled with the idea of having it be my signature scent and would recommend it as such to others. It is a real beauty, a top favourite. Only wish I'd backed up and bought two more bottles of this instead of taking the blind plunge topple, getting myself those others thinking they might be just as good.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"HONEYSUCKLE! So much honeysuckle.

The top note was sweet, too sweet tbh. When that died back after about 5 minutes what was left behind was honeysuckle. Clean, true, fresh, bright honeysuckle. Four hours on and it's mellowed a bit, but it's still there. The notes say the basenote is Orris root, "" powdery earthy rooty scent, with woody, violet flower nuances"" and OK, seems right enough. We'll say that's what's balancing the honeysuckle for the afternoon part of this now closer to the skin scent experience.

This was a skin test while popping in and out of stores on a snowing, 25F degree day. All of that can impact the scent experience, but under these circumstances I loved it. Such a great, true scent contrast with what was going on around me.

I like the original Bloom and this one make sense to me as a flanker. Same base, same personality, but the prominence of the notes has been changed. Loved it.",12/10/21 11:01,coffeefifofum

This is a sweeter, less heavy version of Bloom. I think I can really smell the honeysuckle in the beginning, which I love.

It also doesn't last as long, but I just keep a purse spray and reapply after a few hours, which I don't mind because I like the opening the most anyway.",12/02/21 12:47,lisajmunro

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Am I the only one getting Miss Dior Cherie vibes from this? It’s not listed, but there’s a very prominent note of berries to my nose. And a musky base.

“Ambrosia” in italian is frequently used to refer to liquors and wine, so even though Gucci Blooms are marketed as florals and this specific scent is listed as a floriental, I was expecting something sweet.

And I was right: to my nose, it smells like a fruity floral. It reminds me of a Portuguese cherry-like liquor, Ginjinha. Some boozy notes would have been fitting and might have made this fragrance a bit more complex and less linear, but overall I find it a pleasant scent.

I agree with some reviewers below about a certain chemical harshness, but it’s not off-putting. The white flowers are indeed very green and the rose is faint to my nose. The flower I smell the most is a green jasmine, with some bubblegum tuberose following suit.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I received a Gucci Bloom sample, two flanker samples, and a Gucci Guilty EDT sample with my Oud Bouquet purchase from Macy's. Overall I have been very impressed with these Bloom fragrances. I saved this one for last, because it has a rose note included. Rose is one of my favorite fragrance notes, so I expected to like this one the best.

Gucci Bloom flanker test... GO!

Very green in the opening. So simular to Profumo (the yellow) flanker, that I actually checked the tiny bottle to make sure they didn't accidentally attach the wrong sample to the wrong card. But, nope, this is Ambrosia (the red) flanker. Can't say I am disappointed, as I love this opening. Rangoon creeper is a lovely green scent, and although it is not a listed note, I am pretty sure that is what I am smelling.

When this settles, it is much lighter than the original. It smells very different. Less creamy. I get a hint of green, sweetness from the honeysuckle, tuberose, and maybe a hint of rose. Like a hint of clean rose. Not exactly a soapy rose, but a clean green rose.

This is not a typical fresh pretty rose fragrance for rose lovers. The rose is way in the background, mixed with white florals, and very green. Like smelling a bouquet of flowers and stems, with a single rose in the midst.

The scent aura is not as strong with this fragrance, but I can still smell it around me, just MUCH lighter.

As it drys down, it gets a little sweeter, and the rose becomes more noticeable, but it is still very light. I would say this is my favorite drydown of the three.

This is not my favorite of the three, but it is still a very pretty fragrance, with a beautiful scent aura, and a really beautiful dry down. If you like light pretty clean smelling florals, you may really love this fragrance.",07/04/21 13:17,RainbowGirl
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,Ambrosia is definitely the slightly sweeter version in the line like others stated it’s kinda of creamy/buttery. When I sprayed it on I immediately thought Tom Ford Orchid Soleil; just more florals less plastic/cereal note. I like sweet so I definitely prefer this over the original Bloom; and for a dominant tuberose scent (where I usually associate tuberose as mature) this is sexier.,06/18/21 16:26,AmoreProfumi
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This smells so delicious. Opening is a bit green and mentholated, but wait to see the drydown. It is creamy, buttery, sweet, almost coconutty. Dense and rounded. This one is the most bubblegummy tuberose of all of the Blooms. It is also the sweetest and somehow reminds me of summer. Like it almost has a bit of monoi. Sexy, grown up perfume. Love it.",06/14/21 08:59,Katryna G
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,This smells so good on me! The slightly sweet honeysuckle and tuberose is beautiful and feminine!,06/09/21 14:53,Erica.Cass
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Like all the Blooms I have tried and own, Ambrosia is quite a lovely scent. Pretty, feminine, and east to wear provided you enjoy tuberose and jasmine, the two notes that together provide the common thread from the OG through all the flankers. Ambrosia is no exception. It's pretty, very floral and feminine, and easy to wear if you are a fan of tuberose.
Unfortunately, Ambrosia shares the same problem I have with all the Blooms I've tried and own (the OG and 3 flankers). The longevity is very poor and the silage is moderate at best. My bottle of Bloom is full sized, and the three flankers are roller balls, which may be part of the problem. However, it's a big enough problem that I will not be purchasing any other full bottles, which makes me sad because I enjoy them so much while able to smell them.",06/09/21 14:50,churinl
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I just bought this today and I love it! Its just so yummy smelling. Next I will try some f the other Blooms, but when I tried samples this one stopped me in my tracks. Love it.",06/04/21 23:23,annagupta12
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This is a lovely white floral, and one of the first perfumes I ever purchased. It is a classic for spring, and it smells nice in the fall too, though it's totally different from one season to another. For some reason, I dislike wearing this perfume in the summer or winter, and generally avoid it. This perfume is heavy on the honeysuckle and tuberose; orris also stands out to me, but there are other reviewers who say they don't smell it at all. I will say it does smell slightly ""sharp"" on my nose. It isn't something that keeps me from wearing it, but I tend to spray my outfit with it rather than my skin.",06/03/21 14:09,mars_maybenot
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"It is a lovely scent--I get the honeysuckle and tuberose more than the jasmine on first spray and the dry down is quite nice but ...it does not last long on me at all. And where is the ""Rangoon creeper""? LOL...I have no idea what that is but it sounded appealingly exotic and this perfume is *not* exotic. It is sweet, serene and pretty so if I ever want to impersonate a sweet and serene and pretty girl, Imma wear this. ;)

This is also the first straight up floral I have tried since I used to ""borrow"" my mother's perfume and maybe it is that mum association that makes me want to spice this up! I am considering layering it with a little sandalwood...it may seem like blasphemy (like when I layer Chanel 5 with patchouli) but I think it might work....",05/22/21 20:14,OdileVonRothbart
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Does anyone else get Narciso Ambree from this?
I sprayed it on my arm and that’s what I immediately got. It must be the tuberose I guess.
I will try it again later on so I can fully absorb the scent.
It has a peculiar smell so far. It has the DNA of the original for sure.",05/06/21 10:39,Koningin
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"A delicious scent that I love along with my husband, it is a divinely beautiful scent. I love this floral scent with is so lovely and projects with a very good intensity, so much so you have to be careful not to over spray. It is the only Gucci Bloom scent that last all day long on me.

The Jasmine and Honeysuckle blend so good together where you can't pick out one or the other which is more prettier to me less linear then it will add the rose scent to it bouquet. A enticing, alluring beautiful scent which is signature worthy. Add the Orris for a feminine dry down that is a warm, light powdery, creamy floral scent. I Love This!!",05/05/21 23:24,carlahoffman

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"It's hard to review all these flankers without comparing to the original, and each other. Ambrosia is indeed very similar to original Bloom and especially Gocce di Fiori. I was hoping for more creaminess in this iteration and although I do definitely get that here, the opening has quite a strong woody note, like dry pond reeds, that I find off putting. The dry down is thankfully reed free, but has a bit more of a mature feeling to it than its predecessors. Not sure it's quite the flanker I was hoping for but I'm reaching to find unique elements, as there's barely any difference between them at this point. Overall, it's still a very beautiful, creamy white floral.",03/23/21 04:24,elledeelee
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I really loved this perfume on paper! It smelled so amazing and soft. Unfortunately, on my skin, the honeysuckle is the most prominent note and does not go away. It lasts for hours, which is great for anyone looking for such a strong honeysuckle frag. I wish it developed better on my skin, but with my Ph it's just pure honeysuckle, which is disappointing for the price and potential of the perfume. It may be better on other people's skin, so try it out! Like I said, it smells so different on paper so make sure you do a wear test on yourself :)",03/16/21 11:13,haileytf
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I am absolutely smitten with this!!! I did not think that I was a white floral fan because everything I have tried in the past (that was predominantly white florals) bored me or reminded me of cleaning products. THIS is truly beautiful!!!! I don't have the ""expertise"" to explain why this is so good...but I'll try anyways. It has a depth to it but somehow it still feels fresh (not stuffy or powdery). It ~feels~ creamy somehow?...which is what I think I was missing from other white florals. It also has a slight natural sweetness to it but nothing that would make me classify this as a ""sweet"" fragrance, it just stops it from turning sour on me. I would 10/10 recommend that you sample this on the skin because smelling it from the bottle does not do it justice ♡",03/16/21 05:27,LuluBear
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This is the most beautiful fragrance I have smelled in the last few years. If you love white florals. I would say if you’re wanting a Gucci Bloom fragrance please get this one. Not that the original isn’t good but this version is just that extra indulgence I was looking for. It’s different enough to own. The opening is similar to the original but very quickly you can tell the jasmine is softened by ROSE and honeysuckle and there is a powdery softness from the orris root which is the root of the Iris flower. The dry down is sweeter and very velvety, the tuberose is incredible with the rose. it’s so creamy and a little heavier but not cloying. It’s not indolic or animalic. It’s like warm white flowers with Bulgarian rose petals and heavy cream. It’s so comforting and exceptionally well blended.
A true masterpiece.
Thank you Gucci. God I wish I got the big bottle!!!

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Wooow, one of my favorites! Smells like Gucci bloom original but little heavier, with heavier rose and tuberose. Smells like a summer night in south of Europe, where there are flowers everywhere and people are happy and sunburned.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"The freshest and sonorous of all Gucci Bloom, not so sweet and smothering, a little sour, reminiscent of sour rose hips, rice, white flowers, orange jam, some bitter herbs. Very persistent perfume for winter",01/19/21 10:55,Bgm_1923
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"My favourite of all the Gucci Bloom line; opens with strong freshness and green notes and dries down to a lovely cream tuberose with a hint of rose...sillage is not the best, but it lasts pretty long on me. Perfect day scent for spring/summer and autumn",01/16/21 07:29,bear11
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"To my nose, when I compared all the Gucci Blooms, this one was the creamiest of all. Its not creamy ENOUGH for me though...Im wanting it to get that whipped cream feel of Love Tuberose but it never quite gets there. Although I own this and I love it, I think the rose opening isn't my favorite. Its a very natural Tuberose. I have also noticed this performs better on skin than clothing. When sprayed on skin, it develops better: the rose dissipates, the tuberose becomes more creamy. On clothes, the rose stays and the perfume doesnt really develop at all...stays kind of screechy? I also noticed original Bloom smells great in the heat, this one was better in the cold. I haven't been complimented on this yet, which is a shame because I have smelled the OG Bloom on others and literally swooned with delight, so I'm wondering if I should have gone for the fresher original. When this one empties I just might!",01/13/21 12:45,jeanharlow
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I'm not a fan of green tuberose fragrances. I like tuberose fragrances that are in full bloom, where lush flower blossoms have reached peak of scent and are creamy, milky, or even lightly indolic. I don't even mind dark tuberose perfumes as in Flos Mortis, where the flowers border on decay. But, this is too green for me. There's barely any sweetness to balance out the greenness either. I still prefer original Bloom as it seems more balanced to me. Still, I can appreciate this is a beautiful scent. It just isn't a beautiful scent I want to wear.",11/18/20 15:14,Anamandy
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"the name is certainly apt! it smells like walking through an english cottage garden. unfortunately the honeysuckle is just too OTT for me. i do like the tuberose that comes through, and it's a lovely fresh floral - i cannot overstate how natural it smells - but wow that honey is overpowering",11/17/20 09:27,sophiekoss
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I own and really like the original Gucci Bloom, but this, in my opinion, is better. I love that it has an even stronger tuberose note and it seems greener and fresher than the original. It has that same warmth that the original Bloom has, but it's more tempered by freshness. I don't know if the two are different enough to justify owning both at the same time. But if in the future I finish Bloom, I may replace it with this.",10/28/20 07:14,Wwoman

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"An absolutely beautiful white floral.

It's a sweet tuberose/jasmine combo sweetened so lightly with the another flower in honeysuckle, & a touch of floral powder with orris & rose.

Beautiful all around, a love-or-like fragrance. A modernized classic smell.

Smell extremely similar to the original Bloom. I'd need side by side comparison to tell the difference.

A lovely spring day wear for any lady of any age.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"First five minutes it's realistic floral with hints of green leaves. White flowers and yellow pollen, only bumble bee itself is missing. I wish that it would stay longer such strong and clear floral as in those first minutes, but over time it turns to more yellow sweet-ish. Doesn't seem interesting and I don't get any associations, it's just yellowish sweet. It's nice, clean (not soap) scent. Not really office type perfume as it's rather sweet, but probably it will be inoffensive for most. Mostly summer, but can fit any season. More as day time perfume.",06/12/20 18:20,muahah
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I had a sample of this with a broken sprayer, so this morning I just popped it open and dumped the whole thing all over me.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"abigailtorres632, thank you for putting into words what I have been trying to formulate since smelling this! I was expecting this to be at least tolerable as the original is, but when I sprayed it, I instantly recoiled and dry heaved! I couldn't even begin to discern what I was smelling, I just had to get away from it posthaste! Now reading what you've experienced I have to agree 100% that this does have that same horrible stale almond/heliotrope strangeness that Beautiful Belle and Beautiful Belle Love have and I had the same gagging reaction to both of those scents, too.",06/02/20 10:10,DarlingNikki
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Bloom Ambrosia is intoxicating. Upon first spritz is a bit sour for about half a minute. I am not sure why but it is. Perhaps it is the Rose note.

Then all of a sudden it hits me. A lavish sweet Honeysuckle. I adore Honeysuckle so this is very pleasing. Then I detect a very straightforward Jasmine.

As Ambrosia develops I pick up on a glorious dominant Tuberose. This is a creamy, dreamy Tuberose. My senses get sent to the Heavens....Lahhh!!

The Orris adds an Earthy velvety dimension which is quite balancing seeing the bouquet is undeniably lush and buttery. It could become heady without it. If you love florals this is for you. A must have for the Floral lovers out there.

The sillage is strong at first then it is moderate but that is okay because I wear this baby for my pleasure. Longevity is about six hours. Not bad for a modern floral. I highly recommend!",05/08/20 04:00,Michylaka
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Love this flanker. I am drawn to anything creamy with tuberose/white flowers and this fits the bill. I wasn't that keen on the original Bloom, it lacked depth for me as did the other flankers in the range. I sampled this on holiday and fell in love, it has a creaminess which I adore. Some of the more commercial scents are all very 'samey' these days but Gucci has done well here. For me this should have been the original Bloom and I hope it's not discontinued going forward.",05/04/20 08:53,Danifresh
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I have a sample and wore it for the first time today, fresh from a shower and moisturizing my skin. It is beautiful and very similar to the original Bloom, but as others have pointed out, the rose makes it deeper, and in my opinion it lends a velvety component to the scent. The question now is whether or not to purchase a full bottle since I have the original, and many white floral perfumes. I must say that the quality is there, as in others in the line. What I may do is wait until I finish the bottle I have and purchase this one next, or drop hints to my husband before then. Another Fragrantician said something about the wonderful things Gucci is doing with tuberose, making it popular with younger people who would run away from an older white floral, screaming ""granny scent"". I would be happy to see florals in general making a comeback. Maybe I'm too frou frou, but I enjoy smelling feminine, and this one is definitely that!
EDIT - I didn't realize at first that this has orris in it, which accounts for the velvety feel I attributed to the rose. The projection and longevity is stellar, especially on clothing. I don't recall the last time I purchased a perfume where I could still catch whiffs of it 24 hours later. This is a big love for me!",03/22/20 19:44,churinl

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Finally I have a sample in my clutches.

And I love it. Gucci has made some very good Tuberose centered scents in this line. I liked the original a lot, and unfortunately I cannot compare the two because I’m not sure where my sample lays. I can say that Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori is warm and full. Leans more toward cold weather in my opinion, not sure I can pull it off in Summer.

I own a lot of perfume, too much really...and I already have many Tuberose scents that I love. That said, I would not hesitate to pull the trigger on a good deal, I just can’t justify full price, though that’s not to say Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori is not worth it.",03/10/20 19:18,Bubbles1964
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Really nice scent! I tried the regular Gucci Bloom as well, which is also nice - a very fresh tuberose floral bouquet. I find that the Ambrosia di Fiori is very similar, but has the addition of a sweetish rose scent, which kind of softens and deepens the Gucci Bloom scent subtly, making it easier to wear for a daily scent. I don't usually like straight florals, but this one is beautiful!",02/26/20 05:48,Shoshi
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Rich succulent white flower powerhouse that is very well done. There is also a dark green note (maybe the orris?) that takes this to the next level. The dark green note doesn’t make this masculine, but as a guy I am drawn to it and I’m thinking I can layer this with something else to make this my own. A lot of design houses have scents like this (think Prada La Femme Intense or Armani Prive Vert Malachite) but this one is hard to beat and much more affordable. Thumbs way up.",02/18/20 14:56,Vegas Pauli
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I wanted so badly to love this one! It's a no from me. Very disappointed. It is a stale version of Gucci Bloom - like an unfinished Gucci Bloom sitting on the table waiting for the other notes to complete it. This is devoid of the natural floral sweetness of the original but instead has the horrible flat and bland aspects of the unfinished DNA of the original with the addition of something that smells like a mixture of blanched almonds and hay! I do not know what causes this but it is repulsive to my nose since I hate almonds - it's that same stale, musty almond note that ruined the Beautiful Belle Love flanker by Estee Lauder. I've been smelling similar notes on the market and just been turned off by it.

Edit: Spraying it again it really reminds me of the park when in the horse carriage lane, the smell of horse maneur mixed with hay. Not good... I love well done indolic fragrances this just isn't one of them. Terribly out of balance, flat with an off-putting stale maneur/horsey-hay smell.

Edit No 2: this is seriously giving me Beautiful Belle vibes mixed with Beautiful Belle Love on the dry down - nothing at all like the original Gucci Bloom except the borrowing of some notes. Totally giving me an Estee Lauder Beautiful Belle vibe, as a dupe, an hour after spraying.",02/18/20 14:45,Unfurling Blossoms
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I enjoy the Gucci Bloom line. This popular Gucci release has made tuberose scents popular again. The original was a creamy, lush tuberose fragrance without the headiness or the 'poopy' indoles. Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori is much the same, with an interesting addition of a red rose accord.

Admittedly, if you own Gucci Bloom or another of her flankers, you probably don't need to own this one too. There are only very slight variations between them, and to an untrained nose, the differences are barely discernable.

The rose adds a touch more depth to the white floral centric composition which works nicely as an evening or cool weather alternative. If I had to pick a favourite amongst the Gucci Bloom flankers, Ambrosia di Fiori is one I would happily wear. I enjoy white florals and rose-based scents, so the pairing of these two notes appeal to my taste in fragrance.

If you found the original a tad too fresh or too green, Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori may be more your cup of tea. Not to mention the packaging is stunning with its striking red bottle, a popular choice for Christmas shoppers late last year.

I own enough tuberose scents to last me a lifetime, so I haven't considered purchasing Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori, but I would never be opposed to receiving it as a gift from a loved one.",02/02/20 21:39,missk
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Although Ambrosia di Fiori has some ingredients common to the whole Bloom family, like tuberose, jasmine bug, Rangoon creeper, and velvet orris, emotion-wise, it would be the closest to Nettari di Fiori.

They both have that feel of a ""night-time"" summer air heaviness, a flower palette that you would wear to last and impress. But Ambrosia takes it up a notch and makes it LUST. It's very seductive and sensual, the bottle cries of desire but is never blatant. It's more than a flirt but less than an invitation.

It's genuinely an amazing and charming scent that makes a great addition to the line. Give it a few seconds for the mid and base notes to kick in and take you on the mysterious journey. There's something about the cocktail that you'll always remember.",01/23/20 19:58,zgnedenkova

Ambrosia is even better than the original because it is more intense. Ambrosia is sweet like the original but more creamy and buttery, sophisticated and elegant.

I'm in LOVE with the entire Bloom line (except Acqua di fiori).

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"To begin with correctly, Ambrosia for the Greek mythology was the drink of Olympian Gods. A sweet and deep dark red wine. For a strange reason, perfumes in dark red bottles are a 'like' for me.

I very liked Gucci Bloom EDP when first came out. Maybe cause I am a fan of white florals. We connect white flowers to unfortunatelly 'bad ceremonies' if you get my point and mostly with tuberose. It is an overdose of 'watery' tuberose and the good thing is that lasting power as well sillage are so good that I even got complimented from a harsh judge, my mother! Why I say all this and don't go str8 to Ambrosia? Because Gucci did a good work for white flower lovers.

Now about Ambrosia EDP edition. Aren't there too many editions already? Ok maybe Acqua di fiori is the only edition that goes to an another direction. Here, when first smelled, I said yes, I like it. Then test again and thought that I smelled a win-y jasmin or let's say a red wine aromatized by white florals. Damask rose is in perfect balance to give it a sweet twist, you almost don't get it and there's also a whisper of green freshness-musky-earthiness. At this stage,it reminded me a bit of Narciso Rodriguez Pure Musc. Here jasmin/honeysuckle are the stars. Don't expect something new and crazy but expect a more serious if not mature, more linear, more womanly, softer edition of the Bloom family.",12/08/19 14:58,Kon-nos91

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I'm wearing Ambrosia for the first time today. My initial thoughts: this Gucci Bloom fragrance lies exactly in the middle of the original Gucci Bloom and Gucci Bloom Nettare de Fiori, both of which I like a lot. Its tuberose is a little ""louder"" than the OG fragrance, while it contains a bit of the earthiness/spiciness of Nettare.

So far, its strength and longevity on my skin is right there in the middle, as well - OG Bloom doesn't last at all on me, while I can still smell Nettare's spicy/herbal notes hours and hours after I spray it on. I'll have to see how long Ambrosia lasts.

UPDATE: I realize that this fragrance reminds me of Korloff Majestic Tuberose, only not as spicy. I layered the two today and they smell great together!",12/03/19 10:05,ceilstrakna

Conveys hot, humid, sticky summer nights after a thunderstorm, with the very faintest rot/indolic smell. The honeysuckle and tuberose are strong and lasting, with soft orris underneath. It's not as strong a tuberose as something like EL PC Tuberose Gardenia, so with a light spritz you can probably wear it to work and not make people around you faint. Heavier application is date night appropriate. I never tried the original Bloom, only a card tester of the Nettare flanker which didn't impress me at all but I love this.",11/25/19 16:32,kml24

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,I love original Bloom with its powdery and slightly sweet tuberose but I have to admit that Ambrosia is even better because it is more intense and it is so creamy and sophisticated and elegant.I think Ambrosia is the best Bloom so far.Also sillage and longevity are both great.,11/19/19 13:52,auroramaria
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Very similar to the others from this line, but more mature. The opening is earthy and a bit powdery, later i get fresh white flowers. Very pleasant and elegant. For white floral lovers definitely worth a try.
Overall, it’s sensual, confident and feminine.
I really like it.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I purchased my bottle from Macy's earlier this week.
I have to say: I ABSOLUTELY 100% agree with the poster below me. This outclasses ALL of the Gucci Bloom flankers. Damn! This perfume is GORGEOUS! A little FYI, I do tend to lean into being more of a niche chick in acquisitions. But, to ask me, I'm not really one way or the other. I buy and wear what I like. I don't care who makes it or whose name is on it. That's the truth. I actually roll my eyes when I see designer ads. But, I keep an open mind and nose when it comes to the juice. Wow! This one is nice. A dense, rich cold weather floral for us flower loving hippie chicks.Thank you Gucci, from the bottom of my flower laiden heart.
Peace out sisters!

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"With Ambrosia di Fiori, Gucci outclasses every Bloom flanker, making the jus more carnal, creamy and intense, rightly observed by you, without depriving it of the original lymphatic green freshness.
Even the red color emphasizes my subjective perception.
Despite it contains discordant ingredients, typology ideally reminds me of the last masterpiece I tested at Bvlgari, Tubereuse Mystique, and honestly I wouldn't know which one to choose between the two.
Remaining on Gucci theme, my choice at this point would fall on 'Ambrosia', downgrading to the second place (I mean as a purchase order) 'Nettare', that I've had on my wish list for a long time now.",11/15/19 14:43,masako_30
Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"This is the best of the Bloom line. It has the sweet, warm, creamy quality that I expect when I hear ""tuberose perfume"". It carries some of the spectacular deliciousness of Love Tuberose by Amouage (which is signature-worthy to me)...But underneath it all is the smell of Gucci Bloom, which is clean, fresh in a modern way, with a nice honeysuckle note. A bit perfumey, but elegant, and versatile. I could happily use a full bottle, but I long for Love Tuberose more than anything. Either way, I happily reapply with great pleasure.",11/12/19 17:46,kastehelmi

BUT then it develops into a beautiful luxe tuberose scent !!! and that stays with u forever !!! i dont mean forever like powerhouse strong lol i mean like it lingers beautifully :) so if u love tuberose give this a try :)

and i love the dark red bottle..........i hope they come out with more flankers in other colors lol - i know more flankers omg lol but im a sucker for them lol...........would love to see a bloom in a purple bottle with a lavender or orchid vibe......maybe a bright yellow with a citrus vibe & im sure black for the night vibe is not far behind lol",11/10/19 13:35,violetstorm

In terms of performance, it is definitely an improvement on the pilar fragrance; but in terms of creativity, I’m afraid that it’s the case of same ol’ same ol’.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"Expanding Bloom’s new age, tuberose lite formula, Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori makes for a more decadent wear than its predecessors with a base of whipped orris butter and soft, satiny Damascus rose, which here lends a textural element more than a distinctly rosy character. As is to be expected of a Bloom flanker, Ambrosia di Fiori is still very much a tuberose composition, now though, there is depth where once there was only gossamer petals and musk.

And that bottle, Christmas gift perfect!

It is definitely a well made gourmand much better than the other fragrances those other companies released this fall. I was not impressed with ""Memoire d'une odeur"", but I would purchase this once I am able to find it at a discounted price.

I decided to purchase this one, I found it at a discounted price online. I cannot wait to add it to my collection.

I used this fragrance for the first time, I layered it with the Bloom Guccie Dry Body Oil, It made me feel like a princess. I am not sure it is a fragrance for the winter, I think it is more for spring and fall.

Gucci Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori Gucci,"I love Gucci’s Bloom line. The Bloom EDP made tuberose palatable to younger generations, shaking off vintage dust from the accord and proving it’s the perfect floral note for people of any age. The “sequels” have also become must-sniff. They aren’t just cash-ins; rather, each flanker recontextualizes the original EDP in a different light. Ambrosia di Fiori, Bloom’s fourth flanker, perhaps bests all of its siblings. Here, there’s that irresistible harmony of tuberose, jasmine, and honeysuckle, only now, it’s been deepened. Under the “Bloom-ness” is a creamy orris shaded by rose—a dry-down to fall in love with.

Beautiful scent, beautiful bottle. And longevity? I tested one spray on my wrist in the afternoon, then woke up the next morning with Ambrosia di Fiori still radiating.",10/05/19 17:57,1guy1dog3cats

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"A soft aromatic, pleasant, hygienic (but not soapy) scent. Very linear, many might not find it thrilling enough. Nighttime synthetic white floral vibe can be smelled up close. Any citrus types notes that might be here are held back. Up close, it dries down to Gucci Guilty Black but a half point better. The scent decant sample spritz behind each ear and two on the neck lasted my work day. Don't be afraid of the salt note. It adds more of a semi savory facet to the fragrance or a support for other notes, you won't smell like salt at all I'd get this as a (why not) purchase once my collection is filled out for less than $60 for a 50ml if I could find it but I can make a case for just buying it now as well but I'm not impelled for the price and the scent yet for a number of guys: I could recommend it as a signature scent. Very nice for the office, semi formal and formal occasions, dinner with your lady or in a co-ed setting. For the every day average guy, this could be his dressed up fragrance. Ladies will think that you smell nice/good and maybe sexy due to the pleasant hygienic factor and gentlemanly noon to 8 vibe of the scent.",10/28/25 16:17,waymonbrown84

I think it has a scent that suits all ages. But if you ask me, it is a fragrance that would suit more mature people.

I hate when companies make something that smells amazing but disappears before anyone can smell it. Even with it being so easy to like scent-wise, I could never recommend this due to it becoming a skin-scent within thirty minutes.

It smells close to the original Pour Homme, just a little more woodsy. I would likely buy the original again but not this one, as I get moderate longevity and projection from that one.

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"This is the daddy of Gucci Guilty line.

Throughout the years I had the experience of wearing almost every single version of Gucci Guilty and recently after release of the Elixir version I wanted to try them all again.

Previously I owned Guilty Black, EDT version, and currently I own Cologne and Parfum. This is by far the most mature version and the most elegant one, yet still super pleasant. The second best in my opinion is the discounted Black.

Gucci guilty EDT was always a fun one but it just lacked the maturity. The perfume version has all of it. When I was deciding between EDT, EDP and other versions, I asked myself what would I like to wear on a really important date, and the answer all the time was the Parfum.

The Elixir is also really serious and smells really nice, especially in the dry down, but in my opinion it has nothing in common with other Guilty versions. So I don't even consider it a Guilty flanker. Totally different DNA.

When it comes to projection and longevity, on me ir projects a lot. I can smell it around myself for hours and interestingly enough I never go nose blind with it. Maybe it's a different batch but mine is really, really strong and really strongly projecting.",01/26/24 06:59,Detonate

I don’t really know if this moment actually happened. I don’t know if it’s part of a lost 90s summer or part of a dream. A shit dream. I don’t really know if I can trust my recollection as there’s factors that deceive and elements that are fact.

That is the long winded way of saying that though this iteration of the Guilty fragrance line is pleasant; I can’t trust any part of my experience of it as though parts of it are fine and nice they’re at the same time tediously familiar and banal.

I think this is a good fragrance but it’s not got anything about it that makes me think that there’s a story behind it. It’s creativity via marketing and margins. Ultimately it’s just a thing that is there without any fanfare or deeper presence - I bet when it was launched there was little relief or anxiety about its potential or performance. Just a sniff, and on to the next one.",01/11/24 17:11,Thatbwoy
Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"I was debating giving this a 4/5, but I realized a review like that comes across as recommending the cologne. I do not recommend this, you will not only get limited compliments, after wearing this for a while, you probably will start to dislike this scent a bit too.

The scent isn't bad, but it isn't that good either. It's not super basic but at the same time you won't remember what it smells like if you don't have it on at the moment. Silage and projection are alright. Pretty much the classic 3/5 cologne.

However, I would say that 1/5 guys could definitely have this cologne work for them, and if you really like it on YOU, then go for it. I would just say that for most people hold off.",01/06/24 03:51,CHRISTIANDIORDIOR

I disliked this one enough to give it away, primarily because the EDT, which I gave away because of it's performance, actual smelled far fresher and better. This scent is heavy enough to be almost oppressive for the first hour. I like some nutmeg and musk, but both are overkill here. It is a cool black bottle.

Sure it's the EDT with a BIT more characteristics, but don't let the notes fool you. This isn't special at all. EDT performance is better, this is more expensive, and tbh, its not as bright as the EDT, and it's a citrus forward scent. So yea I want bright. Stay away from this, it's actually not a EDP or parfum performance at all. I know parfums sit a bit heavier. I have EDTs that put last this. If you want something unique and fresh spicey citrus, get something like bogart one man show ruby.

While the concept seems intriguing, I was honestly a bit disappointed throughout much of the life cycle of this one. Too thick and heavy for a relatively light fragrance dna.

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"It is very masculine and a bit classic ( because of the nutmeg). I am not a big fan of nutmeg.
I like the patchouli that is strong in the opening but don’t like the nutmeg which is too strong in the dry down. It is still better than edt or edp. But guilty black is better. Elixir is even better. But the best of all is the Guilty Absolute! But it deserves a name on it’s own because it is very different from the rest of the line. It also applies to elixir which is also different from the rest of the line.",11/02/23 11:55,BGBG
Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"It's taken multiple wears but I can finally smell this more clearly, and best of all, for more than just an hour or two.

Clean masculine elegance right here . The original Guilty edt but he's all grown up now, salt and pepper hair and beard. It's so rare - and welcomed - to have a scent profile like this be aimed at the 35+ crowd.

Very fresh with the juniper and lavender but there's a hint of mature, old school fougere too with a touch of Zino-esque patchouli; the way it and the labdanum interact with the juniper has echoes of Bond's wonderful Cooper Square (which itself calls to mind the original Calvin by Calvin Klein).

The difference here is the orange blossom, rendered so differently than normal, it is not fresh or fluffy or indolic but instead just a slightly honeyed warmth that blends perfectly and leaves Guilty Parfum smelling brighter and warmer than Cooper Square, Zino, and others, which makes it much more friendly and to my nose, enjoyable.

In summary, silvery lavender and silvery woods, ethereal orange blossom with hints of smoke, honey, patchouli and dry white tobacco. The late drydown smells of the white tobacco with a bit of vanilla.

Longevity is about 12 hours but the last 4 will be a pure skin scent. Projection is only decent for a couple hours but I imagine it will bloom more in the heat.

It smells good from top to bottom. Classy without pretense.",10/27/23 09:08,SculptureOfSoul
Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"I like this version a lot more than the original Gucci Guilty. That one smelled thinner and sharper to me, more a typical men's fragrance. This one is sweeter, fuller, rounder. I smell mostly juniper, patchouli, nutmeg, and lavender. The orange blossom comes across as sweetness to me, like it's orange blossom, but it's not a super heady white floral by any means. This Parfum is masculine, but somehow I still feel quite comfortable wearing it. It's not overly sweet, not vanillic like many of the men's colognes are these days. It lasts probably less than 6 hours on my skin, but what I got in my hair lasted past the 7 hour mark. I would recommend this one - I have the women's version that came out at the same time.",10/12/23 18:19,ntabassum92

I'm revisiting the Guilty line after falling for Elixir and so far, am disappointed. I'm one of those that gets minimal longevity out of this. It's not exactly that I can't smell it after an hour but the periodic whiffs I do pick up are so non-descript, a silvery sort of dry woods that might be juniper + labdanum but might just be something from thr lab like norlimbanol. I have to presume it's my nose because, while not a huge fan of them I still can't imagine Gucci would release the scent that I'm smelling, if that's how it smelled to all.

I will give this a few more chances when I'm out and about and come across it. The opening smells promising and even shows some depth, something like the original Guilty but with some hair on its chest, so I do hold out a sliver of hope.",09/16/23 05:07,SculptureOfSoul

Why not? While it lasted longer than an hour, the performance overall is still no different to an EDT concentration with the drydown struggling to cling on for dear life about 4 hours in.

The scent itself smells like something ChatGPT would come up with if you asked it for the most mass-appealing, least offensive and safest concoction. It is a bit citrusy, a bit soapy, a bit floral, a bit spicy, a bit woody and a bit musky; it is a bit of everything and hence also rather unisex.

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum is an aromatic, woody and slightly citrus fragrance.

The opening is citrusy, but less prominent than the Eau de Toilette version, yet still fresh, herbal and floral. There are notes from the original version that have been taken up but giving them a less sparkling and ""darker"" twist, because there are lavender, orange blossom, patchouli and musk, but the smell is less youthful and playful, it's more towards a mature aroma.

It has the recognizable DNA of the Guilty Pour Homme line, but it is less versatile, it is as if a person who was young 11 years ago has become a little more mature today. It remains usable all year.

In terms of longevity, it was with me for about 8 hours, but unlike the EDT and EDP versions that have a greater projection with me, this one stays close to the skin from the beginning.

The smell is good, but is a little expensive for its performance.",01/25/23 13:12,caifan

You could put sh*t in a bottle and they’ll eat it up (4.5+ rating) as longs as it projects, lasts, and smells unique. This really great scent though?…well, na smells too good to most people and not like a patchouli covered poop bomb so we’ll bash it and give it a 3. I have learned to not trust this site or the influencers very often in regards to whether something is worth buying/testing.

Price: You can get 90ml under $100 in a few places which is as much as I’d spend for it. Never go full retail.

Scent: This smells divine, and I have received more compliments on this in the week I’ve worn it than any I can remember. My favorite part is the opening. This opens up fresh and invigorating and drys down into a warm scent(not sweet) perfect for fall or spring. Could also be great for dates or with enough sprays, worn in winter. Probably too warm in the dry down for summer. My wife’s new favorite scent for me to wear!

Still, this smells good for about 20 minutes. Then it turns into generic side, then it becomes skinscent as @The Wolf stated.
In comparison, the EDP has beast mode on me but the Parfum version performance is abysmal.

Basically I have the same problem as user @ThatMakesScents.
Half an hour and I can hardly smell this. I thought I was nose blind or something but as I said EDP I can smell the next day!
I can confirm as well that the drydown is boring and generic as fuck.

Gucci is known for their out of the norm and daring approach to designer mens fragrances, I think this is no exception, if you like something different, you may want to test this, and test it on your skin, these oddball note combinations may work very different on your individual skin.

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Let's start with the good. This smells good for about 20 minutes. Then it turns generic, and then it disappears. I like the house of Gucci (Guilty Absolute is my favorite leather in the world) but it's like they're asleep at the wheel. I think they only put effort into alchemist garden line (many of those are disappointing as well) but some are good. Armani, Prada, and Givenchy have better offerings in the mid tier, designer space. This doesn't smell bad but it's completely forgettable and performance is trash. I do love the bottle anesthetics but the juice and the fragrance brand feels like it's sleepwalking through these releases.

TLDR :
It feels like they put more effort into the inspiration and ""story"" of this fragrance, than the fragrance itself. Make sure you test this out and don't be fooled by the first 20 minutes which are good. Because after that, it becomes boring/generic and then disappears!

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Parfum takes the mainstream designer fresh opening in a slightly different direction. Usually the citrus opening is sweeter and more sparkling, with notes like bergamot, which has a sweet lime smell. Guilty Parfum's opening is much sourer and more bitter, with lemon rather than bergamot. It's got a tart profile with the juniper, but still smells fresh and pleasant. Some soft, warm spiciness from the nutmeg comes through in the mid, which actually reminds me slightly of La Nuit de l'Homme.

Into the dry down was where this fragrance fell short for me. I'm not sure what it is, but I get a headache-inducing, almost plastic smell which I also got from YSL Y Parfum. It might just be my nose, but perhaps worth a test first.",07/22/22 03:30,lwhaymand

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Huh..

This smells a lot like Diesel Only The Brave. That same, fresh, slightly-green, slightly fruity-sweet bubblegummy aromatic smell.

Guilty PH Parfum takes that green, fresh, clean core of the Gulity PH line made up of lavender and green notes , and adds an lightly-woody incensy accord.

Green, fresh, slightly-sweet, clean, musky, lightly-wood, and lightly-incensy.

Very likeable and mass appealing, like Diesel's OTB. It does also smell slightly like Versace Dylan Blue. Similar fresh, slightly-sweet, and lightly-incensy drydown. Dylan Blue, however, is much fresher and sweeter. Neither is gourmand-sweet, though.

Mild/warm weather wear for the young crowd.

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"I expected this to be another pleasant scent. Upon spraying it, the initial sprays had me like, ""hmmm this smells good but there's also something going on with this."" There was an opening of freshness with a hint of spice. But something was lingering that kept me from just feeling like, ""OMG this is beautiful!"" After about 5 minutes it was nothing but patchouli screaming in your face. That lasted for at least 30 minutes. No other notes were detectable, which was unfortunate because on the open you could tell it had ability of being something great. During that 30 minute window others were also like OMG that doesn't smell good at all. And then after 30 minutes or so it was a really soft well balanced scent. The patchouli was still there but had found its place in between the other notes. Unfortunately, the time it took to get there made the fragrance just a skin scent, about an hour. Maybe if you over sprayed you could get better projection. But the half hour of Patchouli is what prevents me from saying this is full bottle worthy because it was so abrasive and unpleasant. Scents are subjective so someone else may not find the patchouli as offensive. Ultimately, it found its way but it was a roller coaster getting there.",04/29/22 15:39,Ladiiphresh

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Many years have gone by since the initial release of gucci guilty. I'll admit - i've never intentionally smelled any of the gucci guilty iterations - except the one in the green bottle. that one was nice, but i never bought it. When i saw this ""on sale"" on fragrancebuy, i impulsively made the purchase. i'll admit - i was excited to smell it! So...i've had it for 3 days now and i have to say - this is the ultimate ""meh"". It's pleasant - but not worth diving into a note breakdown. it's an easy grab - but probably not one i will consider a ""go to"" scent. It's people pleasing - but wont make you stand out from the crowd.

It's a good scent - far from great - far from memorable. Which i suppose is what i expected...but maybe deep in my heart i hoped it would be something more.

I will say that there is some kind of creaminess about this scent that totally turns me off. It's most notable in the first 5 minutes. it's like a juniper/sandalwood mixture which triggers a nauseating response for me. Again, it doesn't last long - but it's definitely there.

This is a hard one to recommend unless of course, you don't already have a mass appealing scent in your arsenal.

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Wow! This is an incredible fragrance. I can’t believe I’m saying this 😀? But imo, Gucci hit it out of the park with this one. Like me, If you’re a fan of Gulity Line ? Then you’ll (most likely) really like this. Mix the EDT with Black, and make the 2 into a legit elegant Parfum. Then boom! You have Gucci Guilty Parfum. It’s a little steep in price. But who cares 😀? To me it’s worth the $. The silage and performance are above average. The bottle looks great on your shelf, or wherever. It stays on skin for a good while, even after it’s done projecting. The only mistake I made was, not getting a 5.0 for only 30 dollars more. I’ve been wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, lately. You could easily wear this year round for many occasions. Enough.. Just get it. A 10/10. Really, it is.",04/01/22 00:33,HunterB10X

I can't really compare it with other releases in the Guilty collection as the only one I know is GG Absolute which is a completely different scent.
It's the perfect scent to give as a present as it is almost impossible to dislike this one.
However, if you already have a sizeable collection with a little bit of everything, and you aim for variety, chances are that this piece will smell a little bit redundant. Or maybe not, depends on how you built your collection.",03/15/22 09:12,Damu
Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Perfectly nice, perfectly pleasant. Guilty Parfum is a big, green, spicy dose of…something. It carries the DNA of the line very well, so if you’re familiar with the original or Black, you kind of know what you’re getting into here. I get a type of lemon/lavender vibe with added green accents and floral touches, and that’s really the bulk of the fragrance. It’s masculine, easy to wear, easy to like, dress it up, dress it down…it’s got versatility in spades. And it’s not even a blue fragrance. It’d probably be a good alternative as a dumb reach with an extra point of sophistication. But that’s really about it. Nothing about the fragrance makes me think it correlates with its name or the image Gucci’s creative directors have created for it. Not that that’s important, it just feels a bit of a missed opportunity to offer something bold.

Being mildly acquainted with the Eau De Parfum from 2020, this Parfum feels like a big step away from avant-garde styling. Guilty EDP had the salt, vinegar and rose thing going, which sure made it interesting, if ultimately not that appealing to my taste. Guilty Parfum is so polite, it feels like a giant leap back towards the bosom of safety and mass appeal, which I don’t fault Gucci for at all. This line is their cash cow, after all. Still, I can’t help but think it’s a bit like Disney Star Wars movies. When too big a risk was taken in Last Jedi, backtracking was necessary in Rise of Skywalker. Guilty Parfum is kind of like The Rise of Skywalker of fragrances. It gets the job done, even though you’re sure it could have been better.",03/11/22 22:46,Ambroxer
Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"I’ve always enjoyed the Gucci Guilty line. There’s just something so pleasing and youthful about them. This one I think is my new favorite, though it might be tied with the EDP version. While the EDP felt like a super bold and daring entry to the line, with its acidic vinegar/chili pepper opening and soapy/floral rose, this one plays it a bit safer as far as composition, but the quality and depth of the fragrance is definitely increased.

When you smell it, there’s no doubting that this is a Gucci Guilty flanker, it’s instantly familiar. It’s much more similar to the EDT than the EDP was. However it’s also significantly deeper and more dark and resinous fragrance, it’s really quite beautiful. Honestly, if you’re looking for a luxurious drydown of resin and balm-y notes without getting too thick and gourmand/warm, this is it right here. It’s divine. It’s not as sweet as the EDP, it’s still got floral elements but it’s much more woody and resinous which I absolutely love. The EDP could be a bit too sweet, even in the cold. This one plays it just right, it’s still fresh and clean enough (just not very bright) to be super mass appealing and likable while being dark and woody enough to win over the enthusiasts and connoisseurs who favor complexity and depth over mass appeal.

Projection is down as expected, and longevity is up. The base notes are the strongest here as expected again, so the opening isn’t meant to be super sharp or bright and attention grabbing, it’s all about the long game here… in that regard, this scent serves as an excellent foundation for layering as well.

I do not get any incense or scratchy chemical notes like I do from BdC or AdG Profumo. This is way more smooth and much more pleasing to me.

Good for all year round, day or night for me. Though by nature it will be most well received in slightly cooler temperatures and/or in the nighttime and evening hours. Not an “after the gym” freshie whatsoever, this is more romantic and mysterious. Not attention seeking or loud whatsoever. More for a reserved gentleman type vibe, not a loud club-going f**k boi (no offense). It’s casual enough to rock with any outfit though.",03/11/22 19:32,Bfreepro417

Good performance, incense-cedar smell, dark floral, fresh citrus and spice up top. If you like the incense in bleu de Chanel parfum or acqua di gio profumo, you’ll like this as well because that’s the case for me. I don’t know what the original guilty smells like so I can’t compare this to that. Apparently this is new too so not a whole lot of people out there will smell like me, which also makes this a better candidate for my signature scent.",03/07/22 16:25,realestrater444
Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"An excellent release from Gucci that isn't getting enough credit because it's not as daring as Guilty Absolute. However I would argue that the amount of florals in this fragrance make it just as daring for a designer. Many people here are experience with niche and unisex frags and won't see this in the same context as a normal dude at Macy's.

Heavy florals. Dark, floral, sweet, feels vaguely Gothic. An evolution of the original Guilty, if they called it Gucci Guilty Noir it would have made sense. Feels like a bouquet doused with labdanum being shoved in my face. Longevity is good,easy 8 to 10 hours for me. Projection is restrained which is how I prefer my frags but that might be a minus for others. Surprisingly formal and reserved,wearing this to work with no issues. I don't think this will work in temps above 70 though due to how floral and sweet it is.

Easy 8.5 out of ten for me. Retail price is high but I'm glad I bought it for full price because the only say I have in fragrance design is how much money I spend. Vote with your wallet. If you want more daring frags, buy them and try and hype them up so we don't get stuck in a rut.",03/07/22 03:19,summerselection

Under a long sleeve shirt with heat I get pleasant wafts of GUILTY like I have always known it. I doubt they did anything extreme to get to this.

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Been there, done that…
With every new flanker of Gucci Guilty line I am more sure that both Absolute (Femme & Homme) are the best. Gucci is struggling so hard and they just can’t do anything new and better than Absolute flanker. They need to go back to 2018, take the same idea of creating bold and daring fragrances and bring it back to 2022.
Upon initial smell I knew that I have already smelled that and I am glad that I didn’t bought it blindly. Notes are very promising: cistus, nutmeg, juniper… The opening is strong very intense and indeed it is a PARFUM concentration (as on bottom sticker). We all know that smell… Imagine Dior Homme 2020 woody vibes with Versace Dylan Blue base, even Burberry Hero is more original, safe and quite generic, but still in terms of smell more original (both are produced by Coty). Sorry to disappoint you guys, but it is what it is. I only wish that they would make something between Absolute and Envy. Real modern classic with some spicy kick.",01/07/22 06:16,mateuszolech072
Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Parfum Gucci,"Fan of the guilty line for what it is. My fav is Guilty Black (not ashamed) but the performance is so poor. L’eau is a good flanker as well. I own the EDP, absolute, and the original, too.
Just tried this new parfum at an Ulta. I passed. It’s def a parfum and very long lasting on my skin. I’d think twice about spraying it directly on a shirt, it might leave an oily stain. It’s a legit parfum.

But honestly the woody juniper direction that this one took just didn’t do it for me. I kept getting strong vibes of the original Hugo by Hugo boss, with the connected screw on cap. It was the juniper-fir-balsam thing. Granted there are major differences, but that’s what it made me think of.
I tried it because I was hoping it would be like Guilty Black or l’Eau only with better performance. Alas, no.

If you do like it, it will certainly perform for you.

However, for striking similarities this is reminiscent of Ambre des Abysses by Houbigant. Whilst ADA opens fresher. The drydown is nigh on identical. I must say the opening is far better than GGADP. For the opening five mins it had a play dough, putty like note that I did not enjoy at all. Once that subsided it was very good.

Found it on a site at a good discounted price and pulled the trigger.

Gucci Guilty Elixir - A bit more fresh, airier, and lighter
Gucci Guilty Absolu De Parfum - It opens as a dark boozy version of GGE, lot of almond and nuttiness, can't really smell the Red Pepper, and in the dry down its much more leathery, and darker.
They both have the same DNA but also have their own uniqueness.
GGE - whiter, fresher, airier, floral
GGA - darker, nutty, boozy, leathery

Is it Redundant ? for a normal nose, Yes
Do I regret buying it? No

Love both the versions of the perfume. I'll keep one for day time and other for the night out.

Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"Not really close to any version of Myslf. Sure it shares orange blossom but that's it. This is similar to the original Guilty Elixir but without the wintergreen root beer nuance, and instead amping up the smooth pimento/nutmeg spice and the dry slightly petrol leather, too. On my skin this is quite a bit darker than the original and feels decidedly autumnal evoking shades of burnt orange and burgundy. Not as groundbreaking as the original with its neo-oldschool floral leather approach, but just as good and undoubtedly leagues above the majority of new releases both mainstream and niche.

About 7 hours into my first wearing and this projects less than Elixir and seems like it will not last quite as eternally long. This is actually preferable to me as my one big complaint with Elixir is that it's just too strong and long lasting, interfering with the following day's scent. Also, on me this is a lot spicier and less sweet on skin than on paper. I'm getting a noticeable somewhat piney labdanum and red chili note at this stage, mixed with vanilla benzoin and leather.

I tried the Absolu in Birmingham airport after a frag buddy put me onto it stating that it was a less floral, but richer fragrance.
I wasn't expecting much difference because lets face it, a lot of these flankers are just money spinners.
However...

This new release is a beauty!

As my friend said, it is indeed a deeper, warmer, richer version of the scent with the florals toned down.
The opening notes of Rum, Almond and Orange Blossom give it a really nice twist on the Elixir, then once the Tonka and Vanilla join the party it keeps the same kind of vibe.

Now you're gonna get really mixed opinions about this frag, this is Fragrantica.

My advice is to try before you buy on your skin and see how you get on.

Personally I really like it and I will wear it alot this Autumn/ Winter.

Enjoy

Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"I suspect it has to be on skin to get the true scent of this fragrance because on test strip both the Elixir and Absolu smell terrible. On test strip it smells as stated by reviewer, Olere Novum, a synthetic chemical plastic putty. How can anyone rave about that scent? Maybe today I'll test it on my wrist. There has to be a reason for it's favorable reviews.",10/09/25 07:24,RC2017
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"Very similar to Elixir. If you love the scent profile then it's worth having both as together they offer day (Elixir) or night (Absolu) versatility, and cover all four seasons (Elixir for warmer and Absolu for colder weather). In the drydown I caught some similarity with Afnan 9pm Elixir, almost as if a hybrid of GG Elixir and 9pm Elixir. Having checked the notes there are several key overlaps in the dominant aspects I notice most: leather, pimento/red chilli pepper, labdanum, vanilla. Smells great and seems like a top performer so far.",10/03/25 13:21,olfactsnolies
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,It doesn't have the versatility of elixir the dry down is Elixir with leather and the opening is more sweet boozy do I like it ? Yeah for sure but for me the OG elixir is better with this floral notes mixed with benzoin.,10/02/25 13:27,Tripokaridos
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"Finally got my nose on this fragrance. It's really well done but not what I expected at all with the rum, almond and leather notes being added into the absolu. I was expecting some Guerlain ideal dna mixed with the guilty dna. The initial spray was the same as elixir, but stronger and sweeter with a slight boozy scent. Then leather started rounding out the fragrance. When I was outside I notcied the red pepper really shining threw when I got warm from the heat outside. It smelled just like the produce section at a store, and a pepper, but mainly only when I was warmed up did I smell the pepper accord. This absolu is absolutely beast mode. I sprayed this on my hand around 11am. Could still smell it on my hand even after my shower in the evening.. And I even scrubbed it off so I could wear my other newest fragrance, but it was still there. Not as prominent, but it was there all the way until I passed out around 11pm 12am midnight. Even after a shower and reapplying another fragrance to my hand where gucci was, I could still smell it overpowering my other fragrance until I fell asleep. Probably one of the most powerful fragrances I've ever sampled.",10/02/25 08:42,Addicted2cologne
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"I never liked the OG Gucci Guilty Elixir very much. The OG Elixir has a thick synthetic chemical plastic putty smell that I find very off putting. That is still present in this 'lil gem, but it is muted by the almond, red chilli pepper and rum accord.

I agree with everyone who is saying GG Absolu is similar to the OG Elixir ... it is, but it is better. It smells better, the harsh chemical accord i get so strongly in the OG is less obvious in Absolu, and the overall scent is improved. I would gladly trade my OG Elixir bottle for this one, but I don't think it is good enough to waste $195.00 on it. Maybe I will get it in 2026 when it gets down closer to $100 at discounters. But for now, I have a dozen or more other orange blossom fragrances that smell a heck of a lot better.

7.0/10 and a Fragrantica score of 3.85",09/22/25 08:12,Olere Novum

Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"Received a sample of this from a fragrance store and to me this smells like if you chewed a hubba bubba with some almonds and then ate a piece of candy. The drydown is insanely sweet and i honestly think that the people around you would become nauseous if they got a whiff of this every 5 minutes. Not a bad smell, just really really heavy. Please don’t apply this if you’re gonna be in a confined space for a long period of time 😭🙏🏻",09/10/25 03:47,FourLeaf
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"Tested this in store and then managed to get a sample. I don't have Guilty Elixir as to me there was just something a little off-putting in the opening, almost minty/black licorice like. I do have the newest Guilty Love Edition though as it is like a lighter/stripped down version of the Elixir and I love the creamy white florals/candy-like sweetness it has.

This new Absolu de Parfum still has that same backbone to it as Guilty Elixir/Love Edition, just now with the added rum and almond giving it a slightly sweet booziness mixing with the spicy red chili. As it starts to dry down a bit you can tell there a bit more of the amber/vanilla sweetness than the previous ones, and you can start picking up hints of leather throughout for the first couple hours. Then as it has fully settled it smells pretty much just like Guilty Elixir with mostly just the vanilla sweetness. It kind of feels like mixing Love Edition with something like Hugo Boss The Scent Elixir.",09/06/25 07:27,Matt180
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,I just tested this in store and I own the elixir. If you are trying to avoid redundancy then it’s a skip. If you like the elixir dna and like the subtle differences then you do you boo. Personally I’m getting a little tired of flankers at least those with heavy reminder of previous ones. But I guess that’s the point of a flanker. If I graduate to this it’ll be after I empty the elixir. All in all it’s good. If you like the elixir you’ll either love this one or like it as well.,09/04/25 10:12,Pinkmeat

Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"Instant buy. No questions asked.

I already had something of an unhealthy obsession with the Elixir. Went through almost a whole bottle since acquiring it.

Bought this (15% off @ Macy's doesn't hurt as much price-wise) and am thrilled to have it.

I am a hardcore fanboy of men's fragrances utilizing white florals. Orange blossom? Count me in!

I know florals, particularly white florals, aren't everyone's cup of tea, but they sure do work for me.

This is a MUCH smoother, more well-rounded iteration of the OG, with the same overall structure. A bit less 'astringent' if that is the term. Longevity and projection are both above average, and easily on-par with the OG. Seems to have more depth, and a slightly darker edge. A slight touch of booze. I love it.

Is it similar to the original? Yes.

Is it worth it? If you like the DNA, then also yes.

Similar to the arguments being had over in the BDC l'exclusif page; I personally don't find that fragrance to be worth it. I do, however, believe that this one IS, for me. The next person may or may not agree, and that is fine. I am very happy to add this one. Now to wait for Fall......",08/25/25 10:09,Felixthreeone
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"I got a sample today at Macy's, smells like Elixir and Creed Delphinus/Centaurus had a baby. Has that cherry chloroseptic waxy note from Delphinus/Centaurus in there. It's maybe a heliotrope and geranium combo. I really like it, but not better than the OG GGE though. I'll update on strength soon, seemed weaker than the Elixir on first test, not as potent, could be a huge decision factor.",08/23/25 16:22,FlexYoFace
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"This fragrance is already on shelves at Macy's. It smells very similar to the elixir version but smells a bit creamier, sweeter, denser with a mild dose of spices. If you like the elixir you'll likely enjoy this one and it shouldn't feel like a redundant buy. But keep in mind you will definitely know its a flanker to the elixir. I will say the performance on the elixir seems to be better.

8/10",08/22/25 18:30,seldomseen
Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Homme Gucci,"If you can imagine the Elixir with a little spice and booziness added, but less orange blossom, then you have a pretty close idea of how this smells. The elixir smells amazing, so this one smells good too. It does definitely seem to tone down the orange blossom (sadly) so you trade floral for boozy.

The dry down smells strangely somewhat similar to Stronger With You Absolutely. I prefer the Elixir, because it smells way more niche and unique (sometimes even a little medicinal, root beer like). The performance and projection is good, worse than the Elixir tho. For me it just doesn’t have the same magic the Elixir has.",08/22/25 08:14,lormp

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Autumn in a bottle.
Magical elixir.
If you miss Midnight Poison, you should check Gucci Guilty Absolute out.
It has similar fizzy patchouli, red rose and intriguing cypress notes that are adding a masculine edge like in Midnight Poison.
I feel also the unique spiciness of pink pepper, refreshment based on bergamot.
Beautiful background of woody notes and charming juiciness of blackberry.
Vetiver and amber also can be contemplated here.
The bottle color fits the scent perfectly.
It is a modern chypre.
Classy and serious, but with a magical twist.
I can clearly picture a dark angel rocking it.
On me it gets shy after an hour or 3. I keep catching wafts og it but it does not project much, unlike Guilty edt.",,MademoiselleMaya

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Perfect execution of brash and bold--dare I say, just a little trashy (in the best possible way). And ""trashy"" is an aesthetic that usually manifests in heavily gendered ways but this seems to actively play with gender. It's got that synthetic woods fuckboi frag dna at the base but the rose/blackberry is SO jammy, thick, thorny, sexual. Instead of neutral androgyny, it evokes exuberantly crossdressing (in either direction). It smells like the color of the bottle.

Very linear (again in the best possible way): a perfume that gives you everything it's got right off the bat for an explosive first impression. The patchouli gradually gets more prominent throughout the long wear but that's about it as far as evolution.

A surprising comparison: when I first tried Marissa Zappas La Divina I was instantly reminded of this; the wood accord in the base is a dead ringer. But you'd never mistake one for the other; La Divina is going for silky elegance and while it's a beautiful perfume, personally I think GGAPF's partybitch approach just does more with these notes.",07/12/25 13:44,icekind

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Bewitching. Dark rose in a cold deep misty forest. This is pure aphrodisiac bottled up. I put it on and wore it the whole afternoon. I can't stop smelling myself. Masterpiece.
The cypress adds a captivating cool camphor note and the woods bring down the sweetness and make it a spicier and less sweet rose. I think this leans more unisex compared to other rose scents. It's like a deep forest spa scent.",05/06/25 11:59,Eline091
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"A very grown-up scent that feels unisex. It is not masculine, but it would smell good on a man.
Predominantly roses, a bit of blackberry as effect of rose-cypress-patchouli more than the actual fruit. It is a bit gloomy and as such a perfect match for autumn, but fresh, chill spring fits it also well. A scent to go into forest in :) The only one I know. It does have similarities to Lalique Amethyst.
It is an earthy, woody, serious rose. It changes in far drydown - sweetens considerably, with patchouli, rose and woods. This stage is the best -occurs after 8 hours.

Initially gave me a heavy licorice scent that was nauseating. After macerating for the last couple years, I came back. It mellowed out and yes, is going to be a go to for fall. It could still be cloying for the humid summer months. It’s not fresh but syrupy berries wrapped in the leaves of a Christmas tree. Not cough syrupy. I love the contrast. The Smokey patchouli does taper off in the dry down. Gorgeous parfume to wear with a long coat and some heels. I do not see ladies under 25 wearing this.

One day while I'm wearing this, one of my work friend liked it and asked the name of it. And he said ""starting today, this is and will be my favorite perfume"" Since that day, he is wearing this scent every fricking day😂 and I can't because I don't like smelling same with someone so close... 🥲

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This fragrance was a journey for me but I feel like Gucci could have done so much better with this one. Opening hits you pleasantly with juicy blackberry. Wish blackberry was used more in fragrance because it smells so good. The opening is also very fresh. Then the blackberry disappears VERY quickly (maybe 15 minutes max) and you're met with sharp woods. As it dries down, the sharpness of the woods mixes with a mustiness that I can't comprehend. I did try this on a hot day, the scent kept turning warmer and more sharp on me. Maybe it's more suited for colder weather? Give it a try on your skin - this is not a safe blind buy.

The good part is that it lasts very long - but I did end up scrubbing it off. It was giving me a terrible headache because of its projecting power and I just didn't like the sharpness.",04/27/24 21:33,jow012
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Feminine and Creamy blackberry-red rose duo.
Patchouli adds maturity while subtle woods and amber add modernity.
Fortunately, not loud or brash...
A refined fruit-florale perfume.
Full drydown brings this one down to earth but never loses it's rosy core.
More dressy than daily.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Just tested this (1 hour ago circa) - it opened with a fresh, fruity blackberry and rather soon morphed into rose/oud-alike combo.

I have to say that although it isn't groundbreaking, the usual combo here was very balanced, smooth: perhaps because the berry provides backbone, though not so obviously.
I like this! It's befitting of an Arabian princess - aka a typical but very well made middle Easterner scent. Worth a test if you like the genre.",03/21/24 09:52,Forbiddenjade
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Blackberry. Rose. Patchouli. All up in your nose holes, inducing pleasure.

It’s amazing. It’s a dark femininity - the bottle is exactly the right colour for the juice inside.

Quite unusual and not readily available so it doesn’t feel super common or overdone.

The longevity is good and the sillage is healthy. One of the better Gucci scents I’ve smelled.",03/13/24 14:46,Gillzathrillza
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Female perfume but smells dark, cold and slightly masculine. I have the feeling that this is the scent of a Blackberry bush in a deep, dark forest.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Got a bottle for Christmas in 2018. It came with a travel size 10ml bottle as well, so I carried it everywhere. I’ve always repurchased it, it has a special place in my heart. It’s one of the scents that my partner adores, he said himself that it does smell of love to him. To me it’s a happy mature rose scent, it really puts me in a good mood. I had few compliments from men and women at work when I wore it, it projects beautifully, but it’s not overpowering. It lasts on my skin for over 12 hours. Last time I wore it at around 8am, I came home after a pub crawl at 11pm, took a shower and apparently my partner could still smell it on my neck. Great longevity.",03/02/24 14:23,Ljena777

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I always save my sweet fragrances for winter, with mostly a vanilla or tonka bean base. That gets boring after a while. This has deep sexy berries with a woody base, deep enough for fall and winter and a great addition to my cold weather arsenal. Just the slightest bit of sweetness from those berries, as well as some tartness. The cypress note is next level, in fact this fragrance is niche level at a great price. What were Gucci thinking discontinuing this gem, and keeping some really boring offerings?

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,Very unique. I don’t smell this very often in other people so I will probably get a full bottle.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I thought I would love this judging by the notes, but I was sadly mistaken. I adore Olympic Orchids Blackbird, and I assumed this would be similar, albeit more mainstream.Yet, I actually find that bombastic niche option much more palatable and easier to love than this designer release...go figure.

It opens very harshly with some super astringent cypress/juniper tones (at least the notes make sense). I really don't care for it, it feels very high-pitched and scratchy. The blackberry is drowned up until the 10 minute mark.

As it mellows, some aspects that I enjoy begin to emerge. The rose isn't bad, but I wish there was a little more to balance the bitter woody tone. Patchouli is there, but not a forerunner, and it remains rough in texture into the drydown. The pepper adds to the overall texture.

I find this to be interesting on some levels, but also quite abrasive...surprisingly so actually. I'm not comfortable in it. I think it leans slightly masculine (Who cares? Wear what you like regardless!), but performance is decent.",04/23/23 13:37,ShadowsofLight

I am however going to come back on the drydown to report as I've been reading some mixed reviews....but opening is a love for me.

Ah ok i see what everyone is talking about. This is a few minute wonder..so not really worth investing into, but the initial burst is a good one! Fun to test. Drydown is a soapy skin scent. Shame!",04/02/23 03:46,Cherry_Darling

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Jammy Blackberry-Rose with Cypress & a Retro Twist...

For those with a nose for detail, this underrated blackberry-cypress scent is a modern interpretation of an old school chypre. Signed by perfumer, Alberto Morillas (Versace Bright Crystal), this composition manages to evoke both modern and vintage perfumery. Opening with a fruity burst of blackberry and cedar-y cypress it transitions to a jammy rose heart on a traditional chypre base of patchouli, bergamot and vetiver. From the opening and into the heart I get a jammy blackberry-rose-chouli with a cypress accent on top. However, as it dries down I get a slight retro twist in the chypre that I'm not sure where it comes from, possibly the vetiver. I've had mine since 2018 and it only gets better with time, both on the skin and in the bottle. Enjoy!",03/21/23 18:32,suzanne_ronald

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I was moseying around Ulta, one fragrance in hand and looking at the others. I saw the description under Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme as “blackberry and” … something else. To be honest, I stopped reading/caring after “blackberry” .. that’s all I needed to see. I sprayed it on and got a lot of rich, jammy blackberry. Before I knew it, I picked up a 30mL bottle. I was going to buy it on the spot and not even worry about the drydown, but the rational part of my brain took over and told me to let it marinate. I’m VERY thankful I did. The jammy blackberry is short-lived … afterwards, it’s an absolute cypress bomb that overtakes most of the other notes, and the blackberry only returns in the deep drydown as part of the skin scent. Cypress and other foresty green notes do not do well on my skin; they all turn into isopropyl alcohol. Besides, this cypress is very perfumy, not at all like the fresh, cold, crisp, snowy cypress forest I imagine.

Almost a win, but ultimately not for me.",01/27/23 08:02,supergirl9412
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,This smells just like the colour of the bottle. It smells like a dark mysterious rose with dark syrupy and thick berry compote poured ontop.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Gucci missed the mark again. I find this overall to be a lotion-y arabian christmas; on my skin is absolutely divine, very mature and sexy BUT there is a gross note in the projection that I cannot put my finger on.

It ain't yeasty, not salty, not quite savoury... reminds me of the scent of goldfish food (the flakes or pebbles, either or). More precisely, it smells like the cupboard or locker into which you store the box of fish food.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"A friend of mine wanted to try this fragrance because the notes intrigued her and as a reward for surviving her harder-than-it-should-be Geology class, I bought her a sample off Ebay. Actually I bought two samples, one for her and one for me! She tried this fragrance out a few weeks ago, but I had quite a few other fragrance samples that were more of a priority at the time. I finally got around to trying Guilty Absolute Pour Femme today because it just felt like the perfect time to try it - It's pretty cold out (36 degrees F here in Nebraska) and I am feeling the whole aesthetic of what this fragrance promises. Today was the day!!

Sadly, I don't really love this fragrance. It's not absolutely terrible by any means, but it's not particularly artful to me. I sprayed my sample a few times on each arm/wrist and was hit was a very stereotypical ""perfume"" scent that just felt heavy. I sadly didn't get any of the blackberry which was the whole reason I wanted to test this fragrance out. It's taken about an hour for this fragrance to ""calm down"" a bit, but even so all I can smell is the rose and patchouli. It's not that that is a bad thing, I'm just not particularly impressed by it after having sampled so many heavy rose + patchouli fragrances recently. (My favorite, as I've mentioned in about 5 recent reviews, is Juliette Has a Gun Mad Madame) Also, it truly was disappointing that I didn't get any of the blackberry.

I'll keep my sample and try it out again (maybe on a night out or on a day/night where the weather is a tad warmer) to see if that helps.

Okay, it's been about two hours now and I can smell a bit of the blackberry. I also get the cypress I think - it's definitely a green woody note. And, of course, the rose and patchouli are the most dominant notes. I think I maintain my original assessment - as a blackberry perfume it's a bit of a disappointment, as a rose & patchouli perfume it just doesn't measure up to Mad Madame.

Hopefully I can find a new bottle for cheap to get for my friend for her birthday because she really really likes this!",03/23/22 05:58,realitygreene

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"A deep muscular rose fragrance enhanced with ripe juicy blackberry. Strong cypress, patchouli and cedarwood in the base steer this toward the masculino side of gender neutral, in my opinion. I don't find GGAPF challenging, overbearing, or experimental, but the lack of femme signifiers (the ubiquitous 'white florals') may not appeal to some. Reminds me of Azzaro Acteur (winey) and Jo Malone Pomegranate Noir (fruity), but more appealing than either, owing to an attractive tart spicy amber dry down those lack. I see myself using GGAPF sometimes in place of TF Noir de Noir, as it scratches the rose/patchouli itch without bringing so much heavy darkness. Unlike NdN, this does not project or last well on my skin for an EDP, but the scent is unique and distinctive (and inexpensive) enough to excuse middling performance. I should probably pick up a bottle or two before it gets scarce.",03/05/22 14:34,ameda

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Had it in my collection for few years, used to challenge myself with it :) Great for cold weather, autumn/winter. It's a strange one at first, but quite addicting, unique and theatrical! Has a bold personality on it's own & feels niche.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This was a blind buy for me, based on the notes. And while I think it’s a beautiful scent, I don’t think I would repurchase. The longevity and sillage are pretty decent, though. To me this doesn’t smell at all like the original Gucci Guilty pour Femme, despite having several of the same notes (they traded the mandarin for blackberry here, and swapped out many of the floral notes — all but rose — for woods and vetiver, but the base notes are the same.) After the blackberry fades, my nose picks up the cypress, rose, and patchouli above all else. And they don’t seem to play very well together for a while; it’s as if they’re fighting each other for attention instead of blending well. Still, after the drydown it starts to wear a bit better. I definitely get Victorian goth vibes from this one. It’s just hard to stomach the rose-patchouli battle to get to the good part. If I could go back in time, I’d have bought this one in a travel size, and gotten the full size of the original. Oh well. At least it’s not awful, but I do think I prefer Lady Vengeance by Juliette Has a Gun when I need my rose fix.",01/29/22 11:13,fairycoffins

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I tried this in an Ulta, and was shocked at how distinctive and original it was. I detected mainly juicy dark blackberries growing in a fairytale forest, an enchanting bush of roses, and a patchouli that had an anise-like quality. It is a great unisex option. The herbal edge gives it a hint of masculinity. The smell fits perfectly with the bottle. Dark potion vibes, but not overly ""natural"". More like super stylish witches with black crocodile Gucci bags full of herbs.",01/26/22 22:23,antfarm
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Really great, a bit theatrical scent, long lasting, beautiful in all stages. I would love it totally, except there is a rose in it, which spoiles it, for me.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This is such an amazing flanker! You can still smell the original Guilty in this because they’ve kept the base notes the same as well as the pink pepper in the top, but everything else has been changed. I love this scent so much, it smells expensive and classy. The berries add just enough sweetness to balance out the green and woody notes. I managed to get this perfume in the clearance sale at Boots in the UK which I’m so happy about but I just hope that it doesn’t mean this scent is being discontinued!

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"There is something truly special about this fragrance. It is intoxicating and not overly sweet, a perfect blend of bittersweet berries, fresh roses and woods.

In the opening, I get that sweet blackberry. The sweetness comes with a bitter note that balances out any jam feeling. As it dries down the rose and wood come alive. A soft Bulgarian rose lies down on a dominant woody bed. It sounds a bit masculine and it is, and that's what I enjoy so much about it. Gucci Absolute pour femme it’s not your girly girl scent. She minds business, she is strong, unconventional and knows what she wants. This is could easily be my signature scent. Just Lovely ❤️",11/15/21 03:49,Dani C.
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"It is very similar to Florabotanica. Vetiver and rose. Florabotanica has mint, this one has cypress, and it may be a little woodier and more fruity, but they are similar.

I used to wear blazers and aromatic perfumes in the 80,s and with Giorgio Beverly Hills,everyone knew I'd arrived before I was there! This is more subtle but with all the elements I adore.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Not a fragrance counisseur, but I'm ready to move to some more mature scents and this is more that way with the woody notes. I'm 37. I am getting over the light fruity scents. This defintely has more depth and I like that it leans unisex, I can't tolerate that over sweet smell anymore. So it starts with berries but goes into rose/woody. Very nice.",09/13/21 13:22,audreysoccer
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Took me a while to finally get this, and as a fan of both chypres and of Morillas' work, it did not disappoint. It's sort of a cousin to YSL's Elle. Fruity, woody and feminine with a sexy edge. The opening has a quirky (and thankfully fleeting) sour animalic note that lasts 3 seconds, but it mellows out into a lovely smooth woody-earthy-berry delight. This is not a teenager's berry fest, but a sophisticated fruity chypre that is both sensual and elegant.

It almost has a pheromonic quality and is also quite uplifting/confidence-boosting. It will have you sniffing your arm constantly. Lasting power is 4-6 hours but it lasts a couple of days on clothing. A modern classic that could work well for any woman & any season.",08/24/21 12:14,Aromantra
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I always think that Gucci fragrances are kind of good but not really me. Then I saw the Guilty Absolue recommended on this forum or Youtube or something and decided to spritz it at the department store. I was persuaded by the drydown and purchased a bottle.

The first 15min are really sweet red berries and absolutely not my style. After that the charming woody drydown comes out. It is fresh from vetiver and greenish from cypress. I associated the scent to going to the beach by the Mediterranean because of pinetrees but I also see that people find this Christmassy which also makes sense.

Happy to find this unusually woody perfume targeted to women in the mass market! Of course men can easily wear this as well.

Lasting power is weak!",08/10/21 22:41,evarosa
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Big hit of juicy berries cut through with a clean woody note - this is outstanding.

It is sweet but not too sweet. This errs on the unisex category for me - this would smell equally as gorgeous on a man.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Strong syrupy forest fruity smell at first ( assume that's the blackberry and pink pepper) then in about 30 min becomes a still sweet woody scent. More fruity sweet than woody, not bad but not the deep forest smell I was looking for.
Edit: I finished my sample and kept thinking about it, so ended up getting a large bottle and now I love it. Mouth-wateringly juicy berries, fresh and woody, with very little sweetness. It is a very atmospheric scent. After wearing it for a few days I kept thinking it reminded me of something I used to wear and finally figured it out-Elle by YSL. And checking here, I am not the only one who has noticed it! They are both fruity perfumes and share pink pepper, rose and patchouli. I think the pink pepper and rose combo is identical in both, but GG Absolute is fresh, juicy fruity and YSL Elle is syrupy sweet fruity. Dry downs are completely different, but I feel like they can be flankers of the same perfume and they are both gorgeous scents. I will definitely be looking to get back up bottles of GG Absolute as it makes me feels like I am somewhere wild, out in the woods when I wear it. Totally get the ""picking berries in the enchanted forest"" comments now!",08/01/21 05:48,Emera1d
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Rich, warm and lovely. It is berries but also something a little spiced.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I am now in my late 20's and usually wore sweeter smelling perfumes (think Ariana Grande ""Sweet Like Candy"") but this was the first perfume I bought that felt more ""grown up"" without being ""too mature."" To me it is a deep, dark berry scent, kind of woody, only slightly rosy, more sweet than spicy but not saccharine. It lasts long and I can smell it on clothing or pillows a day or two after I wear it. Great for nighttime but I wear it all day. In the winter and fall it is warm, comforting and sweet sprayed on a cozy sweater or scarf. On especially hot summer nights, it is very sexy, sultry, warm and fruity sprayed on slightly sweaty skin. It can be a little overwhelming if you use too much. It is versatile; cozy yet professional yet sexy. All around it is my favorite scent I own!",07/15/21 18:47,LaurelDeLasMontanas
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Unisex berries but not particularly naturalistic. I'd say it starts out more femme whereas the base reveals an earthiness reminiscent of scents labeled for men.

By then the scent was gone! It was like I never even sprayed the perfume. It was all gone within 30 minutes. This fragrance is very disappointing. I would never invest in a travel size or a full size. This perfume cost way too much to be gone in 30 minutes!,07/06/21 18:56,Perfumelady88
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I love this enchanting fragrance.

The opening is a very deep delicious blackberry. Simular to Lancome Amethyst, but that fragrance was a hint soapy, and didn't last a hot minute.

Gucci Guilty Absolute has this beautiful mix of blackberry, cypress, and woody notes, that smell like a dark magical forrest.

I understand some reviewers not getting the wood notes. The wood was stronger on the card, but I do get a hint of wood on my skin, under the blackberry and cypress, and I do smell wood in the sweet scent aura around me.

The cypress is everything in this perfume. It's fresh, and earthy, and keeps this from being just another boring sweet berry.

I imagine this is what a woodland pixie would smell like. Mischievous wood with wet moss and berries.

Projection and lasting are not great, but it does give me a scent aura, and I would not mind reapplying this one throughout the day, as it is unoffensive.

In the end, I would mostly wear this one at bedtime, to dream of fairies, sprites, and dark forests full of adventure.",07/02/21 12:26,RainbowGirl
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This is a big sirupy fruity rose on my skin. Almost no woods at all. I like it but I miss the wood that everyone else seems to get. I think this is a very well done fruity floral. Well blended, not cloying and it has depth. If you like fruity florals I definitely recommend it. But for me it lacks something to juxtapose the juicy sweetness.",07/02/21 10:21,Agnes81
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Wow, this is a very strong fragrance. The scent is overwhelmingly woody, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. The woody notes are very realistic and perhaps some of the most evocative I've smelled. It's too woody for me personally, but someone looking for an antique wood smell would enjoy this.

There's something very intriguing about Guilty Absolute. To be honest, it smells like an old wooden chest containing vintage garments and dried flowers. The dry down actually smells like a dustier version of JM Velvet Oud & Rose. It's just so atmospheric in a haunted Victorian parlor way. I think that's why I can appreciate it but could never wear it myself.",06/23/21 15:04,milkyjoa
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This reminds me of MFK Oud Satin Mood. I really like this. I'm a guy, and I'm obsessed.

Edit: Ok, I see ppl voting Portrait Of A Lady as similar scent, and POAL also smells like Oud Satin Mood imo — now I see why this reminded me of that. They're not same-same, given the price differences, but more like a very light version of the expensive ones I just mentioned.",06/17/21 09:00,AA4102
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This is just elegant, bold, glorious and almost masculine enough for me to wear. I bought a small sample and tested on my skin for a few days because a youtube reviewer said it was unisex. Almost, but that bombastic, bold rose, which gives the fragrance its character, leans it more feminine to me. The woody and fruity/ambery notes are just so good and well blended and warm.

Thus just smells like a monied, take charge maturish woman; I could imagine that the Baroness from the new Cruella movie, would wear this.",06/02/21 13:53,mikestro
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Usually I hate rose on my skin. However, I love a dark dark berry (peep my signature fragrance). The blackberry is wet and juicy, and it completely diffuses the harshness of the rose. Thank god. I enjoy the opening quite a bit for this reason. The blackberry is pulled off with skill.

This is a very thick rose scent on me, but not thick in the heady floral sort way (how rose tends to wear on me). The rose here is sweet more than anything; syrupy! The next word that comes to mind is boozy. And this is where the fragrance settles after a while: a sweet, boozy rose. I want to again emphasize the wetness. Another boozy rose that has been in my frag rotation over the years is Nirvana Rose, but the Gucci is distinct from it because it is so wet and juicy. It's pretty interesting, and I can't think of another rose-forward frag that dries the way this one does.

I don't think I would wear it myself (I've realized that I just don't like rose in any iteration). But I totally recommend giving it a try if the notes interest you. It performs like any other thick frag in this price level; think the Tom Ford sephora selections... You can smell it waft around you throughout the day (the wafts are dark and sweet to the nose). Other's have noticed when I wear it, but it didn't exactly elicit complements. ""Oh, I can smell you are wearing perfume,"" sort of reactions. But this doesn't surprise me: rose has fallen out of popular favor, I think.

Overall, this one is worth checking out if you are a romantic goth type. Or if you are queer and enjoy reading the Brontes. Or if you just like a wet, fruity rose. Happy sniffing!!",06/02/21 10:47,marco_m
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"The opening smells like rotten berries which doesn’t last more than a minute. Then I smell a beautiful well blended complex scent, I get roses prominently with flawlessly blended fruits.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"First blast of sweet orange, tingly pink pepper, and warm musk. Nicely sweet and fruity with some depth. After a minute, the scent steps into the shadows a bit, with darker purple fruit sweetness and amber. I rather like it actually but it's fading pretty fast from my skin. Not getting any of the woody note quite yet but I'll keep my nose on it. Projection is just about arms length. Unisex but leans feminine and best for all weather, methinks.

6+ hours later: The scent stayed on that purple fruit sweet scent and the vetiver came around to play too. They're all sticking but faintly.",05/05/21 10:15,NDStars

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I got my current bottle 5-6 years ago and liked it, but had to be selective about wearing it bc it is strong (cold weather only please), and had a bit of sharpness too it, I recall it as a strong clove note, but don't see cloves listed. In any case, it got pushed to the back of the pack and was also living a hard life in my bathroom with heat changes etc. Just gave it a sniff tonight and it has mellowed considerably! I am loving this as a stronger blackberry scent and mucccch less sharpness. I am missing the cypress a bit.

Comparisons to Enchanted Forest are wayyy off. GGA is spicy and masculine/unisex, very in your face. Enchanted Forest is wet, pine, blackberry and green leaves (cassis), softer and more straightforward than GGA. I love both of them in very different ways because they are very different types of scents, not a good comparison at all. EF isn't feminine per say, but compared to GGA it is much more so. Both are great Christmas scents, I live that connection.",05/02/21 23:22,Juliusq75

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Interesting fragrance.

A friend of mine has it and I sprayed it on my wrist. As a male I was surprised that this fragrance is marketed as a ""woman's"" fragrance, as it is highly unisex.

It is a dark, slightly vulgar (in expensive way) fragrance with notes of rose, patchouli and some woods and grass. It is a bit sour to my taste, that's where the ""body odour"" feeling comes in.

It is stated in the database that one of the more interesting notes here is blackberry. I tend to disagree as for me personally cranberries come into mind. When my friend asked me what I imagine after smelling it I told her that I sense a swamp, and a powdery wooden ""house of pleasures"". I think I would like to stay with that description.

Works as a decent evening fragrance with above average longevity, silage. Would not work well as a day fragrance in a hot climate. Has almost ""niche"" feeling to it.

Overall 8/10 as an evening, romantic fragrance.",02/15/21 01:11,Arunas.K
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"As a man, I've wanted to try Gucci Guilty Absolute pour Femme for awhile now, because of that blackberry note, so I finally ordered a sample. I wore it today, but my skin isn't reliable. At all. Fragrance seems to turn sour on it, so I sprayed on fabric, and here's what I think about it. Very nice. That unsweetened blackberry is prominent, as another reviewer called it, ""herbal blackberry"". In fact, the blackberry, cypress, and rose are MAGIC together! And it isn't TOO rosy because the tart blackberry with cypress keeps it from being too floral. It's slightly musky, but the musk isn't too strong (I generally hate musk, but not here). And the blackberry isn't too feminine or sugary, but ""au naturel"". So men, don't be afraid to try; as others have said, it really should have been marketed as unisex. I wish it did better on my skin, but I don't blame Gucci for that. Even so, I am considering a full bottle, and I RARELY buy a full bottle of anything. But I think I love this! :-O EDIT - What a difference a couple of weeks makes! I wore this today... (my plan was to wear my sample today, and buy a full bottle this weekend.) But I wore it today and all I can smell is roses, roses, roses. WHERE did that awesome berry/cypress combo go? I admit my skin doesn't like frags, but this is too much. I THOUGHT I found a new favorite, but the search for a new berry favorite continues. EDIT AGAIN - Wearing it again, and I think it's very pleasant.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Love. Exudes sex appeal. I liken it to a dirty rose. When I say dirty I don’t mean it literally. It has attitude, it’s not beautiful in the classic sense.

maybe its because the woodiness for business, the fruity fresh for play, and the rose, the sweetness made for lust and desire.

beast performance for me. the scent keep hugging my jacket for 2 weeks in closet! this is insane. and if u use the set gga femme (the shower gel and body lotion perfume), i guess u dont need bath for 2 days! lol

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I got a sample of GGA the other day and I enjoyed smelling it since the first time I sprayed it. The first minutes you feel the berries, really beautiful. Then it dries down to a more sophisticated, woody fragrance. My partner says it’s “unbearable” at the beginning, but I don’t see it that way. I think it’s suitable for a +30 confident woman during winter/autumn night time. In my opinion, this would be too much for daytime but maybe some of you may pull it off.
It is a “strong” perfume, yes. Is it headache-inducing like “pleasures”, “anais anais”, “gucci bloom”? NO! (opinion coming from a woman who loves fresh fragrances!)
I also don't think it's a safe blind buy. Try before you buy it.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"One day I woke up and I had a craving for a cypress type scent (I think I was missing the original Radox formula). It was pure luck that within a week or two of that I tested this just because I hadn’t seen it before, and I felt like I hit the jackpot. Blackberry and cypress combined here by the legendary Alberto Morillas is sumptuous and wonderful. Longevity is superb. I have tried to convince my husband to wear this as it’s easily Unisex. Actually as it progresses it tends more to the Masculine side, which I love. I think it is when you reach the Vetiver note. I love it most at night, and I often wear it to bed. Lastly, I know others have said it’s not the most inspired bottle design, but actually when you hold it is your hand it has a lovely solid feel, and colour of the glass is a lot more beautiful when viewed in person.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Just got my bottle and I absolutely love it! It's like a fruity/berry fragrance for grown ups! I would not call this a sweet fragrance but it does have some sweetness to it - just perfect. Initial opening is more unisex, however dry down is definitely more feminine. A fantastic creation by Morillas.

Longevity could be better, therefore I would give it an overall 9/10.",11/30/20 11:41,lorihollie
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Gucci better than Lalique
________________

Yes… there is a great similarity between Gucci Guilty Absolute and Lalique Amethyst.
- Amethyst is playful and fruity; the mulberry and the blackberry bringing out the jolly nature in a woman's character.
- Gucci Guilty Absolute has that and adds a powerful cypress-note and more rose (than Amethyst has), bringing depth and gravitas to this fragrance, for it aims at the more mature character in women. This is a magnificent fragrance of a profund extend, which only a master perfumer of Mr. Morrillas’ expertise could create.

To compare the 2 fragrance would only do both of them injustice, because each of them aims at another clientele.",11/16/20 12:09,Aleccsei
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I was gifted a bottle of this fragrance and although I liked the cold weather, juicy blackberry opening but I soon got tired of the over-bearing patchouli in the dry down.

On my skin I do get cypress after a while but unfortunately the patchouli is too much for me. It smells like a musty old attic or room in your grandparents house, not an earthy, hippy type of patchouli.

I had to give this bottle away. Shame because it had potential to be more.",10/29/20 18:00,The Niche Edit
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"When I sprayed my sample card, I paused. The initial cologne blast was very reminiscent of opening accords I've found in men's designer releases (e.g. ""Cool Water""). I double-checked the card, and indeed, it said ""Pour Femme,"" but I still gave it the side-eye and wondered what kind of beast the ""Pour Homme"" must be like if this was the ""Pour Femme.""

But the ""men's cologne"" accord didn't stay. After a couple minutes it evaporated and left behind... forest berries. Lush, juicy, unsweetened forest berries - in an alpine wood. I was shocked at how gorgeous it was, and this time checked the card again to see that it was a designer release and not a niche product. I eagerly sprayed the insides of my elbows (where I usually apply perfume) and this time skipped the ""men's cologne"" opening - because this performs better on skin than cards / fabric. Lasts about 6 hours, with the blackberries and cypress being the most prominent notes, followed by pink pepper. (And if something is going to be ""woody"" in a fragrance, I prefer coniferous accords to all the others, except maybe oud.)",10/29/20 10:01,baerro

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"How is it possible that people say it smells masculine?

For me it starts with a blast of minty berries, fresh and luscious. Then I can smell deep dark rose, super gorgeous! The rose here is in the same vibe of one of my faves from Givenchy, Irresistible L'intense. Not at all girly. It's sultry and dangerous.
I'm enjoying the trend of amber drydown nowadays as I recently purchased Chanel Coco. The amber in there slightly sweet but not pronounced. It's all about the dark rose and minty berries. It stays well behaved in hot weather too as I walked out for lunch. I'm in love.
I'm glad it works for me!",10/27/20 02:25,lady_ireth264
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I wanted to smell like an enchanted evergreen forest, but this was too cypress-y even for ME... It's immediately resin-y, and the cypress is more thyme-y in the beginning. It dries down to a more fabric softener scent.

The rose does not feminize this fragrance. It is not feminine AT ALL to me. No idea why it's even called ""pour femme"", because it smells extremely unisex. From the blackberry I'm ONLY getting TARTNESS. It's hard to find sweetness in it.

Sometimes the wafts of this fragrance are fresh and sophisticated. Sometimes the tartness is overwhelming; especially at the beginning. It's definitely taking me some time to get used to overall. I'm more likely to wear this just for me to smell on myself at home when I'm in a certain mood for it, because to other people I'd rather smell a lot more feminine.

I used to have the Preferred Fragrance knock off version of this, and it's pretty similar, except the knock-off was a little stronger in the thyme-y note, black currant instead of blackberry, and I don't remember it being as strongly TART, but it still became ""fabric softener-y""..... Except for the Gucci brand's being so tart, I would say it's only slightly more balanced. I really actually expected a lot more.

I barely have anything in my collection that I could layer this with to sweeten it in the right way.... Y'all... I tried to layer this with ""Alien"" 😂. It started to smell like tuberose and my Gloria Vanderbilt ""Minuit À New York"" somehow. Then it dried down to somehow smell cheap 🤣😭",10/26/20 04:53,Anjolena

It's absolutely unisex, and even masculine leaning (or rather, the kind that my husband would love to wear, as he likes sweeter masculine scents).

I'm happy my husband can enjoy the small decant I have of this (and it suits him so well), but it smells absolutely horrible and sweaty on me. It's amazing how the same fragrance can smell so different on other people.",10/08/20 03:44,AlexandraTroush

In the Winter, that feminine sweet opening sticks around much longer in the duration, which may be awesome for a woman but not ideal for most men. In the Spring is when GGPF gets more masculine leaning and woody - it’s beautiful. In the summer it’s simply too heavy for hot weather.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme EDP opens with a moderate projection of sweet, fruity, floral, woody, and spicy accords. The opening is fresh, bright, aromatic, well-balanced, and very pleasant. The blackberry and bergamot create a fruity note, the bergamot sharpens the sweet, tangy, and fruity notes of the blackberry; closeby and leveled with blackberry and bergamot is the rose note, floral aromatic, slightly powdery and sweet. The pink pepper is a soft spicy touch. The cypress and woody notes are supporting accords, noticeable, at least initially; similarly, the vetiver and patchouli are just a soft green touch. The amber creates a soft powdery projecting accord. The fragrance has some subtle but noticeable opening to dry-down changes. The bergamot is sharp during the opening and brightens all other notes but it loses some projection towards the dry-down; the cypress is more noticeable towards the opening, whereas, the woody notes towards the dry-down, the amber develops a soft powdery and projecting note; also, the fragrance loses some intensity, it takes one step down from moderate to moderate to low. Once Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme EDT reaches its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate to low projection, slightly powdery, sweet, blackberry, rose, and woody fragrance with some spicy and green accords. The fragrance feels airy, aromatic, clean, comforting, delicate, elegant, feminine, floral, fresh, fruity, gentle, inviting, light, mature, sweet, versatile, white, woody, and pleasant.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This reminds me of my childhood in the countryside of Oregon. Picking blackberries from the huge bushes in our yard and roaming through the woods all day with my brother and cousin.
It's a very beautiful, sophisticated and sultry perfume. Dark but still fresh. I get mostly blackberries and cypress with whiffs of rose and patchouli, but everything else is seamlessly blended to my nose. Unisex for sure. I don't detect anything particularly masculine nor feminine in this. I definitely agree with this smelling more like a niche perfume as it's quite different from anything you can find at sephora or ulta. I usually do not like most modern, mainstream fruity fragrances, but this is a treasure! I have nothing like it in my collection and it's great when I want a change from my favorite old-school Guerlain fragrances.",07/19/20 02:24,CarlottaMarie
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"I received a sample of Gucci Guilty Absolute pour Femme from Sephora. The cypress dominates on me, followed by the woody notes, then the patchouli and vetiver.

A definite ""pass"" for me.",07/11/20 21:35,WildDove

Please PM me if you'd like to trade/swap! I bought this last week (original review and this edit posted July 1st) so it is brand new and I've only used a few sprays to test it.

Based on my woman's wearing on casual shopping,
work and at social functions.
But I think, men can wear this on lesser sprays.
As I did and only got very good remarks.
The smell of soft citrus, luscious berries and
aromatic roses that makes it so captivating
from beginning to end.
Wonderful blend with some earth tones,
soft spices and a bit of a suede feel.
The sexiness unleashed on the dry down.
It lingers, really lingers, in the air,
in the room and leaving a very alluring scent trail.
Not to be used on extreme hot days.
Best for fall and winter.
Best for dates, parties, formal and outdoor
events.
Best to impress men when you passed by them.

tried.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Gucci claims this fragrance remains unchanged from first application. While I understand what they mean, it is not exactly true.

The four main notes: blackberry, rose, patchouli and golden wood are present through the life of the fragrance, but it dries down in a classic way with these different notes having their moments to be in the spotlight while others support. First, it is the blackberrys solo: dark and green, juicy. It passes the microphone to a slightly powdery dark rose. Finally, the golden wood and patchouli close the show. In other words, you can still smell the rose and blackberry in the dry down, but they are in the distance, not totally gone.

This is a unisex fragrance. It is dark, sexy, and intoxicating. A very interesting release from Gucci - it smells nothing even close to the other guilty releases. This is niche quality and not safe for a blind purchase - one of those fragrances some people will hate. I have fallen in love with this dark, woody scent.

Funny story - I picked up a bottle of this for 50$ on kijiji. A guy got it for his girlfriend and they broke up... the spoils of war!",03/09/20 21:26,Forbuss
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This is a unisex fragrance with very beautiful, juicy blackberry and high quality cypress. Fruity and woody, not complex but not done this well before in designer range either. It's like smelling a book that your lover just poured a glass of blackberry juice on by accident, if that makes sense.

I figure out that it's a perfect-for-transitional-season fragrance. Oh boy, I didn't like this in autumn, the time of the year when I haven't let go of the summer fragrance mindset and there's something off about already wearing cypress scent 3 months before Christmas. But I love this in the end of winter and especially spring. The weather in February is cold enough to tame the heaviness of rose and wood, yet the fresh blackberry and cypress absolutely shine in the spring's light sunshine. But hey, if you can pull it off in autumn it's awesome! Otherwise, too weak in winter, too heavy in summer (where I live summer can get to 40*C, you would not want to wear any fragrance then to be honest).",02/18/20 01:48,socola_1996
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"Great fragrance! Sexy and uplifting. The opening is like a fruit liquor with something herbal, like the branches of a fruit tree. Unusual but very pleasant, after that, it starts smelling like bubblegum but in a good way and then it turns into a nice fruity jam. Unfortunately it turns way too quickly into a skin scent. Then i can smell something softly sweet, but the drydown is not really unique. Anyways, this perfume is amazing! Gucci is becoming my favorite house, they have great fragrances for women!

This scent has a lot of rose coming though on my skin but it's tangled with the cypress.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This Gucci Guilty Absolute is gorgeous. The initial blast of sweet, juicy, deep blackberry is so delicious. It is deceptive because I did not expect that this fruity perfume would have such a niche, chypre drydown.

The drydown of GGA is most definitely green with predominantly cypress (Christmas tree) and some woods. The blackberry tint is still there but this drydown is not child's play. It is gorgeous and intriguing.

The longevity is great for me. I am wearing this in fall and intend to wear it all year. Back up bottle worthy IMO.

I tested it the other day at Ulta, and it is very, very sugary sweet blackberry; like blackberry jam or juice concentrate that hadn't been reconstituted with water yet. I'm not the biggest fan of blackberry unless it disappears fast, but this doesn't. Dries down to a rose, and piney, spicy (peppery), patchouli scent on me. Okay, but not my style. I'm not a fan of that sweet patchouli combination. Reminds me of too many other scents on the market right now.

I was assured by the retailer that this perfumes *constantly* gets compliments - but I have yet to hear *any* comment. I'll take the negative as well as positive, as long as I know if there's *something*.

But yes - personally - Heck yeah, I fall in deep, lush *love* with this Bulgarian rose and berry scent. It's so deep, sexy, beautiful, and intoxicating!

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"A nice take on a berries and rose fragrance, not just to be contrary to some previous reviews but I find this one definitely leans more feminine but hey it's all subjective. I like this scent but don't think I'll be wearing it myself (that could change though, who knows...). Some guys might like to wear it though as it's not as sweet as other fruity feminine marketed scents.

I'm a big fan of these recent Gucci releases, I own and love the men's Guilty Absolute which is just brilliant and pretty daring for a designer fragrance, a fresh take on a leather scent.

This 'women's' version like the men's one also uses cypress & vetiver to give some green and woody freshness to the berries and rose (rather than the leather in the men's scent) and it works (!), another hit to chalk up for Mr Morillas.",10/09/19 12:29,TrephineArtist
Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This right here is a prime example of why people should embrace the unisex marketing of most niche brands and let the ""Pour Homme"" and ""Pour Femme"" labels become parts of the history books.

As terrible of a scent as the new Gucci Memoire d'une odeur was, it took a step in the right direction by introducing the general fragrance consumer to unsiex marketing.

I worked at several big retailers myself and I saw so many cases where a man would come to the store, see the ""Pour Femme"" label and move on to the mens section to find something for himself, unaware of some real gems that he might love.

I would even argue that this smelled BETTER on my skin than on my female coworkers.

On me this opens with a really juicy and citrusy mix of blackberries and bergamot. I would've loved to get some pink peppers as listed here too but unfortunately couldn't.

Then it slowly morphs into a velvety, smooth, and cold mix of patchouli, vetiver, and some lingering blackberry. With some pillowy soft rose giving it that velvety texture that I love.

Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme Gucci,"This is a cold fragrance, but in the best of ways. No vanilla, amber, tonka or anything of that kind to soften or warm up. It’s a cold, crisp bush of fresh blackberries on a chilly autumn morning. In the forest, surrounded by the woods of conifers, cypress and pine. A crisp rose mingles with an earthy patchouli, but they stay in the back and never steps up front stage. This scent is freshness all the way, crispness defined, but still not sharp or scratchy. Fruit and berry lovers be warned! This berry doesn’t show up alone to the party, she comes accompanied by the earthly date of the forest and is not banal, jammy nor candy like. The crispness of the cypress is almost verging on something minty or eucalyptus like. Reviving to the senses. Sophistication in a bottle.",09/06/19 23:19,LondonJean

The perfumes are not similar other than that. Overall, I would have trouble choosing between them if I had to, but wow, the opening of this perfume is fantastic.",06/20/25 14:29,LLayton
Osmanthus Nectar Gucci,"I got a sample of this after smelling it in store and couldn’t stop thinking about it. Sadly, after wearing it a couple of times, it’s just not a wow. It’s lovely; apricot in a fuzzy soft sort of way, osmanthus bringing a floral edge that blends with the apricot, a warmth from the cedar wood somewhere in the background. But when you aren’t searching for the notes, it’s just a sweet apricot scent. It feels (dare I say) a bit cheap, I don’t think someone would think you’re wearing a £265 perfume. I do find it to last a long time on my clothes, but it doesn’t project much so I do become a bit nose blind to it. Glad I didn’t buy a whole bottle on the grounds that I loved it in store.

It’s divinely soft, cozy, and enveloping, like an invisible silk scarf wrapped around you.
Delicate apricot with a hint of sweetness unfolds beautifully, complemented by a refreshing tea note that adds a light, breezy touch.
A gentle woody base and creamy lactonic nuance (thanks to the sandalwood, I believe) make the composition especially warm and harmonious.
This is the kind of scent you want to wrap yourself in and never take off- made for comfort and pleasure.

It would 100% be my signature scent if it wasn’t so expensive. But I couldn’t resist and had to buy a bottle anyway. Projection and sillage is moderate (which I actually prefer for this scent profile) and longevity is great on my skin.

Osmanthus Nectar Gucci,"This is a sweet osmanthus smell, very feminine. The dry down is slightly woody, but it has the peachy quality from the osmanthus that just doesn't add up with something woody and mysterious, it's more earthy than that.
If you want a perfume that smells incredibly similar to this for a fraction of the price, and that lasts much longer, get Artemis by Soki London. In my opinion it's better: Greener, multifaceted and lasts much longer than this one.

It's still a very nice perfume, but I do love osmanthus...",03/09/25 15:57,Marie76
Osmanthus Nectar Gucci,"Very beautiful peach/osmanthus scent with a balsamic undertone and a woody base. It projects very well, it remains fruity and dense for a long time. The amyris note can be a little too much at times but it makes it more special. There is tiny citrus note that also stays a long time. I see this scent can be cloying if overapplied, but it is truly beautiful if used correctly.",03/07/25 17:42,aspirina
Osmanthus Nectar Gucci,"Gucci’s Osmanthus Nectar is more a conversation between textures than a straightforward scent. It opens with a sharp, almost metallic pepperiness, sort of like the static crackle when you dry leaves rub together. A soft sweetness does start to unfurl gradually, not quite the syrupy sort, but a translucent honeyed peach juice, rippling through the rough edges. The sandalwood appears too, starting oh so jagged, like an unpolished surface, before time smooths it into something quieter, more worn-in. Floral notes weave through, not lush and blooming, but fragmented—spicy petals caught in the wind rather than whole blossoms. It’s an interesting scent, but its beauty appears more as fleeting moments of appeal, within a structure that never fully resolves. Wearable, but not anything particularly great.",01/30/25 00:56,luvoxlixir
Osmanthus Nectar Gucci,"Osmanthus Nectar by Gucci smells like osmanthus tea, green tea, peach pulp, smooth and fluffy sandalwood.

I fell in love with this perfume instantly. I love tea scents, tea is one of my favorite notes.
It smells perfectly balanced. Earthy tea, juicy sweet peach pulp, fresh tea leaves. It smells exactly like it's name: osmanthus and sweet peach nectar.
Usually photorealistic tea fragrances are not very intense, but this one doesn’t have that problem.",01/03/25 12:35,JuliaToothFairy
Osmanthus Nectar Gucci,"Love at first smell, later I will do a detailed review of this magnificent creation by Nathalie Lorson and it is automatically in my top 3 of this line, its performance above all has surprised me because the line suffers from having a ""timid"" performance for the most part, I haven't tried it in depth on my skin yet, but my husband put it on today and it lasted more than 8 hours and the hanging clothes still smelled almost like they had just been applied, a wonderful and fruity osmanthus with a peach aura, sophisticated and playful at the same time, that Tom Ford's Bitter Peach would like to have.
Of the three new releases of this line, it is my favorite followed by Fiori di Neroli and Vanilla Firenze third, the latter I thought would be my favorite because I am a vanilla lover but there is a note like leather or something 'dirt' that does not allow me to enjoy it at 100%.
Bravo for the new creative direction in the Gucci perfumery department, the two Gucci Guilty Love Edition 2024 are also great, let's hope the house continues on the right track.",12/31/24 23:46,Abry_81
Osmanthus Nectar Gucci,"I was not fan of the initial opening. It smells as though there's ginger in here to add a warm spicy factor, but I don't see ginger listed in the note breakdown. I'm guessing its the sandalwood that's adding the spice quality. It smells smooth but I just wasn't expecting that to initially take over. The drydown is beautiful though. The osmanthus shines through during the drydown and lasts for hours on my skin.",12/26/24 13:03,berryclouds

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"It's very fresh...? I don't know how to describe perfumes since my nose isn't that accurate compared to everyone here but this is a very nice and clean scent. It reminds of nearly the end of highschool where girls are beginning to pay more attention to themselves and their scents. when I smelled this, it reminds me of a older female classmate that I admired who's very proper...if that make any sense. Just a very clean and simple scent, perfect for anyone who's just starting to get into perfumes.",06/22/25 03:27,Nemo_
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Category: Fruity, sweet, floral

Notes: Sprays on insanely alcoholic and sour. As it settles the pear becomes super apparent, fresh and a little fruity, but what appears the most is the sweetness of the sugar note. I would not call this brown sugar though, as brown sugar has a depth and caramel-y tones to it, this is rather plain and syrupy in contrast. Simply put, on me this smells like a sickly sweet pear. Cannot detect any gardenia.

Vibe: Cherry blossoms. Baby bunnies. Bamboo. Green and Pink color combo. Watermelon soda. Pomegranates. Brown leather bag. White flowy skirt. Frog on a lily pad. Female friendship. Koi pond. Green tea. Sheer curtains. Wooden bedframe.

Sillage: 6/10. Fairly decent sillage, not loud but also not a skin scent. You do have to come in close to catch whiffs of it but when you do you won't be able to miss it.

Longevity: 4/10. Lasts about 4-5 hours on me, on skin, but lasted less than an hour on my mom who has the type of skin that eats fragrances. So if you have the same issue I would not recommend this perfume. Even then 4 hours is pathetic performance in terms of longevity.

Wear: Daytime. Strictly spring and summer due to it's light, airy and sweet nature.

Overall rating: 5/10. I would describe this as the stronger, much sweeter version of Katy Perry’s Meow. Prominent notes of pear, vague indefinable florals and corn syrup. While fresh and clean, this is truly sickeningly sweet to the point where I find it unbearable, so fair warning if you're also sensitive to overly sweet fragrances. It's very linear and not particularly ground-breaking, but quintessentially feminine, or rather - girly. Definitely more suitable for teenagers and women under 30. For a perfume named Gorgeous Gardenia you would think there'd be some distinct gardenia in there but I can't say I'm picking up any gardenia whatsoever. Safe and likely a crowd-pleaser, this was just a little too sweet and a little to uninteresting for my personal taste.

Who would wear it?: Jackie Burke in That 70s Show.",02/14/25 14:47,JaneBond
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This was a special scent to me as it was a gift my aunt when I turned nineteen.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"ahh i miss pre-reformulation gorgeous gardenia so much :( i've been wearing this since i was a teenager (15 i think?) and it was my signature scent, floral but sweet and a bit fruity. the pear and berry notes really stood out on the old version.

i have purchased the newer version in the pink bottle several times, but when i went back home and smelled my old bottle of this i realized how different they are. they're similar enough that you can tell they're supposed to be the same fragrance, but the newer version is much less fruity and fresh... it feels a bit more mature to me, which is maybe fitting bc i'm 23 now lol, but it's still a bit disappointing",11/04/24 11:58,josephjoestargf
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"A very generic floral scent. The 'fruity' aspect is almost negligible, although I did sense a very slight hint of pear.

Lasts pretty long on clothes but not on my skin.",04/15/24 07:59,mr.biscuit
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,pretty floral perfume but smells a bit generic and synthetic and is so overpriced for the longevity. it disappears after like an hour or two on me but maybe 3 hours on clothes? really disappointed with longevity but really like this scent for spring and summer. sweet but not cloying. gives me a headache sometimes when i overspray but if i dont overspray then it barely shows up on my skin.,12/13/23 18:22,lxllim

The scent is unique, but it's a hard pass for me now. A funny story, though - I was going to a Weezer concert at Riverbend in Cincinnati and had it in my purse. Security turned me away because ""no glass is allowed inside"" - so to avoid walking 2 miles back to the car, we went into the field near the woods by the venue and buried it in the ground!!

Yes, I saw the patchouli note in the base... but according to voters, the patchouli should have been the least identifiable note. Nope... not for me. Patchouli is becoming a note that ruins it for me, and that's what happened here. I need patchouli to be way in the background, far far back. I'll have to pass on this one.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,This smells exactly like Good & Plenty candy to me. It's sweet but there is a strong licorice note.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This smells like a generic floral perfume. I am not really getting gardenia which is a shame because I love gardenia. This is very floral and sweet and it feels a bit cloying. It needs something in the base notes to off set the florals and sweetness. The patchouli is not enough. This smells like a very basic perfume. Probably a good introductory perfume for someone young who wants to smell like flowers. This is something I would expect from bath and body works not Gucci. No shade to bath and body works. I think they have great scents and were part of my introduction to fragrances. In fact I know bath and body works has better gardenia perfumes then this one. I just expected more from a luxury brand charging as much as it is for a bottle.

If you want a better gardenia scent, then I would recommend Banana Republic’s Cardamon and Gardenia. If you want something way more complicated, then I recommend Velvet Gardenia by Tom Ford.",05/14/22 16:08,msamber86
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I have absolutely no idea why, but this, on first spray, reminded me immediately of Colors de Benetton (original formulation). I'm not seeing much in common, note-wise. It settles down to something similar but not quite similar enough to say it smells the same. It is sweet, with just the slightest tinge of the green gardenia ""bite"" lurking underneath. Overall, it's not really a creamy OR green gardenia, though. The pear and berries are very present, leaving a fresh, light, and fruity floral. Not my normal kind of floral, but it's pretty and I do like it. Doesn't seem to last very long, though (even when I spray it directly on my clothing).",05/01/22 07:45,karenX

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I consider this one of my top 10. It is an absolutely gorgeous, ultra-feminine, gentle perfume.

I was not a big fan of the original Flora, because of the weird dry down after a few hours, but I was wearing it religiously because my husband gifted it to me. However, GGG is a stunner. It stays on me for about 10 hours, good projection as well, I think Gucci fumes in general love my skin, or my skin loves Gucci, whichever way it may actually work.
And, whoever is voting that this smells like Viva La Juicy, you have problems. VLJ is so cloying and thick that it is almost unwearable for anyone over 20, not to mention that they do not smell anything alike. People are weird.",03/10/22 09:44,Perpetual Collector
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I remember being so exited the day this came out. I love gardenias, the look of them, the smell of them, everything about them. My all time favourite flower in general. Gardenias were also the main flower used in my wedding bouquet!) Being a scent called gorgeous gardenia I was expecting to be overwhelmed with a gardenia scent straight up, but when I smelt it, I don’t remember the gardenia being particularly specific and it being quite faint a smell. Although smelling it now, a few years later, it seems a lot nicer than I remembered (maybe the gardenia is more noticeable in summer?) I’ll be noting this because wearing it now in summertime I remember the gardenia smell standing out a lot more, although it still has quite low lasting power and sillage. I feel like the name gorgeous gardenia (while I take the term ‘huge overstatement’ back) is is still a bit of an overstatement.

But it doesn’t mean it’s not one of my favourite summer scents for those days you are opting for a light scent. Still a beautiful spring and summer option.",02/11/22 02:43,Cataddicted

In the dry down, GG starts to leans more floral while VLJ is more sweet/gourmand with the caramel note shining through. I like them both, but they’re definitely similar enough that I would not own both. If I had to choose one, I would pick VLJ. It lasts much longer on me and is a fraction of the price of GG. I much prefer the GG bottle and the color of the juice, but the poor performance (lasts maybe 15-20 before I can’t smell anything) and the high price makes it a solid no for me.

The store associate 2 isles over helping some one else even said what ever that is in the air buy it, its smells wonderful lol.

Smelling them from the sprayer, the Gucci is slightly more floral while the Viva La Juicy is sweeter with caramel. But if you sprayed it and wasn't intimately familiar, they would be easily confused in the opening.
After an hour or so it has developed more of a floral character, though it is a sweet and fresh floral. I get almost no patchouli, and wouldn't be able to pick out the frangipani either.

You probably need one or the other. This one is much more expensive though, and I find the longevity average. Would be a lovely and classy gift though.",12/21/20 16:34,fyetan

The patchouli gives it a nice base, if not slightly masculine, with a deep floral. On me, this is a strong fragrance that sits on the skin, if that makes sense.

Then add in some cooling white florals, and you have this perfume.

It is actually lovely!",09/06/20 00:36,vlarya
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"If i don't find the emerald gardenia limited edition one anymore then i will go for this one, even if it has more of a sweetner undertone, which is not overpowering luckily but it is maybe too sweet for a summer scent of even spring. i would love to wear this in evenings maybe even day time when i have something special. but because it has a stronger sweeter tones i would not want to have this as my go to every day fragnance because it comes off as too girly

longevity is great, on me for 5-6 hours and that for a edt is in my opinion decent. also you can always reapply but as i said i would not wear this daily, but for sepcial occasions. for the price point i have nothing against it really, seems okay for a 50 ml.i think...? if it were a cologne and with shitty wear then i woul definitely not pay the price for a 50ml (80 sth euros)

tbh this kinda reminds me of a girly person, i think it is more youtful not teenager girly... a mature woman can be youthful right, so i think it is more in that perspective.",08/16/20 06:44,ayken
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,I received this in a monthly subscription service and when I first sprayed it I thought they had made a mistake. I thought they had filled this bottle with a Viva La Juicy fragrance or VS Tease. Thats exactly what this smelled like for about 20 minutes and then the Gardenia came out but it was light and synthetic smelling on my skin. After 30 minutes its nothing more than skin scent on me and the end result of the dry down is a light sweet gardenia scent. The scent was completely gone after about and hour and a half. Definitely not worth a full bottle purchase,08/10/20 12:19,Kyndra05
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Gorgeous scent, love it. Sweet, warm succulent juicy berries and pear. After juicy Noir this is my second fav scent. Only downside is it doesn’t last! I need a stronger version of this",07/27/20 19:15,Nuzy05
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Behind the sweet, fruity top notes reveals a minimalist composition of gardenia and frangipani; which, all disappears in under two hours and leaves you with a very subtle, powdery, soft patchouli base.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"First off I want to start off by saying that I don't get the VLJ comparison at all. With that being said, this has probably been on my want list since I started my perfume collection almost 2 years ago now. It was so hard for me to find a good spring/summer perfume that wasn't powdery or loaded with grapefruit or yuzu (not a big citrus fan) and this was my saving grace. I never knew if this was worth it so I would go to sephora, make my self a tester, finish the tester, debate if it was worth it, forget about it, and repeat. I like it, but with the extremely poor longevity, I finally decided it's not a bottle I would purchase. But I would swap for it. This is finally coming off my want list. For the same price point, I would go with sky di gioia. Not the same but hits the spring/summer fruity floral decently priced check mark. Not sure if my rant will help anyone but I hope it does!

Edit: Someone mentioned that it smelled a bit masculine. I never noticed that until right now. It definitely has a cologney vibe.",04/15/20 01:27,lnoskin
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"WHATEVER YOU DO, don’t buy this. Please spend your hard earned money on something else!

And for that pricetag is not acceptable, this is my biggest mistanke of blind buy ever. Never got an compliment with this one, I believe cause no one can smell it.",03/23/20 08:32,Heidi931
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Well this is what I get for buying bottles online and not trying first! This is just like viva la juicy but just a tad lighter.

But I already have a huge bottle of viva la juicy so I dont need this one! Too similar.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"It's crazy, I just don't get the Viva la Juicy similarity. I don't like the Viva la Juicy fragrance at all, not on a sample card, not on my skin not even from the bottle. This one I really like, It's a refreshing girly scent. I am almost on my 40's but I still enjoy wearing this. The only downfall is that I don't think it lasts too long on my skin, maybe 3 or 4 hours? I have no issue in reapplying but just saying that it could last longer.

I am not a big fan of Gucci Flora, all of them are headache inducing to me. This one is different so I recommend that you give it a try if you don't like the other floras you may like it. If you are looking for something a little more long lasting try Emerald Gardenia, I personally loved that one, it's like Gorgeous Gardenia's older sister and it lasts longer.",02/18/20 06:06,MahaS

It's definitely very similar but not as gourmand or tart fruit smelling. The gardenia is squeaky clean and makes this perfume a little soapy. I also wouldn't describe this as a gourmand perfume at all unlike VLJ which is a very warm, cozy gourmand.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I’m not sure whether there is any gardenia in this, but I’m pleasantly surprised. In the opening there is a nondescript floral accord mixed with a chemical musky pear note, which is similar to the sugary musk used in Mon Guerlain EDP. After approximately 30 minutes this becomes a less sweet Mon Guerlain without the lavender. A few hours later a sweet synthetic floral note reminiscent of chamomile appears, giving a gentle touch to the musky pear. After 7 hours it’s completely gone.
Overall this perfume is very feminine, gentle, suitable for all seasons. I have used hair products that smelled like this before and wished I had a similarly smelling fragrance - my wish has come true. It should be cheaper for what it has to offer, as there is nothing remotely groundbreaking in this cocktail of synthetic notes, but I do enjoy wearing it.",10/02/19 13:52,mihaela_i
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This is a perfect day fragrance. People mostly seem to wear it for spring and summer but I have also used it during winter. This is a beautiful floral scent.

the bottle is finished now but there is still some fragrance scent left that gives me so much memories related to this beautiful scent.
Definitely a scent for young girls. its not too sickly sweet or citrus. just perfect sweet floral scent.
it is worth a buy for trying out or even collecting.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I certainly have a love-hate relationship with this fragrance. Being a lover of creamy white florals, I can't say that I pick up the gardenia at all. Either the blending is superbly done, or gardenia is perhaps used in a lower ratio. I smell juicy pear, some sweet berries on a bed of patchouli.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I posted a review quite a while ago., just wanted to update review.

I still really like this perfume. I can't say I know what gardenia smells like but there's a floral element to this perfume, it's softly sweet. This isn't candy sweet like Britney Spears' Fantasy range, this is a natural sweetness. I definitely smell frangipani, juicy sweet pear and a tiny hint of patchouli. I don't get any berry notes at all.

I still stand by in saying this perfume is elegant & classy. It doesn't shout, scream or yell, but rather softly whispers or hugs. Perfect all year round, in any situation: work, night in/out, date day/night or just in general chilling at home ect. I don't think this will offend anyone.

On my skin only berries and patchouli, even in the horizon I can't see any flowers, I wish to find flower in the garden smelling like this :) Also I wish Viva La Juicy to smell so luxurious.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"When skimming the reviews of this, 3 out of 5 reviewers say something along the lines of “exactly like Juicy Couture” EXCEPT a or EXCEPT B or even EXCEPT A & b. Well then it IS NOT exactly like Juicy. I find that irritating and it takes a lot to irritate me. Is it in the same sweet, youthful category? Of course! Are they both, for the most part safe and in offensive and easy to wear? Absolutely! But don’t let the word “exactly” being throw around make you write this off for testing. To me and on me it smells nothing like any of the juicy offerings other than what I have already stated earlier. I love this! Got a sample from Sephora and it stood out in a good way among the other samples I got and am currently waiting for my full bottle to arrive so I can spray away!

I have had Gucci Flora in the past (the original one) but found that while it is lovely and nice it just was a bit generic (in a good way!). So a sales lady showed me Gorgeous Gardinia and it struck me as having that lovely Flora vibe but added that missing element that made it more interesting to me. Something to note is that it is not too strong on the gardenia so don't let that put you off. It is really nice, the pear, frangipani and berry accords really make this something special.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This is an amazing perfume! I thought I would leave a review, as most of them here have been a bit average and meh. I have been looking for an almondy/frangipani pear scent with woody or leathery undertones for a while now and I may have found it.
This is a sparkling fresh deliciously flowery scent in the summer and a sultry, lingering, even leathery (if not listed) frangipani wonder in the colder months. In the summer, spray it in your hair after a shower and let it waft around you with every move. In the winter, try spraying it onto the lapel or sleeve of your leather jacket or ladies handbag. It will hit you with feelgood vibes throughout the day and make you feel like a star!
Every single person that gets a sniff of this asks me what that wondrous fragrance is, even from some distance away, so the projection must be great. I never even get this when wearing Dior... Everyone compares it to Juicy Couture, but I think this one does more than shrill and fruity and it has a serious, deep side too.
So, it is worth saving up to get this beauty if you are into lush woody florals, you won't regret it. The box, especially the first colourful edition is gloriously drawn, I have nothing like it on my perfume shelf. Even as a blind buy it is worth it, quite a crowdpleaser. Yet, it is not childish or simplistic, it has plenty of layers to keep you happy throughout the day.",02/19/18 02:14,mavimy

I think Viva la juicy is more bright and sweet but Gucci gorgeous is more flora, relaxed and have a hints of elegant.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia is not the best white floral I've ever smelt, but it is very pleasant on the skin. It's missing that creamy aspect that most gardenia scents have. I find it to be a mostly clean and fruity interpretation.

This fragrance is essentially a floral scent for those women that have an aversion to white florals. Gorgeous Gardenia is a young fragrance with a sweet fruitiness which is sure to appeal to the young female consumers.

It's interesting to note that Gorgeous Gardenia was the only Flora Garden flanker to be discontinued and re-released in different packaging. Perhaps this decision from Gucci was due to the fact that this was one of their best sellers. I can almost understand the appeal, however I find Gucci Premiere a much nicer white floral scent if I had to pick a floral fragrance from this house.

Sadly I find Gorgeous Gardenia a little bland when compared to the many other floral fragrances that currently line the department store shelves. The original Flora by Gucci is still my personal choice, followed by the very pretty Gucci Premiere.",11/22/17 21:24,missk

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Expensive ""soap"" similarly as other ones in this series. When I first sniffed bottle I imagined pretty feminine woman in nice dress and in her 20s. I tried it and first 15 minutes it was soapy candy with sunny floral in background. In next minutes it became more and more soap with synthetic touch. At this moment because so synthetic it started to slightly remind grandma perfumes. It lasted maybe 30 minutes, after that I need to put my nose close to my skin. After a hour there was almost nothing left. Can't feel there any specific flowers, all soap are somewhat same for me.

This is a good one if you are in to young, romantic, light, sweet, medium warm, soap perfumes. Would be nice for summer and if not used too much then wont bother much anyone around. I don't see this perfume as compliment gatherer. I like and dislike this perfume.

Those accustumed to more complex, niche compositions may find it somewhat boring and generic. 2. It lasts a couple of hours on your skin, which is a shame for its price. Sillage is also moderate to low. All in all, Gorgeous Gardenia is a very pretty scent but rather weak & pale compared to ...ummm...more sophisticated fragrances on the market. I enjoy wearing my 30 ml of this baby but I won't repurchase it",12/22/16 08:00,Loredana0108

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"The combination in this is beautiful! On my skin this fragrance stays sweet the whole time, but doesn't get sticky or cloying. There is a certain maturity about it's sweetness - and that makes it stand out.
The aroma stays mostly the same from beginning to drydown and doesn't cahnge much.
I do however feel that this is not quite a perfume for young girls - it is more for a grown up woman and someone who wants to be taken more seriously.
Sillage is good on me and longevity also, but you have to be careful not to overspray.",10/10/16 10:05,senalica
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Such a lovely smell, created with gardenia and pear notes. It's so gentle, dreamy, feminine - gorgeous. Too bad the sillage is so soft and it doesn't last too long.",09/28/16 22:39,dyaver
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Flora Gorgeous Gardenia on me lasts long (7 hours plus) with moderate sillage for 3 hours, an uplifting gardenia/frangipani/red berries combo, sweet but not annoyingly sweet, refreshing, dreamy, makes me think of dew on gardenias, jasmines bushes in a garden with fruit trees nearby. Lovely, can be used in summer and in cool temps also,",09/24/16 08:30,socorrosouza
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Ugh. I didn't know this had pear.

I swore to the moon and back that I didn't like Pear in fragrances, but this is my faaaavvvvvvorite perfume ever. EVER.

The longevity and sillage is soft, not the best. 2 hours max. But this smell makes my eyes sparkle. When I look into my eyes in the mirror having just put this on, my eyes seem to be the windows to my soul! (corny but true!) It's like this smell defines everything I want emphasized about myself.

Just a cheerful, beautiful smell. Elegant, bright, like the hope in cold winter, the light summer breeze. It's everything to me lol.

It is a heavenly white floral with that inital blast of berries.

I also compared this to Viva La Juicy. I still like this better.

And nah, I wouldn't say this is the truest representation of a gardenia. It's embellished with all the other goodness. The way it makes me feel is unexplainable to an extent. But gosh. I just love this. Loooove.",09/23/16 21:41,cara94

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This is a such a beautiful sent! It’s floral, fruity sweet but fresh. It opens up with sharp flower. The sharpness smell might come from a laundry sent, like freshly washed cotton but it’s probably the red berries. This is what makes it special and not a normal fruity, floral sent. Then under that you smell the fruit, a sweet fruit. The sweetness isn’t overwhelming, but it’s there. It calms down in a sweet, warm sent but it still has that fresh berries somewhere.

If this were a woman I would see a fashionable one with a minimalistic but girly style, she doesn’t scream for attention but everyone recognise her sweetness and she’s impossible to not like. Something about her is like almost magnetic, it’s something that you can’t find anywhere and is impossible to let go of.

This is indeed a special sent, the red berries is so enchanting and reacts beautiful with the fruity florals. My 2 go 2 and all time favourite. Easy wear and not heavy. But still last 6-8 hours. Recommend this to everyone!",06/19/16 03:30,Kt_38
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I just spent a gorgeous weekend in Miami - warm sea breeze, tropical turquoise water, enchanting orchids, plumeria and jasmine growing on every block, but what struck me most was the scent hanging in the air and projecting from the beautiful ladies on the beach. It was sweet yet fresh with a slight crispness. At the airport DutyFree, I looked for a fragrance that would remind me of my Miami holiday, and this is the one I found. All of the scents of the beach, the sea, and the city seem to meld together into this harmony of a fragrance. You can smell the flowers growing on the sidewalk, the beautiful people walking by, the crispness of the sea breeze, and the warmth of the Miami air.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"What can I say? I couldn't believe in my nose! I am not a huge fan of Gucci perfumes although I found them great for the youth and not good enough due to their lasting power.

This perfume smells exactly like my first signature, Viva la Juicy La Fleur from Juicy Couture. I was so scared that my signature will be discontinued as it's hard to find in a Juicy Couture stand anymore, but now...who cares?

Delicious red berries, sheer and light white florals (gardenia actually), pear? Hmmm what about patchouli that I can't detect and frangipani that I am not familiar with? All I know is what I said. I should have been angry because of the copy of my favorite perfume, but to be honest can't wait to try it on my skin and examine it more.

I thought I wouldn't write a lot, but what I want to mention is that maybe I am growing, I am changing my taste in perfumes and why not try a similar one with a bit different notes? It's not scary, I wished that I will never change, but it's natural and maybe I like it.

I have a lot of trouble with floral sometimes and had thought Gardenia may be one of my trigger flowers. But for whatever reason on my skin I get hardly any Gardenia at all. I love that it's a sweet floral as opposed to a powdery one which I cannot handle. I love that it's fruity. I LOVE the way I feel wearing this scent. Happy the instant I smell it. It seems to last on me well. If you have trouble with florals you should give this one a sniff. Not offensive to me at all and my nose is SO sensitive.",05/03/16 11:54,RedFairy

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"What a pretty perfume! And I do think ""pretty"" is the word I'd use to describe it. It's giggly and fun, but not immature - it's sweet and feminine, but not syrupy. It manages to retain an air of youthfulness, while conveying sophistication.
I'm very pleased to have a little tester vial. I prefer it now that the weather is getting a little cooler, than in the summer, when the sweetness intensified on my skin. As previously mentioned, longevity is a little on the ho-hum side. (2.5 hrs on me.) I can stretch this ever so slightly longer if I apply a non-scented hand cream to my wrists prior to applying. I adore the pear and frangipane notes and am absolutely elated as always to find there is not a trace of my nemesis patchouli on my skin, even though it is listed as a note... YUSSS!
With its ""pretty"" price-tag, I'm not convinced it will find a home with me yet, based on its disappointing longevity primarily. I do give the scent a strong ""like"" rating though.",04/02/16 02:30,cstands

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I am very disappointed at this perfume.
I have recently bought it. I was looking for Dolce and Gabana
'L'imperatrice"", which is a perfect mixture of a playful and classy perfume for summer. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.

I tried this, which in the beginning gives the impression that it's fruity. But when I got home I wore it and got shocked: there got to be a problem in the mixture. THE FRUITY and FLOWERY SCENT ARE AT ODDS with each other. There is no exquisite transition between the two.

Also, it fades quickly, leaving a smell of flowers. I am not really into flowery scents.

Too expensive for an eau de toilette, and too unsophisticated for a Gucci perfume.",03/08/16 22:42,Yasmeena
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"In the beginning I can smell some fruitiness but it soon turns into rich and full white flower. So that's got to be gardenia. It's very classy and beautiful, almost fresh white flower scent.

I don't love the patchouli in this so it won't be my everyday frag; however this is lovely for the spring months in NYC when the cold starts to thaw and the sun comes out after the dark winter months.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Gucci could have mass-marketed a modern composition featuring the bodacious gardenia flower to captivate younger consumers and entice those of us who love gardenia already, BUT NO - this house had to release some played-out fruity/floral composition (a la Viva La Juicy) and tack the ill-fitting name, ""Gorgeous Gardenia"" to it...in 2012. (???)

I would have thought (hoped) this would be a sort of entry-level gardenia-dominant scent along the lines of the easy-to-like Generous Violet that Gucci released. Generous Violet was definitely violet-y, but was well-balanced and soft enough to appeal to those new to violet fragrances and established violet-lovers, too. Why couldn't that structure have been used in the creation of Gorgeous Gardenia? If there IS a hint of gardenia in this composition it is present only because I am willing it, with all my might, to appear underneath all the saccharine. Bummer and a fail (to my nose).",09/17/15 13:03,Peachysugarbuns
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I surprised myself by liking this. It's certainly reminiscent of Viva la Juicy and other heavily fruity florals and less of the traditional white floral than I expected. White floral gals, don't let the name fool you.

It may not be listed in the notes, but it smells suspiciously of caramel. Perhaps the sweet fruits just create that accord. I get mostly red berries and sugared gardenia petals.

I've worn it a couple of times and enjoyed it. My eyes don't water with elation at the thought of it.

Edit 10/12/15: The more I test this, the more I'm absolutely convinced that this shares the same aroma-chemical base as Viva La Juicy. Now, I personally like the smell. But I do find it a bit disconcerting that the major fragrance companies find it sufficient to take one ingredient and dump it in a perfume in large doses, without nuance or finesse, and then stick a hefty price tag on it. Forget fruits or flowers, this basically dries down to that single note I don't know the name of. This is where the caramel-like smoothness is coming from.",09/15/15 14:02,HanamiTsukimi
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This smells absolutely delicious. It is impossible to dislike this perfume. It is one of my new found favs. I have tested this many times before -but usually I have tested this on my clothing while out shopping along with about 30 other fragrances so for that reason it didnt shine or stand out to me for a while maybe it was overpowered by all the others. However a lady sat infront of me on public transport the other week and she smelt divine- i was so tempted to ask her what it was she was wearing as it smelt vaguely familiar-then it came to me like a lightbulb that it was gucci gardenia- so to cut a long story short i ended up buying this diamond that same day- luckily it was payday haha!

Anyway, ever since, i have been using this perfume for work along with special occassions- it is so fresh and fruity and somewhat aquatic also. It is such a beautiful fragrance to me. Pear being my favourite note- it is especially delicious- all pear lovers must purchase this! It makes me feel romantic spiritual optimistic and hopeful for the future- it is such a springy positive uplifting fragrance. I smell some slight tuberose in this too along with cranberry. I simply love it- it might be the pear bias- i dont know but this perfume is beautiful to me- it is in one of my top 5.

scent- 9/10
lasting time- 6.5/10
radiates-7/10
Packaging=7.5/10

Truly beautiful romantic spiritual hopeful inspiring scent.

Wouldn't say this one is directed towards young girls infact I would say it is more aimed at middle aged women. But it is beautiful for any age because it is beautifully blended and gorgeous. It epitomizes femininity.

Not that familiar to La fleur- only on first spritz the dry down is completely different. This lasts much longer and has better silage than la fleur and smells more floral and aquatic and is for an older audience.",09/05/15 15:34,polkadot27
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Maybe I'm crazy but I was expecting to smell a sort of Gardenia solifore when I tested this and instead I got a disappointingly generic fruity floral.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Was browsing today at perfumes (as usual) and decided I just wanted to spray something light and floral. Well as gardenia is one of my favourite scents I decided to go with this offering from Gucci. The name of the scent coupled with the plain but elegant bottle suggested to me this would just be a nicely done almost one note perfume of gorgeous gardenia. If that is what you are looking for then this is most definitely NOT it!! In fact I struggled to positively identify ANY gardenia in this at all. Imagine my disappointment.

This is another example of getting the advertising completely wrong, this is not for gardenia lovers. What I did get was quite a dense perfume with a 'masculine' vibe. Quite spicy, with a syrupy rather generic floral note (could've been anything quite honestly). A strong one when first sprayed but unfortunately didn't last all that long on me, maybe 3 hours at best.

I agree with the reviewers who are likening this to 'Viva la juicy', also pretty much all the Nicki Minaj perfumes (they are indistinguishable from one another to me) plus lots of others that have followed the syrup floral trend, but this one has a masculine vibe added and a dollop of spice/patchouli. I didn't altogether dislike it but the 'Gardenia' in the title seems to be for decorative purposes only.

Would not recommend anyone paying the asking price, extraordinarily run of the mill and smells more like a celeb fragrance, not bashing them I love some celeb fragrances but this is no better quality and not as good as some tbh. All in all a disappointment, if u like it save your money and pick up 'Pink Friday' or Viva la Juicy instead, both of those lasted longer on my skin.",08/10/15 09:54,Isobela

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Gardenia. Are you kidding me?
If (like me) you are happily wishing to smell a clear, heady, green and fantastic gardenia, then forget about it before this perfume crushes all your dreams.
This is a sweet fragrance, a mash of ""berries"" and pear plus a spoonful of sugar, and then some sugar, finished by more sugar.
Yes, this may appeal to some, but to me this is deceptive. first of all because the name is misleading. And even worse, the gardenia never arrives. NEVER!! I swear this felt as if I was stood up by a flower! where is she???

It doesn't smell gardenia at all!
It is pleasant, but so artificial! A fruity floral like so many out there.
I think that Gucci went a downhill and never recovered. I was never a fan, but quality has become worse.
Gorgeous Gardenia is a nice feminine fruity floral scent with good staying power, a vague smell of frangipane among the mess and as a final result it can be worn easily as a light scent and you will perhaps receive compliments. It has the fabric of the 2010s crowd-pleaser: non-descriptive.
You will smell ""girl"", clean, floral with only a tiny drydown of generic musky-something.

It's much more interesting than the others in the line that I smelled. Unfortunately it's an eau de toilette, so it probably doesn't last very long, which is ridiculous considering the price.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Sweet red berries paired with creamy pear on a sugary base with light patchouli and a little musk. More fruity than floral, by several orders of magnitude. Gardenia? Not really, but gardenia is more a matter of interpretation, and in this instance, it is a sadly sexless affair. Innocent, not sultry; abstract and pretty, no traces of anything remotely animalic or indolic.

It has the sugar musk base I associate with celebrity scents, BBW and VS, but slightly refined and elevated. A pretty, soft, sweet fruity floral, with decent longevity. office safe and linear, but dependable and consistent. If you are looking for gardenia, look elsewhere.",12/31/14 06:35,Cybernoir

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"After using such fragrances as Annick Goutal's Gardenia Passion, I just want to chuckle and pat this little number on the head! First, there is not a whit of gardenia in it. At all. Second, it is derivative of at least 2 very popular fragrances out there: almost as if Angel and Flowerbomb had a baby! The kind of out there bittersweet of Angel plus the rather soft baked sugar cookie with maybe some floral candle burning near the counter, maybe near that some birthday bouquet. And about half way to the drydown, I swear I smell cherry popsicle, until that drifts away and dark cocoa is left on the burner.

I have to say this is my 2nd review of the Gucci Flora set and I'm thinking the Magnolia is better but still, awfully derivative of the popular creations one might find INCLUDING the Britney crapola you can get (seriously just Fantasy in a nicer label/bottle).

I'm sticking to my Gucci Rush, at least with that it's with me all day and I feel the coriandre was JUST crushed moments ago and on the counter next to a bowl of peaches and cream (and vetiver, and rose)...",12/01/14 23:24,jessora

Is perfect for day or night, I dont like gardenia, and dosent smells like, is a perfect ladish in a bottle, just love it ,,, rOmantic , elegant, femenine,sexy, master piece!! goshhh too much!!",07/21/14 17:19,jessica.rios
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This is my first love in a perfume, can't remember ever loving a perfume before this (like your first boyfriend/girlfriend), and it has to be the first proper, grown up perfume I owned as well. I convinced myself I needed it as the number of times I would regularly go into Boots to spray it on myself before owning was actually rediculous haha.

In terms of the smell, it's fruity and contains another scent I cannot detect apart from the pear/apple (guessing it's the gardenia or patchouli as I have no idea what they smell like?). For an EDT, the lasting power is amazing. This lasts pretty much all day for me.

I'm still in love after having this for 1/2 years with the classy, clear hexagonal bottle and the feminime pink perfume liquid. The bow under the spray is cute too, but gets annoying as when you pull the lid off, it can take the bow off as well.

EDIT: Rang out of this at the end of the summer and I NEED IT SO BADLY, this juice really is gorgeous. Since it's on sale at Boots and Debenhams, it's making me want to justify buying it when I already have enough perfumes :/",07/07/14 09:23,emtopaz

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Not a gardenia fragrance, but still a good one. GG is the first perfume I loved and purchased, and to put it frankly, I got bored after a few times wearing this, so fruity, so sweet and girly, like flowers soaked in sugar, still like it but not me at all; so I just put it in the corner and forget about it.
When I came home one day, bringing a few paper tester for my mum and asked if she liked those. To my surprise, she asked me why I didn't wear GG anymore? It smells so good on me and it's the scent that she loved most.
So that's why I come back to gorgeous gardenia. And fell in love with it again. So subtle, so fresh and lovely. Gorgeous Gardenia is a young quiet pretty girl, not loud or stand out from the rest, but still a lovely friend that you can count on.
This is the one that I will always reach out when I don't know what to wear. GG would never be my signature scent, but always be a must-have in my perfume collection.",04/20/14 07:01,Cielo163
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,all i get is sweet cherry pear. no floral. i think this is definitely an under 25 yr old fragrance. i imagine a young girl 18 wearing this with jeans. casual. i honestly think its a little trashy. i think its all the cherry on me. maybe if the cherry showed up less on me it wouldnt remind me so much of young girl trying to get laid. i bet my husband would like this fragrance. i think more business casual. or if you are in sales or an account manager. i think on the right girl it could be pleasant its just a little too young and cherry on me.,04/17/14 05:57,blackw0lfx

The result: sweet gorgeous gardenia.",02/23/14 18:38,michelle.p.stpierre
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I completely agree the opening of this smells ALOT like Viva La Juicy without the caramel dry down. Viva La Juicy has a strong caramel dry down which, in my opinion, makes it perfect for year round wear... BUT this fragrance has the sweet dry down of gardenias and sugar which makes it perfect for spring and summer wear. It is definitely more ""sophisticated"" than Juicy... This fragrance also has the stronger floral fragrance which triggers headaches for me. For this reason I will stick with Juicy because the sweet caramels water down the florals making it more bare able for my head. However, I do love both of these! Just wish I didnt get the headaches!",02/16/14 10:34,chrissyc15
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"This is a grown up version of Viva La Juicy, if you feel silly wearing that one. Bottle looks more grown up for us over fifties. But they are both lovely. Usually Patchouli turns me off, it must be very subtle here, I wouldn't have suspected it as a note. Can't go wrong with this, good and safe for the office.

Not much of a drydown on me, the sugary gardenia stays until its all gone. Can't say I can smell the aquatic note anywhere. Wich for me is a good thing;)

Longevity is poor (on my scent-eating skin) and so is the sillage. But this one gets compliments from others :)",02/05/14 09:44,Lill Kaja

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"i do agree. it is a light hearted and longer lasting VLJ to me. i don't own either but have sampled both and i kinda like this better. it comes off as a fun loving and happy. i like the very crisp pear note in the beginning it eventually gave way to a sweet gardenia note.. very pleasant and reminds me of a young woman during spring who is free and happy without a care in the world.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"On me this smells almost exactly like Viva La Juicy, but VLJ has sweeter notes (because of the caramel I think?) and this one is a bit more floral. However, the longevity of Gorgeous Gardenia is horrible. After 1 hour, I couldn't smell anything. Although this is an EDT, I don't think this is a good representative of a typical Gucci perfume. I have the Guilty EDT and it lasts a lot longer. The smell is nice and pleasant but I had to return it because of the similarity and the disappointing longevity.",01/23/14 00:09,Eirlys
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"As for Glamorous Magnolia, I'm disappointed that this perfumes ends on a heavy sugary base. And has nothing to do with its name. The base notes ruin it for me.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"It starts very pleasantly, with sweet notes, suitable for a sweet girl. However, after some time, on my skin it develops into very subtle, ladylike scent, perfect for a young lady. Moreover, base note is really magic, delicate sugary patchouli. I will definitely add this fragrance into my 'want list':)

Update: I've tested it again today and I am deeply impressed. What a charming scent! I am in love with it.

Update2: I've tested it once more to check if it is not too sweet in high temperatures. Happily, it is not! However, patchouli can be really intoxicating in warm environment, so it is important not to over-spray in hot summer.

Update3: final test in mid summer: it smells like a blooming garden! Awesome.

Update4: I've bought it and I have to say that it smells good either in high or low temperature. It is suitable for all seasons. Rare feature.",12/29/13 07:59,Arlene-Beatrix
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"Unfortunately, to my nose, it's very linear. All I get is extremely sweet gardenia. I was hoping in the dry down I would get some of the patchouli, but not on me. Still, you can smell the expensive, if that makes any sense.",12/25/13 11:08,Clws
Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"I find it very girly. It's sweet, fruity floral and youthful. There is a similarity to Viva la Juicy but this one is much better.

Flora by Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia Gucci,"If this scent was a lady she'd be: elegant,composed, always polite never rude,stylish and sophisticated, and is the epitome of a sweetheart. The kind of lady everyone loves and wants to be, She has that classic beauty e.g Kate Middleton, Grace Kelly or Audrey Hepburn.

So the hunt began. In Debenhams I find this little beauty, 10-15% off its original price of approx £75,(approx $120-$125) paid like £65 (approx $106) for a 100ml bottle, (3.4 ounce); I was sold could not resist. It has a subtle sweetness I've never come across like it before, maybe because I'm used to a sweetness of Britney Spears Fantasy range. Subtle sexy classy, feminine, just what I wanted and needed for stage I'm at in my life. I've never gotten so many compliments wearing a perfume as I have with GGG. It is sweet, but it is a grown up subtle sexy sweetness, not cloying at all. Very versatile scent, easily could be worn: to work, to class, cosy night in, on a night out or on a romantic date. It is a 'close to skin scent', but that is what makes it sexy, because it isn't so evident and out there like a lot of scents out on market.

I actually did a comparison at Macy's yesterday...I smelled this perfume (I keep a sample vial in my purse) and then smelled Ralph Lauren Blue. You can smell the fruit in the Gucci perfume. It's a good gardenia scent that's not too old lady-ish and over powering.

This Nymph is very opulent. Material- thick tropical white-yellow honey. It has lipstick olfactory sensation...
Perfumes that are in the same family (but better):
Chanel Beige (it's much more transparent, playful, higher vibration, boheme)
Vesper Glitz Ex Nihilo- it's bright, joyful life celebration. Very sparkly and high toned.

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"As someone who grew up in a tropical country with a large frangipani tree in the front yard, this fragrance reminds me more of mimosa than anything else. Frangipani itself doesn’t smell this sweet, creamy, or indulgent. Its natural scent is airy, light, and delicately sweet—almost as subtle as water. Jo Malone’s Frangipani captures that authenticity beautifully and is the closest to the real flower I’ve encountered. I haven’t smelled tiare or ylang-ylang in their natural forms, so I can’t speak to their influence here, but this fragrance doesn’t evoke the true essence of frangipani to me.",01/17/25 16:13,Fleurie20
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I thought this would be right up my street as I love frangipani and tiara flower, but I find the ylang ylang is overpowering in this scent. If this had been swapped out for coconut im sure it would be divine. The ylang ylang makes it smell a bit plastic and overpowering at first. This is a perfume that you really need to let settle for a good few minutes. Once this dries down, it actually has a beautiful tropical flower scent. It smells very much like Hea Poi monoi oil to me. I still feel this is way overpriced for what it is. It’s a nice/pretty perfume, there is a uniqueness about it, but nothing special.",10/23/24 11:00,CaroleAnne81
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I was lucky enough to test this one out at the local Gucci boutique today. Upon first spray, you are greeted with a bouquet of photorealistic tropical flowers: thick, oily, sweet and heady. The overall perfume, however, does not smell especially tropical at all. It lacks the coconut, sandy amber, or sunscreen notes that usually accompany such flowers as plumeria, Ylang, and tiare. Presenting these flowers in this botanical, under embellished way is quite unique and unexpected.
I placed the test ribbon down for a minute to test the other perfumes in the Alchemist Garden Collection. When I returned to it, my nose was graced with another photorealistic scent: blue cheese. Yes, a high quality blue cheese I'm certain (this is Gucci), alongside the now muted tropical florals. I instantly knew the culprit: an unlisted osmanthus note. I own a small sample of the natural absolute at home. At first sniff, it is quite pleasant, displaying fruity-floral facets reminiscent of apricots, honey and white flowers. As the absolute dries, however, it develops fungal, buttery, laconic nuances absolutely characteristic of the aforementioned cheese. That is the case here, and I wouldn't be surprised if Gucci is using an all natural osmanthus absolute, as this material is not exorbitantly expensive. Unfortunately, I never made it to the perfume's dry down, as my nose couldn't tolerate this note longer.
If Gucci's intent was to capture the most natural, three dimensional, representation of these flowers without any cliche synthetic ingredients to distract: they have succeeded in leaps and bounds. This is perhaps the only perfume I've encountered, however, that leans too natural. I believe a synthetic osmanthus accord might have worked better, or perhaps none at all.
While blue cheese is absolutely delicious and pairs wonderfully with honey and apricots, it is not something that I especially want to smell like.",09/16/24 20:22,Justin Ninja

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I agree with Marialena888 below--I haven't smelled the Gucci OG, although I had samples of Gorgeous Gardenia and was less than impressed, although I didn't dislike it--and so everything I am saying about this fragrance applies to the Maison Alhambra impression, in its equally beautiful bottle with its luxe trappings and its bald appropriation of the brand name. To my nose, The Chant smells like a creamier, yellow-floral take on Elizabeth Taylor Gardenia, which will sound like a slight unless you read my rave review of it. I think Gardenia is my all-time favorite bargain white-floral soliflore (not really a soliflore so much as a slightly abstracted impression of the gardenia). At any rate, I get the holy yellow-flower trifecta with The Chant, which is to say frangipani, ylang-ylang, and tiare (orange blossom might have worked too), and I get it in sufficient doses that I simply can't imagine needing the overpriced original of this, even though I love the pretentiousness of its Mallarméan name. The Chant might be a streamlined version, for all I know, but it doesn't seem like a reduction. You get what you're promised with this bold and boisterous island queen.

On another note, please, please, please fix it so that the horrible pop-up mattress ads stop. Believe me when I say that it is counterproductive as a marketing tactic. The interruptions every 15 seconds just make me want to stop reading and posting reviews or otherwise interacting with this site. I can say with the utmost confidence that I am never ever ever ever ever ever ever going to buy one of those mattresses.

It’s well-blended, yes. But it gives me a headache. It’s quite a powdery floral, and quite strong, especially that first blast. I get zero tropical vibes. It does eventually calm down, but it’s just lacking wow factor for me (or maybe it just doesn’t suit my personality and taste??).

I wish I could feel the same as all the other reviewers here who love it… I mean it does cost like a million dollars for a Gucci perfume, so at this point I’m trying to force myself to like it.

It’s luxurious but not meant to be treasured for only special occasions. I can imagine myself wearing this first thing in the morning and last thing before I go to bed.

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I have a fantastic clone of it by Maison AlHambra called ‘The Chant’, even the bottles look similar. It’s overpowering at first (pure loud FRANGIPANI), but after it settles, it smells like an exclusive bouquet of creamy, buttery tropical flowers, frangpani, ylang and tiare, with abit of warmth and sweetness from (non-gourmand) vanilla…the tiare and vanilla combination may come off abit coconutty, like freshly shredded coconut. I also detect an unlisted turmeric root or curcumin note in the background, adding a mild bitter-sweet-spiciness. It’s a STRONG scent and can be headache inducing (it does soften considerably after about an hour), do not overspray, it lingers almost the entire day too, especially when sprayed on fabric. I don’t think it smells particularly beachy, but it does bring to mind beautiful island girls wearing leis. It smells like something that Guerlain and Lush would collab and release, if you can imagine that, naturalistic Lush-style raw floral scent, but with that powdery Guerlain-esque feel in the drydown. Very feminine, sensual and mature. Not worth the Gucci money for me…if you really like this scent but can’t afford it, get the clone, it’s disgustingly fabulous for the price. I do like tropical florals, and this is a very straightforward, intensive, and luxurious one, no fruits, no woods, no citrus, just straight up flowers with a tiny pinch of vanilla and spice. If you enjoy Guerlain’s Terracotta, Lush’s Lust or Sikkim Girls, you will most likely enjoy this (and it’s clone) too.",05/02/24 10:00,marialena888m

I'm not saying the fragrance is bad; it's actually very well composed, comforting and people seem to like it, but there is that one floral note that makes me sick in an instant, and I can't help it. Don't think the fragrance has beachy/sunny vibes of e.g., Sol de Janeiro, Tom Ford's Soleil Blanc or Bvlgari Omnia Paraiba - it doesn't.

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"This is a really lovely perfume by Gucci! It smells very summery, sweet, floral and tropical. I could imagine a beautiful Hawaiian Hula dancer with long and shiny black hair, a grass skirt and a tiare and frangipani lei around her neck. The ylang ylang is quite noticeable too and it lends an indolic and banana-sweet loveliness to the composition. Finally, I'm treated to a warm embrace of sensual vanilla in the dry-down.

I wouldn't call this a photorealistic interpretation of any of the flowers herein, but I'd definitely say I can smell them and this is only slightly synthetic smelling. The frangipani is probably the least realistic of the notes, the ylang ylang and tiare being much more realistic in this one. Like an ylang ylang and tiare monoï oil, which is equal parts white and yellow floral.

I got moderate sillage and an 8 and a half hour wear from A Chant to the Nymph, which is quite good for a Gucci fragrance. I could imagine this being worn during the day in either spring or summer to more casual events or when you want to feel like it's summertime. I'd call this an incredibly feminine fragrance as well and the beautiful pink bottle this is housed in hints at that.

Altogether, I'd give A Chant for the Nymph a 8.3/10. I'd definitely reccomend this one, which is not something I'd say about most Gucci fragrances.",01/15/24 06:55,WhiteFlowerPrincess

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"This Gucci creation is such a beautiful tropical warm ever so slightly powdery holiday scent. I love frangipani, Ylang Ylang, Tiare flower and vanilla so this was absolutely a no brainer blind buy for me and I’m very happy!! It is very similar to Aerin Hibiscus Palm without the spicy ginger or lotus notes thatI struggled with in that fragrance. ACFTN is smoother and more luxurious as well, the luxury aspect may just be from that gorgeous bottle though! This is my new go to summer holiday/staycation scent. The only downside is that the staying power is extremely lacking for the high price tag but I love being in the scent bubble while it lasts.",12/13/23 23:51,harperpeshhe
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"The image that comes to my mind when I smell Gucci A Chant for the Nymph is the following one...
You are carefully kneeled before a large wooden chest of stored clothing relics from your mom... you open the lid and find tenderly folded on top a powder pink, dusty rose colored soft mohair sweater. You carefully pick up the sweater and gently nuzzle your nose and face into its cozy softness, and inhale... It is a dusty rose, soft mohair sweater, warm, mother's hug from yester-year. Beautiful, tender, soft, cozy, pale pink, dusty rose, comforting, and almost eerily nostalgic.",12/11/23 18:58,gpaisley
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"To start off, I want to say I was inspired to test this fragrance because, not only have I been curious about this line since it was announced, but I am a HUGE fan of Hwang Hyunjin and he once showed off his bottle of ACFTN and said he had to purchase it as soon as he smelled it. A pretty big endorsement for something he wasn't paid to promote.
I finally decided, since I have plans to visit Korea in the summer next year, I need to figure out which scent to bring, so this immediately came to mind and I needed to test it before shelling out the insane price tag.
At first whiff of the nozzle, I have to say, though it smelled how every review I'd seen had described it, I was still a bit surprised. This one, while beautiful, is not as unique as something I'd expect at this price point. This is a balmy, sweet fragrance of yellow florals heating up in the summer sun. It absolutely screams summertime, but not in that day-at-the-beach sort of way, though it definitely does have a suntan lotion element to it. This is not sporty or aquatic at all. I have heard some people say it smells like there's coconut in here, and though I definitely don't get coconut at all, the creaminess of the vanilla in the base makes this a very, almost syrupy, sweet scent and I can understand why they're confusing it for coconut. It's thick and rich, but not quite sticky. The star of the show really is that frangipani and the way it all heats up on the skin. For me, the scent really didn't have an effect for me until I tried it on and let it sit for a couple minutes. Working with my chemistry, it took on this almost lipsticky quality that was beautiful and really made ACFTN start to smell expensive. I sprayed it on around noon and it carried up until about 8 pm for me, so I definitely don't think it didn't last a good while, but that's just on my skin and personally, I don't need my perfume to last for 3 days to make me happy.
Now let's address the elephant in the room: the price point. I love Gucci as a fashion house, but I'll definitely admit, the price point is absolutely ridiculous. While I was at the counter, I did smell a few different offers from the line and I have to say, for almost $400, I was expecting a LOT more. I don't think any seasoned perfumehead will be overly impressed with this line. The fragrances are lovely and some are very strong, but they are all a bit too simple and reminded me of other fragrances I either own, have owned, or have smelled. I truly didn't find anything overly unique or groundbreaking. If this doesn't bother you and you just want something both beautiful and of quality, then I think you will appreciate this line for what it is, but if you are looking for something individualistic or a good bang for your buck, then I definitely would look into something either a little more niche or a designer fragrance with less streamlined notes and at a fourth of the cost.
Now for me, I think I still intend to invest in this one. It's currently winter and I don't think I am too put off by the price point that I wouldn't be willing to purchase this for a beautiful summer scent. Though it is not too unique, it worked wonders with my body chemistry and is likely something you won't be smelling on too many people. It can definitely work as an everyday fragrance for warmer climates. I do appreciate the bottle, I appreciate the love, care, and inspiration that went into this line, but I do wish at least the 5 different options I sampled were a bit more daring. I am going to opt not to rate this one as I normally would, as while I do like this fragrance and would like to wear more of it, I'm not able to say it's my favorite fragrance of all time or that it's worth the price I'm willing to pay for it. But to each nose, their own, and if this one drives you wild, then nothing I've said here matters. All I can say is, when I am able to order my first bottle, I know we'll be very happy, together.",12/10/23 23:47,LexiOD
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"A unique and refined floral, I find myself gravitating towards this scent when I’m in direct sunlight, the sun makes the heavenly flowers sing on my skin and it’s addictive 🤍 Intense tiare and frangipani with a light ylang, and a faint vanilla in the background that brings out the creaminess of the florals, GORGEOUS 🤍 I fall in love with this scent every time I wear it and I don’t think I can be without it, it brings me so much joy, it is sunshine in a bottle! Yes it doesn’t stay on for long but I am more than happy to overspray and keep spraying it on and immersing myself in this absolute olfactory delight again and again 😇",11/26/23 22:08,Scents4spirit

I will buy more decants in the future when I run out. I get the clean makeup powder note after dry down. It’s really nice.

Only lasts around 4 hrs, which, for the price, is very disappointing. If it lasted longer, I'd definitely recommend purchasing for the warmer months.",05/05/23 09:48,Ferra_Verto
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I got a sample of this, alongside guerlain’s Terracotta and Narciso ambree. I like this one a lot, but out of the 3 creamy tropical floral scents, A Chant has the weakest performance. Really beautiful while it lasts, though. The frangipani and tiare mainly come through for me. It’s a cooler scent than Terracotta, and I might like it more if it could just last on my skin. As beautiful as it is, it’s not worth it for the price imo",04/19/23 07:33,honeyoceans

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"This is a very upgraded/classic version of a summer perfume. The frangipani is far away from overpowering, is super creamy. The imagery that comes to mind is a fairytale princess during summer time, hanging out by a lake with her animal friends, decorating her hair with the lotus flowers 🌸 from the lake.
If you watched the 1941 version of Disney’s Fantasia, I am sure you remember the beautiful centaur girls. Now imagine them going on a beach holiday and the little angels spray their hair and ponytails before they expend a starry night at the beach with their boyfriends. This would be their perfume.
This is really expensive (for me that is) so is not on my buying list. But if I ever received a bottle I would gladly wear it.

But then The Perfume guy mentioned this in one of his YouTube videos and then I also found it on sale (which never happens where I’m at) and just took it as a sign and I took the plunge…

I like to sometimes sample perfumes in this price range out of curiosity, none have ever really impressed me but a girl can and will try, for fun.",05/05/22 09:21,kkaattjjeess
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"A real tropical wowser. Creamy, coconutty (no coconut just the florals though) indolic, a real lush, tropical flower vibe. Very fresh too, and somehow you can feel the sunshine it has a warmth to it. Maybe just associations. Also a little graininess which I think is the ylang. I was tempted to say there is something old school about it, I think the creaminess of the florals, I could have guessed some tuberose also. I know someone who is going to absolutely love this scent, I think this has to be your genre to truly appreciate it. I do love my tropicals but more the fruity green kinds, less the indolic and salty or coconutty genre.

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"This has a definite holiday in a hot country vibe, like being surrounded by tropical flowers in 30°C+ weather and wearing suncream by the pool, but in a coconutty way rather than chemicals. It is very heavy for a floral, and somehow manages to give me a slight headache which is the first time a perfume has ever managed to do that!

It reminds me a bit of Burberry London, which I guess is the tiare flower? I don’t get much ylang ylang, but the vanilla and frangipani are there. It’s thick, creamy, oily and sweet. I could see this being worn all year round, as it’s warm enough to be worn in colder weather as a reminder of tropical summer holidays.

It is quite linear as others have said, very feminine, but I don’t have such a problem with projection and longevity. One spray on my wrist is enough to suffocate me for the whole day! It’s definitely a unique scent, in my collection at least, but it’s gorgeous. The bottle is stunning and I love having it sat on my desk in the box, but unfortunately something about it does make me feel ill and it’s too expensive to keep for the sole purpose of being a decoration, so I’ll have to part with it☹️",03/25/22 09:46,bel 1

For me, this is a luxurious and comforting slightly powdery interpretation of 60's doll head meets Tipanie Monoi Oil meets a subtle grape-y bubblegum. It smells like modern take of a wealthy jet set woman in the 1960's all dolled up for vacation somewhere tropical--white eyeliner rimmed waterline, mascara on the lower eye lashes, pale pink lipstick, Monoi Oil on the skin and the hair volumized big. This isn't the local beauty of tropical places like Coqui Coqui Fleur Des Ilhes but a very beautiful visitor.",11/04/21 13:47,calesalad

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"Very beachy & tropical scent. Something to wear to a beach resort, if that’s your type of thing. It’s interesting enough but difficult to wear for most occasions. I think most people who aren’t actively thinking of the notes would interpret this as sunscreen, though in subtle ways its more complex than that. There is something enchanting about it as it dries down, but I’ll have to see how long it lasts.",06/10/21 21:59,KladfvbungMicshk
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I agree with other reviews that this fragrance is more on the subtle side. Upon the first spray, you get a wonderfully creamy frangipani note, that then settles down to a warm skin-like scent, that smells like you've just spent the sunny afternoon laying in a field of tropical flowers, and slathering yourself in sunscreen. It's also a simple, linear fragrance, that sadly only lasts for an hour or so.

While the scent is genuinely nice, this is extremely overpriced. Right now, I can't find a bottle anywhere for less than $299. Honestly, I don't even think I'd buy this for $50. The scent is pleasant enough, but it isn't anything special, in my opinion, and the performance of the fragrance is sadly lacking.",05/21/21 09:10,americanablonde
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"A subtle creamy yellow floral fragrance. Stays fairly linear but its well composed and very pretty, would be nice for layering in the spring or summer. Doesn't last at all neither does it project much. Maybe if you spray half the bottle you'll get whiffs of it for an hour. I can see the similarity with terracotta but with less of a presence. Layers nicely with Soleil blanc or any nice warm skin scent (l'ambre de merveilles hermes or jpg classique). Pretty bottle and name but overall unimpressive on its own.",05/02/21 19:49,Sarinaamani

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I tried it a couple of months ago at Saks on the blotter and I loved it, it lasted on the blotter all day. This pink bottle grabbed my attention as soon as I saw it here on fragrantica and thought I would love to add it to my collection. It's expensive so is not something I would just go and buy out of the blue specially since I have so many perfumes and had made the decision to barely buy anymore. Well, the other day I decided I would buy it so I applied for the Saks credit card and got 10%off. When I received it I applied it and it didn't smell as good as on the blotter, also it didn't last at all, maybe 1 hour at most but could barely smell it. I tried again the next day and the same thing happened. I always apply on clothing also and it was not there either, even as much as I love the beautiful bottle, heavy metal pink cap and packaging I made the decision to return it even if I also lost the 10% off discount. I will reconsider buying it if they make an intense version of it that actually lasts longer.",04/15/21 17:47,COSMICSCENTS
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"I love this! I just wish so much that it wasn't quite so expensive... To my nose this is just a perfect creamy frangipani with a hint of vanilla. A couple reviewers below mentioned that it smelled like a creamy, oil like concoction and I 100% agree. This is like the best oily tropical flower vacation in a bottle. I wish this lasted a bit longer on my skin... It really fades away after about 3/4 hours. That being said, I did use a dabber sample; I wonder if it might last longer being sprayed?

Going off of memory, comparisons to other fragrances:

Soleil Blanc: Not so similar to my nose - this one doesn't have any of the sweet pistachio/coconut accords. Soleil Blanc is more edible and sweet and less floral to me.

Guerlain Terracotta: Definitely shares a similar vibe but this one is missing the coconut and jasmine in Terracotta. Terracotta's florals read very sweet jasmine on my skin. I love love love Terracotta too and i'm guess if you love one, you'd love the other.

Love Tuberose: Another of my all time favorites and definitely, again, similar creamy-sweet-floral vibe. This one has no tuberose and, on me, has less vanilla sweetness and more tropical flower sweetness (if that makes sense).

Beige: It's been ages since I've smelled it.... but I think I remember Beige being less tropical and more of a refined, easy going, every day floral. It's just more Chanel :)

Lastly, I wonder if anyone can compare this to Chantecaille's Frangipane? I haven't smelled in about 12 years... And, for that matter, i cant find it to purchase online anymore...",04/07/21 10:10,Abby512
A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"What a pretty name for a fragrance, and such beautiful packaging to go with it! I only bought the $20 sample, but even that comes in a lovely white linen-look case with gold engraving.

This definitely smells like summer. It has some suntan lotion vibes, and I also get the unmistakable hint of swimming pool smell, though it’s pleasant and not overwhelming.

The previous reviewer compared Chant for the Nymph to Terracotta, and I definitely see that similarity. However, Terracotta had some warm, doughy note that I personally found off-putting, and Nymph doesn’t have that note. To me, Nymph is the most similar to the discontinued Aqua Allegoria Lys Soleia (which also gets compared to Terracotta). I tried Nymph on my left arm at the same time as Lys Soleia on my right arm, and they were about 90% similar to my nose. They’re both sweet and summery in the same way. Lys Soleia was ever so slightly fresher, but I think most people would fail a blind smell test if they were trying to tell them apart.",04/02/21 09:13,CreamSunshine

A Chant for the Nymph Gucci,"What a gorgeous scent in a gorgeous bottle. Honestly, I’m not into pink but this bottle is literally beautiful.

From the bottle, a bit exotic and oily scent was strong (I guess it’s frangipani) but in some time after I sprayed it on my wrist, ylang-ylang and tropical flowers started to head up. It smells a little bit plasticky, but all those tropical/ exotic flower fragrances are covered by creamy vanilla, which makes this scent balanced and pretty.

It’s quite a simple and straightforward scent. It does not really change as the time goes by but I don’t mind.

The name of this perfume is also beautiful, and matches the fragrance perfectly. Wearing this makes me feel like I’m in a mythical, tropical forest with yellow flowers.",05/12/20 13:30,Eve Lee
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Limited Edition Gucci,"One thing that confuses me: my sample has a pear listed as the top note, and it is indeed very prominent when I spray it.

This was my mother's signature fragrance when I was a child, and I vividly remember when it was being discontinued, and we went around every perfume shop and department store in the area to purchase every last bottle we could find so she had a stockpile for a couple of years.

My mum passed in March and I picked up a couple of minis off Ebay to smell for the memories, and gosh, not only is it so nostalgic to me, but it is just a gorgeous, warm, sticky, deep syrupy fragrance. My mum was a fruitchouli woman through and through and this is an incredible fruit and patchouli combo with lashings of honey. I wish Gucci did not discontinue this, not only does it smell incredible, it also performs great.

Unimpressed when I tried this a decade ago, but it’s grown into a love over time. The pear balances the guava here, rounds and softens the fruitiness, no sharp edges. The tiare flower is gorgeous, creates a wonderful sillage in high heat. The combo of patchouli, honey, and musk could resemble the skank experienced on day 3 of a music festival but not here. Instead, perfumer Ilias Ermenidis works some alchemy to create a clean, yet earthy, second skin effect. Big love for me.",08/03/23 07:26,Photojenchick

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Scent and memory is an amazing thing. I had a sample of this way back in the day and I can still remember almost exactly how this smelt today. It's an amazingly beautiful fragrance and I wish I could get my little paws on a full sized bottle right now, especially since my nose has matured and even though I love the sweet and balanced fragrances, I love some of the mature styles too.

This is like a dark dreamy forest where magical and mythical classic book fairytales come to life (this is what I picture as the memory of this scent is so enchanting many pleasant surreal things spring to mind). There is something mysterious and haunting about this perfume and almost something slightly edible. This is perfectly balanced and ideal for both men and women. The patchouli isn't nasty or harsh/overpowering, every note is beautifully complimentary in perfect harmony.

When people say this reminds them of Britneys Believe they definitely mean the original formula (with the metal plate) the new version of believe isn't as lush or deep. Original Believe is so beautiful as well 😍",02/14/23 20:29,Tammyrobins7
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Absolutely lovely. Warm, comfortable, and inviting, also grown up and well blended in the extreme. The patchouli here reminds me of that in Gucci Guilty and also Jimmy Choo. It's not a green patchouli, as in Coco Mademoiselle, but has a greenery about it, possibly owing to the guava.... Not sweet, not bitter, not sharp or tangy or tart to my nose. Just perfect! If you want to create a perfectly blended patchouli, this is your model.",02/08/23 11:59,drugstore classics
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci Gucci does have a hippie vibe. Heavy on the patchouli but it is still wearable. The honey and fruity notes keep it fun and youthful. I agree w/ @Favabeans This is the fruitachouli mothership. A good way to describe this perfume. It isn't something I would buy now. I have enough fruitachouli's, they were something that was easy to get my hands on when I started collecting 2 years ago so the vibe here is a little played out for me, but they are wearable and crowd pleasing. That is why I own quite a few of them. You can wear them anywhere and around anybody most of the time. This reminds me of Judith Leiber's Topaz which I already have but I like Topaz more.",01/22/23 11:38,LSAUG
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Smells like a glamorous hippie. Totally captures the Gucci essence, I can see Zoe Kravitz or Florence Welch smelling like this. This is extremely patchouli heavy and to my nose the fruitiness is fleeting or not there at all. Ordered a sample of this being that it's compared to one of my faves - Britney Spears 'Believe'. While the similarities are there with patchouli and guava, they are not the same. This one is way heavier, more mature, and suited for colder temperatures, whereas Believe is more refreshing and sweeter with the added clementine and better for warmer months. Since this is discontinued, I'm wondering if my juice went bad because I have tried this with sprays to the wrist and projection and longevity is weak to my nose.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"DISCONTINUED FRAGRANCE REVIEW
NO.#12 / 10.

This is Britney Spears' ""Believe"" cashed-up auntie.
BS's (hehehe) ""Believe"" is a green, heavy, guava-and-earthy patchouli scent. ""Gucci"" is the same - just heavier with some honey.

I got a used bottle from eBay (because... Auntie's discontinued) and, as such, only spray it occasionally.

The green guava scent adds a decent amount of sweet juiciness, and the patchouli *really* grounds it (an 'earthy' pun? What a win). The patchouli is wildly noticeable here, so if you hate patchouli; it's pretty much guaranteed you'll hate this. Tiare flower is a more tropical flower, but...I honestly don't find this perfume particularly tropical as such. The honey is quite the nice and is absolutely most noticeable in the dry-down. It certainly mingles with the ever-present patchouli.
It's a heavy (probably because of that patchouli and white floral tiare flower) womanly scent that's kind of reminiscent of ""Ricci Ricci"" (not scent-wise at all), and the added sweet, luscious honey makes me think of a wealthy aunt who gives bear hugs and loans her over-the-top jewelry.

By the sounds of things, this used to be a powerhouse, but my bottle isn't. I can smell it, but it would never gas out a room of people. Unless I spray like an unchecked garden hose, it settles to a skin scent in half an hour.

Damn sturdy bottle. It's a good weapon for catapulting at your opponents.

Overall, not really my kind of scent. At least not until I become an aunt who wears tiares (see what I did there?) and chunky bracelets. But - hey - there's still time.

P.S. Is anyone else a little bewildered by all the scents by Gucci called...""Gucci""? How many do we need? Can we get a team together who can conjure up some more original names? I suggest someone in marketing.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This legendary one time beauty was inexplicably discontinued a few years ago. Found a genuine bottle from 2018, but alas, it's an incredibly watered down reformulation. A shadow of its former self. This used to be a thick and heavy room filler with just a single spray, and it would last for ages. This version lasts one hour, two hours tops, and even grossly overspraying won't help. No, it's not my memory, nor is it my nose. Just read the reviews below. Many are experiencing the same thing. Those with great performance are the people with vintage bottles.

Fruity, honeyed patchouli that is to die for. Well, at least it was, once upon a time. THE most intoxicating, most glamorous and sexiest scent I have ever smelled on a woman.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I used it a long time ago, although it is no longer produced, I found it somewhere and bought it. It opens with guava and pear. I feel a very intense sharpness and sourness at the opening, the perfume turns into a beautiful and sophisticated honey scent as it stays on the skin. With patchouli, the perfume gets rid of being too sweet. Frankly, I don't like the opening because I get a sour/metallic feel, but then it turns into a really nice smell. It's a unique scent for me. It is neither too fruity nor too sweet nor too woody. I like it more in winter, but it can be used in summer evenings by paying attention to the number of sprays.",02/14/22 02:16,hazi
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"There must be batch differences or people’s perceptions are vastly different. I have a tester purchased in 2021. This could never be described as “light” or “fruity” in general to me. It is a heavy patchouli fragrance with thick guava. Not sweet or fresh. 8/10 only because this is a very formal scent, requires cold weather and the right occasion with good ventilation.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Unlike any perfume I’ve been able to find, I’m so sad it’s discontinued, and I’ve resorted to buying from eBay. I’m not sure how someone has managed to buy a reformulated one, unless I’ve missed something? I’ve used this since it’s release, and there was only one version and then it was discontinued, and is no more. Eden perfumes do a similar scent called Bye Goochi, but it’s not quite the same (although the dry down is very very similar, so it will have to do when I can’t source it anymore!).
Th EDTof this is my signature, wear anywhere, any time scent. It matches any outfit, work, date, sleep, it’s sooo versatile. I love the EDP too, but the EDT beats if for me, as the dry down is slightly fresher, both are amazing though and I have back up bottles of both!
I’m not a fan of Gucci in general, I quite like bamboo and once used a bottle of it after a blind buy on a plane, but gucci by Gucci is such a stunning scent, so well put together I don’t even have words to describe how it smells. For those saying it doesn’t last maybe it’s a bit of noseblindness? As although the sillage isn’t huge, this lasts so long on me, I can literally smell it the day after I’ve sprayed it. Love it.
Edit: I can still smell this as a skin scent the day after I sprayed it, the edt has gone though.

Edit. Just adding that I’ve bought this perfume regularly since it’s release. There has been no difference between my vintage bottles from the time of release or the newer ones I’ve bought or been gifted in 2018, 2019 and 2020. I’ve bought many, many bottles of this and the EDT, and due to keeping back up bottles I can directly compare different years. These are my signature scent, I would know.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"(Here’s my Un-entertaining, all too long, painfully informative review here lol - please keep this in mind before reading on). Gucci by Gucci is pleasant in theory, definitely unisex, and I would love to have it as my boss-woman signature....but there’s no longevity. The scent disappears from my skin within 1 hour, and 2 hours if I have my skin covered with fabric where I sprayed the fragrance. Unacceptable. I have colognes that last longer. I had to double check to make sure they didn’t accidentally send me a Gucci by Gucci Eau de cologne. Nope. It definitely has EDP on the label. Overspraying does NOTHING to help the longevity, either. If I spray it anywhere skin has to Be exposed? Forget it. 1 hr MAX. My bottle was manufactured in 2018 with batch code 8016, so it is more than likely a dreaded reformulation (this is my first time trying this fragrance). How do people get such good longevity with this? Maybe I become anosmic to some patchouli heavy fragrances. Jimmy Choo EDP is the only patch-dominant fragrance that I can smell on my skin for 8+ hours. I definitely become anosmic to another patch, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle, after a couple of hours, and I discovered that on days when people were making pleasant remarks about my fragrance 6+ hours after I had applied Chanel Mademoiselle and I told them thanks, I could not smell it on myself at all - so that was very much a pleasant surprise that my scent was perceived by others in spite of me not being able to do so.

Gucci EDP has quite low to nonexistent projection even from the initial spray, and I have to put my arm directly underneath my nose to smell it when I first apply it, so it’s very faint but has presence (at least for a full hour lmao) whereas with Mademoiselle, I get actual strength from it, and can at least catch wafts of it radiating off my skin for a couple of hours. Not with Gucci. I’d be lucky to smell myself after 1 hour and then it disappears completely. So with that said, I’m leaning towards this being a dud for my skin chemistry, sans anosmia.

The opening is just a patch and musk and a tiiiiny smidgen of raw honey and.... dare I say a hint of chocolate?? Cacao?? My nose definitely picks up on some cacao. The opening of this fragrance takes itself moderately seriously and professionally without being stuffy, standoffish or unfriendly, and so that should match the person who wears it.

The dry down of this fragrance on bare uncovered skin is where everything falls apart - I never get the beautiful, UNIQUE dry down that I get when I have fabric covering my skin... So, with bare skin, the dry down of this just turns murky, stale, no fruits, and the fragrance Always just falls apart, BUT if my skin is covered with fabric after I apply the perfume, the strangest thing occurs: it almost ‘lifts’ and transforms into a slightly brighter, more feminine version of itself with the fruits flanked by beautiful patchouli and honey. The dry down makes the fragrance still professional and serious, but lighter, friendlier, calmer but still with an ambitious competitive edge, and still with a penchant of taking no bs, which is what I want my scent to evoke. Even then, I only get to experience this beautiful dry down for 30 min. Weird. Extremely unique for being a designer, but I’ll never know....

I’ll be selling this.",02/23/21 14:31,Violinhead8120

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Testing from a rollerball sample.

Whenever I see this perfume, I think of KathleenLights, because she really loves this one. I can see why. It's a sweet, honeyed patchouli, with an interesting guava note. The guava doesn't read as straight up fruity ripe guava, but a perfumey guava, sweet in a fruity way, like a guava filled pastry, to give this perfume that something unique it needs to prevent it just being another patchouli.

Gucci by Gucci is also VERY musky on me. It gets warmer and muskier, the patchouli gets a little crisper even as it dries down, to cut through the musk and honey. The patchouli is clean, but the honey is warm and maybe a tiny bit animalic, and the combined effect is perfect for the '70s advertising they have for this perfume. It does smell a little retro, sensual in a hot skin kind of way. I used to get a ""bad breath"" smell from this on my skin, luckily I don't smell that anymore.

I like it, it's different and more daring than other fruity pathcoulis out there. I see it's more widely available online than it used to be, so that's a great thing if you love this fragrance!",10/09/20 09:10,ntabassum92

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The patchouli in this smells a bit like plastic and more than anything, METAL. It's a little sweet but a bit bitter, as well, it's a crossmix between feminine and masculine, but still stays more on the feminine side. I've DEFINITELY smelled it somewhere before, but around over a decade ago. I think my godmother used to wear this. I can't put my finger on any of the notes, other than patchouli, when I wear it. It's so odd. I pride myself on having a good nose, but it just smells like patchouli ft. perfume rather than a perfume with patchouli in it. It's a woody, sharp patchouli, and I don't get the guava AT ALL. I wish it did have more fruity notes incorporated in it, though - just to elevate it a bit and make it more wearable. I don't think it's awful, but I do see why it got discontinued (giving no offense at all to those who adore it - i apologize it got discontinued to those who really love it), I'm just stating that I can see why many dislike it, if that makes sense.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Back in the day, I used to ""blind buy"" fragrances all the time. Many a time, I was left unimpressed and disappointed in the purchase. I believe it was due to my impulsiveness and inexperience. When I was just learning about fragrances, I wasn't sure what all the notes smelled like from the description so I was more willing to throw caution to the wind when making a purchase. Fast forward 10 years. I know what I like and what I don't like now. I know what notes I'm drawn to and which ones I'm not. I now have an instinct that is much more hoaned, when making a blind buy. I am happy to report that I am very rarely let down from blind buy purchases I make nowadays.
Working in a store that carries fragrances is both exciting and daunting. So many fragrances to research! Haha
I take my time and I look at every one and then I google the ones that I am most interested in to read about the notes, the prices, the availability and finally, the reviews. I take all of that information into account before I jump at a blind buy now.
When the feeling of confidence kicks in, I go for it! Or, if I'm feeling really unsure, I take a pass. Sometimes I'll research a scent for hours before making my mind up but in the end, all the digging around is worth it.
I finished work on Thursday and decided to take a look at the fragrance section before leaving for home. (Believe it or not, I do not do this every day! Haha)
I knew that we had just received a large shipment in of fragrance in that day and was eager to see what we had. I picked up two for men (Versace Oud Noir and Gucci Made to Measure) and three for woman (Gucci by Gucci, Versace Vanitas and Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue.)
I stood there with my phone and looked up all of them. No to the Oud, too manly. No to Made to Measure, too boring. No to Vanitas, too similar to Chloe, which I despise. No to Light Blue, has been reformulated and is now screechy.
Hmmmmm.........Gucci by Gucci. Ding, ding, ding..........we have a winner!!!
59.99 for a 50 ml. bottle plus my employee discount, not bad!
Unboxed it when I arrived home and smelled the nozzle. I knew instantly that I was going to love it. I wore it the following day and had that huge sigh of relief, knowing that I had made the right decision.
When I first sprayed it on (I always do 2 or 3 sprays on my chest/tummy area) I noticed a ""stinky"" note but it didn't scare me, I knew it would settle down and it did. I'm hit or miss with patchouli but it's smooth in here. The musk is light and also smooth. The honey brings a sweetness but it's also smooth and gentle. Overall, it's smooth and well blended and to me, it's a confident, sexy, ""power"" scent. It's not in-your-face or aggressive. It sneaks up on you, gives you a warm hug and steals a kiss! Alluring!
I've read other reviews stating that they wished it was spicier but I think we have enough spicy scents out there already. I think that this one is perfect just as it is. Absolutely stunning for cooler seasons.
Lasts all day on me and I continually get wiffs of it whenever I heat up and am moving around.
The bottle itself is also drop-dead gorgeous!
It's sad that it's been discontinued but I'll certainly enjoy it to the very last drop!",04/18/20 16:38,JSpines
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Wow!! What IS this???? I have a decant from generous Fragrantician and had no expectations one way or another, other than her reassurance that it is gorgeous, and that it is. I am completely baffled at the notes listed here, because this plays on me like a resinous, amber-y, woody oriental. If that is from patch and honey, all I can say is that I have never encountered a patch like this! This is not your hippy variety patchouli, and as Amandy points out below, it's apparently the source of the delicious woodiness. I swear I smell amber! I get no guava, no distinct tiare, and no pear. Gucci is a whole. What I mean to say is that if you smelt an apple, your brain would say ""That smells like an apple!"", or if you smelt a vanilla bean you would think ""That smells like vanilla!"". What I am quite inelegantly trying to say is that Gucci smells like Gucci on me. I can not break it down or isolate any single note. It does remind me of TF Noir de Femme a bit, but the notes listed in NdF fit what I am smelling. This is a very interesting and beguiling fragrance indeed!",04/16/20 23:44,churinl

Okay so .. Not what I was expecting at all based on the reviews I read..
It actually is how do I explain this - A FRESH slightly sweet woody (spicy scent)
I know there is no wood in the notes but combined with the honey and the patchouli it creates that result

If you like deep scents and one one that you can wear during the day that is going to stand out and not annoy ppl in say a date/ an office setting/ movie theatre but be addictive , then go for it .
Reminds me a little of Gucci rush vibes and Hugo boss deep red - in those category of perfumes.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I don't understand the patchouli note in this scent. I don't smell it – at least not in the traditional hippy way. Nor am I getting it in an earthy way, as is in Prada Amber. Nor is it green. What I am getting is a gorgeous, satiny wood. I am really amazed by that considering there is no wood listed in the notes for this fragrance. If I were to visualize this fragrance it would be glossy, like a sleek, smooth, polished piece of ebony wood. The fact that this has no wood sent me on a search to find out more about the Patchouli plant itself. I was able to find out that there are several varieties that are shrubby, and the sap is often extracted from their woody stems and put to various uses. The most widely used this way are Java Patchouli and Indonesian Patchouli, which are prized for their sleek wood notes. If that is the type of patchouli used here that could explain the beautiful wood notes I'm smelling.

When taken as a whole, this composition is very rich. The fruit, honey and spice notes are very light, seemingly only there to accentuate the beautiful patchouli. I'm not getting Tiare outright but there is a creamy, buttery richness to this composition that could only be attributed to that. But it is the Patchouli that is the star here and in its present form is extremely seductive, sexy, and glamorous.

I'm still finding it hard to believe that a note I normally dislike so much can be so beautiful. But from first spray to the silky end this was a head over heels love for me. I am so sad this gorgeous scent was discontinued. I am actually baffled by that.",03/21/20 14:50,Anamandy
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is a memorable and very unique perfume. Sooo sexy, sweet, spicy and ultra glamorous. You will stand out wearing this. It's one of my favorites. I love the unexpected notes and how well they blend. Patchuli is toned down and made modern blending with the honey. White florals and guava and pear are so delicious and add sweetness without being gourmand. It's mysterious without being dark, and spicy without being heavy or too young. This is a masterpiece. I love it.

So sad it was discontinued, this is far superior to Premiere which I feel was probably meant to replace this. Premiere is much softer and more powdery. Feels more makeup country and less special. This on the other hand is a masterpiece. I hope they decide to relaunch it, because this is like nothing else out there.",03/09/20 09:05,Amascent
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This was my first ever 'real' perfume purchase. My husband loves this scent on me and he is very picky and hates perfume in general, so that says something! This scent is special.
To my nose, this is a spicy honey scent - honey with cloves, cardamom and a hint of cinnamon. Very feminine, strong woman, sexy vibes. Not for the faint-hearted.
I will continue to adore this scent until my bottle lasts.❤️",12/23/19 20:41,JustSimpleThings
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This fragrance can be summed up in one word, intoxicating.

The honey and patchouli are a match made in heaven. The light and airy sweetness of the guava compliments it so nicely, not leaving it sickly sweet on the skin. It has a bit of a bitter thing going on but in all the right ways. This isn't a dusty patchouli at all, it's a deep, almost chocolatey one.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"So upset that this was discontinued, it is by far the best fragrance to ever come from the house of Gucci, with incidentally their best ever packaging. The opening is a hit of unadulterated, juicy guava, then it quickly transitions to a carnal, musky, deep scent, reminiscent of NR For Her but much sexier - luscious and dripping with honey. The fruits are subtle, which is exactly how I like my fruits; the patchouli is deep and earthy, and beautifully blended; the honey is sensual and inviting. There is the slightest hint of second hand tobacco that lingers after a decadent night out. This is dark glamour in a bottle, a very voluptuous scent, warm, sultry and oozing confidence.",08/28/19 10:25,elledeelee
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The opening notes of patchouli reminded me a lot of Midnight Poison, and this nostalgia is the primary reason why I got Gucci by Gucci. Of course, patchouli is really the only thing these two share together but it's still better than nothing.

Either way, Gucci comes with a powerful burst of patchouli which later reveals a beautiful cool toned, almost icy tiare flower scent which starts dominating the overall composition. The dry down adds a very delicate honey and white flower base with some remnants of patchouli. As for pear and guava, unfortunately I didn't seem to notice them no matter how much I'd spray on. The scent is still gorgeous, refreshing and quite unique. It would be really interesting to see whether it'll perform great during warmer days.

Gucci by Gucci left a pretty decent trail but I wish it was somewhat more long lasting because the scent is so fantastic that you'd want it around you for longer.",07/21/19 00:20,Catsylvania
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"When this was still available in stores, I accidentally soaked my whole nose area with a leaky tester bottle that I wanted to sniff. Of course I didn‘t try it again soon, and then it was gone from the shelves. I remembered it as a sharp but good fruitchouli, and got me a sample not too long ago to retest, mainly because I love guava scents.

When I first used it, it smelled so different from what I remembered. Guess a soaked nose is not the same as one little spray on the arm. Not very fruitchouli-like at all.
The tiare note is really strong at first, it smells warm and creamily floral like monoi oil, but with a dirty patchouli underneath. The patch reminds me of the original Mugler Angel, but the rest of scent is different and quite unique. The overall feeling of the fragrance is tropical to my nose, but the notes shift in and out. Sometimes I smell sweaty patch, sometimes sexy warm skin, sometimes a clean honey-shampoo, sometimes fruitiness. Even after several tries I‘m not 100% sure what to make of it - It can be warm and sensual, but then a scratchy note emerges that really ruins it for me, something artificially clean.
So, in the end I think Gucci by Gucci has really nice and interesting notes, but it could be done better. I would love some more juicy guava instead of that scratchy-clean thing. Not for me, but I could imagine that this really depends on the wearer‘s skin and works better on others.",04/12/19 11:10,SailorV

Gucci by guuci has that allure about it. It lasts for good 8hrs on me, give or take which a feat in itself since nothing lasts that long on me. It smells of wet soil mostly which is all patchouli, also sweet and fruity at the same time. Maybe that's the guava and honey in it. It's a great combination. It's cool but without being chilling. It's a lovely fragrance for a night out.
The store I went to had a last few bottles left then and I had to buy it. It's a shame that it got discontinued. It's such a timeless fragrance. I cannot fathom why anyone would do so.",02/13/19 02:54,rajnigandha
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I have just recently written under another heading (Paco Rabbane's Black Excess Los Angeles) how the fruity + just enough woods & musks & resins etc to keep it from smelling literally like a bunch of fruit is a standard idiom that 'fume-houses very often have recourse to for their 'flankers', and which can get very boring!

But this is the mother-ship of that idiom! ... the one that sets the bar. I loved it instantly the first time I tried it ... I can't remember exactly how long ago - but a fair while; and even now I can't fathom what it is that it smells like; it just is what it is - it smells like Gucci Gucci & gorgeous & inscrutible, and that's about all that can be said, really - it's such a beautifully integrated whole - sufficient unto itself!

One thing I can say about this though is that it sets my déja-vu haywire - some 'fumes do that - some more than others: and this one does it to me a very great deal ... but without ever connecting with a specific memory. I think the explanation when that happens might be an early encounter with someone wearing it - possibly a very brief one ... and also possibly a very long time before.

And I also agree wholeheartedly that discontinuing this is just completely insane - about as insane as Creed's discontinuing Bois du Portugal. But I cannot fathom marketting 'logic' ... can anyone fathom it? ... including the markettors themselves!

Sometimes I wonder whether it's because they just can't anymore - whether some crucial constituent has ceased to be available, and they would rather scrap it than be putting-out an inferior generation of it. At least that would make sense ... infact not only make-sense, but show-forth a certain integrity.

The consensus here seems to be that this is patchouli-dominated. A very versatile note, patchouli, isn't it: the number of times I've thought ""no! there isn't patchouli in that!"" ... & then on further consideration have begun to perceive how it 'slots in'.",01/31/19 16:05,YYY_Delilah

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I really like this fragrance. I like most Gucci frags, they are beautifully balanced but I also noticed that they develop better and have greater sillage if your skin is warmer.
This little number is another example of blending done right. Yes, the patchouli does take the front stage, but for no longer than an hour, and it isn't bad. The drydown is a sophisticated interplay of honey and patchouli. For me, it is a scent that I would go to on those day I can't decide what mood I am in as it does have that neutral sort of aura, and I think it's important to have one of those, for me anyway. Good sillage (better if your skin is warmer) and longevity.",11/09/18 04:59,shusha
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci EDP is mainly patchouli and guava on my skin. Patchouli and guava are naturally quite bitter, so this fragrance is also quite bitter and sharp.

This comes off as cool and earthy, with a little sweetness from the tiare and guava. Works really well during cold, rainy weather.

My only issue with this one is the longevity. I am willing to overlook the poor sillage as long as it lasts at least 4 hours. Not so with GGI. Still, I will have this in my arsenal for as long as it's readily available.",09/22/18 02:30,letamercy

Another perfume that is slowly bidding us goodbye, slowly making its exit, fading away.
In my country, it is EXTREMELY difficult to find it , searched every mall and every perfume counter, the salespersons would shake their heads at me ""no, we dont have that here anymore"". It is a rare item, you'd have to risk ordering online on Gucci website, which is not an option for me at all.
One day i got lucky, found a miniature bottle of this in a secluded perfume shop and i was over the moon.
It's deep, mysterious and mature scent. Not exactly sexy or seductive. I cant imagine young girls wearing this scent to college. I wont use this for datenights either but definitely yes when im in a presentation at work with grim hard-to-please bosses , put on my most persuasive smile, some twinkles in my eyes , strut my confidence around the room, drowning them with my GUCCI BY GUCCI EDP.

It's like Jimmy Choo EDP without the toffee. Very much a pear/patchouli scent. The patchouli is green/spicy and not hippie/body odor or medicinal/minty. And then the honey and musk takes over. And that's it. A musky honey/patch/pear.

It's ok.

______________________________________________________


I fell in love with Gucci's Rush some time ago and went to the store to purchase it. The saleswoman was somehow impressed of my knowledge of Gucci fragrances. She asked if I knew 'Gucci by Gucci'; since I didn't, she introduced me to it and it changed me.

Rarely did a fragrance catch me with guard down - but ""Gucci by Gucci"", just like its male counterpart, did. It somehow resembles a big soft hug from the rich aunt on Christmas Eve. It's soft and inviting, it's very present, but not obnoxious. It reminded me of cold winter evenings, spent with a loved one in front of the fire place.

The honey and musk notes fortify the core of this fragrance, patchouli, making it by far one of the best patchouli fragrances out there.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I must admit, this is my favorite patchouli fragrance ever. It’s most impressive because I usually dislike strong honey notes, but this scent is refreshingly bold and complex. Gucci Gucci is certainly not mainstream and that in itself is a plus-- there is a dark sense of refinement about this fragrance-- I feel like I am transported through time and finding myself on a date with the Great Gatsby himself. It feels very much like a vintage piece but the tropical notes suggests a modern flair.

I tended to hate patchouli as a main component in most perfumes, as it tends to give a very dirty earthy vibe which reminds me too much of wet foliage for some reason. Even when blended with fruits or florals, it’s easy to become completely overwhelmed by the herbal-ness quality that I’ve often find myself a little queasy.

This is not the case with Gucci, as that “wet plant” quality seems to have been noticeably curbed, the patch here feels lush and opulent. It maintains a dark and boozy personality throughout; while the honey adds to the warmth of this fragrance, the patchouli stays cold and mysterious. Guava and pear top notes are subtle and are quietly overshadowed by the tiare flower which gives this fragrance a very tropical floral accord. Sillage and longevity are very good on me and I absolutely love the dry down, it smells like wealth, power, and seduction…this is confidence in a bottle.

Gucci feels very mature to me, and I don’t mean age…I mean sophistication, class, and elegance. It’s beautiful but I can’t imagine everyone loving it the same. I maintain that certain fragrances will choose its wearer and not the other way around; this is unfortunately the case with Gucci. If you can find a love for refined patchouli and honey, this is a great and nostalgic adventure. Worthy of a test but not a safe blind purchase.

The scent is very loud, sweet, rich and deep. For me it is way too much. I agree with the review of Zoranna, it has something of the 70's vibe. If it was a woman, it would be Mary Jane Watson (from first Spiderman issues), extroverted and intimidating sometimes, but definitely attractive and likeable.

It smells best during colder days. I wouldn't call it sexy.",08/16/16 08:49,MissButterfly

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I haven't seen the advert, but this scent definitely puts me in mind of the 1970's, in an airport executive lounge with orange and beige decor, wearing a DVF Wrap Dress... so classy in it's own way...there's a sweetness which sits the right side of cloying and it's done better than the modern sweet fruit-chouli and sickly scent trends that dominate recent launches. It's a creamy scent and I can see why many would love it. I am not a fan of patchouli and this note dominates for me, along with amber, a note I dislike. Amber isn't listed so this was unexpected. I can't detect tiare (which is a shame as I love this note and it often gets paired with coconut which is sacrilege to me!). I can't detect honey on my skin either which is a good thing for me as that scent makes me nauseous. There's not much staying power or projection for an EDP in my opinion. However, if the notes are appealing to your own tastes then it's definitely worth a try.",04/28/16 15:04,zoranna
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I got mine as a gift and unfortunately, I didn't like it. I even wondered at first if it was really for me since it smelled so masculine. Well, it turns out that it's for women but it's something my nose does not agree on. This is just a big punch of amber (though there's no amber listed on the notes but that's what I smell) when you spray it on that dries down to a very masculine woodsy smell. That's all I got from it. It's a perfume that's trying to be complex and I guess it is complex but that does not automatically translate to something that smells good.",03/26/16 01:47,hannaheart
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci is a wonderful, musky honey smell. It's just a very elegant, night-time fragrance. I do tend to avoid wearing it too often since it reminds me so much of my mother (it's her signature fragrance) but it is a lovely perfume. Lasts for quite a long time, perhaps 3-5 hours.",03/14/16 10:10,antigone26

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This is my go-to fragrance! Light enough for daytime, but sexy enough for night.
I'm very picky about my scents, and I dislike most women's perfume - too basic, flowery and powdery. But this . . this is sophisticated, mysterious, and still feminine. All the notes are well balanced, nothing jumps out at you. I'd describe it as warm and earthy, but still delicate. The tiare and guava makes it just a hint tropical, the patchouli and musk make it exotic, and the honey smooths it out. Just wonderful. Amazing if you want something feminine, not girly - sexy, not sweet.",12/11/15 23:12,nefabit
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"As stated before, I cant see the fascination with Gucci frags that my friends have as like Chanel, they dont last on me. I can smell the pear in this, bit unisex for my tastes. The Iceberg frag is cheaper version of this",11/21/15 02:04,The_Entity
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Much like Gabricookies, I don't detect honey at all- and given that honey notes are the sheer killer of any perfume for me, thats saying something. I get a strong patchouli at first, but not the old boho hippie vibe that some have. This is a very refined elegant note followed and matched with a floral note and slight fruit at the end. I didn't think I would like this when seeing the notes, but I got a bottle in a swap and its fast becoming a favorite. I had a bit of worry about whether the ""maturity"" of this would end up smelling like a granny,but this mellows into more of an incense vibe. It lasts forever on me, and even many hours later I will catch a whiff even when it should have long gone silent to my nose.",08/26/15 12:06,Rie60
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"A very pleasant, warm, sugary pear develops into a musky honey/patchouli combo with the sweet tiare waffling here and there. This scent is inviting, rich and seductively mature. A very well blended, well crafted masterpiece of warmth. The top notes easily transition to the base simultaneously. What's not to love about this? It's sweet, powerful, and sensual for a crisp fall evening of glamour!

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This stuff smells great, and I think it is the perfect balance of musky honeyness and freshness. It's a little light on me but that's OK. I would describe it as a sexy scent, for sure.

Unfortunately, on me the longevity is just non-existent. I can spray 3-4 sprays on the back of my hand and it is a skin scent within 15 mins, and gone within an hour. I haven't experienced longevity this bad with anything else except TF's Cafe Rose (how weird, right?!). It's actually making me wonder if this has been reformulated, but no one is saying it has, so it is probbably just me and my unlucky skin chemistry. There is also no sillage :(

A bummer about the poor lasting power (and non-existent sillage) but it smells great, and wasn't too expensive for a big bottle. So I guess I'll keep spraying every half hour :)",07/21/15 02:56,Alayna1011

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I love this scent!
I really like patchouli but it's hard to find a patchouli that doesn't smell old and musty. Tom Ford's White patchouli is sadly a good example of that.

Gucci by Gucci gives me a very fresh patchouli vibe (you won't get a classier patchouli scent by the way, trust me), but at the same time it's also very creamy. I didn't think these two thing could go together, but they do!
I do get the Tiare flowers as part of this creaminess, and there is a slightly fruity note that I couldn't put my finger on. I don't detect honey at all...

I love this frag because in my opinion it perfectly balances the aggressiveness of patchouli with all the other sweet notes: it's a women's scent, but it does never get too feminine.
And of course the gorgeous bottle and advertisement can't go unnoticed. This fragrance really evokes a distant luxury, a modernist vibe from the '70s perhaps. Not very romantic or glamorous, but still quite elegant and... natural. More Farrah Fawcett than Doris Day :-)

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This was very strong at first spray and I was afraid this scent would be too heavy for my liking.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I got a 3ml decant of this from a website and tried it on. My husband walked up to me and said... ""You smell amazing, almost like sex, or the possibility of."".... YES! That is DEFINITELY how I feel wearing it! SCORE! Love this perfume! I was looking for something sweet, hint of musk, dark, and the possibility of ""kink"". Something that would be fitting for 50 Shades of Gray if you know what I mean! ;)

It starts of very boozy like you have been getting nice and intoxicated and ready to loose your inhibitions. Then it settles and that sweet honey comes out spiraling with the musk and fruits. Its a beautiful combination. So feminine. So sexy. So captivating. The scent of a woman who is empowered and confident. It doesn't smell ""older"" like a lot of musk scents do. Perfect for ladies who are in their mid 20s-30s and coming into their own and not afraid to flaunt it!

I hate I am falling in love with it now that it is being discontinued, but I got a couple bottle on Overstock so hopefully that will last me a while. This will DEFINITELY be a date night/ going out on the town scent!",12/14/14 18:08,chrissyc15

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Power perfume for the modern career woman! I'm convinced that you will be noticed wearing this! Gucci by Gucci is confident, metallic, demanding, deep and overwhelming. I definitely recognise this scent from shopping centres, hairdressers, cruise ships, etc... Unfortunately, to my nose there is just an overwhelmingly strong scent of something that reminds me of burning industrial chemicals or a nail salon... An extremely heavy monster - I split a tiny drop of this on my skin from the vial and after some very vigorous scrubbing it is still holding; however, it's calmed down now and is just a sweet patchouli floral smell. Absolutely not for me!

UPDATE: I wanted to understand why this perfume is so popular, so approached the vial again (with extreme caution) to determine what the top notes were that I couldn't stand... ah, patchouli and honey! I don't love the combination of either of those in extreme dosages, but I'm now beginning to understand how those notes mix to create a velvety scent which others enjoy :)",12/06/14 20:43,RosieRachel
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci by Gucci is my choice ""going out"" scent for the incredibly boozey quality it has haha. Firstly, the bottle looks like one of those vintage heavy crystal liquor decanters. And the scent...usually at first spray I always let the alcohol evaporate before I take the first sniff, with this one the alcohol compliments the experience and I feel like I am smelling a real Jamaican rum cocktail in front of me.

The start is juicy, sweet and sharp. It settles down and is still boozy, but the juicy pear goes away. The pairing of honey and patchouli sounds like something that could be heavy but it is simply a lovely pairing here. It is sweet but dark and a bit smokey too. Despite these two heavy notes, the fragrance is not at all heavy on me . My only complaint is that it stays very close to the skin, I am a modest sprayer so I don't mind much but I can imagine this being a deal breaker for some who enjoy strong sillage.

oh yes and the video ad... the ladies and their hair and makeup, the sleek 70s dresses, the luxe decor, Blondie, Lynch... there are so many things I love about the campaign as corny as it is",11/29/14 16:07,tapehissorchid

It's got attitude, charm, sex appeal and is incredibly feminine. This is such a great scent, and lingers around in an enticing veil. Way too sexy and deep for work I think. This might become my event/function/party/night out staple.


At first, I got an almost boozy amber which then gave way to the fruit and tiare and that thing that Gucci fragrances do (I find it in Guilty as well) and after several more minutes, chills out and develops into what is a culmination of all these terrific notes. Warm, melting honey on the flesh. Eyes open and a smile curves lips. Sheets are everywhere. A stolen kiss. Outside, night shines in through the window, it's summer. An unexpected love affair.",11/04/14 19:43,hippiechick13

I have several with lots of patchouli that I totally love.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"What an interesting fragrance to review! The first thing it made me think of was a red gummy bear or other small fruity sweet (guava+pear+honey?) fallen on skin covered in creamy oily smelling suncream (tiare?). Sort of nostalgic, feminine, almost but not quite girly atmosphere. At the same time though it has the feeling of being perfectly polished, like a dainty young lady who always has perfectly manicured nails and wears skirt suits. Not at all me, so I felt like I was wearing a young, classy woman's (very nice but somehow wrong) perfume, not MY perfume. I think it is perfect as the first ""real"" perfume for a young, feminine and very well dressed woman (not girl) or anyone exploring their soft/feminine/classy/pink side.
What really keeps my interest in this scent is the ""mystery"" note: In my opinion it is thyme (or possibly another herb) which gives an almost savoury/salty note which provides needed ""resistance"" to all the sweet and creamy notes. This is what keeps the largely fruity/creamy and inoffensive perfume from being boring or ""sticky"" and sets it apart.
On me this has very good longevity, sillage is moderate, gradually reducing.",09/24/14 13:34,Littlegrassstraw

It is not particularly complex or deep, but it is well done and the notes work together nicely. Mild, dry patchouli is tempered out with rich honey. Guava and tiare are provided mostly to balance out the honey-patchouli in the forefront, and the effect is lovely. It is seductive in a mature, womanly way and not a sexy/trampy way. Sillage and longevity are mildly disappointing, unfortunately. But the bottle is pretty and the color scheme of fragrance's presentation is absolutely perfect.

Hmmm....hello patchouli....are you in there????? I like really strong patchouli.......on me there is none at all, like I cant even believe other people are smelling it at on themselves. People are saying it was ""heavy patchouli"" on them......I was hoping for that. Not so on me, I am bummed about that. Its easy to wear, soft and very light. I would buy a bigger bottle eventually. Does Not come on too strong, is almost too sweet for me but then approaches the mark and backs off. Comforting, normal smell that I feel like I have smelled millions of times before. Its like honey i guess, although I cant tell the difference between honey and just like...a sweet smell. Like if I smelled it on me I would not think...ohhh yeah honey!!! Its just sort of a mild sweetness. Funny how everyone is like.....it smells so different!! I wonder what my chemistry is doing to it, it just sort of disappears in a very mild waft of something normal and faint.

its uplifting, mild, nice. I would get a bigger spray bottle some day, but im not in love with it. It needs some darker more spicey notes. It would be nice layered over something maybe. like actual patchouli. I feel like other people would like it on me more then I like it on myself in some way.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I don't know if it's my skin composition that does this, but on me, this perfume sits way too close to the skin.

But this one, even I don't really smell it when I stick my nose right on the spots where it was applied. So definitely not something I would put any kind of $$ on.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"After falling head over heels in love with the EDT version of this perfume I had to buy the EDP version also. The EDT is fantastic for during the day but the relatively weak lasting power made it difficult to wear on nights out without having to carry the entire bottle around with me. So when I got my bottle of the EDP in the mail I was very excited to try wearing it out. You can tell right off the bat that they are directly related; the initial patchouli opening coming in strong but then softened by the sweetness of the guava and honey... But the EDP version has a much deeper, smokier almost, honey note. The patchouli stays warm and snuggly for much longer, also. Very warm, dark, and seductive. Lasted much longer on my skin than the EDT. Looks like I'm set for day and progressing into night without having to drastically change smells. Both are classy, elegant and sophisitcated but this is definately the older sister of the pair, who spends her nights on the town surrounded by admirers.",12/02/13 05:45,ledavis727
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I really struggle to find suitable evening fragrances - they either just turn too sweet on my skin or are too overpowering in some way. This EDP is a rare thing for me, because it is very much an evening fragrance, but it never gets too sweet as it develops. The patchouli and honey balance each other very well. When you first spray, the patchouli dominates, but then a pretty honey note comes thorough. I can't really detect the fruit in the top notes, perhaps because the patchouli is so prominent.",11/21/13 08:51,millie1980
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"This opens with the guava and pear, which is fruity, sweet, and candied. If you're into that, that's great. If you're not (like me), that's fine, because it doesn't last. After the fruits fade, it's mostly patchouli and honey with a bit of smokiness. For some who are not used to patchouli, this may come across as a bit too much, but those like me who love the likes of Angel, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle, Black Orchid and more, this really isn't that challenging. It's less intense than Prada Amber (the original Prada), which I personally consider a real ""Patchouli bomb"" but it does have a similar quality to it. This stays close to the skin without much sillage, but I'd say it's a nice evening fragrance for going out. I don't get the ""masculine"" vibe that some people have described, but who am I to say what is masculine and feminine?


In terms of strength, while it might be considered ""sweet"" in the beginning, I never get the sense that it's overwhelming. It's significantly faded after about 3 hours or so and you mostly get a nice patchouli with honey that only people who hug you would be able to smell.",10/20/13 18:22,aliora
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The patchouli is barely there; I get mostly middle, top and ""veil"" notes out of this. It just kind of hangs there.

A lot of fruit listed here, but I barely get any fruit. Some pear.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Hmmm this is a hard one to describe. When I sprayed it today my initial impression was OMG that is some strong stuff. Gucci is known for good quality perfume that lasts. That is what I always love about Gucci. So I sprayed it on my arm in my bedroom. A tiny spritz and as I sit here the whole room is filled in this gorgeous aroma. Fresh and very clean. This is a heavy fragrance no fruitiness, no candy smell... it's all Gucci. I think my only reservation might be that the fragrance has a unisex smell to it and I tend to run from anything that is not totally feminine. This is the only think keeping me from falling head over heals for it. The bottle itself is indeed gorgeous, stout and very well made.

Edited: I gave my nose a day of rest and sprayed Gucci Gucci on again. I must say that perhaps I did not give it a fair shake. This is a complex scent and I got on Macy's site and read the description. I think it's a fair description of the scent and as I wear it I am smelling more femininity. I'll continue to experiment and see where it goes.

Edited about a week later: I have fallen in love with this perfume. Now that we are in Fall weather a true love affair is brewing. I have decided that I enjoy the mild unisex note this perfume carries. It's not masculine. The aroma is pleasant and warm and deep.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci by Gucci is by all means for honey lovers. Its delectable, sweet and alluring. The guava and honey infuse to give you a exotic cocktail of fresh crispiness and sweet shivers of excitement.

I have worn this scent both during summer, and going into winter now, and the scent pretty much holds to it's longevity on me, 5 hours, the only difference is in the colder conditions, I have found the patchouli
to infiltrate that almost innocent gauva/honey combo, and you get this dirty, almost dark feel from the earthy patchouli, which is what most people probably sense as the masculine component.

Also in the colder climates I have to say the projection is a bit better, although not by much. where it would project just 2inches in warmer weather, it's projects about 4 inches in wintery situations. It certainly does give that warm sensation of when you get home and remove your jackets and attire and you're left with your shirt and that warm body temperature is expelled....",04/11/13 03:28,krayonkid

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"I would never have picked Gucci Gucci myself. When a friend gave me a little gift set with lotion, shower gel and a small 5 ml sample, I sniffed it later at home and thought back about what I could have done to deserve this. Didn’t she like me anymore?? I decided that I would keep it only because it was a gift from this particular friend.

Occasionally though, I would splash a little touch of it, more to get done with it than anything else. Sure enough, with time, I have come to love it, and how. I LOVE, love, love it. The initial burst of guava, honey, patchouli and musk smell super sexy to me. It has this sweet, smoky, sultriness to it that I adore. At the same time, it smells (and IS) expensive and classy.

Later, when someone asked me what perfume I wanted as a gift, this was the one I wanted. So much for disliking it.

But, and there is a but unfortunately, as is almost fated to happen with the fragrances we love most, it’s gone in the time it takes me to walk around my house! - Okay, it isn’t that bad, but one hour after layering lotion and fume, it’s all but gone. There's only the slightest, lightest hint of musk. I’m so so disappointed by this aspect. I’ll just have to get a small size and carry it around with me on days (or rather nights, since this is an evening fragrance) I choose to wear it. Does last longer when sprayed on clothes, but sillage is next to non-existent *sigh*

Love it still. Would buy it again…and again.",03/24/13 05:58,Tara_Dan

I wonder what´s she is wearing ?
By accident I found it !
Without knowing the notes I tried it and fell in love too.
The opening notes made me think of Strawberry pie, but that was. -
Guava and Pear....... ok ?
The lovely tiare is simply gorgeous, sweet but calm. not a screamy note anywere the base is lovely too . I usually dont like honey rather than eating it, but mixed with patchoulie and musk irs wonderful !
The subtle scent makes me think óf Elle Intense. but this is still different. Another frag it made me think of in the beginnning -are - Prada tendre.
This is a VERY well made perfume, to me for both day and night.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"It's funny I'm Capricorn with rising in Aries, so is not strange that I like this perfume. I don't believe in astrology and say that this scent is for every woman that likes musky woody florals with a twist of sweetness and a peppery note of patcouli. I like that it's not another gourmand heavy vanilic fuity floral. It has warmth, depth, and is very versatile. I believe it can be suitable for morning if you apply a bit. I smell orange here, although is not listed. Also, I would swear I smell amber too, but I suppose this is honey that deceives my nose. It seems to me woody also........ Tiare is not prominent I think. Pear takes the first stage, together with soft patcouli. It is a quality perfume, not masculine. Warm, femminine, confident, although not an extraordinary one. Very well blended, and so abstract that can reach the taste of those who like florals, fruity patcouli, leathery smells and maybe chypres. It's not a chypre though....",12/06/12 22:50,akats
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"Gucci by Gucci is confident, sophisticated, no-nonsense, and seriously sexy. Someone mentioned this being an 'alpha woman' scent, and I agree. A femme fatale in a black suit and classic red lips. She's all about the clean, basic lines, rich fabrics, and prefers darker colors. Has a masculine vibe while being all woman. Very sweet, rich and deep scent but quite straight-forward and not too complicated. A dark and smooth honeyed patchouli laced with musk and a touch of fruits and flowers. Reeks of class, high society and expensive tastes. Best for evenings, perhaps a sexy night out with a black dress made of french lace...but if you're a boss, you can wear this to the office.

JUST FOR FUN: Perfect for a CAPRICORN or those with a Capricorn rising, the scent, and even the bottle design fits them to a T. Classy, somewhat stand-offish, ambitious and highly determined, it's definitely made for the Capricorn woman alright. Also would suit an Aries woman.",12/06/12 13:36,incandescent

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Parfum Gucci,"The bottle is the reason I've put off trying this. The first time, I only sniffed the bottle rather than spray directly on my skin. The bottle is too intimidatingly classy -- felt like a twelve-year old wearing Chanel Coco. I finally went to Shoppers to enjoy browsing in peace.
Immediately, I detected patchouli and honey blanketing dried, rather than fleshy, peach. The honey seems to have wrapped itself around the peach and (especially) the guava, which served to dull the sweetness of both fruits. Together, the patchouli and honey gives the perfume its warmth, which I envision wearing with softest cashmere sweater, a Michael Kors large-face gold watch and sumptuous suede boots. The drydown is dry, dark and soft. Smokily alluring lending from amber and faint spices. Very classy and sophisticated for day or night (just amplify with another squirt or two). Sometimes, it smells like smoke, dark tea and molasses. I can see a masculine executive wearing this in the office. I would happily share a bottle with my husband. Suited for confident individualists who are open to scents other than the usual sugary-florals.

To me the Gucci by Gucci woman is sophisticated but wild. Men are driven crazy by her, women admire her. She is ambitious and confident. When I picture her I see a young 25-35) successful, and strikingly radiant career woman - the one all the men ogle at, the reason why the company must hold sexual harassment lectures. But she is so much more than just a pretty face; she is clever and witty. She is driven and passionate.

On first spray, i find Gucci by Gucci a bit harsh and cloying. However, after ten minutes this settles into this beautiful, warm, sweet and sensuous aroma. This fragrance just melts so well into my skin. It becomes musky, but not your grandmother's musky, but rather sexual creature kind of musky.

I actually detected some cardamom in Gucci by Gucci but it couldn't have been, since it's not an ingrediens in the perfume. Still something about it reminded me a bit of cardamom. Still, a warm spicy scent. Glamourous and goldy in some way, i can imagine a very elegant, warm person wearing Gucci by Gucci. Dressed in sexy, elegant clothes with a touch of mysteria around her.

When I first sprayed it, it seemed identical to For Her by Narciso Rodriguez. It had the beautiful white florals and the rich, sweet scent of honey. As it dried down, the sweetness increased quite a bit, and the scent of guava became very clear. It's such an unexpected combination--juicy guava drizzled with honey. It had the potential to become another boring, wimpy, fruity-floral, but Gucci gave it enough richness and depth to prevent that.

This was an impulse buy, the result of trying 10 million perfumes in one go and completely confusing your olfactory glands. The same thing happened to me when I bought Kenzo flower.

A Winter Melody Scented Water Gucci,"I am a collector of rare and exclusive perfumes, with some more widely available beautiful ones there too. I expected to like this - my initial feeling was that I was very wrong. The top notes are nauseating. I felt sick, got a slight headache, my tongue swelled, eyes watered and I started sneezing. Obviously strong enough for allergy, which does not happen often and also a really sickening smell. I could smell patchouli (which I hate) although I haven't seen this listed in the notes; I would describe this as a very strong musky cypress, like damp, slightly rotting wood in a forest that, as it dries down, develops a sweet, rotting rose petal note onto the wood. I can understand the incense connection because of the heavy, warmed patchouli oil overtures. It was a definite dislike from me, one I wanted to wash off my skin. I was looking for a similar perfume to my beloved Tiempe Passate - the former is beyond beautiful and seems to melt into your skin as though it were your natural scent, whereas this one seemed to sit thickly on top of it. I persevered and as the base notes came through it became more intimate, pleasant and musky. I would say that this could work better if it was layered up with, say, a bright violet or mimosa. However, the musky, woody cypress was still a dominant feature and it continued to have a slightly sickly smell reminiscent of patchouli oil.

A Winter Melody Scented Water Gucci,"I am appalled by how much I personally want this just based on its looks, and I can see thus far all other reviewers are beguiled mainly by its pretty presentation. Of all of Gucci’s premium line, this is the one I love most; there is something very bracing about the Bergamot, a highly mentholated gelid opening that does indeed feel like an agreeable winter’s day, when the snow has settled and the sky has loosened its grey cloak slightly. But that might for me, also be the primal response to another Icy cologne of my childhood, by German House 4711, in its pretty miniature gin bottle and green label and dinky red-topped cap, sitting on my Grandma’s dark brown teak vanity like a little jewel. the predominance of bergamot in both seems to indicate a strong connection, and 4711 cologne is a much more economical yet effective option, by a wide margin. Winter Melody is further, not aided by its poor silage for its price. Longevity however is decent and it does shift beautifully into a languid rose a few hours later, but practically a skin scent.

Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum Pour Femme Gucci,"I work in cosmetics so I get a lot of samples of new launches: this is lovely! I think it's a very beautiful fragrance for autumn, specifically. It has a nice amount of ""booziness"" to it which are reminiscent of increasingly early sunsets, holiday dinners with family and a cozy autumn breeze. I can smell an almost wine-like scent in the opening but it does dry into a richer amaretto. The coffee and patchouli give it a bit of mature sophistication so I don't imagine younger people would be too drawn to this. While I enjoyed my samples, it's not a fragrance I'm going to rush to add to my collection because it does struggle in a few places - all the different notes give it a bit of an identity crisis. I don't know if it's trying to be fresh and floral or warm and cozy. I also find the almond note is very strong in the dry down. That's going to annoy people who don't love almond fragrances. This fragrance evokes more of an environmental mood rather than saying anything significant about the person wearing it so it will be interesting to see who becomes a typical purchaser.

A Gloaming Night Gucci,"I’ve been wanting A Gloaming Night for ages, and finally for this year’s “ber months” I took the plunge. ✨
# autumn 2025 🤎
It’s festive, spicy, deep, and utterly beautiful … cinnamon, vetiver, patchouli all in perfect harmony. And the bottle is stunning .. A ruby red jewel in my collection.
Wearing it feels like stepping into twilight … magical, elegant, and totally indulgent. I’m officially hooked ❤️

A Gloaming Night Gucci,"Epic home bringer that Gloaming Night, should've started the Alchemist's Garden with this.

Perfect craft, not sure how excitement and nostalgia can coexist so well like that, with the charm and style to it. It's a movie. Get the mature snug, not too much going on as far as multidirectional, got the rare standout, dense and solid. Opens up dark brown earthy, actually bit fresh fruity too, two days in don't get the Cinnamon yet, immediately Patchouli starts unfolding upon the bitter opening with sheer omnitemporal class, this was elegant in ancient times as well as having futuristicals to it in the present. All purpose, shut pretty much any scenario down with this because it will as well appeal to mass. Stunned by and very pleased with the blind purchase.",07/19/25 17:02,Andrei Curta

A Gloaming Night Gucci,"This fragrance is absolutely stunning! It's warm and spicy with a hint of sweetness, perfect for a cool evening.

A Gloaming Night Gucci,"Such a great perfume. I can smell each note, but the cinnamon ties everything together in this kind of earthy, kind of sweet mix that really is something so unique and special. I just used up the last of my small decant of this, but I’m currently sitting, sniffing myself, enjoying this last hurrah of A Gloaming Night because I’ll probably never get a chance to smell it again. Completely unisex, moderate longevity and sillage. Very worth getting your nose on.",04/28/24 08:55,cgaleb
A Gloaming Night Gucci,"Just barely makes grade. Another semi-charming, earthy blend.

Somewhat remiscent of ATH'S Homme or House of Sillage's Dignified. But lighter, more subtle and frankly better, and more refined.

That said, this scent profile is more glooming than gloaming. Starts bland and goes nowhere fast. Another from the series that's more collectible than wearable.",02/07/24 16:48,Whateverwhocares
A Gloaming Night Gucci,"This one is outstanding, and everything I ""hoped"" The Last Day of Summer would be when I purchased them together. With a large collection I grow tired of the typical floral/sweet/gourmand/woody tones that I consider safe and mass appealing. I'm always on the lookout for something unique that will stand out and give me a moments pause when I apply. I will admit this and others like that will not be everyone's cup of tea, but for ME it's more about the experience and having gentle reminders throughout the day that what I'm wearing isn't like anything else I can smell on others around me. This is an Oriental base with just the right amount of sweetness. For what it's worth I feel this bares no resemblance to Gris Dior which is another favorite of mine.",02/02/24 07:56,EveRose22
A Gloaming Night Gucci,"I can understand the comparison with The Noir 29, they are not exactly the same and you can definitely tell them apart. A Gloaming Night is a more brighter version of The Noir 29.

A Gloaming Night Gucci,"Reminds me a lot of noir 29 and gris dior. I also get brioni intense. Since I enjoy these fragrances quite a bit, I thought it was safe to blind buy, and I was right. I think this is like an earthy noir 29, but I don't exactly smell the earthy notes unless I come up close and take a sniff on my arm. But overall, I think it's pretty great. Kind of feels like I'm walking through a calm dimly lit street somewhere all alone. But not in a creepy, scary kind of setting, just serene and peaceful.",08/19/23 18:59,fuc
A Gloaming Night Gucci,"This scent is a hot patchouli bitter sweet experience. The cinnamon and vetiver are mixed with other dry wet/minty dirt notes, it feels very bizarre. At some point it reminds me of some herbal tea.
I guess that it can be great on some people but I don't enjoy it. It feels a little half done, like a chemistry experiment that has an specific herbal odor...",12/14/22 20:02,aspirina
A Gloaming Night Gucci,"I tried nearly every fragrance from the Alchemist line and found most of them very average, and massively overpriced. I never got to try Gloaming Night because it was always sold out until today; and now I understand why it's popular and sold out.

Gloaming Night was love at first smell, and the best from the alchemist line. I'm very picky about cinnamon and because of that, I've never bought one... until now. This fragrance is an excellent cinnamon. Spicy but not overpowering cinnamon and patchouli. Smells expensive, luxurious, and is classy. It's simple, and I wish it was a little more complex, but succeeds in what it is. Gucci finally hit a home run with this one.

Bottom Line: Best from the alchemist line IMO. Voice of the snake is good if you're not already familiar with that DNA (it is done better elsewhere) last day of summer is a solid option but it's also not super unique and Eyes of the Tiger is great but admittedly, very simple in a crowded genre. This is also simple, but it's great at what it does.

Scent: 8.8/10
Performance: 6.5/10

Edit: Hortus is now my favorite from the alchemist line and the entire house of Gucci. Unfortunately, you can only find it at select boutiques and online for a price that will make your heart stop",11/19/22 01:34,The Wolf

A Gloaming Night Gucci,"I get patchouli, rose, and a very clean soapy vibe (upscale, dry and clean linen, freshly pressed with steam lifting from it). They backed the otherwise harsh woody chemicals (vetiver, etc.) with fresh chemicals, making it wearable even in an office, I would think. Still, it has this kind of faint vinegar smell which I don't necessarily like, and at the price point I would never buy it. That vinegary smell comes from lily of the valley aroma chemicals, I think and it does actually taper down in 10 - 15 minutes.",08/16/22 14:09,eewatts23

Added to my to-buy list, but I’d never buy it unless I got a big discount",01/25/22 19:45,leatherorrisviolet

Envy Gucci,"I got a small sample of Envy, and it’s a shame it’s been discontinued. Delicious. It reminds me a bit of Miu Miu. Fresh, like dewy cut grass, with a dry, mossy thread running through it. There’s a sheer white floral sweetness that makes it feel creamy and luminous: magnolia with a lemony glow, a touch of green jasmine, and just a hint of blooming rose. Sometimes it makes me think of Carnal Flower, though thinner, less rich, less solar. The bergamot actually comes forward more as it dries down, and once you know there’s pineapple in it, its juicy sweet-tartness sticks with you. It wears so easily, sharp but elegant. It’s instantly likeable.",09/05/25 05:37,FlaconNoir

Envy Gucci,"If I had just one wish it would be for Gucci to bring Envy back. Please, Gucci, I am begging you!! Ok, that may be a tad dramatic, but it really is such a shame this was discontinued. For a perfume made in the 90s, this still smells so modern. It's hard to believe it's nearly 30 years old.

Envy Gucci,"I adore this. Would be my signature if it was still around. It's definitely unique and meant for someone who is an aficionado of green fragrance.Just reeks class and old money.

It's a master blend of florals, greens, and woody notes. Opening to me is Freesia, Pineapple, and Vodka; settles into Lily-of-the-Valley, Hyacinth, and Iris; later notes as it ends are base notes are Oakmoss, and Musk.

I have both the EDT (clear bottle) and EDP (black bottle). The EDT is fresher florals in composition whereas the EDP has more of the powdery iris/violet and sandalwood. But, they are similar enough to where when you're wearing it, you definitely know it's Gucci Envy.

Absolutely broke my heart when this discontinued and I treasure what bottles I do have left. I consider it a treat.",01/28/25 17:48,Wanderer75
Envy Gucci,"This is one of those discontinued fragrances I own that I'm scared of using bc I know I'll mourn after it once it's gone.

Sexy and clean can contradict each other, but I think they go well to describe this perfume. Imagine a garden full of white florals - particularly Lilly of the valley - after a rainy morning. The refreshing scent of the rain amplifies the smell of all of the plants and flowers, and a young lady who is wearing a musky perfume is now walking through her garden, relieved that she doesn't have to water them.

Envy combines a variety of green notes and musk into this lovely, ladylike potion. Lilly of the valley is definitely the leader in this team, but you can also feel some freesia in there as well as oak moss. Feminine and charming while also having this enchanting, not really seductive but heavily attractive quality to it. I wish Gucci would bring this back and not make it body spray longevity, unlike their recent releases.",01/04/25 23:02,Azisai-

(50 ml., thief shop, 25 usd, fairy mint condition, 1997 batch)

Me & my hubby, finding some activity to do.
On this beautiful raining Sunday, we decided to go to Japanese thief shop, fairy far from a town.
Big warehouse.

I found Envy, green bottle. Sit in the shelf.
The shop is humble and let us test.
I split one tiny spray on my hand.

I got instant eyes-roll, it is the best mossy green white-floral I have been tested so far, like I can’t explain.

It is very clean, soapy and modern.
No we not talking about pass modern.
It is very now, I don’t mind wearing this at all.
In 2024. It is minimalistic clean white floral.

Comparison to the classic release in around the same times, you could feel the scent indicates the era. Pleasure by Estee. Something like that.
No but it is not the case with Envy.

You know, I pay certain amount to enjoy Fleaur Diamantine by Maison Crivelli but damn like, there is no major difference, Ms.Envy might be the same teir.

My 2nd throw back time fragrance that make me feel something like this apart from Parco pour Homme.

Old perfumer is something else..
Why, I have no idea, why?
Why they can create something like this..
Since 1997 and hold up until this day..?!??

Addendum (Ps. But yeah.. as much I am enjoy this scent, the classic floral green blueprint. I can’t recommend you to pay abusive high price for this.. unless you have strong nostalgia. You crave it, to evoke something inside. Please don’t hold back..)",07/21/24 02:55,tanaC
Envy Gucci,"I found an incredible deal on a vintage 100 ml bottle, but it wasn’t packed well and leaked during shipping. So, these are my notes on skin from the tiny bit left and from the contents on the cardboard box.

It’s a definitely green floral, but not harsh, and the woods are prominent. My guess is the woods are more prominent for me than they would be typically because the bottle leaked slowly in transit, so it’s been exposed to air for a while. The pineapple lends softness to the green flowers. It seems to have a rounding effect as opposed to emphasizing the fruit. It doesn’t exactly smell like vintage Cristalle, but it creates a similar feeling. But take this all with a grain of salt, because my sample is odd. It does make me want to find another bottle, however.",07/11/24 13:59,Bangabanga
Envy Gucci,"Was curious to try this popular late 90's creation, so I got a mini. I transferred some of it into a spray vial so I could wear it properly, and gotta admit I'm not into it at all. It's not that Envy is bad, it's just not my thing.
It's mellow and green, smells way more simplistic than the note pyramid.
Some fruit, a little floral, with an underlying smell of dewy grass. Longevity is pretty good, though.",05/31/24 19:38,Aeternitas
Envy Gucci,"Gucci Envy was a fragrance I first smelt when I was in my late teens. A boyfriends mother had a tray of fragrances in the bathroom, and I would see her get ready to go out for the evening and usually reached for this. She always dressed sophisticated and chic. The fragrance really suited her. I remember thinking, ""Huh! Is that what elegance smells like!?"" As a person who grew up in a household where both parents disliked fragrance, I rarely got to enjoy any until I lived on my own. I remember wanting Gucci Envy but couldn't afford it at the time, and by the time I could, it was gone. Gucci Envy should definitely be brought back it had all the right notes that made for a fresh yet sexy classy fragrance. It is truly a feminine scent.",05/30/24 13:31,BcoconuttyB

Not sure if it's available elsewhere though. I'll be wearing this regularly now. Marks a change from all the sweet perfumes and this is such a beautiful green scent despite it being so green, especially at first spray and the first few hours after. It just makes me feel happy and energised from the instant I spray it on. It doesn't smell synthetic at all. It can almost be unisex but still retains enough femininity for a woman who is into fresh, green, floral fragrances. One could even say there's a vegetal element to Gucci Envy.",11/06/23 07:30,rachelv

Envy Gucci,"The first fragrance I got into. It was the last year of college and our class had taken a trip to France. My roommate had bought a bottle, and I had to know what it was. I used Envy for years after that, until the green aspects of the fragrance started to sit on me wrong.

Some 15 years later, I check in here and realize that Envy has been discontinued. I then found an old bottle in storage and tested it out. The opening notes after application went somewhere odd and I worried that it had turned, but after that it became the Envy I remembered. For me, it sits firmly for me in a category that I've come to label ""perfume perfume"", and is what I associate with most of the larger designer house perfumes, Guerlain excepted. Envy is not trying to be any one thing outside of a green-noted floral with wide appeal, and there's an elegant simplicity to that. There may not be perfumes that do this exact thing as well, but there's plenty of other scents out there to fill the void that Envy has left in the perfume world. Explore the world of smaller perfume houses--this scene has only gotten larger since the late 90s and early aughts.",09/10/23 10:02,cedarsweetgrass

Envy Gucci,"Decided to wear this today as I still have my vintage one from over 20 years ago. Haven’t worn it in a few years. It still smells ABSOLUTELY fresh to this day. Has not turned one bit! It is so green and invigorating. I’m not one for green notes ordinarily BUT this lifts your senses. I thought it was a simple green fragrance with some floral tones. A simple pyramid. But gosh that’s one full pyramid. For me the bergamot is the overall impression of the fragrance even if the floral is the main accord. Yes I can smell Lily of the valley BUT that bergamot makes it PEAK your senses. Love the fact this still has that rare oak moss base in it. Nothing artificial about this, although it still smells perfumey. This isn’t my style but I appreciate it. Gucci clearly has a fan base here but I don’t think they’d be able to replicate the authenticity of this without the oakmoss. Even if the aroma chemicals and new molecules can replicate such smells I just don’t think it would be the same.",02/13/23 05:32,Rainstorm

Hyacinth is an Advent and Christmas flower in Sweden

Envy/ Gucci on the other hand, is a spring fragrance, with bright flowers, greenery and a hint of the cream Nivea (does it mean snow?) that deepens and supports.

Just like Anais- Anais makes me feel like a little girl, something everyone needs a little now and then.

I probably prefer Hyacinth's deeper and for me spicier notes.

Envy Gucci,"Beautiful. I purchased it blindly from a person who often sells hard to find perfumes. I like rare scents (as in hard to find and/or discontinued etc). I first smelled it during winter and it reminded me a popular scent from the 90-ies, and even though pretty then, it seemed to be lacking the depth. Indeed, after I used this today (a warm , but not hot, June day), it opened up probably twice as deep, but interestingly not the same correlation with that unknown scent from few decades ago. The scent of Gucci Envy is almost completely new to my nose, thankfully (in this case.) It's fresh, citrusy-floral. It smells sweet to me, but not in the traditional sugar/vanilla way. The sweetness comes from the sweet fruits and flowers used to compose this masterpiece. It's strong too, which I appreciate, but not overbearing and seems completely easy and non offensive. I'm not sure how long it'll last but because it's discontinued, I recommend it to anyone who likes quality and beauty in a citrus floral perfume and is fortunate to find this hard to come by scent. Also, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it reminds me Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue. In fact they share the following 10 notes: Lily of the Valley, Magnolia, Jasmine, Iris, Violet, Rose, Bergamot, Peach, Musc, Sandalwood. It also reminds me Issey Miyake The Scent (EDT) :the notes they share are citrus fruit, Hyacinth,Jasmine, Cedar (and maybe more, but Fragrantica only shows these.)",06/14/22 05:16,Olive8
Envy Gucci,"It's funny. Envy is such a murky emotion. I envisage it as a mucky khaki colour. Yet Envy the perfume is as clear as a piece of bright lime/leaf-green glass, letting sunlight pour through. So named because of the sharpness and acidity of the concept perhaps. It is citric, lime-like, a tiny bit floral, something rounds it out but I don't know what. I don't get peach but maybe the genius Roucel rounds out and warms up any possible harshness with it. Where lesser agents would have dumped a dollop of fruity sweetness in (to apologise for the citrus) and unbalance this composition in favour of sales. But instead this sings clear and at a high pitch. It is an abstract representation of envy, very green, juicy without sweetness, well lit, transparent. I remember when it first came out Yuzu was mentioned as one of its notes. Lily is brought in to sing with the sharpness, yet lends a softness. So many contrasts and intrigues in this.",05/07/22 01:54,Fierce Swan Scent

Envy Gucci,"Envy is a pretty decent fresh green scent. I am reviewing my miniature from the early noughties. Composed by the excellent Maurice Roucel, I expected a dream green scent. While it is excellent at times, notably its opening and drydown, overall it is not the ultimate green for me, thanks to an unfortunate sour phase. It has shades of Cristalle EDP, Jardins de Bagatelle and Eternity - three acclaimed, fresh, floral scents from roughly the same era that I find slightly off-putting due to an astringent/sour note.

Envy opens with bright fruity notes, with pineapple being most dominant. I don't usually like pineapple, but this is probably the use of the pineapple note I have come across. There is a hint of peach in there. Bergamot adds crisp tartness, tempering the sweetness nicely.

Some clean, fresh yet soft florals emerge on the skin after a little while as the fruity notes subside. Green lily-of-the-valley leads the way, and is the most prominent floral note to my nose - it is beautifully rendered. The other florals emerge - namely some soft hyacinth and a hint of jasmine, which along with the lily-of-the-valley, develop to form a clean white floral accord. Some violet leaf adds a slightly metallic edge, and here it takes a slightly unpleasant turn - becoming a sour, slightly sharp, Eternity-like white floral that overstays its welcome on my skin.

The drydown is not truly chypre-like, as I was expecting, but instead becomes a musky, slightly mossy, woody accord. The sour phase subsides, and the drydown is a more pleasant phase of Envy. Remnants of the white florals are present, primarily jasmine. Sillage and longevity are moderate, and it is feminine-leaning in my opinion.

Green and crisp until the end, Envy is nicely crafted fresh green scent. Missed by many, it is a pity it has been discontinued. However, thanks to its sour phase, it's not a must-have for me. 3/5.",03/14/22 09:05,Enrium

Envy Gucci,"Smells like baby wipes at first, there's also a heavy sunscreen note in there. Really reminds me of taking a vacation to florida as a kid, that humid summertime smell. Pineapple is probably the most potent note. VERY summery.",02/15/22 16:03,kasialovesflorals
Envy Gucci,Does anyone by chance have a bottle of Gio (Giorgio Armani 90's) that they'd like to trade for Gucci Envy? I have a 1.7ounce bottle that's nearly full:) Might be a long shot but still asking...,02/03/22 11:31,adealpiano
Envy Gucci,"I think fruity notes were (and still is) so prominent in commercial fragrances that it has become a second thought in consumers' minds. For a green floral, this is actually primarily pineapple and not lily of the valley—although I've never smelled the real flower, take one look at Guerlain and other famous creations, you know this is not it.
For those contemplating on buying this discontinued gem at an outrageous price, think about what it is that you're drawn to; I recommend searching for green chypres with pineapple. There are some Creed Adventus imitations with exaggerated pineapple note that is similar to this, as well as Amouage Interlude Woman if you want a intensified ""nuit"" version (kiwi + incense) 🙂",01/30/22 12:51,Calvini
Envy Gucci,"Ah. This green dream....
I bought it upon its release, and kept wearing it for years.
Back then I was penniless and without direction in life. Then one day I came across Envy at the perfume counter of a newly opened shopping mall in Florence.

That place was filled with all the most beautiful things, and I used to spend hours there to window shop as my wallet was always very hungry. It is there that I met with Envy, the vivid memory of that moment etched forever in my heart.
I remember browsing and sniffing a number of perfumes and then gravitating towards its uncommon bottle shape. A spray, just one in the air... and my heart went BANG!

I fell in love instantly. The scent made me feel a million dollars, it spoke to my core of all dreams I had. Hyacinth, green notes, a timid (very) freesia - the muguet, really, is not detectable per se as a note. I smelled grape too, vine precisely, though there's none in the composition. Instantly, I grabbed a bottle and reached the counter with determination. I knew I'd never regret spending that much on my dreams.

At today, whenever I spray it, my mind goes back to the young, penniless girl. And I marvel at her knowing of what truly matters in life: how we feel about ourselves. Envy is a perfume that exudes confidence and joy.
Forever in my perfume armoire!",12/13/21 14:05,Forbiddenjade
Envy Gucci,"Carolyn Bissette Kennedy didn't wear this. But when I smell Gucci Envy, I picture her. Why? Something about the combination of clean florals, green freshness and comforting lactonic cream remind me of the pure beauty, and chic aesthetic she personified. Envy is a perfect white Oxford shirt tucked into a camel colored pencil skirt. It's the type of blonde women will spend thousands to achieve. It's being sexy, being rich, being clean. This isn't classified as being a lactonic scent like it's cousin Rush, but there's something so very milky about this. Perhaps because its reminiscent of the Pantene Pro-V conditioner that was all the rage in the mid 90s.

Envy Gucci,"I was finally able to get my hands on a bottle of this masterpiece and have been hesitant to write my review, simply because it is my absolutely favorite fragrance of all time, and I've decided to make it my signature scent. I just don't think words can accurately express my love for this fragrance, and if anyone from Gucci is reading this, I beg you to bring this scent back, exactly the way it was originally. Maurice, you are a genius, a fragrance god, for coming up with this divine concoction and I bow down to your excellence. I was first introduced to this fragrance back in 2002, during my high school years, and whilst I didn't quite understand how masterful it was back then, I still enjoyed wearing it. I do have some scent memories attached to this fragrance, but that's not why I love it. I just think this fragrance smells downright amazing. I am not a huge fan of Lily of the Valley, but for some reason, I think when it's mixed with the Hyacinth, it just works. I absolutely love how when I wear this fragrance, I can actually smell it on myself. It is not one of those fragrances that I become nose deaf to, it creates this beautiful scent bubble that lasts a very long time, 8+ hours. There are some fragrances, like Baccarat Rouge 540 that do this disappearing act while wearing it, and you can't seem to smell it on yourself. Envy does not do that at all. In terms of what this scent smells like, it's like the most insanely beautiful green floral scent that has some freshness and a crispness to it. It is extremely unique and just stunning overall. I think what I love about Envy the most is that it's not too much of any one scent profile. It's not too floral, it's not too green, and it's not too fresh. It is purely the best combination of all those things. I suppose there is a hint of a fruity quality, with the pineapple and the peach, but they are not what stands out, they're there in the background giving the slightest touch of sweetness. The combination of base notes is another aspect that really intrigues, and I love a good oakmoss in the base. It is interesting to me that there is Jasmine in the heart and the base, and Jasmine is another floral note that I am very partial to. In terms of when this scent is appropriate to wear, I would say you can wear this all year around if you live in a moderate climate, day or night. If you live in a place that gets very cold, I would say, probably save this for spring/summer. I have two backups of this fragrance that I hope will last me for many years without them going off... I am using what I have very sparingly because I never want to be without this. Just sniffing it from the bottle gives me joy. I pray that Gucci brings this back, it is a shame they discontinued it! I love you Gucci Envy!!!",11/21/21 17:02,shaeri87

Envy Gucci,"The most beautiful, truly green perfume composition. Shame it was discontinued. This fragrance represents well what Tom Ford era did for Gucci (look at Gucci now, the clothes and fragrances are hideous, tacky, and for the desperate, followers, and posers). This scent is sophisticated, fresh, and feels like a privalege to wear, since its discontinued. Maybe because my bottle hasnt been protected from heat or light, but it does not last at all.

Envy Gucci,"Envy was the first fragrance I fell in love with and the one that made me discover the world of perfumes several years later so beware, this review is filled with a lot of nostalgia.

Not a usual pick for a teenager, right? Well, it was handed to me by my mother, who actually hates it, and it immediately became my favorite scent, shoving aside all those woody and vanilla frags I had on my shelf. Ah, those high-school days when Envy blended so well with cigarette smoke and wild trips! It’s crisp, stern and so chic, makes me think of 90s Kate Moss.

To me, it’s truly a masterpiece, a piercing blend of oakmoss and lily-of-the-valley. It’s a pity it got discontinued, I wish they’d create green florals like this again. I’ve only got 15 ml left now and I can’t make myself wear it, guarding it like a dragon. I got CdG Celluloid Galbanum in hopes for finding the familiar scent but it’s not the same, it’s green, yes, but more simple and bold.

Envy Gucci,"Every time I smell a new green perfume, in my heart I'm hoping at least one will smell like this one.

A true green floral, the deliciousness of sour sweets, fizzy, zingy, zesty, and yet smells expensive and like nothing else. Longlasting with a good cloud for others to pick up on, without being a ""beast""; it's just fantastic quality.

In the innocence of youth, this was an unopened hand-me-down from my mother, and since it was my only ""proper"" perfume at the time, it was practically my first signature scent so I wore it out everywhere - including clubbing! How I wish I could save some of those sprays wasted on crowds of Axe wearers (kidding, sorta). Snagged a backup bottle a few years back but I'm constantly on the hunt for a dupe and no luck yet. Instead releasing rosy or 'intense' flankers every year, brands should bring back discontinued gems, which would sell far better.",05/03/21 12:07,Letitlinger

Envy Gucci,"Lily-of-the-valley is my childhood flower no. 1. I associate it with the ceremonies at the end of semester and start of the long summer break; we all went picking the flowers in the nearby grove and handed to our school teacher before heading out to have ice cream and ride our bikes to the nearby lake.

Envy however is a grown-up lily-of-the-valley. It has all the qualities I appreciate in a springtime fragrance: subtle, crisp yet soft, green but not harsh. Pure pale green elegance.",04/16/21 08:18,Citronella
Envy Gucci,"Yes, Gucci should bring this wonderful fragrance back. Green floral with an attitude. Complex yet in a way simple and very versatile. Perfect balance between floral, green and spicy notes (those stand out the most to me) - the result is a fresh scent that is not boring or forgettable. I find it almost juicy. Longevity is great. The bottle design perfect. I layer Elizabeth Arden's Fifth Avenue and CK One and that ends up smelling similar to Envy but the result is not as complex. Still - for those who are not able to enjoy this scent this could be an option.",01/31/21 04:48,Maomaus

Envy Gucci,"What a nice meeting! What a different thing from current perfumes!

When I first smelled this perfume there was that magic in which I found myself thinking: ""I have smelled this before"". That part of my brain that always searches in the back of my memory was stimulated and started trying to connect the scent with any past experience... This time, however, my brain did not find it.

Gucci Envy is a green floral. And there is no way to describe it better. It is a gentle breeze that brings the scent of sprinkled flowers in a sea of fresh green grass. Its sillage and duration are so good that you can spend hours walking through that idyllic meadow that has been evoked in your mind. Today I have used it again and I have had a ficticious walk all morning, appearing to be a sunny one despite being really cloudy outside. It makes me feel serenity.

Sillage is moderate-high and projects very well for a lot of hours. Its duration is more than 10 hours on my skin.

It is a perfume that, in any case, will shine much more in spring than now and it will probably be the first perfume I will look for as soon as spring blooms again next year. What a great shame that this jewel is discontinued!

A house cleaner broke my bottle some years back which is how I learned it was discontinued. I quickly bought up three 3.7 bottles and two 1.7 bottles for a large price. As lovely as this fragrance is, the $399 and $699 prices online sellers are now trying to acquire for this fragrance is not worth the money. If it performed like a beast, perhaps. Unfortunately that is not the case. The description on Fragrantica is correct. Flowers, metal and minimalistic. Very beautiful and unique. Too bad it lasts less than 1/2 hour.

Envy Gucci,"My first love and my eternal love.

從鹹魚上淘回這隻，幾乎全新，留個念想。上身的瞬間，記憶湧現，上一次相遇，至少是十年前。

以下是我在知乎上回答的——

香水于我，是记忆，也是情绪。

18岁开始用香水，到现在已经快18年，我不介意暴露年龄。未成年便被送到澳洲念书，虽然很多人都说人的三观的形成早在其12岁以前，但那时候的我，除了终于知道独立生活的不容易，也对这个西方新世界的一切充满好奇。很庆幸我在各种场合遇到了各种各样友善的鬼佬，都是长辈吧，他们教会了我英文的典故，以及西方的礼仪。

并没有人直截了当地告诉我喷香水是种必要，只是作为一个从小就嗅觉非常敏锐的人，我觉得香气可以悦己悦人，何乐而不为。第一支香水是Gucci的Envy，可能是哪本星座书上写过这是天蝎座的签名香吧。前前后后用完过四五支，差不多十年前有一次喷它突然皮肤过敏了好几天，便戒了，但它依然在我青春的岁月里占据了非常重要的一段时光。再后来的十几年，陆陆续续买了三四十支商业香，有些也算是挺冷门的，比如Cerruti 1881，或者John Galliano。但相对来说在某一个时间段内用的香水还是比较固定的，于是，每一支都成了一段记忆的承载。有颇不成功的明撩暗恋，有与大学挚友熬夜做建筑模型的亢奋，有打工生涯的辛苦，通过香水，通过嗅觉，帮我巩固记忆。

这两三年突然入了沙龙的坑，人的占有欲之可怕，简直一发不可收拾。如果不是财力有限（qiong），我可能已经拥有一个香水帝国。当我接触了越来越多优秀的香水，也通过一些相关书籍的阅读和同样爱香水的朋友的交流，对不同香味的接受度就越来越广。依然会欣赏很多并不复杂的花香果香调，但嗅觉一直在跟我说，它需要更多复杂层次的刺激才能被满足。

但也因为如今一天都不会只用一支，所以香水与记忆的关联变弱了。开始在网上写香评，可惜没有专门学过，所以没法从比较专业的角度去剖析，多只是一些对每支香水的主香调的感受，相对主观。

除了以上，“明白或者获得了什么”？因为喜欢香水，所以会关注其周边，书也好纪录片也好，本身又对心理学感兴趣，所以会去了解不同国家地区不同人种不同年龄对香水的不同喜好，特别是在工作上，会提前了解下客户背景，选择相对应的香水，通过香水拉小陌生感。

(I’m now 31) So about 2 months ago I happen to find a 50 ml bottle in the back of a small store. I asked the seller if they had any samples and of course they didn’t. So he opened the packaging and sprayed the fragrance.... OMG It smelled divine!! Exactly how I remembered it. I immediately bought the bottle and I am so happy to own it again. I think the fragrance stayed good for such a long time due to the fact that the fragrances in that little shop are stored in the back and it’s a bit dark in there.

It left me all ""meh"" and uninspired, and I rarely wore it, so I eventually sold it on eBay. To one of you, it would seem, because it did fetch a surprising sale price, indicating it was well-loved and ""meh"" was the minority opinion. I am glad to know it went out there and made someone happy. If you are the happy owner, maybe return the favor and pony up one of my long lost loves? Guess original in the twist bottle, Angel the pre-2004 version, Ninja by Designer Imposters, or Oleg Cassini the Jovan version would suffice.

Envy Gucci,"Since I wasn’t interested in perfume in the 1990’s, I can amuse myself today by discovering “vintages” of the recent past, like Gucci Envy. I love green notes in perfumes, from the original Cellier Vent Vert to 1970’s greens such as No. 19, Givenchy III, Aliage, and so when I read that Envy was a worthy green perfume, I picked up a bottle a few years ago. Prices for Envy are going up and up since its discontinuation, but I found a good deal on the parfum, which comes in a beautiful, sleek atomizer.

And Envy has definitely earned its place among my green vintages. The published note lists are perplexing so I will just try to describe what I smell. Galbanum, of the chalkiest and smokiest kind, LOTV, fresh cut grass, and cilantro. A number of reviewers here with reliable noses describe Envy as a sweet green floral, and yet I get no sweetness at all in the parfum, just the slightest fruity undertone of melon. Perhaps the EDT and EDP are sweeter?

The most intriguing aspect of Envy parfum is its green-tinged muskiness, via the cilantro/cumin note, which would seem poised to deliver the erotic impact promised in the ads, but somehow does not, since it always remains a vegetal musk, rather than a fleshy one. After wearing Envy parfum a few times, and being nagged by a strong sense of déjà vu, I finally realized that Envy is very reminiscent of vintage Coriandre, another favorite vintage green (comparing parfum to parfum formulations).",07/28/18 05:15,ex-grayspoole
Envy Gucci,"I've heard Envy was a grape vine flowers soliflore.
Grape vine blossom has a very pleasant delicate scent which is not similar to any other fragrances - something like linden + ether + aspartame sweetnes + orange? + wintergreen. It slightly resembles White Musk by Body Shop but is greener.

I do detect grape vine blossom in Envy, but it is heavier, and more wax-y, not so fresh as in the nature. Like a grape vine blossom scented candle.",06/22/18 09:31,justfloral

Envy Gucci,"I was given a big bottle of this for Christmas several years ago, and initially I really liked it, but after a while, for some reason, it started to irritate me. So I shoved it to the back of my perfume collection and haven’t touched it for a couple of years. I hauled it out yesterday and dusted it off. It’s still pretty, but it’s very white-flowery on me – I don’t get any pineapple or rose or sandalwood or pretty much any of the other notes. And I think I’ve figured out why it irritated me – a) the white flowers take over after half an hour or so, b) after four hours it had mostly disappeared and c) what was left took on a rather sharp, almost-but-not-quite sour green edge. Sillage was very weak as well. I’m going to try layering it with something else to see what happens, as I the first half hour of this is rather lovely. If anybody has any suggestions, I’d be happy to try them.",09/24/16 20:51,TessiiDob

Envy Gucci,"Crushed dandelion stems, oozing green and astringent juices; grassy citrus, zesty and dry. A light, young, fresh lily note without the slightest indolic roundness. The first 20 minutes define a 'green' scent. Then slowly, a mellow lightly musky note creeps in. A dusty vetiver, light wood and sandal, a tiny hint of rose. Individual notes are rather indistinct, the overall composition goes from bright green to shadowed woody green. Too sharp for my taste, even with the more mellow drydown; sillage was modest, longevity ~4 hours.",07/02/16 17:17,HeidiLynn
Envy Gucci,"This ""old school"" complicated, but in a good way, scent is very very 90s. It's converted to elegant and evening usage for me. mufulia describes the initial notes correctly, but it graduates to a mild powdery yet creamy floral/fruit hybrid than it finalizes into a musk that is very tolerable.",05/07/16 17:49,Lola Montes18
Envy Gucci,"Gucci, what have you done? Discontinuing this perfume was NOT an option! There is virtually nothing on the market now that can compare.

Just plain old cool, but like ice left in the freezer too long. Shisheido Zen: blah, should have gone easier with he sweet citrus. like dollar store orange candy. Versace Eros: very , very nice, but where is the pineapple? I think this is the note that sets Envy apart. I can't seem to find a scent that is at once fresh, spicy, floral and a tad sweet.

Envy Gucci,"This is such an easy to like fragrance. It reminds me of a more grounded, younger Diorissimo with the Lily of the Valley and the aromatic green smell. So lovely.

Someone I worked with years ago wore this in my first office job, and on her it always smelled sunny and almost tropical. I never did buy it back then but now as it is so scarce, I feel like I should have.

I think this is fresh, sexy, very wearable by all sorts of people and just very easy on the nose. I do love it.",01/02/16 18:02,hippiechick13
Envy Gucci,"This is a fragrance which withstands the test of time.

My first experience with it was in the form of a rollerball tester over 10 years ago. It started green, subdued sour green giving me the impression of juiciness, fresh wet grass. Almost appetizing. The green stayed with me for around 4 hours. There is some faint floral, citrus and woody as time passes.

I am glad that when i re-visit it after 10 years, it smells exactly what i remember it to be. No reformulation.

I like it more now that i have a spray bottle. It gives more sillage than the rollerball. Envy performs well for all weather and season, although i like it the best during summer rainy day. 10 years ago, there were more green fragrance (i had Les Belles de Ricci and Pastel de Gres for example) so Envy wasn't my favourite. But les belles de ricci and pastel de gres are gone now (or just impossible to find?).

Envy is getting more difficult to find (even on-line) comparing to say 6 months ago.",10/19/15 21:17,AnnaT

First off, the brilliant name says it all...ENVY. Of course its liquid is toxic ""green with envy"" and kept in a slender glass bottle.

Most striking is the hard Hiacynth-punch in the nose. Or maybe it's a blend of Hyacinth and the poisonous plant Lily-of-the valley. I feel very self-confident, I'm sharing a desire to have something, I'm envious.",08/26/15 06:59,fleur_de_mimosa

Envy Gucci,"In the late 90s, Envy was the fragrance I would often reach for on a night out, to dinner, clubs, bars, etc. And that's about 4 nights a week. I don't really remember how I acquired it. Was it at a department store or at the airport? What decisions went into this purchase? Why can't I remember any of this? It has only been 18 years.

I can deduce why this was my choice on night outs though...because the other choices in my ""perfume armoire"" would have been Oscar, Victoria, Chanel 5, Chanel 19, Caleche, Madame Rochas, Miss Dior, Diorissimo, and other classic fragrances that I did not feel would be appreciated by my fellow partiers. And at that time, as a young woman, I wasn't brave enough to wear scents I was sure would make people talk about how I smelled like an old lady.

I would have to guess that back then, I found Envy to be modern, edgy, and appropriate for my age group. Another reason I wore it at night probably had something to do with Chanel 19 which was what I wore when going to more formal nighttime affairs. I thought, with the similar green juice, and the similar coolness, (as opposed to warm) it exuded similar confidence, elegance, and aloofness as Chanel 19, but with a contemporary and less snobby vibe.

As I sniff what's left in my bottle today, I can tell the top notes have gone missing. In reading the top notes up there, they are all ones I like, so I can see how I would have liked the blasts as I sprayed. But in looking at the middle notes, I'm also understanding why I just don't like it anymore. Lily of the Valley is one of the notes I really dislike. I just smell a bunch of green sharp florals now.

It would be helpful for my review if I could get by hands on a fresh bottle to test, but I guess I don't need to recall that badly how it is that I liked this fragrance. I'll just move on to all the perfume that are new to me. The perfume choices I have now compared to the 90s is just mind-boggling. Hurray to the Internet, Fragrantica, and perfume choices!",08/23/15 16:33,Milladane

Envy Gucci,"My second review of Envy:

I've had at least 3 or 4 bottles so far and I have no confirmed information whatsoever as to if it has really been discontinued, except some gossips. All bottles I've had looked and smelled exactly the same.

Dior Tendre Poison IS discontinued. So is Armani Sensi. Most probably Paloma Picasso Tentations too... But Gucci Envy which you can get almost everywhere??? Or Gucci Rush??? In every Rossmann and the like?

How can you tell whether a bottle of Envy is a fake or not? What if it smells exactly the same and as long as the previous bottles that I had back in the early 2000's? What if I bought it at a regular network store and not in an online store? What if the labels at the bottom are the same as they used to be 10 years ago?
The fact that it's not on the official Gucci website is not too convincing - many houses advertise only the brand new scents they have just released or the most popular ones (e.g. Lancome).

What if there are some respectable online stores (not just amazon or ebay) that offer it constantly? And what if I see it every now and then in real-life stores, such as Superpharm ? Are they all fakes? Even if they are, I don't care as long as they smell 100% the same - and THEY DO!!! Which is, b.t.w., hardly ever the case with fakes...

I'd be really grateful for any justified information regarding this perfume though, I'm not interested in gossips or urban legends. I just want to know for sure.

Love love love ""Envy"", I do intend to buy another bottle and for the time being I see absolutely no good reason for saying ""Goodbye"" to it. Please show me one, if it actually exists, I'm ready to face the truth!
Best wishes everyone!",05/12/15 15:28,LadyPilot

Envy Gucci,"Once I ate this huge Zee Sweet white peach. It wasn't too sweet, and it was very refreshing. I must be blind but I couldn't find this brand of peaches being sold here in the supermarkets anymore. Gucci Envy became my craving quencher. It doesn't smell like a peach would but rather what that peach would taste like. It is not a sweet ripe peach, there is still some crunch and some 'sparkle' to it, like a slice of peach in carbonated soda. Of course there's that lily-of-the-valley, freesia and hyacinth that many people mention, but I'm really here for the peach.
I was in a state of panic, when the shop I have made purchases from over the past 10 years, informed me that Gucci Envy was being discontinued and hence all the Caucasian tourists were buying up the remaining 30 mls by the busload. Initially, I thought it was just a load of crap to get a frenzy started, but as I started to check around in all the physical stores, I realized I couldn't find any 100 mls.

Why they even made flankers for it is beyond me. They pale in comparison. Envy is light in a heavy way. it is a strong scent, but not heavy in the way you would select a heavy perfume to wear out to dinner on a cold winter's night.

Pineapple does not go on the lead nor the jasmine either. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if something had dominated, except lily of the valley.

I’d define it as a very sophisticated and chic fragrance. Its longevity is great, sillage is good, it is not invasive and goes well day or night.

Envy Gucci,"I have been so curious to try this ever since I really fell in love with Envy for men.. It seems that I love fragrances from this time period! They were so unique but modern and sexy.. Well I got myself a little 1.0 ounce bottle and I sprayed one spray on myself just to get to know this Envy.. It sure smells alot different from the men's version but that is because the composition is completely different.. The men's is a spicy oriental whereas this is a fresh green floral but I can see why they are counterparts to each other though.. Well it starts out really fresh and has a interesting synthetic like blast in the opening that I find really nice because it is suppose to be there just like the synthetic hairspray note in Rush for women.. I detect some pineapple in the opening but it starts to fade and more and more florals start to come out.. Now I do not have much experience with women's fragrances so I am not good at distinguishing floral notes but I am learning.. I think I am smelling a lot of lily of the valley, magnolia, hyacinth, and maybe some jasmine.. It is a true green floral, a huge cocktail of florals, many more than the ones I listed.. Once the top notes start to dry down and the florals really start to come out I start to detect this gorgeous metallic vibe that runs throughout Envy.. Maybe it is the lily of the valley, the hyacinth or both together, I do not know but it is so unique and beautiful! Than as it dries down there is a hint of musk while the florals still remain prominent but very fresh and clean.. It did not smell overly feminine on me to the point of not being able to wear it..It is basically all florals but they are blended in such a way that it smells very fresh, clean, but not to over the top feminine, of course only if worn in moderation! I heard that Envy was also inspired after the scent of vines and yes it does resemble fresh cut vines and flowers.. I like it because it smells of perfume and not of fruits, candies, or deserts.. It smells like something from its era, very modern and unique but still smells like perfume and not some type of food or cheap body spray.. It is very classy, sophisticated, sexy, clean, fresh and unique.. Oh I miss the times when Gucci use to make things like this..",11/08/13 22:38,dolcethadon
Envy Gucci,"Each time I look at my bottle I want to cry.
Why such a beauty was discontinued????

It's fresh, green, little spicy and sophisticated and ohhh so special to me.
I have so many beautiful memories with Envy.
Envy is not loud, it's stays close to skin but is extremely longlasting.

Love and I'm finding a good replacement for it but still nothing can compare to my lovely Envy.",09/18/13 11:23,soonflower

Envy Gucci,"One of my all time favorites, I wore it everyday in the late 90's for several years. The scent is of clean exotic fresh cut vines.

I loved it when I first bought it in the 1990s, however it wasn't long before this punchy perfume was giving me blinding migraines. In the bin it went. So glad I don't have to smell it any more. It could knock a rhino out!",07/30/13 10:20,FrancesAnne
Envy Gucci,"It's so green, smoky, fresh and beautiful. A real sparkly floral with stems included in a smoky hot lake bath. It dries down to a nice floral musk with a little spice and cream. I imagine a misty garden on a spring or summer dusk, the day after it has rained, relaxing in a hot lake with steam emitting from the water. Two sprays will do, nothing more. for days and casual nights out, preferably at the time of dusk, in the Spring, and Early Fall; crowds are welcome.GREEN the color of envy.",07/26/13 10:15,Pari88
Envy Gucci,"One of my regrettable blind buys from TJMaxx in the late 90's. Let's say the perfume memory is strong. Very green floral and sharp. One day I will learn my lesson with cedar and what it works well for me with what notes. Cedar + Lilly of the Valley = headache for me. I see now that bergamot and pineapple are notes. That may have contributed to it's tartness I also perceived. Overall, it was a no for me. It didn't mesh well with my body chemistry. I gave it away to one of my friends and it worked okay on her.",06/30/13 13:13,hontapocasgreen
Envy Gucci,"Finally, I found a perfume kiosk that had a tester bottle. Big floral scent but not nauseating. Fresh and soft green but still staying floral. To me this is an attention getter. Estee Lauder's Beyond Paradise is floral but cloying and piercing. Bois de Jasmin loves this and Rush. The latter is thick and milky, orange-citrus. Envy feels like fresh scented breeze. Like but wouldn't pursue a bottle. Am afraid to fall too much in love with a discontinued fume.

Envy Gucci,"Funny, I tried this on around ten years ago and it didn't suit me at all, maybe it was the EDP. I recently bought a half full EDT and it is lovely! Lilies and magnolia, two of my favourite flowers and now I have found a perfume with them in which I like to wear, I'm very happy! This is more of a daytime scent for me - work or when I feel I need something green and floraly fresh. I have in the past associated this with more sporty, urban (slightly ritzy!) women than myself but it sits very nicely so I'm giving it another go!

Does anyone know what the green notes are, please? Or does that refer to a particular flower note? I am warming to greens more again but there is a note here that I suspect is in one of my all time favourites, Y by YSL (listed as a chypre fruity though I can't smell fruit in it, it's far more floral chypre to me!) and I can't place it...hm, a mystery...",04/14/13 11:04,miss mills

Envy Gucci,"This is ok, but nothing special. I can see why so many people like it but on me it just smells perfumy, powdery and headachy.

EDIT: Wore this to work today and I'm liking it a little better. It dries down into a nice mellow floral, even though the powdery element is still a little old-ladyish (although anything powdery smells like old lady to me, so that could just be a personal association).",02/27/13 22:45,Kiera79
Envy Gucci,"this is the only scent I can't stand. In the bottle it's not very bad, but once applied on the skin, it smells terrible. not kidding. I had a small bottle but gave it away.

But i did really enjoy wearing it and got many compliment from my friends especially boys. End up many of my friends also borrow my perfume.

It smells really green, fresh and sophisticated. I think it can be unisex too. I really adore it. Since it has been discontinued it quite difficult to get in my country.",09/19/12 21:57,Vastalux
Envy Gucci,"I love this so much, why have they discontinued? There is nothing else quite like it.

I first smelt it on a colleague and had to ask what it was. I went out and bought some the next day and have loved it ever since.

It is fresh and clean smelling with a note that kind of clashes somehow, like a note gone wrong, but this is what makes it special and sets it apart from your run of the mill florals.

If you like a light, non heavy floral with a depth and a great high, green note, this is for you.

Think freesias and Lily of the Valley with something daring and sexy thrown in to just to be different. Fabulous.",09/09/12 12:55,BettyNoir
Envy Gucci,"It's strange because I like this but I also find it to be slightly astringent. Maybe it's because I'm just not used to some of the notes contained.
I say astringent because it smells exactly like an aftersun gel I used on holiday once.

Refreshing, green...flowery and somewhat aquatic. I haven't smelled a ""perfume"" like this before for sure. It's something I would love to have as a face mist straight out of the fridge on a really hot day.

A certain perfumey element that's within the mixture of flowers helps it smell that bit more refined rather than smelling like a hair or skin product (to my nose anyway). I can imagine this would get alot of compliments.

I don't think I could think of a better perfume for sticky hot days when you want to feel clean and refreshed.

Envy Gucci,"Probably the greatest green floral ever made, except for maybe Chamade by Guerlain. This one isn't harsh at all, and it's not too powdery or heavy on galbanum like many of its ilk. It's simply a smooth, grassy-green lily fragrance that pumps out decent enough longevity and still smells pretty natural. While Envy is a pretty ""safe"" fragrance, it doesn't really need to be obtrusive or make a huge statement. It takes some talent to be able to create a green floral so pleasant yet natural and soft-spoken. If you can find it, then get it, at least for reference. Even if you're a dude.",08/31/12 22:05,Grottola
Envy Gucci,"Oh Envy! How I miss you!! I ""envy"" the ones that can still wear you! :D I have to buy myself another one as fast as possible! It's very light, but doesn't pass unnoticed. One of the few fragrances I've worn till the very last drop.

Edit: I could get another 30ml bottle of this throughout time, but I still envy the ones who can wear it because, since it's discontinued, I just can't wear it freely. I want to be able to, at least, smell this for a long time so my little bottle is here mostly for appreciation, not for wearing!",07/06/12 19:18,may_perfumeaddicted
Envy Gucci,"I adore this fragrance, though it goes all weird on my skin.

Opens with sweet, mildly heady lily-of-the-valley and hyacinth synthetic bouquet. Mildly reminiscent of Metal by Paco Rabanne without the intense treemoss(though it's still there). It cools down into a crisp green floral with the odd metallic ""violet leaf"" note so popular with men's fragrances in the 90s. I can't say this is my favorite part of this fragrance(and I'm a man), but the effect is diminished on fabric. It develops further with a green feel similar to Futur.

The big surprise is the drydown, which is an homage to the legendary Grey Flannel. I actually love this about the fragrance, because there's something in Grey Flannel that makes my sinuses start to seize and swell - not so with Envy.

Projection is metallic and 90s robotic masculine, but up close it stays a tender muguet fragrance. Fresh and romantic, this fragrance is still modern and relevant.",06/08/12 13:23,lovingthealien

Envy Gucci,"I had a large bottle of this on my dresser along with my other fragrances when my son & his fiance came to visit. His fiance & I like to sample eachother's fragrances when possible & when she saw my bottle of Envy, she admired the bottle, ""Oooooo, what is this?"" I began to describe the dazzling green, the blend of the florals, how it made me feel like I was surrounded in a beautiful sunny, breezy meadow full of flowers. And I knew she'd love it as much as I did. I was right! She just HAD to have some, so I gave her mine.

It is one of my absolute favorite green fragrances! Several occasions of being asked for the name of what I was wearing because it smelled clean & not too sweet or head-y. Absolutely fabulous!!!",03/29/12 00:20,nananessa
Envy Gucci,"From the first moment I was bowled over by Springlike sweet blue hyacinth over crisp cool tart grassy notes. The sweet/sour blend just gels perfectly. There's nothing sharp at all, it smoothly rounded, and it's upbeat. It's sort of a sweeter kinder and happier version of Mitsouko. I admire but I don't like sad/sour green Mitsouko; I love Envy. It's a quite amazingly wearable and comforting green April garden scent

It lasts quite well for several hours of delicious vernal freshness and then fades suddenly. All in all it's a lovely perfume that makes anyone feel young.

Where has this beauty been hiding all my life and why oh why now just as I've found it do I also find that it's being discontinued???? I'm all mixed up by the joy and woe of it. Guess I can stock up and use it sparingly. Don't like that situation, but it's way better than never having found Envy at all.",03/24/12 15:08,missymary
Envy Gucci,"Green fragrances are on the whole difficult for me to wear but Spring is here so thought it would be nice to revisit an old favourite. For the first couple of hours Envy is pretty loud,fresh and very green, but this bold beginning paves the way for a beautiful floral/cut grass heart. Eight hours in and the cedar and oakmoss make their presence known, supported by the feint sweetness of the Jasmine. Now there is a subtle peppery quality which sits so close to the skin, only those you want close to you will notice how special it is.

This review is for the Parfum.",03/20/12 13:55,Santalrosa

Envy Gucci,"2/14/2012- Gucci Envy is said to have been SJP's signature fragrance, worn regularly on set during Sex & the City filming. Now, sadly d/c'd, but still available via various etailers. Stunning! Sparkling, bright, green, gorgeous, fresh floral. Just beautiful- An absolute treasure to own & wear. This is the frag. I'm most often complimented on :) The bottle itself is an architectural piece on my vanity tray! (I know, I know- I keep it covered, yet close-at-hand, because I wear it so frequently). With the long-lived free-advertising buzz created by SJP (who is rumoured to be a very serious fragranista herself, & created her own frag's- purportedly inspired by Gucci Envy), indeed it seems odd that this stunning beauty was d/c'd... Maybe yet another LVMH casualty? I 1st discovered this stunning beauty @ TJMaxx, was hooked immediately, tried to buy more (etail)- learned it had been d/c'd, so I went a little crazy, purchasing a large supply from Perfumania.com. Stored in basement since purchase (dark- in the cardboard case box)- Now, I have too much to wear in a lifetime! I'd love to swap some excess bottles for various frag's (I don't reside near a large city, and have access only to what's carried by non-flagship dept. stores). What I have are the large 1oo ml./3.4 oz., EdT bottles as pictured (my cost was ~ $75). I'm interested in scents like Miss Dior, Dioressence, Aromatics Elixer, and/or similar strong, woodsy/earthy/spicy scents- Those w/ great longevity & projection/sillage.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Hello fragrance fam!
On today's reformulation guide, were covering Gucci Pour Homme ll. Pour Homme is an easy to wear tea based scent, released when Tom Ford was the creative director at Gucci.
I believe there were three reformulations of PH ll. My years are a close approximation, make sure to compare your bottles with the descriptions to help date your bottles.
*The first and second batches are very similar with the first having slightly better longevity. The third version I've read is not as desirable, as the first two.
1. Pre-2010 The first edition is easy to spot, the liquid is going to have a slightly green color. This is because they used trace natural ingredients in this formula, like oakmoss. The batch sticker is clear.
2. 2010-2016 Some of the trace natural ingredients were isolated after a reform. This batch will be a blue slightly cloudy color. It will have a clear code batch sticker.
3. Post-2016 they reformulated some fixatives from the original formula. This batch is a very deep blue color, with a white batch sticker.
Hope this helps and enjoy the Journey!

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Gucci: Listen to the people…BRING THIS BACK, PLEASE!

This was my signature fragrance from the time it came out until I ran out of my last bottle after it was discontinued.

What got me into fragrances was trying to find a replacement for GPH2. I’m still looking and have dozens of fragrances in my collection now, none of which (including niche fragrances) are as good as this was to me.

Such a beautiful, well blended composition of notes. The black tea and tobacco blended perfectly, with the tobacco not being overbearing but adding just the right amount smokiness to the dry down. Gosh, what a great fragrance this was!

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"The time has come for the last (chronologically) of the great Guccis... a fragrance which, according to the name, is a variation on an older classic, but with a completely different character and purpose... And it turned out very well, which is as rare in the case of sequels as a flash of intelligence in a professional. boxer…

It seems to me that trying to beat the perfection of Gucci PH would be difficult, if not impossible - that's why it was very wisely decided to create an opposite to the spicy classic... The PH II composition is the extreme opposite of its older brother and is also its wonderfully tailored counterweight, worth wearing. named after a phenomenal ancestor…
Pour Homme II is delicate, light, airy and sensual... of a seemingly delicate style, it is an extremely endearing, charming and elegant fragrance... it works well under a white collar, as well as for a casual getaway from countries somewhere in Poland... While the arrangement and color of the Gucci PH cork is intended for evening use (in winter, but with the possibility of setting it during the day, which he likes to do), the second pair was intended to be used during the day... and it copes with it perfectly. ….

It's true that many people, including myself, complained about the poor projection and aftereffect of this fragrance for the first time, nothing could be further from the truth... Gucci PH II is a delicate and discreet fragrance, which means that the wearer's nose gets used to it very quickly, which results in received by the recipient from every touch.
However, since my launch has already been made available, nothing could be further from the truth and there is no need to repeat the application after a few hours, or even more so to spray countless amounts of clouds on yourself.... Ladies from an external source that Gucci PH II is perfectly testable after 6-8 times and smells wonderful afterwards :)
Simple, standard application of 4-6 sprays…
Zapach otwiera się w niezwykle delikatnym otwarciu przywołującym mi na myśl fiołki, jakiś delikatny powiew nuty owocowej, słowem niezwykła filigranowa subtelność… by nie było zbyt słodko całość urozmaica delikatna nuta białego pieprzu, której moc oddziaływania zestrojono z resztą kompozycji… (Panie Jacobs, trzeba było się uczyć od innych, jak robić to dobrze, nim wypuścił Pan swoją wersję gazu pieprzowego o sugestywnej nazwie BANG!)
Tym właśnie mnie ten zapach podbił i położył na łopatki… zaczyna się tak niewinnie i ujmująco, że nie mogłem oderwać nosa od nadgarstka… cóż za lekkość i anielska wręcz transparentność…. nic nie dręczy zmysłów, wszystko zmieszane ze sobą w jednolitą, harmonijną całość, która ani trochę nie nudzi, czyniąc z PH II zapach idealny na wiosnę i cieplejsze pory roku… ten zapach aż rozświetla swym blaskiem aurę wokół nosiciela… wysublimowane piękno, delikatność i prostota tworząca tę kompozycję po prostu mnie zniewoliła…
Jeśli najpiękniejszym miejscem na świecie jest Barbados, to wyobrażam sobie, iż właśnie tak musi pachnieć ten raj na ziemi…

Do tego dochodzi niezwykle pasujący do charakteru zapachu kolor cieczy, będący niewinnym i nieskalanym błękitem doskonale podkreślającym rolę i przeznaczenie pachnidła… całość zamknięto zapewne w nawiązaniu do nazwy w identycznym dla Pour Homme flakonie z grubego szkła, opierającym się na grubym szklanym denku… prostota i kwintesencja dobrego smaku…
i od razu wiadomo, że zapach jest dla mężczyzn, bez konieczności czytania etykiety…
Całość zwieńczono korkiem stylizowanym na szczotkowany mosiądz… po prostu poezja…

Szkoda natomiast, że po wypuszczeniu tego zapachu i nastaniem innych – dobry smak i fason, z którego dom mody Gucci słynął przez dekady został obrócony w perzynę…
Cieszmy się zatem tandemem Pour Homme/Pouur Homme II, bo nic lepszego ten dom mody już nie wypuści….
A jeśli jeszcze gdzieś głęboko w Waszych sercach tli się iskierka nadziei na korzystny obrót spraw – to powąchajcie Gucci Guilty…. przejdzie Wam… (osoby o delikatniejszym zmyśle powonienia, są przed powąchaniem męskiego Guilty proszone o konsultacje z lekarzem 😈 )

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,I had this for years and today I tried it for first time. It was a gift from a friend of mine. It is really nice and easy to wear. You need it when you wear a linen shirt on a nice warm summer day. I thought it might have a weak performance but it was not. It was soft and light but it was there all the day. It reminded me of Five O'Clock Au Gingembre Serge Lutens but Gucci pure home is more rounded and balanced than Fice O’clock. I would say that Five O'Clock Au Gingembre is like a cup of classic bitter green tea while Gucci pure home is like the lightly flavored and sweetened grean tea.,08/21/24 18:16,KwMoy
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"My favorite scent. I had the chance, right when it was d/c'd, to buy like 5 bottles off a clearance rack for 30$ each, and to this DAY I am kicking myself that I didn't do it.

I've never considered this one to be a strong fragrance; it lingers closer to the skin, and for good reason - the mix of scent notes gets drowned out if any one of them becomes ""too loud"". For me, I can pick out the tea, the cinnamon, the tobacco, the violet freshens and softens, the bergamot adds just a dash of ~zest without taking over (which is something the clones have a problem with; more in a moment). It's just a very well balanced and unique scent. If it was to project more, I don't think the way the notes come together would survive.

Despite being more of a skin scent, spray this on a hoodie though and toss it in the bottom of the laundry basket. If you fish it back out a week later - you can still smell traces of it. It doesn't really project, but it does stay put.

I've still got about 60% of an OG bottle left, and I use it VERY sparingly. I lean on two dupes instead.

Dua's Man Card VIP is a dupe, and it's what happens when you try to crank this fragrance up - bergamot takes over. When I initially got it, I could smell all the notes and the DNA was there, but the berg was still a bit too strong. Now that the bottle has sat for a bit, when I spray it, I just pick up the berg. If you want a dupe of this that leans a little more citrus-spice, Dua's is a good pick. I do use it, but not as much as Alexandria's.

Alexandria has ""The Pour Homme II"", and to me, it's like 90% there. For starters, they tinted the juice blue to try to match the OG, so points for presentation. Alexandria's doesn't try to amp up the OG and increase the silage, it's much more balanced and stays closer to the OG. The bergamot doesn't take over, and I get the tobacco and tea notes more than I do with Dua. The only thing is that Alexandria's feels ~slightly flat, and for me, I think it's missing the violet. It's just missing a touch of sweetness, a touch of something fresh - it's just not quite as ""bright"".

Alexandria's is what I go to and use whenever I wanna pick up this bottle, since it's so close to the OG for me in terms of scent and presentation. I only ever touch the real thing for very, very special occasions.",08/13/24 13:36,rs790

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Serenity, confidence. All notes contribute to that.
I can sense black tea (the star of the show, smoky and calm), violet, tobacco and probably cinnamon.
But it's like all notes perform at half-speed here, none of the notes reveals its full potential.
It's their sum that creates the full presence, deep and masculine, but because of this effect, the scent still feels somehow transparent, almost diluted.
So it's indeed like a mirror, or rather a negative image of the first Gucci Pour Homme with its dark incensed aura.
Gucci Pour Homme II goes on the bright side like an ice tea with perfume ingredients added.
Violet leaf, for example, usually turned to moss or petrol in most masculine fragrances; here, it's sky blue. Same for the spiciness of cinnamon: every note speaks serenity because of its tight measure and proportion. A great scent.",03/10/24 19:46,iris
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"One of my favorite blue fragrances ever. It is fresh yet warm and cozy. I love how well blended this one is with violet leaf, black tea, and cinnamon, while being slightly aquatic, with a elegant, clean, musk . I still have about 2 ounces left and am very hesitant to use it. I love this one but i dont use it because it’s worth much more then it smells imo, however it is a great addition to my collection. I just remember when this was $120 now it’s $750 . It makes me want to sell it but it’s hard to let go .I would recommend this fragrance over most to any man as a signature scent, but I wouldn’t recommend paying anything over $200 although it is a collector’s item .",03/03/24 19:14,ZiggySmellsGood
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"I bought a 3.4ml of this in the original bottle with about 15% remaining for $70 which isn’t actually a bad deal. After hearing so much about this I had high expectations and when I first smelled it I was disappointed. After wearing it for a few weeks I realized how much I liked it. Opening is great fresh black tea notes with a little aquaticness. Dry down still smells aquatic and like tea but some of the spice notes come out. Mainly cinnamon and cardamom. Is this the best fragrance I have ever smelled? Probably not. But it is definitely in the top 5. However projection and siliage are pretty weak so I would keep this as an spring/summer/fall indoor day fragrance. Bottle design is also beautiful. I also bought duas version of this. Man card vip. It lasts a lot longer and has better projection but has less of an aquatic note and more of a cinnamon cardamom vibe.

And while not disrespecting either one and honestly not knowing which one came 1st. The Tea for two in my testing is a little bit better in every way as far as the scent (which is the same) popping a little more on skin because they are literally as far as my nose can tell are the same fragrance!..Tea for Two cost more originally.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Back in 2012 I was working in a 5 star hotel in Poland. For the first time in my life I was exposed to so many beautiful smells - perfumes of the guests - but the best smell was the one coming from my ugly co-worker who had bought some random perfumes in Cyprus. I asked him about the name, but he had zero idea. One night we went all out for some beers and I ended up sleeping at his place, because I passed out. I woke up, took a shower and asked him to use the perfumes so I won't smell like alcohol at work. He brought me Gucci Pour Homme II. I still remember smelling it on me for a full day, performance was 12h+ with a strong sillage. I was young (19) and poor, but it made me feel like I'm more mature and rich. Same day one of the guests (amazing milf) asked me out for a drink. I couldnt do it of course, as i could risk losing my job, but it felt great.
I finally got them two years later, and they smelled like heaven, but the performance was crappy - around 1-2 hours. not mentioning the sillage that was just a skin scent.
Gucci Pour Homme II was MY SMELL, I know I would be using it forever if it wasn't discontinued.
Spicebomb does a great job copying that smell and I guess sooner or later I will buy it.

The citrus influence is negligible, violet is noticeable, but tea and cinnamon are the royalty in this masterpiece.
It says black tea, but I get strong sniffs of a warm infusion of roasted matte leaves. I can almost ""drink it"".
When I was a kid in Brazil, we had this ""Mate Leão"" tea (today it's owned by Coca-Cola), very popular late afternoon drink, that was delicious, warm and obscenely cheap.
Reminiscences aside, this is a very comforting, and friendly scent, and as noted by a fellow reviewer, The Moschino Toy Boy has the same tea note as their scent profile ""protagonist"".
In Gucci pour homme II, the main characters are Black tea/ Matte and Cinnamon.
In Moschino Toy Boy, the main characters are Black tea/ Matte and Rose.
I have both and I enjoy them very much, I use Gucci pour homme II a lot less, due to the very expensive replacement price. Moschino Toy Boy comes handy, but I know that they are not in the same ballpark, as the rose is still a challenging note in western man's perfumery.

Keep in mind that GPH2 has macerated longer, has better quality ingredients, but in longevity and projection, Florence Man B 0589 stays on skin way longer, keeping the same profile as GPH2.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Review of 2013:

GUCCI POUR HOMME 2 this is by far my favorite gucci scent next to gucci pour homme 1. The black tea is very proninant throughout the scent which is very very nice i dont really feel the bergamot in the opening a very slight tinge of violet leaf then the scent goes immidiately in the heart notes. In the heart notes the cinnamon,pimento,black tea are present its just that the black tea is more noticable.
At the base the black tea is still there i do get a hint of tobacco i dont know about the olive tree or myrrh as i dont know whats the smell of myrrh the musk barely noticable. My experience on the overall scent is black tea. This is a tea based fragrance and its good very comforting smell i think its a pretty linear scent and it does not evolve that much which i dont mind. When i spray it i imagine myself in a cold weather in a high rise building in a patio chillin and relaxing cold breeze in the air sipping on a hot expensive black tea leaf (those you buy in china town or expensive tea shop not the cheap grocery tea ones) and warming me up comfortably. The projection is poor to moderate but this one stays longer on the skin 6-8 hours on average thats very good and also FYI this is the only old gucci scent that is still in production its a good thing this is still available everywhere and as far as i know they have not discontinued this one YET so grab it while you can i did not hesitate to buy 2 bottles of GP2 all in all GREAT AND A CLASSIC IN MY BOOK.
longevity 8/10 6-8 hours on my skin
projection poor to moderate 6/10
overall smell 9/10 ill give high remarks on this one as i enjoy the overall smell
uniqueness 9/10 very unique i have not smell any similar scent in my collection or any fragrance in my experience.
price vs quality 9/10 you can basically get it at 74 usd which i think is very much reasonable
versatility cold weather scent day or night, works good on summer nights.

Recap 2023:

10 years have passed 😂 and i still have 2 bottles of this, the other one is still sealed, it’s an awesome tea based scent cold, calm, clean and very refreshing at thesame time truly vintage and a must if you’re into collecting fragrances.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"A very good and solid fragrance. I have the light blue greish version, from 2007. The lastest batches were more blueish.
It is one of the fewest fragrances that my wife sensed it and complimented me on it, and not after aplication. I am saying this because I saw some reviews in which people said that this one doesnt have good performance. Mine is more then ok on that level, the projection. Longevity is indeed avarage, a couple of hours tops. In the seventh hour after aplication it's almost gone.
But It has more then enough strenght.

It is in the same vein as rush and pour homme 1, it has the same backbone of those. Different openings, but the undertone is very similar in all 3. Can't remember envy for men, but probably that one is also similar with these.
But especially in the drydown, it is very alike rush for men.
The opeining in this is similar to Must de Cartier for men, very cucumber like. The Tea notes appear after half hour or so.
The myrrh is there, from the begining to end, more pronounced after the first half hour.

By the way, this contains a black tea accord, not green tea note as one would find in Silver Mountain Water, for example, which smells entirely different.

When my supply ran out, I used Hanae Mori HM for a while. It's a fair proxy as they do share cinnamon, violet, and bergamot notes. GPM II could be worn year-round in my opinion, maybe a little less-suited for Summer. HM is primarily Fall scent in my mind because it has a earthier, raked-up-fall-leaves aspect. At any rate, HM is super hard to find now so I wonder if it was discontinued.
Parfums Vintage makes a spot-on, I mean SPOT. ON. clone called Imbue, but I've only bought that once since feel all of their products are over-priced (but excellent quality!) The Dua Brand also makes an excellent ""inspired"" cologne called Man Card VIP which is my current favorite. I feel confident saying the projection and longevity are better than the OG, but maybe that's just my poor memory. (I don't have the original around to compare).
Several fragrance oil houses make fair, but not great, versions of GPH II. Musk and Hustle is better than most of them IMHO. They make roll-ons which are good for sprucing up later in the day as the projection fades.

Does anybody have any idea or opinion why Gucci discontinued this? Sometimes fragrance trends and corporate decisions boggle the mind.",03/15/23 12:52,darian_sparks@hotmail.com

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Upon first sniff, I get a cucumber impression, which presumably is the violet leaf and bergamot. Then there's the tea accord, which to my nose is more green than black tea, even jasmine tea. This intertwines nicely with the chilli. At the base, the tobacco leaf is subtle but adds depth to the composition. The longevity and sillage are a little underwhelming. If the performance was better, this frag would've become iconic.

There's something icy-cool while simultaneously calming about this fragrance. The bottle design captures this really well, with its grey-blue liquid and mellow gold cap. It's not a loud scent - it's quietly confident. This would work well in the daytime, in spring and early autumn. Masculine but in an ethereal sort of way.",03/04/23 04:33,Philip John Costas

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"I look through my fragrances and I see a lot that of blue fragrances . It all started with this one for me . This was what I wore to be different than those who wore Acqua Di Gio . I wasn’t a collector when I got this for the first time so I thought this was as good as it gets in the fragrance world not knowing much about it . It was Gucci with a Gold top and smelled great so I got it ! This brings back memories for sure . While it is Ozonic and fresh it has a herbal accord at the top . I like the light citrus with bergamot in the opening but I love how the violet leaf blends into the dry down where it takes on the more herbal aspect with black tea, cinnamon , and tobacco leaf . I pick up the black tea and cinnamon more so than the tobacco leaf . It has a beautiful musk to it ! It’s a shame that this is discontinued . I have a lot of discontinued fragrances and I don’t where them as much as I’d like to because once they are gone paying $500 is not a option for a designer fragrance ! All though I love it, I don’t love it that much !

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"OMGoodness 😳😳!! The Bergamot, tea & violet combo is to die for & they sit on top of the spices. I’m not a fan of cinnamon so that note kinda takes away from the overall enjoyment/ experience, thank goodness it’s not loud though. I can also smell the spice of the pimento right next to the cinnamon, which I do not care for, but gives a masculine twang.
Overall it is a pleasant scent, completely inoffensive unless you just can’t stand a lil spice.
A very light wearing, 6 sprays & the projection grows every hour. Approaching the 4hr mark I begun to get really bored & irritated with the scent.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Tea can be a very, very difficult note to pull off when it comes to fragrance. Take Creed’s Silver Mountain Water, for example. Venerated by many, but hated by many more because the tea note they incorporate into that fragrance can come across as inky and/or metallic.

Amazingly, Gucci managed to pull this one off. And not just by the skin of their teeth, either. GPH2 knocks it out of the park. It’s masculine, but I think it could be pulled off by a woman easily enough. The tea and the cinnamon are what come across strongest to my nose, and it’s such an interesting blend. Airy and light, but with a deep underlying sweetness to it. When people talk about ‘niche quality’ designers, this one should be right up there with the best.

That said, I don’t think that I can say in good faith that this fragrance deserves a niche pricetag. Don’t get me wrong, the scent is incredible and smells like nothing else on the market today. It’s versatile enough to be a signature scent, and the presentation is fantastic… but for three, four or five hundred dollars? Forget it. If you can find this one for $200 or under, I’d say it’s a worthwhile enough deal for the right person.",10/21/22 13:28,Captain Odour

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"I believe the most similar fragrances I’ve smelled to this are women’s fragrances from around the same period (‘01-‘10).

For example, Marc Jacobs Daisy (og) and to a lesser extent, RL “Ralph,” have a somewhat similar overall feel/vibe in the air, though they might be a bit overtly feminine for the average guy to wear. If the feminine notes were replaced with cinnamon and tea, we’d be cooking with fire.

Another is women’s DG Light Blue (og or intense), which is a lovely, perfectly unisex frag in the same postal code as GPH II, primarily the top (no warm cinnamon base; though there is something in the base that adds a degree of warmth).

I remember smelling something on a few women in ‘07/‘08, which I thought had an interestingly similar profile, but I never thought to ask what it was. I eventually asked one lady at work (thinking it was somewhat similar to my GPH II and that it might be the same scent I had been smelling around). She said it was Sarah Jessica Parker Lovely, HOWEVER I’ve never followed up and smelled that myself, so that could be garbage information.

Otherwise, I’ve always thought YSL L’homme could be a good substitute signature for GPH II, despite not smelling like it. But they are similar in personality and are equally high quality and addictive IMO.

Anyhow, my point is to please ask the women in your lives to smell your GPH II, then ask them what women’s fragrance(s) it reminds them of and let us know in the “reminds me of.” Thank you in advance for your efforts. 😊",04/06/22 06:37,eriksimon

I really enjoyed HiM so I pulled the trigger on a Pour Homme ii sample.

Honestly, I was a little disappointed in the real thing. I would save your money (a lot of money) and just get HiM by Hanae Mori. I think it pops more than Pour Homme ii and I actually think the scent is better as well. Don't get me wrong, I am all for buying the real fragrances whether it be discontinued or it's expensive, or both, but in this case HiM is the winner.

**1 Month Update - Ok, this is a lot better than I had originally presumed. Also, I feel that HiM is only about 80% like this Gucci Homme II fragrance and not better than Gucci. Pour Homme II just has this ""weird but addicting"" sweetness to it that HiM by Hanae Mori does not have. It's a sweetness I've never smelled before, but I like it. So, yes, Gucci Pour Homme II is a really good fragrance, but at the price point it's at today that is for you to decide if you want to have it or not.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"this perfume is the best and most beautiful scent for a man, which captures beauty and discrete masculinity perfectly. Most male perfumes, also high end, smell like a Middle Eastern over-testosterone and bad taste masculinity with a ton of wood in it. This perfume however- is SO amazing, and discrete. Found this for my man, he loved it. Sadly it went out, and I have not found this scent again - have tried to find it amongst different brands, also Armani Privé collections and so on. But male scents seem to again mainly have that either over masculine pushy stench, which for alot of women is a bit of a turnoff as it is just too pushy (hence reminding me of Middle Eastern men whose culture do not accept a no - btw. I am Middle Eastern myself, so it's not hate, but just inner knowledge of the tacky over the top taste - which they indeed have) - or the wayyy to much citrus which can in fact give a bit of a guy who went to the gym and didn't shower, but immidiately covered his pits with perfume to cover up the sweat stench - vibe. Also not good.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"With all respect to Rowan's magniloquently negative entry -- I really enjoy his prose, but I could not disagree more with almost every aspect of his review.

This stuff may not be definitively ""sexy"" (though that's really a subjective thing), nor does it scream from the rooftops at how alpha male it is (it certainly is not), nor does it last until the second coming (though I will say I think the previous reviewer vastly overstates its lackluster longevity). But you know what? It still smells gorgeous and comforting. Again, subjective judgement here, but it is plain to see that I am not alone in this opinion. Yeah, I wish it could be stronger, last longer, and oh, by the way, be AVAILABLE again. But it still smells wonderful to this nose, and I'm over the moon that I horded 3 full bottles before the prices went absolutely ape shit.

My proposal to anyone and everyone who loves this stuff as I do: Please join me in requesting Alexandria Fragrances release a clone of GPH2! In their typical parfum extrait strength, this would be absolutely magnificent, would it not?

PS: It seems a certain very sensitive soul took uncommon umbrage to my audacity for disagreeing with his point of view. So much so that he felt the need to go on the offensive. To this person I say this: Suck it up, buttercup. Nothing I said should be taken as an attack on you personally. I simply disagree with you. Relax, it's bound to happen.

""A review is an opinion articulated for the benefit of others. Some people actually spend money based on the reviews on Fragrantica which is why blinkered, unrealistic hyperbole is not only misleading, but costly.""

Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. Having a different point of view is not tantamount to hyperbole or propaganda. One opinion is no more or less valid than any other. Get over yourself.

""There’s nothing wrong with having an opinion, but when it’s contrary to reality it becomes a delusion.""

Who dictates reality, Rowan, you? I don't think so.

""De gustibus non disputandum est
(which, for the benefit of my snarky Philistine fanboy, means “there’s no accounting for taste”)""

So much to unpack here. But your semi-apoplectic response to a simple difference of opinion has me thinking you are either a bit insecure or victim of serious anger issues -- or both. Why else act so triggered by others whose only transgression was to disagree with you?

""PPS - “Ad hominem” is another Latin phrase you should probably learn, stultissimus""

Says the guy making ad hominem attacks and upping the ante with name calling. But hey, kudos for looking up some Latin to impress us all with your rapier wit. ""Ad hominem"" attacks reduce one to looking like a petulant child, regardless of one's choice of flowery prose. I haven't and won't take that bait. But hey, you do you.

Maybe you should step away from that computer and live life, spend some time with loved ones instead of raging at strangers on a fragrance site. Your unprovoked attack in response to an honest opinion in a public forum does not warrant either the venom or the effort you've invested in it.

Be better, Rowan.",11/08/21 11:01,OntheMark
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Agree with Apulian that GPH II is totally overhyped

As with so many disco fragrances there’s a fan club that behaves like a cult, furiously regurgitating hyperbolic praise.

It serves no purpose when a page like this becomes an echo chamber of febrile masturbatory evangelism completely untethered from reality.

As Cicero would have said, “Cui bono?’
Most likely sellers trying to justify their extortionate prices - or their victims trying to justify the absurd prices they paid for a crappy fragrance to convince themselves they weren't ripped off.

I spent years and years trying super-hard to like this stuff - but it is mediocre at best and performance is so abysmal there’s no point even wearing it in public because by the time you leave the house it is undetectable.

Inspired by the GPH-style packaging, I bought SEVEN goddam bottles of this stuff back in the day when it could be had for the price of a couple of packs of cigarettes - because it was ridiculously cheap, and a good stocking filler for teenage relatives.

There's a reason it was always discounted.
It was discounted because it didn’t sell.
And there’s a reason it didn’t sell ...

It didn't sell because nobody wanted to buy it

Seriously, what’s the point of pretending the performance is fantastic when it’s quite obviously not?

Repeating a lie does not make it true.

Gucci made gigalitres of GPH II, only to find that it was doomed to follow in the footsteps of Gucci by Gucci and Made to Measure - a commercial failure that was heavily discounted for over a decade because NOBODY WANTED TO BUY IT.

Really enjoy wearing the original Gucci pour Homme, but not once have I ever felt a burning desire to wear GPH II.

It’s the answer to a question nobody asked.

GPH II is a fresh gentlemanly fragrance featuring tea and tobacco, with a herbaceous green violet leaf - it's nice but it's nothing special.

GPH II becomes a skin scent within an hour and longevity is maybe three hours max - in Winter.

Infuriatingly weak - with the performance of an eau fraiche.

GPH II is a pleasant but uninteresting fragrance hamstrung by suboptimal performance, as unisex as a hermaphrodite and as ascetic as a pope.

A review is an opinion articulated for the benefit of others.

Some people actually spend money based on reviews on Fragrantica which is why blinkered, unrealistic delusional hyperbole is not only misleading, but potentially harmful.

There’s nothing wrong with having an opinion, but when it’s contrary to objective reality it becomes a delusion.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"I bought my first bottle in summer of ‘07, which was the most magical year of my life up to that point (got my first “grownup” job, had worked hard to get the best body of my life, and met the stunning woman who is now my wife and best friend). This was the scent of that year and our first few years of marriage.

It was soft back then, but not as soft as just before it was discontinued. It was warm, classy and exotic. It was the warm soft cinnamon, spice and tea WITH the airy ozonic/aquatic nuances that made it magical.

There was a guy from New Zealand at my new job who looked like the singer of Trail of Dead. He was a very intriguing person, dressed and behaved much differently than anyone I had met before. He bought a bottle on his lunch break one day and was so excited, he insisted that I spray some on even though he hardly knew me. I loved it and bought my own bottle that weekend. My sister and lady friends could rarely smell it on me (though I was a two spray max guy until just a few years ago).

I rarely think about it, but when I do, it sort of feels like Gucci burned a photo album of mine when they discontinued this (being overly dramatic). When time travel catches on, I’m going straight back to ‘07 and buying several bottles for myself. I only have about 20 ml left.

All this said, I can’t deny that nostalgia (and of course discontinuation status) is responsible for a good deal of GPH II’s current perceived value. If production had never stopped, I bet there would be plenty of “meh” attitudes floating around in the forums about this. If you don’t have memories with it, it may not be anything special and you’ll likely be bummed by the performance (and for the cost, you could easily buy 2-3 of the best frags in existence, and spray all day, with zero anxiety since they aren’t discontinued).",08/20/21 13:54,eriksimon

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Not a masterpiece, but not overhyped either.

Gucci Pour Homme II has an excellent scent. It is just gorgeous, but the thing is... It is so light and so subtle, to the point that it's very easy to get anosmic with this fragrance. The performance is not good, but the scent is great and unique. That black tea is beautiful here, accompanied by cinnamon and a hint of violet and tobacco.

I'm actually surprised there are no mainstream dupes for this one yet.

I just got a tester bottle of this one for around $34 (converted), and I think it's an awesome deal. I feel so much better because it is also a blind buy and a successful one indeed.

If you can get it for a similar price, I'd say go for it! But for those utterly high prices some people are selling right now, nope. You can get some much better fragrances, especially when it comes to performance. If you're willing to pay that amount of money for a nostalgic reason or if you really want it, then again, go for it!

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Gucci Pour Homme II is a true MASTERPIECE! The top notes are one of the best in any fragrance I have ever smelled, to me better than BdC! Fresh, ozonic/aquatic (violet and tea) opening with a beautiful addition of the citrus is literally to die for! The dry down/base is almost like a totally different fragrance, it really goes from ultra light and addictively fresh to super sexy/rich/spicy! Its truly amazing how distinct the notes and transitions are! I get a very natural smelling clove in the mid (not cinnamon at all) that stays until the fragrance is gone(its actually not a natural clove its Cinnamal creating this note, I read the ingredients;-). The tobacco + olive wood is in the back seat while the clove is in the forefront. Its not a loud, annoying, ultra projecting fragrance and I don't think it was meant to be, its very fresh and sexy and does last quite a long time. Its more intimate but the scent trail could/might/arguably be one of the best of all time! I have been testing/wearing/collecting fragrances for 25+ years and this has to be in my ''all time top 5'' (designer or niche, does't matter), its that good! Versatile, its an all season, all occasion and nearly all temperature fragrance (isn't the best for super hot days or the dead of winter). This 'was' a signature scent for me, now that it has been discontinued its more of a special occasion fragrance because its becoming more expensive and much harder to find sealed/authentic bottles. I will easily pay 2x retail for this fragrance, no I wont pay the crazy $300 for 100ml but I will drop $100 or so on a 50ml just to keep my stash up. If you missed out on this fragrance or really want to try it out pick up a sealed 2ml sample on ebay, I have quite a few samples in my collection for traveling.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Green, spicy violet leaf.

GPH II smells like a herbal tea note, mixed with spicy cinnamon, and watery violet leaf.

That combination made spicier with chili pepper and fresher with bergamot zest. There is a very slight bitterness from the myrrh.

The overall combination is a fresh spicy, herbal violet smell.

It's pretty nice and inoffensive. Easy wear for warm days but not fresh enough for hot summer days.

I think people cried too much over the discontinuation of this. It is nice but nothing as ground breaking as people made some of us believe.

It does smell like HiM by Hanae Mori but GPH II has more violet. It is in the same vein as YSL L'Homme Libre Libre did suited me better. Ironically, that one is discontinued, too.

GPH II is a warm weather wear for all ages.

Mostly from this I get a spicy tea fragrance, with that violet leaf offering a green, slightly bitter freshness to it. Easygoing yet unique. Relaxing kind of fragrance, with a blend I’ve never quite smelled before. It's soft fruity drydown is so chill, it's little a little lullaby to your senses. Works great in hot weather too. Also reminds me a little of Byredo Gipsy Water but this is better.

This is a Clove scent.

Go to your spice drawer and do a comparison if you don't believe me.

This smells exactly like clove for the first hour, I could just put clove oil on and achieve the same scent with better longevity.

However, when the tea and very slight tobacco comes in, it becomes a very pleasant expensive smelling scent. It's too bad it wears off at about hour 3.

Luckily I bought my 100ml right before it was discontinued. I will keep it because I really enjoy the clove smell. Pleasant smell, reminiscent of that era. A sweet but masculine clove without the cloying gourmand category affixed to it. NOT WORTH CURRENT PRICES.",07/06/20 01:27,cedar&birch

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Gucci pour homme, the older brother, typically gets all the fanfare. I definitely appreciate GPH and realize it’s place in terms of being a groundbreaking scent for the time period.

The tragedy is that, because of the GPH shadow, GPH2 gets somewhat overlooked.

While obviously gph2 has its fair share of fans, it doesn’t carry the lore of that which gph has.

I’m personally more partial to this. As someone who doesn’t really like tea based scents, I feel like this changes my whole perception of how tea can apply to fragrances. In this case, with the strong tea + cinnamon, I can’t think of a more relaxing combination.

This is like chugging a big bottle of water after a long run - or a nice afternoon nap after an all nighter. It’s so calming and refreshing - while never coming across as a “freshie”

I genuinely believe that GPH2 deservedly fetches the high asking prices, as I don’t really think there’s an applicable replacement. While hanae mori is close, I find that to be heavier - more suited for fall and winter - and less calming and refreshing. There’s also a bit of a metallic or mineral note in that one.

Regardless - this is a stunning fragrance - doesn’t matter your age or style - it’s beautiful. A true 10/10",05/26/20 10:48,picknenders
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"I'm lucky enough to own a 3.4oz and I enjoy it tremendously this time of year (Mid-Spring). It's rather soft so literally impossible to over-spray. However, if you try to go heavier on this to get better projection, I guarantee you'll end up going nose blind. This fragrance was meant to give a smooth and soft sillage... not project like a monster. It's blended so flawlessly with tea, cinnamon and ginger as the stand out notes. If you are seeking a bottle don't be fooled by the hype here. The $200+ prices on ebay is price gouging because this juice is so rare nowadays. But there's a buyer for anything rare. Heck, last month people was paying $30 for a roll of toilet paper to wipe their arse.

As for the high asking price I'm saying not to blind buy at that price. Of course if you already smelled it and find it worth that price then that is understandable. After all, I can see some people falling in love with the buttery smooth composition this delivers. For instance, my wife loves this one and asked me not to sell it. So I'll keep it for now (wink, wink).

Lastly, I have to disagree with those that say GPHII smells like HiM Hanae Mori. I'd say they are in the same vein mainly because of the cinnamon. But totally different scents. Actually I prefer the HiM. Fight me.",05/14/20 13:24,richmilton
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"What's the one secret note that makes the fragcom go crazy? ""Discontini-oud""

Worth the hype? No.
Worth the current price? No.
Is it a good scent? Yes.

Opens with a spicy (chili, ginger, clove) violet leaf that lasts for may be less than half an hour, at which point the black tea comes in. The tea note stays for a short duration, eventually giving way to a very generic cinnamon drydown.

The opening is reminiscent of the smell near street food vendors in the subcontinent -- combined aroma from freshly cut cucumber, tomato, cilantro, mint, green chili, ginger with hints of spices -- Not bad for the western consumers, perhaps exotic too. But South Asian folks might have a different association.

The fragrance is at its best in the first hour, then it becomes any other designer release. If this was not discontinued, there will be no hype around it.",04/21/20 00:47,onlyonline1

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Beautiful. Extremely versatile, attractive, playful yet artistic. The tea and spices combine seamlessly to create something absolutely magical. One of my go-tos, HdP 1899, has similarities but isn't nearly as blended; individual notes stick out much more. Here, everything meshes so that you could technically pick out individual notes, but the overall impression is that of a scent all of its own.

I actually get very decent performance out of this. It doesn't project heavily but it's the kind of scent that draws people in, like a second skin. Considering that, I think it's perfect for what it's trying to do - if it was stronger I might actually be reluctant to wear it.

I have a tiny 5ml decant but I might have to splurge for a full bottle soon - hopefully I'll find it at a decent price.",02/20/20 07:23,Ors

Had I got my nose on this when it was first released I think I'd have been in love with it.

A masterpiece, though? Hmmm …

I think this thread is one of MANY examples of what happens when a fragrance gets discontinued, whether that fragrance is good or otherwise. Notice how the reviews changed from “average/good” to “masterpiece” after it ceased production a few years ago. Is that because there’s a human tendency to elevate what is more difficult to obtain, or can’t be obtained at all? Or in some cases, are folks (outside of Fragrantica) simply trying to cash in and hyping it up to justify the crazy prices?

Interesting phenomenon.",02/10/20 12:03,Br'eauDeCologne

The scent is so perfectly calming and mouthwatering at the same time with the tea and cinnamon. Those ingredients don't sound blue, but the light blue color seems spot on to the overall scent anyway. So soft, masculine and irresistible - fresh and spicy - and so enormously sexy.

Could be a great all year round-scent. But I think it absolutely shines in the spring, late summer and early fall.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"GPHII was a blind-buy for me and I'm super happy with the purchase. It's truly one of a kind with the pimento fumes inviting you in as soon as you open the bottle. On my skin, every note does a bit of the heavy-lifting for a 2 hour scent-bubble and a 6-8 hour skin scent. I have the 2012 batch (2333).

I usually wear it to office and find it a bit too elegant for outdoors. Maybe during fall with a jacket and your loved one next to you, but apart from such one-off scenarios, GPHII truly shines in indoor setups. For work, I spray my shoulders on the shirt in addition to the key points on the skin. After the initial violet burst fades away, you're left with a beautiful, clean, relaxing scent that people might feel is not coming off you but something around you. I had a colleague come over at my desk and while talking to me, have a look at my cup to see if I was sipping tea.

One thing I've realized is that if you're buying these bottles online YEARS after their manufacturing dates, use them a couple of times and allow them a month and a half to completely come to character. It's almost like burning your earphone drivers for 50-75 hours before they start to open up. My bottle has changed character over the past two weeks.

I don't get longevity issues on my skin but the sillage is definitely on the lower side.

Soft, pleasant and lacking any harshness is how i would describe this, in my collection it is a unique scent, I've smelt nothing quite like this before

Its a fresh Green smell with hints of fruity citrus in the open, getting progressively warmer with the introduction of a very discernible Tea and spice mid

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"I've bought this back in 2014. Nice bottle, great looking juice amazing smell but poor performance.
I can get the smell of tea and some cinnamon (I can't get much tobacco). Longevity up to 2-3 hours at max. Skin scent. I decided to wear this on windy days, only that way I can get whiffs of it. And trust me that whiffs are good!

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Just got to put my nose on GPHII, I could immediately understand why people compare Hanae Mori HiM to this juice.

Gucci Pour Homme II opens with an almost unidentical scent of the dry down of HiM. After that, it becomes fresher, some green kicks in, before the whole juice settles down into a refreshing and warm scent, very lovely and very calming. Just like a cup of tea. But this would not be listed as a gourmand, it doesn't smell like a cup of tea that you would drink, but rather an aroma that keeps reminding you the feeling of holding a hot cup of tea.

It's not so sweet as HiM which I like the most, the opening of HiM was so sharp and sweet that it was almost unbearable for me for the first half an hour. GPHII lacks the spiciness of HiM which makes it more suitable for the warm weather, but that by no means it cannot kick asses in the winter. This is an all-arounder in my opinion, warm or cold, office-friendly, casual, and can be worn on a date too. It would simply put a smile on everyone get to smell it, inoffensive and calming.

Full bottle worthy: yes.
8/10

After some wears, this fragrance is headache-inducing for me, bye. It's boring too.

As for the genuine article - there is nothing out there quite like it. I can't stop going back to this one, in spite of having a collection of 100+ bottles, about half of which are more expensive and/or acclaimed. It's just that wearable and enjoyable IMO.",06/30/19 00:44,OntheMark

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"This is one of my all time favorite designer fragrances. I’ve had it in my collection for around 10 years now. It appears this has been reformulated in recent years and has a new distributor as well.
The bottle I purchased nearly a decade ago has a more prominent green/ozonic opening note when first sprayed.
It’s a special scent to me which I wear any time of year. In the warmer climate the tea and slightly woody/tobacco aspect reveals itself more as opposed to the softer violet/floral tones I experience in cooler weather
It lasts hours on my clothes, while not nearly as long on my skin. The older version definitely has more lasting power, sillage, and projection.
Overall, this is a scent anyone can wear and is wildly pleasant.
I will apply once and reapply maybe 30-60 mins later to lay it on a bit thicker.
My suggestion for having any fragrance last longer is to apply fragrance free moisturizer which will absorb into the skin and help create more lasting power for a scent
This was a suggestion from an associate at a boutique.
Gucci nailed it. Have to smell the predecessor still. It’s a rarity now.",05/25/19 21:21,braindead83
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,It has a really nice fresh black tea smell that's perfect for warmer weather. The performance is unfortunately as awful as it gets.

Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"YES. This is so good. My now-husband used to wear this all throughout college and afterwards (8 years and still wearing) so I have had a long time to slowly fall in love with this fragrance. Honestly, part of the reason I fell for him is because he always smelled so damn good! The thing I love the most about Gucci Pour Homme II is that it is a fresh scent for men that doesn't have that sharp ""masculine cologne"" smell. I've realized that I don't appreciate that sharp scent on me OR on men. This one, however, is just perfect. It opens up super fresh with violet leaf but morphs very quickly. It's so smooth, and the tea/tobacco combination is done so well here. The spiciness isn't harsh, just sweetly spicy and perfect for warmer weather, with the violet leaf still present but muted. I can smell this on me and my husband all day when either of us wear it (I steal from his bottle :D) so it's a good performer for a fresh scent without ever becoming overbearing. This is one of those scents where I have trouble focusing on any one note - it all just blends together into something you just want to nuzzle into. There is nothing I would change about this: 10/10.",04/25/19 09:10,ntabassum92
Gucci Pour Homme II Gucci,"Gucci pour homme II is the lighter and more summery version its now discontinued predecessor, the Gucci pour homme.
Even though it distinctively retains the originals classy and masculine DNA, a very strong and beautiful tea leaf note givs it a very fresh and slightly herbal touch. Opening few minutes do give you a slight lemony feel but then it quickly disappears and a hint of woody and tobacco leaf notes join in at the base. Although cinnamon is also mentioned in its notes breakdown, I didn't get any sweetness during it's evolution.
In the nutshell, it is a very unique black tea leaf fragrance all along with other mellow notes that show up in between from stat to the end to keep you interested.
An all occasions, spring and summer fragrance for sure that gives you 6 to 7 hrs of staying power and very decent silage for up to 2 hours.",04/15/19 07:32,irfanabuhadi.1

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"25.June 2025

We have parted our ways today, so I thought i would write a few lines about this little thing. I will start by saying that i really like the Flora original eau de parfum and eau de toilette with black lids and golden letters on either black or white sticker. The other ones not so much. I already reviewed the ""anniversary edition"" in a beautiful bottle, but the fragrance itself was not as good. This ""eau fraiche"" sadly will not get my praises as well, since to my taste it is too sharp, for the lack of better words. It is like the ""Flora"" but with extra citruses and green notes added, and that is what ruins it for me. The creaminess and beautiful flower bouquet is gone here. All i smell is a watery peony with overdose of bergamote, very basic scent in my opinion and has nothing to do with original. If out of all ""reminds me of"" i could choose, then i would say its the closest to Versace´s ""Yellow diamond"" - they share same vibe and feeling. Sadly with ""Flora eau fraiche"" lasting power is not good, as many mentioned before, yet sillage is quite ok.",06/25/25 13:03,passionata20
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"This is my go-to spring/summer fragrance! It's so fresh and bright, perfect for daytime wear.

The dry down is nice and leaves an almost flirty floral scent. I love using it during the summer especially! Very hard to find as I believe it has been discontinued but I found mine at Stoneberry.",08/03/23 17:15,spicybibim
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"This is my signature scent. I have been wearing this perfume literally since it came out! That's over 12 years living with it and it has never failed me to mesmerize me with every spritz. If you do not like green, chypre scents, then this is not for you. This is my signature scent year round, but it SHINES in the summer on a VERY hot day. On my skin, this pulls very green aquatic with slight floral notes, sandalwood and very light pink pepper pop out at the end. I can definitely pinpoint the peony, lemon, bergamot and aquatic notes upon first spray. Once it settles and dries on your skin, GREEN comes out, I think due to the osmanthus being a bit creamy and aromatic, however it remains calm and comes out as more of a sage green as opposed to kelly green. The sandalwood hides until the very end but is what keeps your nose coming back for more. The pink pepper keeps it only very slightly spicy and is very well blended, the patchouli in this is very well blended as well as you can barely pick it up. Sandalwood keeps the scent from being too cloying and the patchouli keeps it earthy. If I were to describe this smell, it would be like relaxing in the horizon on a hot summer's day, lying in a healthy bed of grass with your eyes closed, and the wind blowing against your skin. As you inhale, you catch whiffs of the salty ocean breeze, the vapors from the water hitting the shore tickling your nose. There is a bit of petrichor as it may rain in a couple of days, so the grass, leaves and trees are dewy and moist. You sniff the air and it smells wet and dry at the same time. You smell warmth and coolness all at the same time. The cool aroma of the ocean and the earthy scents of the forest intertwine as you sip an ice cold limoncello(garnished with a fresh lemon peel) under the sun and the shade all at the same time. You would like every summer day to be like this. Both uplifting and grounding all at the same time. I imagine this to smell like an ideal Italian summer day.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"This is the most beautiful scent in the world. It's just happiness in a bottle, it's perfection.
Flora Eau de Parfum is not available in the stores anymore, which is why I purchased this version instead. They also removed Gucci Eau de Toilette and renamed Flora Eau Fraiche so it's now Gucci Flora Eau de Toilette. It's a bit confusing. EDP is still available online but not in the boutiques. The Eau de Toilette is completely gone. Eau Fraiche is now Eau de Toilette and is still available everywhere. Thank God. I'm just thankful since this version is still strong for an EDT. It's incredible!

Short story. I wore it for the whole day and was cuddling with a guy in the evening. When he left he wrote me later that evening that he could smell my perfume on himself. So the fragrance lasted for 10+ hours and even transferred to his skin and clothing! That's actually insane for any perfume and mostly for an EDT!

I love both EDP and EDT, they are almost identical. EDP has always been my signature and my true love fragrance for a long time. I just couldn't find it anywhere for a period of time, so I had to go with this one, which is totally fine! You can't really tell them apart. EDT is just slightly more fresh but still has good performance!

Edit: This version lasts longest on my skin. I've been wearing both EDP and this for some days now, and this one wins in performance, which is weird but amazing since it's cheaper and fresher, which I love.",01/22/21 05:10,mimissekat

Next came the dry down which smelled a teeny bit less fresh, more powdery and woody floral with the fruity freshness. Longevity is phenomenal, silliage is moderate and projection is moderate also.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I am a perfume addict and am constantly blind buying bottles based on reviews of others (bc I live in a remote town with literally no shopping). I have collected over 300 beautiful perfumes. I had to write a review on this because I am pretty unlucky with it. I bought the biggest bottle, just knowing I would love it, and then my mother gave me the biggest bottle for my birthday. Now I have two huge bottles and I will never wear this.

I usually love many styles of perfume; fruity floral to rose oud and niche perfume. This one, however, I do not at all understand the good reviews. I try and try and keep hoping that one of these times smelling it, i will have a change of heart (which has happened before with other frags). No luck.

In my opinion, this smells like the most basic generic boring perfume I can even imagine. To my nose, there is nothing at all appealing about the scent, and I have smelled this a thousand times before... at Target or Walmart. Gucci used to be so great, but now I do not love any of their newer releases. They are all weak, boring, and nondescript. This one takes the cake of boring. I won't even wear this around the house because I would rather break out my celebrity frags for the day that smell so much better.

After discovering how boring I think this one happens to be, I ordered a few more by Gucci, just to see if it was a fluke. Gucci Envy, which was also highly rated, was better than this, but still boring and nondescript. I ended up returning my bottle of Bamboo. Someone gave me (once again) TWO of the biggest bottles of Gucci II EDP. To my nose, this one was the best Gucci I have smelled...ever. Not weak, has moderate sillage and also acceptable longevity. Don't even mind having to reapply thru the day, as it was pretty inexpensive for what the juice smells like. Even though I like Gucci II the best, I still don't ever reach for it. I don't love it.

Just for some reference, my all-time favorite is Chloe. Not the old Chloe, which is REAL gross, and I gave away the day I received it, but the newer version in the square/rectangle bottle. Both EDP and EDT are so awesome that I could cry.

I hope I didn't offend anyone as that is not my intention. I just want to be as honest as I can be to hopefully stop a blind buyer with MY type of taste from wasting money. Another house that seems pretty basic and boring, but I bought them all anyway, is Versace. Maybe I am different than everyone else, but I am curious if there is anyone that feels the same way that I feel about the two houses?",02/24/19 16:01,waskotransportation
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"This is so pretty. I know that fruity florals seem to be especially common right now, but that doesn't mean they can't be good. I actually really like fruity florals, because I find them refreshing and versatile.This one stands out in my mind from other fruity florals (and I've tried quite a few), because it doesn't have an artificial or metallic, cheap after-smell at all (a problem I've had with lesser quality fruity floral scents).

The water note makes it more distinctive, in my opinion. It elevates it to a more airy, happy, ephemeral, cheery scent. One problem I have with some (not all) fruity florals is that they feel more like perfumed water to me...not in terms of longevity or sillage (although that too) but the scent itself. I don't consider myself a fan of stronger, more intense fragrances, but whenever I try the newest Daisy flanker (don't know which one, I swear, they churn out a new one every hour) or another fruity floral, the presence just seems to not be there at all. I always end up forgetting what it smells like immediately after I spray it, because it seems to disappear immediately. In two hours, I'd be lucky if I could get even a slight sniff of a simpering whisper of sugar water from my wrist.

And by nature, fruity florals are supposed to be light and airy, so a lot of those scents end up not having any mileage or presence at all. Gucci Flora Eau Fraiche avoids those pitfalls, though. I could spray it in the morning, and in the afternoon, when I'm walking in the breeze, I'd still smell it on myself, which is highly impressive, given it's an EDT. It's a huge compliment getter too, and very likable. I just spray it twice (I don't want to be the one person who oversprays) and it's lovely.",01/08/19 18:59,SeaAnais

I love a great packaging so I really love the hexagon bottle which makes it so elegant and sophisticated. The only con is, the bottle is too heavy for a 50ml. But of course, I'm not carrying it on my bag so it's no big deal.

I'm not a fruity floral kind of girl. I'm into woody, musky perfumes. This one is definitely a fruity floral perfume. It smells very good but not amazing. It's absolutely an expensive fruity floral perfume when I smell it. More on the fruity side than the floral. I don't think I've smelled anything the same or close to it from the fragrance mists I've tried and smelled before. I was expecting it's more floral since it is labeled Flora. It smells strong for my liking but eventually I get used to it. It screams YOUTH to me. This is perfect for late teenagers or early twenties women with glowing carefree character. It smells like summer and spring with a touch of class and happiness to me, like an expensive potent fruity floral drink. I've used it once to school and I must say I'm very impressed with its sillage and longevity. I went to school at one in the afternoon until I got home at nine, it was still pretty strong.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Have tried this at Shins Beauty Shop last week.So here is my review.I think I do not need that expensive or elite fragrances such as Chance and also Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel or any frags that is related.

I prefer this one better that its other two identical sisters of EDP (the gold coloured) and EDT (the clear coloured liquid).Eau fraiche version smells fresher,way better and lighter to my nose.I only smelled it on a tester strip.Later on the drydown and to be specific,on the next day.I am able to smell a nice rose flower scent along with its woody n leafy patchouli composition.but the citrusy scent remains.

Top notes : Citrus fruits of kumquat,bergamot,lemon and mandarin orange.
All are freshly present and appeared to be quite strong and quite sharp on its initial spray.

Middle notes : Peony,rose and osmanthus.
Peony and osmanthus makes flora eau fraiche smells oriental-like.
Rose flower at its later stage.I mean on the drydown.Lovely.

Base of notes : Patchouli,sandalwood and pink pepper.
Pink pepper enhances the citrus part in Gucci Flora so that the wearer would be happy and stay active.
Patchouli makes Gucci Flora mature and humble or down-to-earth in character yet recognizable.
Sandalwood contributes its femininity,soft n gentle traits to the wearer.",10/14/16 09:17,nurul.ain

This is really, really pretty! It is fresh in a way that is different than a lot of other fresh fragrances. The lemon note is not the most prominent and it is not very woody. It is floral for sure and just a little sweet, but all mixed together with a clean vibe. The only bad thing is that sometimes when I wear this it will give me a headache. I still like how it smells even through a headache but I would rather not have one. So I usually wear this on days I know I won't be going out and can wash this off if I need to. I highly recommend trying this out though! :)",07/12/16 21:33,bekah
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"The name ""Eau Fraîche"" really does this perfume justice, it is a fresh aquatic scent but not in this weird cucumber-watermelon-citrus sense that you can smell so often on people in the summertime.

Flora EF opens aquatic and sweetly green; the kumquat and peony join quickly.

At times this smells ""icy"", like an icy mountain river surrounded by flowers, melting in the springtime.
""Crisp"" smelling, as someone wrote here.


This is long-lasting and the heavy sillage for a perfume like this was nice and surprising.

I usually don't go for fresh light fragrances like this, I was gifted a small bottle by someone. I was hesitant to try this, but so so many people commented on my scent while wearing this.

Flora EF is nice when you want to smell polished.

If you usually don't like aquatics (like me), try this.",03/11/16 02:58,fleurgourmande
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Tried this one at Sephora for the first time months ago. At first I wasn't impressed, but my husband loved it. Now craving for a light aquatic scent I ended up buying this (and because my husband love it and its he only perfume I have that doesn't flare up his allergies). For an eau fraiche I think it lasts a good time (6 hrs on my skin) and the sillage its pretty good with just a couple squirts. If you like sweet light and aquatic florals this is for you. I think its a very young and happy kind of scent, perfect for the warmer months.",03/04/16 08:35,bagaceirababy
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I love this fragrance! Lovely, classy floral to be worn in any circumstances, with enough freshness to feel youthful, optimistic and relaxed. Made me think of a stroll in a summer garden, caressed by a fresh breeze and when I had it I preferred to keep it for casual time off. As the ad shows, it is a scent of freedom.",12/30/15 08:59,AlexGargoyl
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"It's summer here, hot and humid and I've been searching for the perfect ""green"" scent. Spritzed this on in store today and was pleasantly surprised. Very fresh, light, airy and aquatic but still has a feminine sweetness to it with the lovely peony and rose. Really uplifting and refreshing on hot days but when you still want to smell nice. I previously used Acqua Di Gioa but unfortunately that one smells too harsh on me; like lemon detergent. This one worked really nicely with my skin chemistry and is definitely going on my summer fragrance wish list!",11/28/15 01:38,scarlett.angel
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"The Gucci bottles have no labeling on them that distinguishes the regular Flora from the Fraiche, but the one I tried smelled lighter and sweeter, so I am guessing it was Fraiche.

I had high hopes for this one after smelling it on paper and even when I first applied it. It was so pretty, and I got a sharp peppery grassy smell right away, which was funky and different (I am looking for ""different"" for my signature scent). Sillage was just right, not overpowering, but not so close to the skin that I didn't smell it every now and then. I was thinking I was in love.

Then came the drydown. Have you ever smelled someone with a perfume on, and it almost smells like PEZ and metal? Maybe mixed with static? Well, this is what I smell like with most complex perfumes, and this one was no different. In fact, it reminded me exactly of the way Chance Fraiche smelled on me, which was a no go as well. Luckily, the longevity on this was practically non-existent, so I didn't have to be tortured for long. What is left on my skin at this point is just a slight fruity floral, but it still doesn't give me any sense of warmth or excitement...I completely agree with another reviewer who said this is a ""cold"" fragrance. I really need to start looking for common ingredients in fragrances so I know what it is I do not like in so many of them. I'm sick of smelling like pennies!",11/07/15 21:03,Linaskye

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Smells wonderfully fresh, clean and elegant! I feel the warm sun against my skin, the beach in the distance and the distant smell of orange blossoms in the breeze.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"No idea what has happened to my bottle of this, it smells nothing like the tester from the shop and I've wasted £58 on it as once opening, you can't send it back to get a refund! The shop bottle was lovely, fresh and smelt like you'd just stepped out of the shower and similar to the normal Gucci Flora perfume, but my bottle has this odd after smell, like stinky sweaty socks/it's gone off? What a shame and waste of money.",01/08/15 04:07,emtopaz
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Oh no, this is not nearly eau fraiche. Sweet, very sweet. It's sweeter than the EDP version of Flora. Well, it's kind of aquatic, but not in a fresh and bright way.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"When i received my sample first i check the notes: aquatic, green notes, peony and pepper are not my favorite ones so i was ready to pass on it.Gucci creations are also not on my top list. But curiosity took over and i sprayed tiny amount on my arm. And you know what? This is amazing. It's sweet, cheerful and not that green at all. Very well balance between so many ingredients. Eau Fraiche had another surprise for me - longevity. It lasted good couple of hours radiating nice, delicate sweet aura around me (at the end i used whole sample).",06/12/14 00:32,anna.glowacka
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I like the opening - very azonic, fresh, fruity, not overly sweet... but then disappointing, some sort of ""detergenty"" dry down on the skin, just like all the other cheep fragrances on the market today. Can you do a little better, Gucci?",06/06/14 17:25,Lana148

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"This is really refreshing your day, even cold day. It has a blast of mandarin & aquatic vibe. Trully fresh. When i wore it, anybody's around me can smell it even they're about 3 ft away. And they can feel the fresh just by sniffing it from me. I think the commercial should be for this version because when you wear it, you can feels like you are in the Flora commercial. The scent's stick on your body all day, very impressive for EdT. I had to have 1 or 2 more bottles for my own stock. 2 thumbs up for Flora Eau Fraiche. Well done Gucci",05/18/14 23:36,GGLiCious
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Fraiche is the right name for this. This is breezy,and perfect for spring. Perfect for a woman on the go. It's long-lasting and fresh. Great for daily wear. At work,shopping,or an independent day out by yourself.
I was surprised to find that there is no spearmint in this,because,that is the first thing I smell. Not to mention,the mint green juice I see.
This is a great scent,in a great bottle.",04/15/14 04:38,amy1983

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"This Gucci Flora flanker does not remind me very much of the original eau de parfum. Eau Fraîche is closer to the eau de toilette: a standard-issue abstract fruity-floral. Fresh, clinically clean, uplifting and bright. An SSRI frag of the twenty-first century! Or is it a shampoo-conditioner frag? Maybe this is a combination of the two.

These sorts of fragrances are designed specifically for public settings: office-ready inoffensive fruity-floral frags (ORIFFF). They match the scent of Pantene conditioner, not uncoincidentally (also from Procter & Gamble!).

I find the scent and simplicity of this Flora Eau Fraîche eau de toilette to be very similar to some of the Bond no 9 abstract florals. Most of these launches are interchangeable to me and it would be difficult to distinguish them except in a direct side-by-side sniff-off. They all tap into the same memory: freshly shampooed hair.",03/23/14 08:39,sherapop

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I bought the eau fraiche because at that time I found Flora too sweet and heavy (but later on I have become more fond of the original as well). The eau fraiche has been in my collection for a while (second bottle now) and it's one of my favorites for summer. My boyfriend enjoys it as well, which is a bonus. The only downside is that it doesn't last longer than a couple of hours on skin so I have to re-apply after 3 hours, but overall it's a very nice, delicate and fresh floral scent.",01/27/14 06:58,Hellita
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Lately I have been on a fresh and clean perfume kick so I ordered this fragrance from sephora.com in the 2.5 oz size to put away for the spring.I had previously smelled this perfume and really liked it.I find it rather different from most aquatic fragrances.While light blue is more on the natural earthy side and really depicts salty ocean air,Gucci flora eau fraiche is more of a seaside atmosphere and more on the classy floral side if that makes any sense.Its more elegant and I would wear this if I was going out to dinner or was more dressed up on a spring or summer eveing.This opens with strong juicy mandarin oranges and a touch of peony.The floral notes are well blended with a seabreeze accord thats clean and fresh linen like.The pepper notes are there from start to finish so if you don't like pepper you will not like this fragrance but I think it gives eau fraiche a kick.The drydown is sophisticated and the sandalwood is blended with the patchouli very nicely.It is not a dirty patchouli but it gives it a classy earthy touch.This perfume is fruity, floral ,earthy and sparkling all at once.It does depict spring and summer breezes at some beautiful resort.If you like aquatics but are looking for something a little more classy and chic give this fragrance a try.If you like chanel eau fraiche,light blue and acqua di gioia you will like this as well. This is just a tad different and more of an elegant aquatic with more flowers to give it that garden by the seaside vibe.The longevity is about 4 to 6 hours depending on your skin type and the silliage is medium.I am going to pair this with the body shops satsuma body butter to keep the juicy mandarin smell going!Happy spring summer breezes to come!",12/12/13 10:56,tropic sugar
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I just bought this from an ebay seller. When I first received it and sprayed it on, it had a funny smell. I thought I had gotten a loser. Then, I started cooking. As I cooked, I kept smelling some heavenly scent as I worked. I sniffed my wrist where I had sprayed the Gucci Flora Eau Fraiche -- that was it! To me, this perfume smells absolutely lovely (after dry down). Very soft and feminine. Wow! I got a very good buy on ebay -- I will have to watch for more of this. It reminds me slightly of Versace Brigth Crystal and Bvlgari Mon Jasmin Noir L'eau Exquise (all florals, but each slightly different). Bright Crystal is the strongest and sweetest of the three. This one, Flora Eau Fraiche, is the lightest. I love it's soft elegance!",12/07/13 12:56,Yah-el
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"It reminds me good quality body balm with strong green notes. Very fresh, charming, a bit soapy, but still it is perfect for hot season. Why is it worthy? It gives a lot of pleasure when you wear it.

Update: In warmer weather, it reveals its true beauty. This scent is amazing, fresh green, and yes - I rarely use that word - noble. Perfect for office and any formal/business occasions. Miraculously fresh and totally unobtrusive!

Update2: I've tested it once more, just to be sure. And yes, I am sure I love it, even if it includes green notes! Here green notes are totally pleasant, not grassy at all!

Update3: I've bought a small bottle for summer 2014 and I am so happy!

Update4: I highly recommend to wear it in heat. It gives a lot of refreshment, like a cool shower. I feel so fresh!",12/07/13 10:59,Arlene-Beatrix

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"first aquatic I love! on me, it smells like a summer flower bouquet with a hint of jasmine. I used to dislike citrus noted scents - my skin disapproves them, but Flora's is adorable! it's very different with Calvin Klein summer fragrances which also citrusy. On first spritz, the notes gradually reveal themselves, one by one, like facets of a gem. Then they mingle and melt, and wear very close to the skin, with a hint of playful freshness. Flora definitely spells Class. I will go for the full size.",11/05/13 22:36,sekargambir
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,Just tried this for the third or fourth time I'm not sure how many times I tried this but it's really clean & perfect after a cool refreshing bath.

This one is way better & doesn't smell rotten or cheap like I heared from some reviewers.,08/09/13 15:40,Red Rose
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Surprisingly this is my first Gucci fragrance. It's lovely, it's love at first whiff.
I thought it's aquatic, like Acqua de Gioia, but this one is a more beautiful, more sophisticated, less raw, more natural. It has been my summer scent, and I'm enjoying this. Everyday I look forward to having to smell this scent, it's invigorating in some way.",07/12/13 12:35,kikiki
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"My wife has this unusual preference when it comes to buying fragrance. She would go by color than smell. (I mean, the color of the juice instead of how exceptional or mediocre the smell of the scent is)

She bought this last year, simply because she wanted a pale blue-green fragrance. Out of many other fragrances (of similar color) the sp presented her, she picked this one. She said she liked it, and she wanted it, so, she had it.

That moment, I thought this would be just another ridiculous purchase she made, of so-called 'fraiche' fragrances, that smell of calone, along with pale floral notes.

I was wrong. This fragrance is quite an exception. Instead of being 'airy-watery', the 'fraiche' comes from the lush, sweet smelling of citrus notes, plus the florals. It's not caramel-sweet, but rather more to the smell of ripe, sweet-juicy mandarin and other citruses. This is a strong but not overpowering fragrance, feminine, and simply gorgeous.

Both lasting power and silage are great. I wonder what color she'd look next.",07/06/13 09:54,frag-overdose
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Very fresh, fruity fragrance which cheers me up. I'm absolutely in love with this one.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Loved the top notes, smelled so fresh and fruity. But the dry down after about 5 minutes, meh. It smells like something I can't put my finger on. Not fresh at all.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"With full respect to the person who compared this with bvlgari l'eau exquise, there's no comparison really. Gucci is so fresh & way cleaner than l'eau exquise & it doesn't even smell like green tea or anything like that. This one is so fesh & clean & just way too good to not have a bottle of it ♥

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Today it's cold, wet and windy. It's still winter here where I live. So I bought a hyacinth in the pot ( it's in button right now but after 3 days it will show me a wonderful and divine smelling flower), I am looking at the summer pictures, the sea, green grass, flowers. My hand cream from Yves Rocher smells like fresh cut grass and I sprayed one spray of Flora eau fraiche on my wrist. This scent brings back the summer feeling- fruits, flowers with a hint of elegance and sensuality.
Memories of summer. No winter allowed.",02/15/13 12:23,Juliana6
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Aquatics aren't usually my style, however I must admit that Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche is by far my favourite from the Flora range.

I wasn't a huge fan of the original Flora. Something in it just didn't sit right with me. I also found it unoriginal and plain. This Summer inspired flanker is much nicer. It's crisp, delicate and fresh. It also feels very feminine and clean on the skin.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche opens with green, citrusy bergamot and a refreshing ocean breeze accord. There are a fair few fruit notes in this composition, and while they are definitely present, they smell subdued on the skin. Osmanthus and peony predominantly feature in the heart of this fragrance, adding a fresh floral touch.

Due to the watery aspect, Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche seems like the perfect fragrance to wear to the beach or to the public pool. It is a very Summer appropriate scent. I doubt that I would crave such a fragrance during Winter.

Since its release in 2011, Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche has had quite a few good reviews and many fans. I can now see why it is so widely liked. I too wouldn't mind a bottle of this in my collection for the warmer months.

The projection may be fairly light on, however the longevity was impressive. Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche lasts even longer on fabric. I highly recommend this flanker.",02/08/13 22:11,missk
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Eau Fraiche?
You would think aquatic, green scent right away, however this fragrance is more than just aquatic green floral scent. This fragrance is crisp, zesty sweet and citrusy with subtle notes of the florals. (peony, rose and osmanthus). To my nose, the kumquat is the dominant citrus scent, smells so sweet like a ripe mango. All and all, the fragrance is subtly fresh, with soft florals. Lasting power and silage are good.",12/09/12 01:56,HORRIDFRAG
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,There is something about this scent that I like but I do agree with everyone who said that this scent has a weird drydown plus this barely lasts on my skin! WTF?? That's not acceptable for a designer fragrance.,12/06/12 17:40,colorblindlove

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"Very clean feminine and delicate scent that is slightly green and soapy floral. It's not all that sweet nor fruity enough by my standard.

I just prefer the original and the Gorgeous Gardenia.",09/28/12 16:43,nattonline

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I am very fond of this one . I like it even better than Gucci Flora edt.

Maybe because we have summer now and this scent is very clean , fresh and simple but in a very positive way. Simple but not ordinary.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I think my humble collection greeted the arrival of this lovely Gucci’s EDT, a very appreciated birthday gift, with kind of a relief sigh: “Finally a fragrance that can be easily worn during this hottest Italian summer!”. I’ve never tried to hide my passion for creamy and sweet fragrances in general, but really this is one of the most enjoyable scents that stay quite far from that category and still make me intrigued.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche, since the watery shade of the juice, owns a brightness that is both lively and exquisitely refined, sending me reminiscences of some other brisk and successful summery fragrances from the past especially for its sparkling mood: Tommy Girl and Clinique Happy mostly, plus some others I can’t put my fingers on right now. Ideally put beside those, Eau Fraiche feels in a way much more aquatic, even salty and aromatic, eventually behaving like an intense floral dominated by osmanthus and peony (at least on warm skin).
A polished yet very flirtatious interpretation of freshness, that's what Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche is to me.

I can sense kind of an iced green tea note between the almost scratchy mandarin orange-bergamot combo in top notes and the more relaxed and delicate floral heart.. evoking pleasant afternoons and evenings spent on a terrace in some holiday place..
(Light-hearted chats, a turquoise and white strapless mini-dress, drinking a cool lemonade with little sugar in and enjoying the air fulfilled with fragrant nuances from trees, fruits and flowers around).
The blend of sour citrus notes and sweet osmanthus, in this EDT, feels even more pronounced than in the previous Flora releases.. like an overexposed, purer, juicier and somehow simpler version of both that never loses its graceful nature.
In the drydown the fragrance acquires some depth thanks to sandalwood and patchouli - one beloved note by perfumers at Gucci, it seems - though subtle aromatic (citrus) and aquatic whiffs keep coming from my skin after several hours.
For an Eau de Toilette, Eau Fraiche has a noticeable tenacity on skin (about 6 hours in the heat of summer), with a come-closer-and-sniff-me attitude more than a terrific sillage.

This is definitely a soothing, bright fragrance with some slight suavity and complexity to it... an excellent and most wearable choice for daytime wear in hot and humid climate thanks to its citrus-floral composition (and, most probably, it would feel like a joyous ray of sun in a cold, melancholic winter day). Not tender but lovable, not fluffy but smooth… it smells ""young"", yet quite formal too.
The hexagonal bottle - the same of the other Flora’s - deserves a mention for it is pretty solid and elegant at the same time, with a heavy white cap and a little black ribbon running around the sprayer… tout très chic and accurately made, packaging included.

An ode to cuteness!

The sun filled my room this morning, and I observed how beautifully the rays of light go through the bottle of Flora and make a rainbow on the ceiling.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,This is a very fresh scent but something about it really bothers my nose. It reminds me of a candle made by Pier 1 Imports called Oceans.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"such a nice fragrance, floral airy, a little sweet, and smells a little juicy at the same time,lasts all day on me, seems to be the best of the 3 floras (perfume and toilette)by far. It also stays floral to the end nice top note,it's a little juicy, floral middle, I think that's where the green is if any would be but it's a beautiful floral and the base is still flirting with the middle, nice soft drydown, maybe a little green but far from a forest,just a hint, and it does not at all smell like the eau de parfum, no way, this is much softer and prettier through the whole olfactory experience. I think it's the peony in it that is making me really like it.It has that note of peony that is like Lancome's Miracle which is a really nice fragrance but something smells a little cheap at the end, this one is beautiful all the way through.In california I can wear it all year round b/c of the warmer climate, so it's not just a summer fragrance, so i kinda don't care about certain fragrances for certain seasons unless it's cold and rainy and then something with a nice vanilla drydown like The One D and G would be appropriate",02/21/12 19:24,glad57

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche Gucci,"I ordered Gucci Flora via a new yet unrated merchant listed on Amazon. It was being offered at a very low price and I risked ordering it. I was sent the Eau Fraiche instead. I have never worn a Floral Aquatic and hence was apprehensive.

However, to my surprise I loved the fragrance. Its young, its sophisticated and its light. Its just perfect.

Its very Gucci. It jives perfectly with the Gucci brand image. If you are a Gucci girl, or aspire to be one, this is your perfume!!",10/04/11 09:16,rubyscribe

I actually discovered this at work because a costumer was wearing this wonderful perfume and I just couldn't help myself asking what perfume she was wearing and she told me it was a Gucci one but she didn't know the name of it but it had a bottle with six sides and it was a new one. So i figured it must be the newest Flora, the Eau fraiche one and I went and got a tester of this and i just can't get enough of it!
So when i found a great deal on it I just had to buy it.

It's very sweet and fresh, i found it to be kind of a ""varm"" scent still tho. It's very pretty both the scent and the bottle, a must have.",08/08/11 07:25,lizaan

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Diamond Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Diamond Edition is masculine citrus aromatic. It exists as an artisan version of the original Gucci Guilty, that's been blended up to be fuller-bodied and more complexified.

In the cologne facet of this fragrance, you get Gucci's signature Italian lemon. Deathly potent. Stingy, but icy. Then a sweet, seemingly unique mandarin backing it up—with what seems to be like a little bigarade (or Seville orange); and the faint presence of some seemingly indistinguishable fruits that form a ghost cocktail in the distant background. Probably white peach, fig, pomelo, and lime—if I had to guess it.

In the aromatic facet of this fragrance, you get an extremely well-blended array of textures and accents that give the fragrance its depth and appeal. The most prominent is an accord of sweet leaves, lavender, orange flower, pink pepper, and coriander.

The sweet leaves aren't distinguishable, but the body that they add to the fragrance is noticeable and very nice. The lavender is unique and has a beautiful smell to it. I'm not normally a fan of lavender, but this one has been fixed up perfectly, or is seemingly perfect itself. The orange flower seems natural, yet is sweet and perfumey; while the pink pepper and coriander seem to provide the finishing touch with a subtle abrasive texture.

I would consider this a flawless version of the original Guilty as far as a well-rounded composition is concerned.

Another thing to note is that this fragrance is super potent. I almost killed myself the first time I put it on. I had to dilute the last of my sample with a little water. It doesn't seem to carry well in the cold—but in the heat is absolutely stunning and beautiful.

Sweet, stylish—and flawlessly cut. I personally love it, and it will be a staple in my collection for as long as it's around.",03/29/18 17:41,ReapThaWhirlwind

Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Diamond Gucci,"I can understand why those who owned Gucci Envy are disappointed in this series because I am one of them. Even if you just walked by a fragrance counter once, long ago, and smelled Envy wafting through the air, you will remember the difference between its lush and intoxicating bouquet and the much weaker Gucci Guilty series. Even the name is less provocative. Guilty? Guilty of what? Aren’t there enough things and people in life that make us feel guilty? Must Gucci make us feel guilty, too? I would rather people be envious of me than I feel guilty about anything, including wearing this.

Nevertheless, I did take a sniff of Gucci Guilty Diamond and decided if I could set aside my memories of wearing Gucci Envy and the feeling I was “settling” for something less glamorous than I expected, I might be able to enjoy this fragrance mostly because it does have the most distinctive leafy, green patchouli aura of any of the Guilty series. GGD certainly has flaws.It does not project especially well and its longevity is questionable; however, if you really like lemony patchouli with a splash of neroli, as I do, then you might wear GGD when lazing about on a summer day poolside or when in bed with somebody who will be close enough to you (skin on skin close enough) to really enjoy your aroma. These I can recommend.

Maybe next time they'll start over from scratch and pick another Deadly Sin like “Lust” or better yet, “Avarice“. Yeah, how about it Gucci? Just drop all pretenses, get down with your own bad, avaricious self and call the next release “GUCCI GREEDY INTENSE”. That may fit just right!",12/02/14 00:32,olfactorium
Envy for Men Gucci,"This was the sh*t here in Europe back in the day. Absolutely loved it. The perfect autumn/winter scent, dark and spicy but yet soapy clean — and awesome staying power. Whether clubbing, hitting the shops, dating, going out for dinner — it was just so good and sexy. There was so niche market back then, a new release by a top luxury brand was a big, big thing for fragrance fans, as was the case with Egoïste some years before and with Poison and Antaeus before that. And yes, it was a huge hit. So then Gucci… pulled it? Why?! Their best scent, gone. If you can find a vintage bottle, grab it.

Envy for Men Gucci,"Don't come for me,

But I wore Gucci Envy f1 to the office today - a love of mine i don't wear often.

Then half way through the day - all of a sudden a garbage fly attacked me today, I was dodging under my desk, swatting it. It landed on everything cleaning his hands like he was preparing for a feast - till I finally swatted him away somewhere else. Garbage flies don't bother me - ever.

I was skyping my coworker - her response to the fly was WAY BACK THERE??? I'm far far away from the main hall where the garbage's are. Hours later I had an epiphany and I whiff my arm - completely disassociated from my biases and likes - coming to realize that Gucci Envy in its mid to base is reminiscent of that quintessential sweet earthy spicy vanillic garbage heap smell you get when you get close to a mass garbage bin to throw your bag away (Minus the rotten smell that makes you hurl).

I am not being a troll - I love Gucci Envy - but the comparison is striking. I can't believe Gucci Envy is reminiscent of a garbage heap - yet I like it - I even searched the comments with Ctrl + F to see if anyone else noticed the comparison - no one does! Am I going crazy? Cause I swear i'm not - the fly has spoken. Even the FLY is green like Gucci Envy.

Envy for Men Gucci,"Heerlijk is deze, los van de nostalgie het was de kenmerkende geur van mijn vriend. Ik heb er nog een beetje van welke ik 2 keer per jaar gebruik.
Destijds gebruikten we parfums, er waren nog geen databases over.
Nu denk ik bij alle heerlijke geurtjes die in no-time uit de roulatie zijn dat ze wel ingrediënten in zich zullen hebben die schadelijk voor de gezondheid blijken te zijn.
Misschien dat ze er eenmalig mee weg komen, maar niet bij blijvende productie.
Waar ik me het meest over verwonder dat er een assortiment is binnen de designerluchtjes die wel jaren en jaren in productie blijven, welke vaak echt niet de lekkerste zijn.
-
This one is wonderful. Nostalgia aside, it was my boyfriend's signature scent. I still have a little of it, which I wear twice a year.
Back then, we used perfumes; there weren't any databases about them yet.
Now, I think of all the wonderful fragrances that are discontinued in no time that they probably contain ingredients that turn out to be harmful to health.
Maybe they can get away with it once, but not if they're kept in production.

Envy for Men Gucci,"Absolutely love everything about this fragrance. I bought my first bottle in 2002 and it lasted me years. Exceptional performance but as others have mentioned this is more for a date night or a formal event, rather than a daily casual. I’m on the lookout for what would be my 3rd bottle and to be honest I’m not too mad at the reseller price. I’ve paid more for a Creed recently which in my opinion is inferior to Envy in many ways.
One day the world will run out of this and it’ll be like it never existed.. but I’m pretty sure if Gucci ever re-released it, they would reformulate it beyond recognition and it would probably last 30 minutes on the skin. I’m not sure which outcome is worse! Probably better to let it die on its sword rather than come back with no soul like some rancid dog from Pet Semetary.",08/11/25 12:44,micholas
Envy for Men Gucci,"This is a very good fragrance. Ginger, cardamom, sandalwood, anise. It's a spicy, creamy, sweet fragrance. The anise in the dry down is faint but it balances everything out so well.

The ingredients are high quality. I wouldn't have expected the quality to be this high for a designer fragrance.

This is more of a dating fragrance than something to wear to work or an everyday fragrance. The ginger makes it unique. There's nothing quite like it.",05/16/25 17:03,John_Sam
Envy for Men Gucci,"A rich EDP concentration of spicy ginger, alluring florals, spiritual incense, and a sweet ambery warmth (no gourmand sweetness). No distinguishable fruits, no animalics, no masculine notes like tobacco nor leather persay, but also no feminine notes neither.

A hybrid blend & unique palette of green notes (not resembling traditional 60s, 70s, and 80s greens) simmering on low in a boiling pot making everything incredibly warm with a light steam.

People that hate on this truly astonish me. There is NOTHING like this in perfumery - its such a sweet spot of many influences modestly delivering what childish generations don't have time for nowadays; expensive modest regal elegance with conservative allure.

I've always loved this scent, and I still have my bottle that I bought over 20 years ago. However, it is far from being one of the greatest scents ever made or a perfect masterpiece. I think people are gushing over it now simply because it's been discontinued for about 15 years and is very hard to find.

Envy for Men Gucci,"The fragrance is, unfortunately, no longer offered or produced (because what is good cannot last forever, and especially according to the current Gucci philosophy), which is a pity, because it is an example of one of the best-cut men's fragrances in the history of perfumery... I admit that I approached it many times to finally understand it, appreciate it and, as a result, love it....

My first contact with Envy was at the urging of “fellow misery” from a friendly forum (greetings Gentlemen and Ladies) 😉.
Since the fragrance is hard to come by and to buy basically only in online stores and on the few auctions on alledrogo, by happy coincidence I spotted it one day on the shelf at the local drugstore Superfarm (typo intended and intentional 8) )....

I will immediately interject that I do not recommend sniffing perfumes, let alone making a decision to consciously purchase anything other than the fragrances you know very well in this type of establishment, because the conditions for sniffing in this type of establishment are far from favorable....
Firstly, the ubiquitous and subtle in action like the Red Army security guards... poking a suspicious look at my back because, in their view, I take too long to take an interest in the contents of the rack, instead of promptly throwing some Lacoste into the basket and crawling towards the checkout....

Secondly, in this type of place there is air conditioning and artificially forced air movement in a rather strong way, so most of the sniffed smell is caught by the ventilation system before it manages to reach my nostril by gravity....

Thirdly, there are various people walking around all the time, shrouded more or less intensively in their own fragrances, and every now and then they spray something profusely in the blotters or on themselves... in addition, there is a cacophony of fragrances coming out of, as it were, “not quite airtight” atomizers of dozens of testers on the shelves....

It is impossible to sniff in such conditions, it absolutely will not be authoritative, so for anyone who wants to get to know this fragrance as well as any other, I recommend getting a sample and testing the scent quietly at home... I assure you that the reception will be surprisingly different than in combat conditions....
My surprise during the re-test (lovely thanks to Lichu for the sizable decant) in home conditions was overwhelming... the fragrance smelled completely different, fuller, more willing to share its shape and every now and then revealed new previously unknown fragments of the composition.... and there is much to contemplate....

Envy is complex, multifaceted and treacherous as hell... it can surprise as much as an overprotective mom popping into a teenager's room every now and then under any pretense, and with a view to preserving her son's virginity and purity in dealing with women 8)

The composition of Envy is a masterpiece in terms of composition and release of the various elements of the composition... it can rapidly change its face in extremes depending on the conditions, time of day, humidity and ambient temperature... what on the surface seems chimerical and capricious... after getting to know it more closely begins to appreciate over time... Envy has as many faces as users and on each it will play in concert, but somewhat differently.... this endearing play of aniseed, which like a green absinthe fairy circles and moves the senses, combines with a kind of vegetable scent of spices and plants to create a multifaceted somewhat culinary note....

It is a phenomenal sensation that surprises both the wearer and his surroundings... the fragrance is not the least bit forward or unbearable... the projection is relatively lazy and some time passes before it begins to envelop our surroundings with its tentacles, but it is able to move the senses despite the apparent sleepiness of the composition....

I love the subtle aniseed note, which in Envy is extremely balanced and rid of the aggressive sharpness known even from Opium YSL....
It is calm, somewhat idyllic, my nerves are gently soothed by the lazily dragging streaks of once aniseed, once vegetable notes, up to the sweet, subdued, yet remarkably masculine base of the fragrance....
The whole is enclosed in a classic rectangular, one-sided flattened flacon made of thick glass, which is topped by a slightly oversized black plastic stopper reminiscent of the one in the Gucci PH/PH II series, but obscuring almost the entire contents of the flacon... The color of the liquid in the form of an intense vivid green is somewhat at odds, although it partly alludes to the composition and arrangement of the composition....

Envy for Men Gucci,"Eclat 642 (because it doesn't have its own page): Creamy, spiced sandalwood ginger tea. Delicious and solid quality for a clone.

Decent presentation for a clone brand, minimalist but heavy glass bottle, magnetic cap. I dislike the 55ml size, would have preferred more JUICE. I like the monster performance, this definitely has longer longevity than my memory of Envy's longevity. Much like the OG, this for me is strictly a winter only frag, I can't see myself using this anytime outside of that season. Definitely not one to overspray, can get cloying extremely easily, this EDP concentration would suffocate people in Spring/Summer. I'm an expat in Southeast Asia (extreme humidity most of the year), and I honestly don't even know when I'm actually going to be able to use this properly...

I haven't smelled Gucci Envy in 12 years or so, but this definitely shares the same overall DNA as Envy. Obviously, nothing is as good as the real deal, but to echo the other positive comments below, Eclat 642 gets my tick of approval as a solid quality and nearly identical alternative.

As for Gucci Envy itself, I mean, what more can be said? The fact that utter crud like Gucci Gucci Pour Homme (2008) is still in production and greats like Gucci Envy, Gucci Pour Homme (2003), and Gucci Pour Homme II (2007) were discontinued says it all...

Envy, alongside Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense, is Daniela Andrier's finest moment.

Edit: @Antoshka2 is most likely correct about the clone brands copying older Envy bottles with diluted scent notes after all these years. Eclat 642 - After testing this more, it definitely has less incense than Envy, is much more mandarin/orange forward, and has slightly less ginger compared to Envy. It is still an extremely great buy if you're not looking to spend $$$ on a grey market Envy bottle. Carven Homme is a very solid fragrance by it's own right but the cinnamon in that really sets it apart from Envy (no cinnamon) so in my opinion it's not a worthy replacement for Envy. Eclat 642 is much closer.

Gucci Envy: 10/10

Envy for Men Gucci,"This is the first scent I can remember being absolutely amazed by but feeling somehow under-qualified to wear. Like, perhaps I'd need to dye my hair darker to be able to pull this one off. Gucci Envy for me was aspirational. I wanted to become the person who could wear it. I was only twenty-two-or-three years of age, and when I sprayed this on I felt impressive as fuck but also maybe like a bit of an imposter. Looking back I think that's because the first time I wore it in public was at my job at a call center. This definitely is not a cubicle-friendly scent. Not unless you're trying to get your co-workers all unnecessarily twitterpated. Which I was not. There's nothing 'cool' about this. No icebergs or fighter jets or whatever. This is super-warm ginger-sandal-cream. Nowhere to run. Makes the air in the immediate vicinity thicker. Changes the latitude. Makes everyone's blood pump up a notch whether they like it or not.",05/14/24 15:29,chazlamborghini

Envy for Men Gucci,I do miss this. It reminds me of my 20s. I bought both a 20 year old bottle for an extortionate price and a dupe. Neither smells like it did back in the day. I think the dupe people must actually be copying the old bottles with long faded top notes. Sadly this doesn’t exist anymore. Even if you buy a genuine unopened bottle it’s over 20 years old. The fragrance is lost to time now. The dupes can’t even get a reference point to copy. A real shame really.,04/17/24 16:57,Antoshka2

Envy for Men Gucci,"The Prelude: Creamy Ginger

Picture this: a sun-kissed ginger root, freshly unearthed from the moist earth. Its skin, golden and warm, yields to the blade, releasing a creamy nectar—an elixir of fire and silk. Gucci Envy opens with this very essence, a spicy crescendo that flirts with your senses. It’s as if the ginger itself leans in, whispers, “Come closer, my dear. Let me weave my spell.”

The Heartbeat: Sandalwood’s Sigh

And then, like a clandestine lover, sandalwood emerges. Its woody notes wrap around you, a velvet cloak of ancient wisdom. Close your eyes, and you’ll feel the sun-drenched forests of Mysore, where sandalwood trees stand sentinel. Their fragrant breath mingles with your skin, leaving an indelible mark—a promise of eternity. Gucci Envy’s heart beats to this rhythm, a slow, hypnotic pulse that draws you deeper.

The Finale: Whispers of Longing

As the hours wane, Envy unfurls its final act. Incense curls like smoke from forgotten altars, vanilla caresses like a lover’s kiss, and amber glows like embers in the night. Tobacco and leather linger, a secret shared between kindred souls. It’s a symphony of longing, a whispered confession in the language of scent.

The Verdict: A Stolen Kiss

Gucci Envy for Men is not for the faint of heart. It’s for the midnight wanderers, the poets who pen verses on skin, and the rebels who dare to chase desire. Wear it when the moon hangs low, when the world sleeps, and let it weave its magic. For in its creamy ginger and sandalwood embrace, you’ll find a stolen kiss—a memory that lingers long after the night has surrendered to dawn.

Note: Gucci Envy for Men is a discontinued gem, elusive as a shooting star. Seek it in the hidden corners of vintage boutiques or the whispers of perfumistas. But when you find it, hold it close. For in its allure lies the promise of forbidden dreams.",03/20/24 22:15,necrosero
Envy for Men Gucci,"I have just recently moved to Brisbane Australia from NZ. I was lucky enough to pick a 50ml bottle of this on eBay for $220 when I first got here. Yesterday I was in the chemist just below the apartments where I live, and I couldn't believe my eyes, They were selling a 50ml tester bottle of Envy for $60.

Envy for Men Gucci,"#590 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""

Found an old half-used bottle, scent's getting faded, but still familiar enough to bring back memories. 26 years ago was an exhausting but wild time in my life and from '98 to '06 this green juice traveled the world with me the equivalent of over 120 circumnavigations just in air travel alone. Many times I would arrive in a foreign country and go straight into a meeting with no time to go to a hotel room and prep, and go straight back to the airport to depart for another overseas destination. The life of a Yankee trader. This fragrance did yeoman's duty keeping me from smelling like whatever they served for breakfast on the plane that morning, or worse. Still enough scent left in this old bottle to recognize and wax nostalgic, but too faded to wear except for my own daydreaming.

There are many scents from that era where the perfumer threw in the kitchen sink as we say, putting in a little of all the good stuff in an attempt to satisfy every taste. You can read the notes for yourself, so I won't repeat them here. My fragrance collection was small and very consumer mainstream in those days. But Envy was my travel buddy in a spray bottle. Every note on the scale playing, but softly, like an orchestra playing pianissimo, though honestly I always wanted Gucci to pump up the volume on the scent, that I enjoyed but always seemed weak stuff to me, though better than many others (I grew up in the age of Brut and Jade East, so what else would you expect?). Envy got compliments from the ladies pretty regularly, or at least that's how the conversations started.

Curse Gucci for discontinuing the scent instead of keeping it alive in an EDP version. Gucci by Gucci is by a pale shadow, a wraith drifting by an open window. But I'm a guy who still appreciates Bowling Green, Giorgio, Original and Red, Cacharel, Bogart Pour Homme, Paco Rabanne Pour Homme, Oscar Pour Lui, scents whose day is admittedly done, but still project masculinity to me, as does Envy. Would I pay an eBay scalper a few hundred for Envy? Oh hell no! You can get the same nostalgic feel from any of the aforementioned scents, all still in production for under $30, and Bogart by Jacques Bogart is closer than any of those to Envy. But if Gucci brought Envy back as an EDP or Parfum, I'd go as high as $120 for it, no hesitation, and I feel the same about Gucci Nobile",02/28/24 15:22,JusttheFactsMan

Carven Homme is very similar indeed. That one has better performances though.

Comparing this to the other Gucci men fragrances from that era (Pour Homme 1, PH2 and Rush), this one in my opinion is the least interesting, a Little too generic and basic.
Even comparing it with the generic crap that is released today, this doesnt stand out as much. Ok, it is better then many current offerings, yet You still can find better fragrances that still hold up, like Terre, Fahrenheit, some of the Guerlains, etc.

Envy for Men Gucci,"I bought this for the nostalgia.

It used to be my party fragrance years and years ago, would wear it in sweaty Berlin techno clubs, Gabba raves in Hackney and crisp Japanese techno events.

The scent is still as beautiful and serene as it was back then, although my memories from back then are somewhat blurred (go figure..). Timeless and a true masterpiece. I also remember wearing Gucci Rush for men - and the first edition of Envy when it was first released.

Gucci Envy has that clean feel of the mid to late 90s minimalism...think Jil Sander, Helmuth Lang and polished concrete flooring amongst bare white walls.",12/17/23 04:07,number68
Envy for Men Gucci,"This is a masterpiece. To me it smells like a Gothic but crisp mixture of spicy ginger and creamy sandalwood, but with something green in the background, and this green does not necessarily remind me of nature, but of church; hinting at incense but not 100 per cent there.

I found this too serious and for adults when it was released, but mesmerising as well. As I was in my late teens, I did not feel comfortable wearing it, but from the very first moment I knew this was going to make a big impact for a very long time, as it has.

Envy for Men is something unique, distinguished, really creative, a bit challenging to wear at times maybe (it wears you unless you dress formally and look a certain way) but oustanding. Like a work of art. The problem with such pieces is that sometimes they leave you in awe, and you can only look or smell in admiration, from a distance, or envy them but not be part of them, somehow. It took me time to feel comfortable wearing it, but now with age (despite the cliché) I do like to wear it finally...

I will never understand why it was discontinued, and I also find it hard to understand why other companies (Zara, I am looking at you) do not release some kind of dupe, even if it is updated or a bit fresher or a bit less strong. It would certainly sell out.

From the clones that keep on being mentioned to replace this, none do fully replace it. Floris Santal lacks punch and ginger; Vintage Carven Homme is too strong on the vanilla; and Tabac Man Fire Power smells like a pale reminder of Envy's last phase. The three of them do have some nice similarities, but that's about it.

Re-releasing Envy for Men these days would make such a statement...",12/09/23 15:00,Vaporwave
Envy for Men Gucci,"If you want an idea of how precious and adored this masterpiece is...

This seller on Mercari listed a bottle saying ""Tried it- wasn't for me.""

I quickly confirmed the bottle he tried was one of those fake Gucci envy bottles with peeling silver lettering and the bottom sticker idiotically saying 'Yves saint Laurent EDP'. I said ""BROH its not for you because its fake Gucci envy!"" He quickly pulled the listing down and thanked me.

Anything to secure the Gucci Envy name because someone actually not liking this fragrance is one of the most incomprehensible things I've ever heard. Right up there with someone saying they don't like tacos or saying they'd rather work in the office than from home.

I think this being composed in 1998 is what makes this so balanced and perfect, a mix of all decades, all styles, all notes, no IFRA bans, No scratchy ambroxan, no overkill of sweetness to give you a headache.

The best date scent of all time using ALL love seduction notes imaginable Sandalwood, rose, jasmine, cardamom, vanilla. Pure love. Unconditional love in its highest form. Pure Nirvana. Unlike most modern LAZY date scents bland with only 1 or two of the countless notes Gucci Envy supplies. I'm sorry but LNDL- I STILL don't get it... 2 notes lavender and cardamom- big whoop. Such a stupid overrated fragrance.

Envy for Men Gucci,"My sense of smell is not fully back after covid. This has moderate projection, so I'm not getting all the fullness of what it is.
It is wonderfully blended. I have mostly niche fragrances. This smells like a niche quality frag. Like a vintage Guerlain, Derby or Lupin.
It is more youthful than those, more playfully like a Creed Aventus.
It's very smooth with the amber base. I get a great sandalwood and mahogany.
The greeness is coming from cardomom and carnation. But the cardomom and ginger do not stand out prominently, but everything is well blended.
From the open to mid, it's somewhat fresh, green spicy. From the mid to dry down it's creamy smooth, warm spicy.
I can understand why people say it's one of the best designer fragrances ever.
There is nothing cheep smelling like many designer frags today. M-7 Fresh was a great YSL fragrance that had ginger and mandarin orange and Oud. When Tom Ford moved from Gucci to YSL.
Vintage bottles of M-7 Fresh can be had for 1/2 the price of this Envy. I would rate it as good a designer classic.
But Envy is a complex great all arounder, any season any occasion.

Envy for Men Gucci,"ENVY was my nights-out fragrance in the 2000s... I adore it!

What I would highlight about ENVY is the ability to adapt a highly classic fragrance to a young, glamorous and fun profile. Here, there is a little bit of everything, but nothing exceeds; everything is rounded and measured to the millimeter to make you feel sexy and confident without feeling too 'perfumy'. The scent was MAGNETIC... sandalwood and ginger standed out, but even none of them screamed inside a bottle with a design to die for.

Forget about Floris, forget about Carven, forget about Tabac... nothing is comparable to ENVY.

I even cannot figure out that Gucci decide to reissue this perfume... honestly, the world would split in two... might it be the same? so many things have changed in the world of fragrances...

What the? You play too much. Nothing wrong with Red tobacco but that must be the WORST replacement suggestion to Gucci Envy I have ever heard. Gucci Envy is green, floral, warm, and elegant. Red tobbaco is an intense brash oudy cinnamon cigar scent. In no way elegant nor carries the vibe of Envy. Gucci Envy is more along the likes of D&G Pour homme, and Fahrenheit Parfum- Floral, elegant, and creamy. In the end though- still nothing else like it. Absolute masterpiece.

Envy for Men Gucci,"I’m of the mind that this is one of the greatest male fragrances ever created. This includes niche and indie, not just designer. You don’t smell scents like this anymore.

The pop of ginger in the top with the creamy sandalwood is absolutely spellbinding, and as it dries down into more of a sandalwood/incense combo with a slight hint of leather and tobacco… oh man. It is an absolute masterpiece of a fragrance. It’s nearly impossible to describe, but when you smell a fragrance that WORKS for you, you know it. And this is one of those fragrances for me, which makes it all the more disappointing it’s been long discontinued.

Should you buy it? I'd say try to sample first. For the amount of money this stuff commands now, I think blind buying a full bottle isn’t the greatest of ideas, keeping in mind this juice is going to be 15+ years old. It's quite polarizing for a Gucci fragrance too, like I can understand why this didn't work for the general public. My girlfriend for example strongly dislikes this scent on me, but it just makes me love it even more.",02/06/23 08:59,Sauce God
Envy for Men Gucci,"I just got a tiny little vintage bottle of this. It’s so damn cute, it’s just a 3ml version of the bigger spray or splash bottles. I believe it’s the first iteration (based on my research from reading comments and forums) as the juice is a pale yellow instead of the bright green in its later formulations.

After dabbing it on, ginger is the very first thing I could smell. It’s absolutely wonderful. After that, everything kinda blends and I don’t really smell anything in particular except the tobacco, patchouli, incense, some wood and honestly on my skin…the ginger. I think it lives past the beginning stages, but it could just be my perception. I really like it! It does have the life of a typical edt, so for my skin that means even less time as many fragrances just kinda disappear. Oh well, it’s very nice while it lasts.

Now would I pay over $200 for this? No. Would I pay over $100 for this? No. I paid $25 for my 3 ml sample and I’m fine with that, it will last me many years unless I fall in love and want to wear it more. It is nice, but I’ve smelled nicer fragrances. Or at least to my tastes, different strokes for different folks ya know!

I can’t believe no one has made this comparison. But I had a bottle of Calvin Klein Euphoria Intense for men and I was reminded of it in a way. Envy is much nicer, and I ended up giving away Euphoria as I got it for cheap and it wasn’t for me.

I hope I can find a Gucci fragrance I like. I tried Gucci Guilty Black for men and the love edition or whatever (green bottle) and…just absolutely no. And all the discontinued and vintage bottles are just so exuberantly priced. Perhaps with Alessandro stepping down, there is a brighter future with Gucci fragrances.

Envy for Men Gucci,"This is an overall warm woody scent. The scent opens up surprisingly fresh; not ""fruity and sparkly"" freshness, but more ""warm and menthol-like"" freshness from aromatics such as ginger, lavender, cardamon, orange, and sandalwood. The scent becomes more warm and aromatic sweet with the addition of amber and tobacco. The projection and longevity are moderate. It is a nice, warm, and complex scent that is characteristic of 80s-90s designer fragrances (vs more simple/linear designer scents of the 2010s). I imagine classy smokers from 80s-90s (a young businessman in a dark brown suit, or a chic artist in a black turtleneck) sporting scents like this. It is not a safe scent in that it cannot be worn at any occasion, but definitely easy to wear scent in spite of its complexity.

I can understand why some enjoy it, and why some have strong, nostalgic memories of it. If you remove the nostalgia/history from it, it is just that: a nice designer scent. This is quite a synthetic scent that gives me a headache, which also is quite characteristic of 90s designer fragrances, and behaves just any other fragrance in the $60-100/100mL range.

Envy for Men Gucci,"I found a bottle of this in my house and can't remember when exactly I bought it, it was a long time ago though. Does anyone know if the numbering is indication to what formula / year it was from. My is very low, 0698.

Envy for Men Gucci,"Gucci Envy is good. Damn good, in fact. But I don’t think it’s good enough to justify a niche price tag.

I have no nostalgic connection to this fragrance whatsoever. I’ve never had the pleasure of getting my nose on this fragrance until recently, and as such, I feel like an outsider looking in here. Everywhere I look, Envy receives praise that would make even modern giants such as Sauvage or Aventus turn green with, well, envy. And make no mistake; this fragrance is certainly deserving of a lot of it.

It’s a woodsy, spicy, dare I say oriental fragrance that has the most invigorating pop of ginger at the top. The incense still comes out and is one of the high points of the entire experience. In the base and the heart, the woods come together very sharply. The closest contemporary comparison I can think of is Givenchy Gentleman Boise. Despite its age, it still smells fantastic, though I don’t doubt age has gotten to this fragrance, even if only slightly.

If we’re talking demographics, I’d consider this to be a younger man’s fragrance. If you’re in your early to mid-20s, right up into your 30s, I think this would be right at home on your skin. And let me tell you, wearing Envy in 2022 is a statement. Not just because you need to fork out the scratch to afford the damn stuff, but because nothing else in the game smells quite like this. Clones exist, and some of Envy’s contemporary competitors (Floris Santal specifically) are still around; and while they take a similar scent profile and perform admirably, they still don’t quite reach the lofty heights that Envy perches itself upon.

Projection and longevity are nothing special. I’d say it tends to follow typical EDT standards, and projects moderately (bordering on intimately) for about 3-4 hours, before settling into a skin scent for another 2-3 hours. My particular bottle is from 2006, so I’m not going to judge a 14 year old fragrance too harshly for not projecting and performing like a beast.

Would I recommend a purchase of Envy to someone who doesn’t have a nostalgic connection to it? It depends. If you like a sharp ginger note, this will be a fantastic fragrance for you - period. It’s beautifully blended and is as unique as they come. However, I’d recommend marking this one down as a sample before you buy, unless you’re a committed collector.

Finally, I figure we should address the elephant in the room - the inflated pricing for this scent. Is it worth the astronomical prices being demanded on eBay? No. But also… yes? Let me explain. I believe Envy still, more than a decade after its discontinuation, competes with the very best Tom Ford has to offer. TF’s private blend will run you between $150-250 for 50ml, depending on the fragrance. If you can find a 50ml bottle of Envy for around that price, I’d consider it worthwhile. If you find a 100ml bottle of Envy in that range, I’d consider it an absolute steal. However, for this price to be AT ALL justified, it must be worn and enjoyed down to the last spray; not savoured and babied for another 20 years. Like the decade Envy came from, this fragrance won’t last forever. To remember it as an olfactory zeitgeist is only going to make the discontinuation of this fragrance harder to stomach as the years roll on.

Envy is a lamentable loss, but it had a good run. I like seeing that it still has a dedicated fanbase. It is truly, truly excellent and holds up well to this day. I’d consider it a must try for almost any fragrance collector, but not necessarily a must own.

I’d recommend giving JordanFromNZ’s (below) YouTube review a watch, he approaches it from a similarly non sentimental angle.

EDIT: For those of you interested, Covet by Dua is a decent enough approximation, but not a perfect clone. It's much sharper and harsher than Envy is, and far louder. For those of you who have used Envy in the past and are looking to relive the experience for a price that's actually affordable, it may scratch that itch. But for those looking to experience Envy for the first time, I wouldn't recommend Covet.",07/18/22 12:08,Captain Odour

Envy for Men Gucci,"Ok, although i rarely visit this site, i just created an account to help others like myself to find a suitable alternative to this masterpiece. Like many others, this was my all-time-favorite back in the 90's - '00's so a lot of good memories are associated with this fragrance. Ever since it was discontinued (still baffles me as well) i started buying bottles on ebay and searching for alternatives. I tried a lot of these (Carven Homme, Floris Santal, Tabac Firepowrer, Vetyver l'occitante but none of them ever came close to the warmth, depth, classiness & mystery of the real deal until......
i found this VERY good & affordable alternative: Eclat N642, initially there's a notcieable difference between the two (yet not unpleasant) but on the dry down it's actually very, very similar & the longevity is better than the original. I still have 1,5 bottles of the original so i have done side-by-side tests. I only wear the original on special occasions and my wife asking me why i all-of-a-sudden started wearing Envy again on a daily basis was the ultimate compliment for this alternative in my POV Prize-wise it's also a great deal as well and they ship international (i live in Holland, eclat is german). I am by no means associated with Eclat in any shape or form. Just want to help out others who like me, simply can't live without this fragrance nor can't afford to wear it on a daily basis.

- Floris Santal : the top notes are completely different but the dry down is very similar , good quality , weak performance.
- Dua Covet : save your money it's really poor quality and it smells nothing like envy at all.
- Tom Ford Fougere D'Argent : it's a good fragrance by it's own but there is no any similarities.
- Carven Homme , ST Dupont Signature and D&G the one gentleman (Discontinued)

Envy for Men Gucci,"Very, very nice, creamy, dense, sweet spicy fragrance. I smell star anise but none is listed. I also don't get much Wood despite it being the second most prominent accord listed here. It must be so well blended into the creamy amber and lavender that it doesn't come across as a woody scent. It comes across as a creamy, dense, sweet spicy frag to me. The leather note is clearly discernable, so the accord stack on this page should have a Leather accord listed. Really cool bottle design too. This is in my favorites collection. Too bad its discontinued. I have about 7ml left in a 15ml bottle, but I wear Dua's very good clone called Covet. Disagree with @Karim_Ezzat above on Dua Covet. Covet does indeed smell like a stronger Envy, but you do have to tolerate Dua's amped up performance and the enhancers they use as I can see that might effect quality. I also have the Envy clone by Scentual Obsessions called ""Role Model"". It is very good and doesn't suffer the distortion of the strong performance enhancer in the Dua. I also have Floris Eau de Santal, which is very similar - it opens very similar but veers more a bit more green in the drydown, essentially just the opposite of @Karim_Ezzat's opinion above. And its performance is worse. And, laughably, I have to say Gucci Envy for Men smells NOTHING like Chanel Egoiste. Lol. Nor is it anything, and I mean anything, like Creed Tabarome. I have all of these fragrances. I mentioned that because someone actually invoked these as a comparison.
UPDATE: I just found a cheapie clone of Envy for Men called Enthral by EAD. It was brought to my attention by a YouTube reviewer who said it was a dead ringer for Envy for Men. Haven't yet worn it but it smells just like Envy for Men on test blotter. Lol, on the back of the box it says ""EAD - European American Designs and Enthral is not associated in any way with Envy which is a registered trademark of Gucci"".

Envy for Men Gucci,"Really lovely ginger incense scent. But one that I’ve bought and sold twice. I love the smell. I just don’t know if I want to smell like it myself. I’ve realised I gravitate away from scents that smell of one or two notes predominantly (I know there are tons more in this but I get more of the two), in favour of scents that are blended so well it’s harder to pick out one or two notes. Also this isn’t one I grew up with so there’s no tie to the fragrance. It is a beauty though. Ginger, spicy almost barbershop incense.

I just wish I could have tried this in its prime. Do I recommend? Well with the price hikes for discontinued I’d say not. While a nice subtle cedar, there does almost seem a small amount of cypress but not listed. It comes across as almost a smooth cypress cedar scent.

Envy for Men Gucci,"I actually threw out a 3/4 full large bottle of this 5 years ago that I had got a bit bored of many years earlier. It was just gathering dust. This was before I got into collecting fragrances. I remember wearing it every day to work etc and I always thought it was a bit over the top and sickly. On reflection I think it was just too heavy a scent for the hot tropical climate I lived in at the time. I think I replaced it with something fresher and less spicy.

Absolutely makes me feel sick when I see what it’s going for on ebay now!! It certainly was like nothing else I had smelt at the time, and the only modern scent I have come across that somewhat reminds me of it is Cactus Azul by niche house Fueguia 1833 (which I love, ironically). So was Gucci Envy unique? I think so yes, but does it deserve this cult like status? No, I don’t recall it being that particularly special. Maybe I would have appreciated it more living in a much colder climate like Melbourne where I live these days.",04/25/21 05:27,ElCaptain

Envy for Men Gucci,"One of my all time favorite fragrances that is sadly long discontinued and very, very overpriced as a result. It's warmth is just something that I wish I could be smelling all of the time, but because of its price I can't afford to wear this one anywhere near as frequently as I'd like.

We have this fresh sort of opening, but the top notes are nearly instantly overpowered by the rich, spicy, ambery, sexy base notes and depending on which batch you got this may also contain a massive dose of incense which I absolutely adore. The first formulation also has this smokey woody note that reminds me of a few other designer fragrances I own a little bit: Bentley for Men Intense and Absolute, and YSL M7 Oud Absolu. Another key note here is the very intense and creamy sandalwood note, which I don't think this fragrance gets enough love for having such a great sandalwood. For a designer release, I believe this was pretty ambitious which makes sense since Tom Ford was the head of creative at the time.

Overall, this is probably my all time favorite fragrance, I wish I could use it more. Dua's Covet is absolutely outstanding and really nails the sandalwood aspect but misses some of the finer details. Overall, I would say it's about 90% similar to the less dark batches of Envy where the incense was toned down. I'll continue to use that and only bust out the real thing for special occasions until Gucci realizes their mistake and brings back this beautiful fragrance, hopefully along with Gucci Rush, Gucci Nobile, and Gucci Pour Homme I and II.",03/06/21 21:54,Marcjohn86

Envy for Men Gucci,"One of the best incense I have ever felt. It has a seductive, dark and spicy sweetness that instantly captivated me.

Opens with notes of lavender and a peppery orange, enriched with cardamom. In a few minutes the heart begins to emerge... the sweetness becomes more evident with the carnation, jasmine and the rose, creating a spicy floral accord. But the best is yet to come.

The dry down is incredible. Smooth and warm, slightly spicy and sharp at the same time. Ginger, incense, amber, tobacco and vanilla with a woody background (rich in sandalwood, mahogany and patchouli) create an acrid/sweet/smoky accord.

It's heady but at the same time soft, comforting and exciting... it's really hypnotic. Longevity and sillage are medium and require mild temperatures. It's elegant, but not formal.

Envy for Men Gucci,"Very dense and complex aroma: rare perfumes of so many notes announced REALLY make it possible to feel almost all of them distinctly (until today I have only experienced about 4 frags like this, including this one). The initial explosion of Gucci Envy already announces this possibility: extremely rich (and naturally confused), where all those notes from the grid (I said them all in a sincere way, they're virtually all there) can be felt going back and forth within smell, with a very high green tone on top of the general madness.

At dry-down, the game ends and it all gets more defined, opening with the following chords:
1) in greater volume it becomes a bitter and incensed green, strongly seasoned (black pepper and ginger are easily felt);
2) in a smaller volume and assisting the first chord above, there is a chord of the base notes - amber tobacco / cardamom, leathered, woody, mossy.

The high quality of ingredients conveys reliability for the notes, but the undeniable excess plus the use of one too many ""love / hate"" notes (like too much pepper) delivers a result that is too aggressively ahead of the curve and leaves versatility way restricted, and restricted versatility from a designer point of view makes the the discontinuation very understandable.

Envy for Men Gucci,"★★★★★

When something is a link between you and the version of you in the past, it surely is a precious thing. When that link is taken away from you, it almost becomes an urban legend. A myth.

I’ll try to be grounded, and talk about Envy without thinking it’s rarity and high price on the net. It’s a beautiful mass appealing designer. It’s unique, easy on the nose, sensual and refreshing at the same time. The gingery sweetness is contrasted cleverly with its oriental woody character. It’s that ginger that makes me think of a total black Japanese minimalistic outfit, an aesthetic I love.

It’s not a mind blowing smell, then again it was not intended to be. A massively successful designer that conquered the 00s. That’s it!

I am not encouraging anyone to pay a high price for envy. I found a bottle at a moderate price by accident. Then again I understand how precious this memory link to the past can be for some people. That’s the beauty of fragrance.

I’ll wrap this up by saying that it’s not a beast mode fragrance. Lasts long, but projects discreetly. One of the best designers for men, yes, but there are some other designers that have been really mind blowing (looking at you By Man, wherever you’re hiding)",10/17/19 11:22,Cerulean

Envy for Men Gucci,"Ssg.
I stopped trading with Perfume Parlour. Their copy of Acqua Di Parma Oud is fantastic, but they’re so unreliable,and have sent wrongly labelled perfumes on a few occasions, including the ADG Oud. The last mistake they made, I had to pay for the postage.
To be honest. I’d now rather save up and buy the real deal, as the money I’ve wasted on companies like this, and the Lattafa and Ard al Zaafarans of this world easily equates to the cost of a couple of bottles of Roja Dove and/or Tom Fords.

-original pale yellow
-2nd light pale green

the pale yellow one is the one with the spicy ginger in the top notes,and the rich real sandalwood in the drydown, it's the best one.
the bright green one is more incense heavy I think, it's less gingery and more smokey, or dusty, ?...it's definitely a little different, it's missing that spicy ginger as someone said in their review,....""a fresh ginger that says Let's Party!!""",05/22/19 18:21,FragChronic

Envy for Men Gucci,"Dear Gucci Envy,

Why did you leave me without a trace?
Everything was going perfectly and then...POOF!
Gone.
Never to be seen or heard from again.
You just disappeared into the ether like a ghost.

I adored you.
I treated you like royalty.
We were together every moment of every day.
Nothing came between us and nothing came before you.

Oh sure, now I spend time with Carven Homme and Floris Santal every once in a while.
But they can never be you, just as a swimming pool can never be the ocean.
They’re just vague reminders of the love we shared.

Of course I’m heartbroken and angry with you.
But I’d forgive you and ask no questions if you came back to me.
I’m waiting for you with open arms.

I Love You Forever,
Me

The closest I've came to Envy is the orginal Carven Homme. And Floris Santal.
Here in New York we pretty much can find anything in the grey market but I've yet to see a bottle of 100ml or even a 50ml of Envy.
I'd even take the dark green version of Envy - not that it's bad by any means. I just prefer the light yellow bottle.
I wonder even if they still had the formula and even Tom Ford back - could they even make it the same.

Envy for Men Gucci,"Yeah, it’s literally basically gone on me after a few hours... this is a fairly gigantic bummer to me... may may be sitting on the skin for a little longer... then it’s just gone. I tried it with some Vaseline, and it kept the opening around a bit longer for sure.... then it just fades away to nothingness... as amazing as this smells (and it has a cool bottle) I can’t really understand how this could possibly project more than arms reach for anyone... and the fact that it is simply disappearing is insane to me. I know it’s and EDT, but I have some EDT’s that certainly last nearly all day... and some EdP’s that literally may last on clothing for a week!

If I spray this on fabric... it is GONE in about 45 minutes or so... so WTF? I believe I have a bottle of the pale green, it’s sort of yellow, mostly green for sure... it has little floating particles in it, which I’ve read other Gucci Envy owners have in their bottles, so it’s probably Ford’s propensity for natural ingredients doing something inside....

But the price:performance ratio here so far is actually depressing....

I’m really happy I got this for a good price... and it smells so amazing and looks great in the collection... lol but if even sprays on a Vaselined neck don’t work... then why in the fuck would I not sell this for a 300-400$ profit?

I’m not sure how many of the comments on here are people who remember anything about the performance of this and are mainly attaching beast level to their memories of this smell...

This isn’t cool how this is going... no other frag in my entire collection works like this... if have body mists that perform better.... so what’s up?

EDIT: just now I sprayed 5 sprays into the same spot on a piece of fabric and put it on my desk... so I’ll see how long it can be detected....

EDIT 2: alright... so I can still smell the 5 big sprays I put onto a pair of socks and went out all afternoon and left them on my desk... I don’t really understand what’s up here... because one spray on each side of a tshirt and a jacket I did yesterday, then went out and walked around for a few hours (it’s really cold right now in Toronto) and seemingly not a single trace could be detected. Still don’t know what’s going on here... I’ll give it a few more tests before it’s set in stone.... but again, at the price per spray (as I have a 98% full 3.4 bottle) is insanity, and 6 sprays anytime I try to wear this isn’t going to work... I’d rather sell it and then buy every clone of envy ever made to find the best one.",01/30/19 11:03,zorba_colin69

Envy for Men Gucci,"Yeah... wow. Finally got my hands on a bottle of this today!!!! Found a 3.4 of the lighter green version! Oh man, didn’t really know what I was expecting... just hoped it lived up to all of you on here proclaiming it as a masterpiece...

I think it probably is... this smells super super awesome. It’s hard to describe the smell, it’s different than anything else in my collection... it’s definitly woody, peppery, with some floral action behind all that. This is really really really good stuff.

It must be a little subliminal with the green juice, but my first spray when I got home today, so my first time smelling this ever, it reminded me somehow of pickles hah. Good ones though and not a vinegar/alcohol smell, but that mysterious, sweet, pickled strange vegetable from a far off land...

Pretty captivating and I haven’t warn this out in public yet hah.

EDIT: Hmmmmmm, so this seems to be performing, really badly? 3 or 4 sprays on my neck, one each on my wrists, a shot on my shirt and jacket... on the clothes it’s almost immediately gone. After three hours or so I can smell it right where I blasted my wrist... seemingly my neck smells like nothing, and I’m not sure if it was really projecting at all since I left the house... if I can barely smell myself, surely no one else can smell me...


This is disappointing on a fairly different level lol. This smells incredible, definitly the only thing I’ve ever smelt like this... but if after 6 sprays or more in total and it’s gone in 3 hours.... wtf? Not usable at the price per ml basically..... hmmm I’m going to give it another day or too and see if it gets any better but I mean... today was the big test to see if it was as awesome as everyone says.... but if this won’t last beyond an hour or so with any strength, I definitly don’t see the point.

I was getting wiffs of it when I walked around, but it seems to be gone, I sniffed the collar of my shirt right now... barely detectable... so anyone who actually has this and isn’t just remembering... what’s up?",01/28/19 17:29,zorba_colin69

Envy for Men Gucci,"I love this scent and am disappointed that it is no longer in production.

I was excited to hear that there is a company called Perfume Parlour, here in the UK, that supposedly makes good copies of many fragrances, including Envy.

The reviews of other scents they produced seemed to be largely very positive, including 7 reviews of PP's version of Envy, which I guess could easily have been fabricated...!

On receipt of their version of Envy, I was VERY disappointed it did not even closely resemble it!! They supposedly use gas liquid chromatography to put the fragrances together, I don't believe this judging by the result.

I was equally disappointed by their response when I said as much. They said ""It is very unlikely that we would have got the scent wrong as we have sold many of the same and not had a single complaint thus far."" What arrogant b*****ds!! They have got it VERY wrong, so don't waste your money on them, as you will be sorely disappointed as I was.

Envy for Men Gucci,"Gucci Envy for Men is one of the more hyped recently-discontinued men's fragrances, a highlight of Tom Ford's stewardship of Gucci.

A mix of citrus, ginger, amber, rose, and incense, I detect mostly the spicy side of the ginger and incense mix, not being distracted by too much else. Ginger is usually difficult for me to bear in excess, but in Envy, it is used tastefully, not spoiling as it often does. It has lighter parts but overall feels like a heavy-handed masculine takeover, a firm punch to remind of what we imagine that men's scents of yore must have smelled like, regardless of whether that's accurate. It doesn't indulge an appeal to barbershop freshness as a fougere would, but leans far more toward something worn in the winter, or at least at night.

Performance for an EDT is impressive, moderate/strong on projection and strong on longevity--back in the day this would have been quite a steal as far as a mature, classic-smelling men's fragrance.

Unfortunately, Envy's status seems to have become overblown, with bottles going for $200+ on eBay. While I don't appraise it so highly, I can recognize this as one I'd like to own and reach for, just not so much what the market is purportedly bearing at this time.

Envy for Men Gucci,"- Timeless masculinity - ★★★★☆

Envy, one of the centerpieces from the holy era of modern male perfumery. Many of the older powerhouses such as Poison, Kouros and Eau Sauvage are masterpieces on their own but unfortunately very dated and difficult too wear for a guy in his early 20s. Nearly all the great releases since the beginning of 90's are however still oddly very relevant today and mix very well with the current trends - A*men, Rush and Opium Pour Homme come to mind.

Envy for Men is very different from the aforementioned fragrances but had a strong influence on the direction where the modern male perfumery headed after its release. A genre I like to call soft orientals emerged - heavy use of spice and incense in a fresh Western style. Other great examples of this genre would be Gucci PH I, Lanvin Arpege PH, L'eau d'Issey Intense, V&R Antidote. Especially the use on nutmeg (very evident in Envy) was particulary prominent and a trend that I personally miss these days.

Envy is an excellent fragrance and needs to be respected for the impact it had back in the day but I don't find it to be the masterpiece that many claim it to be. I think it's a jack of all trades but a master of none - there's woods, spiciness, some sweetness and eventually turns a little powdery. Ginger, nutmeg and coriander meld beautifully with the incense and peppery sandalwood but I'm left wanting something more. Something spicier or sweeter perhaps. My own signature Arpege Pour Homme is very similar to Envy in structure but it has that extremely powdery iris and intoxicating nutmeg-vanilla that give it a precisely defined character surpassing it's forefather.

To summarize: If Envy was still in production, I would buy it immediately but IMO is not worth the +200$ prices in eBay. Happy hunting!

Envy for Men Gucci,"Overrated because of it being discontinued. It's an okay fragrance but nothing exceptional. Not worth the crazy prices $250+ it's going for on eBay from people looking to cash in on its rarity. Honestly, for that money I'd rather plunk down for a more modern powerhouse like Amouage Interlude Man or some other modern beast. Gucci Envy is well worth its original price of about $40. But for $250 to $400... get lost!",12/08/16 15:41,richmilton

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"It's a really refreshing aromatic with a lovely violet flower note. Has similarities to Maison Crivelli's Absinthe Boréale, but side by side they're clearly different fragrances. Yeah, it's a shame this got discontinued because it's genuinely a great example of a modern fougere. Grab a bottle from the discounters before it's relegated to ebay if you like this style of fragrance.",10/17/25 04:37,Decker_Doberman
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Ahh yes, Gucci wipes.
Great aroma to wipe your boujee ass’es with! 🧻

I personally find it unisex leaning feminine due to the way the violet/ heliotrope combination smells here. The violet is soft & calm but w/ a subtle body care product sweetness twang.

The cypress is unfortunately completely absent throughout 😫. As well as bergamot & patchouli which I do not care for.

Not herbal, not soapy, not medicinal, not powdery!

It’s all heliotrope, violet & rosemary.
Pleasantly boring. Couldn’t imagine any woman wanting their man to smell like pampered baby ass 👶",04/23/25 10:34,DapperDon
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"A soap and detergent mix that smells very clean and unique. To be honest, it was one of the first fragrances I bought, and it was a meh, boring scent. After collecting and having so many different types of scents, this one feels very refreshing and clean. I haven't smelled anything like it, so it is relatively unique, and the performance is in the medium-low range.

Now people are finally appreciating it. When something isnt following the current trend and touches new ground, people dont like it bc of npc/normie mindset. But this is genius by a genius. Really cool and masculine fresh, going against the grain.",04/03/25 14:45,Unmodernize
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Green, unique, and herbal masterpiece. Good performance with great silage. Women live it, and have commented a couple of times. Great when it’s windy out.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I don’t see anything ominous in this perfume; it doesn’t suffocate, it’s sterile, evoking the atmosphere of entering a freshly opened hospital where you know doctors are there to help, a place where you feel safe. But that is just a faint background. The stronger impression comes from the blend of cypress, rosemary, and juniper berries, enhanced by bergamot that emerges with the deepest breath.

This is a perfume designed for successful people, suitable for all seasons, something that will define you in the eyes of others as bold and confident. I see nothing wrong with this fragrance; for an affordable price, you get a brand with quality comparable to Zara but exceptional in every way. It’s a true burst of spiced freshness, the essence of business trips, and the realization of dreams bottled up.",01/21/25 06:45,Aco99lo
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"The reviews for this are perplexing. It's nowhere near as divisive as people make it out to be. In fact, it might be one of the best men's fragrances released in recent years (so of course it's discontinued 🙄).

I mainly get cool, soapy evergreens supported by clean, powdery purple florals and herbal rosemary. There's a slight minty aspect from the rosemary in the opening and a clean, sparkly patchouli in the base.

This was a breath of fresh air in today's sea of uninspiring, $120 ""cologne guy"" releases.",01/11/25 01:17,Marty23
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"When sprayed on skin, it can smell a little intense and like cleaning products.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I quite enjoy this fragrance. It's definitely not for everyone, so I'd recommend sampling first. One of the things I enjoy about this fragrance is that it's it's a freshie that isn't your typical citrus or aquatic scent. The juniper berries, cypress, and rosemary stand out the most. It comes off a bit medicinal, but not in a way I dislike at all. It's a more mature scent, so guys in their early 20s and younger probably won't care for this fragrance.

It's not a strong performer, but it's a high cologne flanker, so it's what you'd expect. Gucci has its share of fragrances that are very different than other designers. This fragrance is discontinued to my knowledge, but still shows up here and there online.

Overall: 8/10",11/08/24 16:34,Jj94
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I'm going to keep the review very short - they should've called it Gucci Guilty Absolute Cologne...
Cuz somehow that's what it smells like - a Cologne version of Absolute.
That should tell you this is not safe and definitely not a blind buy. But for those who complain that Gucci does safe fragrances these days - between the EDP, Absolute, even Elixir a bit and this, there's definitely room for doubt and reconsideration.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I would not recommend buying this at all.
If you are I would suggest smelling it beforehand or sampling it.
I got this gifted to me but the smell is just weird.
I bought Gucci Guilty Black before which was more appealing to all noses but quite boring. This on the other hand is just very odd.
It is not the worst but most certainly not the best.
For me, the notes are what doesn't do it any justice.
The only reason this fragrance is okay is because the bergamot is the only note making it smell just alright.
If it didn't have that note this fragrance would be very bad in my opinion.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I had a hard time with this one, as from the first sniff my thought was 'do people actually pay for smelling like this, weirdos?', I tried it out in stores few more times and noticed it's getting less stocked, and then on one of the groups I found a good deal for first batch, so I took it. Back then I wasn't too sure if I'd ever actually use it, although when I forced myself into occasional usage during summer made me fall in love with it, exactly the same way I fell in love with Guerlain's Ideal Cool.
It's fresh. It's herbal with some citruses. It's green. I don't smell this heliotrope powderiness here.
Longetivity-wise it's not a best performer on my skin, although I get a decent sillage in first hour.
Whenever I see some other perfumes with color like this, I hope they'll smell similar.
If you find this somewhere in the shops, do not hesitate.",05/25/24 21:25,czajnik

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"That was... weird. The first sniff caused me this sensation of ""I smelled something that's too minty/fresh and it got into my lungs"", which caused quite an uncomfortable sensation.

After it's a soapy powdery and floral smell, really fresh and different. Good one if you are looking for a rare blue smell. I understand the dentist comparison, but it is not as close. Kinda regretted not buying it, it's a cool perfume to have as a collector.",04/20/24 00:52,djigoio

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme is a soapy powdery, smooth woody, green and flowery unique freshy.
Personally, I liked it a lot, at the opening it smells weird for a minute than it becomes beautiful I think a lot of people judged the fragrance for that 1-minute smell without smelling it more without giving it more time.
it has moderate performance on my skin approximately about 6-7 hours it projects very good at the first 2 hours than it becomes close to skin, when it comes to likeability of the fragrance, I think it's pretty likeable.
So, guys I recommend it, at least give it a chance don't pass it because of the judgments of others.",03/09/24 09:37,Aslanyus
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"man I wish i bought dozen of this before discontinued. last time i felt like this when i heard the news about the v&r antidote.
gucci cologne has a real coolness effect just after applying which is very enjoyable and the magic appears in the dry down which gives a mature and manly feel with dark greeny notes.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"The whole Guilty line seems to be disrespected in the fragrance community & sometimes I don't understand the negative reviews. Reviewers will have you believing that you will smell like shit.

Guilty Cologne is one of the freshest scents I have ever tried. Immediately that juniper and rosemary brings a fresh herbal vibe, mixed with the floral mid just creates a lovely atmosphere of cleanliness. It's okay if that isn't your vibe but surely if you came across someone wearing this you wouldn't think they smell bad, right?

Where the original is fresh and soapy, this one is fresh, soapy, & floral. you might see it as feminine and that is okay. For the price on discounters it's pretty good. I don't think it lasts long though, when do fresh scents ever...

8/10 lovely floral freshness",01/23/24 08:03,Afc_Croatian
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"There is something really strange in the first minutes of this composition, like juniper gone bad or the rosemary way too much, or the moment you taste that nettle shampoo with your mouth: a chemical-bitter taste, spoiling the rest to come.
And the rest is a cool herbal cocktail with a frosting of heliotrope and violet, crispy and cold. I eventually stopped paying attention to the opening and I like a lot the ice-cold floral sweetness that comes after - violets are yummy, and the herbal part is like a Comme des Garcons urban abstraction. But it needs some time for adjusting, meaning you can't sell it at airports.
Anyway, I reach for it more often than I initially expected: it's refreshing, without implying a particular mood; a cologne without a tangible citrus note, for the times when you don't really feel like being ""immediately transported"" to Amalfi or Tuscany, more like going to the local pharmacy, but this should be fun, too.",01/14/24 04:20,iris

This has a chalky powdery musk dry quality to it, it's dry but rounded, does not feel thin and whispy like some colognes do..
Very slightly pissy in the background, though I haven't found that before.. sobits probably something else I have on with woods and citrus intermingling...

Not an easy buy for me, I would try this again with nothing else on..
It has gone more pleasant, lost the animalic feel it had, which wasn't hugely noticeable anyway..
I have the regular men's guilty I the silver bottle no issues with it.

This is not a crazy projector, its subtle and light unless you overspray. I really like balsamic notes, it's subtle here from the combination of cypress & juniper. If you don't like green balsamic notes, this may not be for you. It's clean smelling and should be worn in warm weather. This doesn't have enough strength to be worn in the cold weather. For me this will be a summer, errand running, gym scent. It's a pretty average scent overall, but I do like it.

Discontinued as far I know. Got a great deal on a tester. Not remotely worth retail price or inflated discontinued prices. Don't think I'd pay more than one $40-45 for this.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"This has a very soapy smell when sprayed. The outer bottle emmits a nice, fruity fresh fragarance, but once it hits your inner wrist it smells ghastly. Like too much soap. Whats more interesting is how it dries. After an hour it starts to sweeten up and after half a day it smells great. You can wake up the next morning smelling the better part of it on you in this strange magic trick of smelling the soapy odor dissapear.",09/25/21 20:23,Turbo
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Very dfficult ages for Gucci s fans! Gucci nowadays is only worried about making flankers as Fendi, Armani, Dior and Ralph Lauren.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I wanted to like this fragrance and have it grow on me, but after wearing it multiple times, I had to sell it. I always found myself thinking, ""did someone open a diaper bag behind me"". It's not a turd smell by any means, but it reminds me of baby wipes. I would highly advise against blind buying this one.",08/25/21 09:03,Bllynch1
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I like this cologne. It's challenging, but the more I smell it, the more I'm reaching for it as a daily wear. I am satisfied with my purchase of a whole bottle. And truthfully, I enjoy it a lot. Among the shower-gel freshies, the ambrox bombs, and the nauseating milky-sweet-sandalwood mens fragrances at Sephora as of 07/21, this one definitely stood out.

The fragrance is dominated by a strong, long lasting ""gunpowder"" accord that I can only describe as extremely powdery, dry, green, sharp, fresh, slightly sulfurous, smooth, and balanced. This might be the ""heliotrope, violet and cypress"". I'm guessing the heliotrope + violet is a ton of ionones (alpha ionone anyone?) and some irones and heliotropin, somehow dried to a crisp with other aromachems. The cypress note might be a microdose of some sulfurous aromachem? The Alaskan Cypress Oil I own definitely has sulfurous top notes, so this is appropriate. Anyway, it's a really nice and unique aroma that is linear and lasts.

It starts out with a nondescript, acidic, distant, sharp but pleasant citrus note. It finishes off with a nose-tingling breeze of woody-amber molecules (ambrocenide, norlimbanol perhaps). Through the duration of the fragrance, there is a very mild and lovely aquatic presence, perhaps calone or cascalone. Normally calone disgusts me, but here it works so well!! I cannot detect the white musk... I could perhaps be anosmic to it, or it's just carefully hidden, or very transparent.

Good longevity, and strong but not overpowering.

Is it a safe blind buy? No. But it's different than anything I own, and I really enjoy it. It's minimal, light and transparent, but lovely. Definitely polarizing. Try before you buy! Wear it and see how you feel.

EDIT: I really like this juice, the more I wear it the more I appreciate it. I also removed some snark in my review regarding note pyramids.",08/01/21 20:23,greeneaj87
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,I just tried this. Its rare that i have to wash off a fragrance that i sprayed on myself but this one is one of them. It just doesnt smell good...... headache inducing mess. Sorry.,07/01/21 11:47,Senso_
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Blind buy because, c'mon, this scent sounds so interesting and controversial from the get go, and it is discontinued to boot. This is a throwback to the 80's early 90s powerhouses, any shame aside. I can even see this having it's placemaker earlier on, referencing some mediteranean colognes of fore. The whole Gucci Guilty line, in my opinion, is coherent and manly, which means women won't necessarily appreciate them -have in mind-. The cologne version I am reviewing is clearly based on the OG but veers towards warmer weather and daily wear, by means of bergamot. I find the whole Guilty line as polarizing, high quality masterpieces. You need to sample this -I stress this- before you make up your mind, but if you like the OG chances are you want this badly for your spring-summer daily wear. I paid 30 euro for the 90ml and I just can't get enough of it. I find it perhaps a less melancholic Hommage a L'Homme, and as excellent as that.",06/04/21 15:42,sapeur1999

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I must reveal my strange relationship with this fragrance. I cannot be silent anymore because I've been obsessed with Gucci Guilty Cologne ever since I got it. It confuses me, it intrigues me, it humors me, it supports me, it loves me, it gets me... I didn't bother test this one. I just plunged straight into a blind purchase. I disregarded the consistent hate, disgust and rejection this scent received. People call it names insult it but it just made me more curious.

It came. I sprayed it on.

I thought, ""Damnit I actually don't like this... What is that saltiness? What is that fizziness? What is that weird creaminess? What is making it smell dry, powdery and soapy like baby wipes like others have mentioned? The notes looked so promising but the result is so f...ing strange"". I was so upset that I continued spraying it on hoping it would change or dry-down to something different. I kept spraying trying to find out what I enjoyed about the scent. Why am I still spraying this thing? I already decided I don't like it, but why do I keep spraying. Am I forcing myself to enjoy my blind buy? Are my feelings about this not reliable anymore because I am a hostage in denial of the idea that maybe I wasted my money? Stockholm syndrome at its spookiest... But wait a minute...

At the time it had been two consecutive days and I had worn nothing but Gucci Guilty Cologne trying to understand it, but also enjoying it. Performance is quite strong for a cologne even an edt but stable. It is clean and soft, like fabric softener and baby-powder in the air but contrasted by the facets of creaminess, fizziness and the sparkle of shaving cream like an ultra-modern fougère. The scent profile humors me. It is humbling expressing humility by displaying an infant-like cleanliness but then it is rounded and matured by a cleanliness that is also of a grown man clean shaven. I have stopped wearing it to understand it because not understanding it is why I love it. Gucci Guilty Cologne is Olfactory art. It is a statement.

It has told me, ""shut-up, stop overthinking and just wear me"" reminding me of the basic function of a perfume, and I have submitted to its commands. It has restarted everything for me and told me it is as much functional as it is art. I needed Gucci Guilty Cologne to remind me that perfume is equally an art as it is functional. I find it calming and addicting and it has become one of my favorite signatures to reach for this spring and summer. I look forward to also wearing it this fall and winter. Unique, avant-garde, but ultra-modern and clean. A misunderstood masterpiece in my opinion.

Edit:
I don't know how or why but I've been complemented and approached numerously on my wearings of this. I don't usually write on complement factor but this performs very well on me.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Confessions of a Gucci Fanboy:
It's happening. . . I have gone full circle from the frustrating prospecting of niche to the well-calculated, marketed, targeted, tested raw power of designer. Oh hell, I just gave in, the designers are so darn good. Still, I love my niche Sticky Fingers by Francesca Bianchi. Just one score like this one makes niche worth the struggle.
Side Rant: Francesca Bianchi is so amazing--not hard on the eyes either. Probably can't say that nowadays. We guys oughta just shoot ourselves or maybe go to one of those charming 're-education' facilities like the Communists use. I can see it now: Bad Doggie re-program Room A. Right. You are now cured. 'Oh. . you look nice today (snore). You can't even joke anymore so let me sort this out so as not to offend. Guys who are gentlemen can meet todays standards. A gentleman always keeps the standard. OK relax, good talk.
Regarding 'designer' versus niche; designer is not as robust a fragrance and re-formulation has erred toward weaker compared to niche. Still, alot of niche quickly becomes a skin scent. Confused enough?
Wondering if the public does not want something too strong that will hang in the air. Maybe the public just wants a fragrance quickie.

NOTE: This is a cologne with surprisingly great durability. Being a cologne it is not as concentrated as a Toilette. Still, keep the faith. This stuff delivers with a hearty spray!!!!
The juice is the prettiest, softest green-- that ever made the scene. The glass bottle is so heavy and tapered for the hand. Yep. It just feels good. Nice ritual.
To the notes, to the point:
Top: Juniper Berries, Rosemary, Calabrian Bergamot
Middle: Cypress, Heliotrope, Violet
Base: White Musk, Patchouli LEAF, Cedar

Done by Roberto Morillas and launched 2019.

Open is just wonderful with my favorite note of Juniper Berries. I go crazy over black pepper and juniper as found in many of the British scents like Dunhill or Hugh Parsons. (By the way. . . . Hugh Parsons kind of is getting the 'high hat'. This stuff is fun, bright and traditional for a real gent!)
Moving past the Juniper--there is no black pepper. A quick entrance of Cypress, and Violet in just a matter of ten seconds. Super nice Violet.
The Heliotrope adds a lush nectar/sweetness with maybe even some heft! The only base I can really detect is Cedar which I have come to love. After some hours, the final drydown does seem to have the White Musk factor and it is barely detectable--but 'gamey' and classy.
It's in there:
I'm going to have to try the Patchouli Leaves by : is it Montale? Mancera?
This scent is remarkably successful in attaining two goals: First off, it has a certain bulk to the fragrance cloud as well as a bright aspect. Also the Violet is so nice and the Heliotrope is like a really satisfying confection or pastry. I think the Heliotrope adds the ""bulk"".
Secondly, this scent in final dry down offers a real delicate interpretation of musk and a much brighter Patchouli that fools my nose. I saw it in the notes, I did not detect it. So light. . . must be the leaves.
Apparently, this was not run for very long. I get real curious when a fragrance is met with 'we don't get it' . Dump it, 'it aint sellin'. I just have to move in for the sniff. I like prospecting. I'm getting real good at it, but had to waste some money at first.
I paid $71USD. Upon initial purchase, it seemed a bit rich. The product really is unique and worth every penny. Shop it, if you want. I love a great deal.
I learned alot. Patchouli leaves--wow. Heliotrope--luxe.... doll. Violet--not all the same. Juniper Berries--where the big boys screw it up but not this one.
Also learned: Cologne is not always too weak. Re-calculating.
Also learned: Practical and hot all in one bottle. I like that.",04/16/21 14:52,norm1

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I bet GGC will be discontinued soon. Simply because it doesn’t fit into context. It is and is not cologne. Pale green is exactly what it is (I have never seen such a color of perfume). The stars that shine are: at the beginning bergamot, in the center is a very special cypress (due to a pinch of powdery heliotrope) and at the end (which just lasts) an interesting musc with woods. As some note, seemingly nothing special but unique. However, this is not immediately obvious. Quality. Definitely no association to anything Gucci. Sophisticated, if not intelligent water / cologne fragrance for ""niche"" lovers. It lasts, it doesn't project too much (Great). So, not for fashionable Gucci folk, for sure. Even Guilty Absolute, which isn’t bad in its genre either, but despite the boldness really nothing special, isn’t as anti Gucci as this one.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"After hearing a few pleasing reviews I was quite curious to check this out because based on the notes it looks like something I would enjoy, and it is. This is a very well done classic Italian style cologne, which is no surprise considering the perfumer. I feel like the majority of people who won’t like this are just used to and don’t tend to steer from Gucci Guilty edt and Black or The One, Sauvage, Bleu de Chanel, La Nuit De L’homme, etc. more basic mass appealing frags. This is definitely unique compared to those, but not as unique in the more niche market such as Creed Viking, Nishane B-612, Roja’s Scandal or Reckless, and many, many colognes, after shaves and tonics of yesteryear. It’s sad to see this discontinued from Gucci along with Gucci Guilty Absolute and Gucci Guilty Oud considering how unique to the line they are, but from a marketing standpoint I totally understand. They are classics, but not classics of the brand. Stock up or get your hands on these gems now if you’re looking because they’ll eventually become very hard to find and fetch a pretty penny, especially Absolute.",01/23/21 12:07,lostsoul007

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,I just happen to be at Sephora and saw that the bottle that they have actually has blue juice in it. I’ve had two or three bottles of this because I love it as a summer fragrance but my juices always been green. I didn’t ask the attendant if I could sample the blue juice that they had on the shelf and when I tried it I felt like there was a softer more powdery opening than the strong green/citrusy (the juniper and rosemary is less prominent) opening I get from the green colored juice. Does anyone know if this has been reformulated ????I’m assuming so I even took a picture of the blue juice on the shelf to make sure it’s BLUE the attendant had no idea what I was talking about 😳!

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Superbly well made cologne (but with EDT concentration so lasts longer). Not citrus here so the vibes are even more herbal-masculine with a good amount of cypress that makes it so unique. As every distinct fragrance is not a crowd pleaser but very unique and pleasant.

As a big fan of cologne I can make some comparison with Acqua di Parma: this goes in the opposite direction: no citrus, herbal but very pleasant. Longevity is good and better than most AdP since these are Eau de Cologne and this is Eau de Toilette. It doesn't have a big projection but is a new classic, masculine barber scent.

Reasonably priced so I did buy the 150ml bottle. Price/quality for an Alberto Morillas fragrance is unbeatable. 10/10",09/29/20 02:47,commodore64
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,Not usually a fan of Gucci fragrances but this is a winner IMO. Slight medicinal green juice with a nice dry down of musk and cedar.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"A great alternative to common citrusy ‘Cologne’ summer versions of other frags. The bottle and it’s color are spot on in describing the contents.

This can be a love or hate deal. For me it was the latter at first, as I sniffed it way too up close. The attention beggar molecules in the base were too harsh and obvious.

Later, when wearing this on my chest, the magic started happening. I’d get whiffs of something fresh, like a weird blue slushie drink you’d get from an American retro diner. Perhaps some fresh sour berries combined with something slightly aquatic, but not at all too much. Luckily not a calone bomb.

All in all, this turned out to be a lovable curiosity. Wearing it just might turn you into one too.",08/22/20 07:55,Sauvarghhh

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Wow, so what to say about this one? Well, I do love it, not just a like for me. The issue is, I like it because of what it intended on doing. Which is old world Italian clean charm. What does that mean.. Well, my grandfather used to wear certain fragrances that had a very medicinal minty fresh vibe, like a ""gin & tonic"", which makes sense with the Juniper berries, bergamot, mandarin and cypress found here. So, as I'm wearing it, I get that mental image of my grandfather dressed up conducting business and just being a commanding presence.
The longevity and projection are both good, as I get 6 to 8 hours, and just maintain a bubble around me that isn't too far reaching, but enough to reach those you walk by. Again, more than acceptable, as no one wants to be the person that you meet the fragrance before you meet the person.
I bought the 150ml bottle at a decent price of $65. My opinion, it was worth it. This is such a departure from Sauvage, Dylan Blue, and the rest of the blue fragrances that have taken over. Just as Gucci Guilty Absolute was polarizing, this is no different. You want to hate it for being different, yet love it for the exact same reason. Which is why I consider this a niche way to go for high heat fragrances. You'll get noticed and know that you're clean, but they may not be sure why they like it. Lol.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"This is a really good fragrance. This is probably my favorite of the Gucci guilty‘s for summer weather. It is a great every day summer scent. I use things like dolce and Gabbana light blue, Dylan blue and maybe even a little happy for men during the summer but this is for sure my daily go to in warm weather. It reminds me of the beautiful beaches of Malibu and the windy mountain trails and fresh breezes of Topanga! You get the perfect combination of clean and earthy without a lot 🍋 and 🧼 and the dry down is completely comforting. When I put this on I get comps out of the gate! It is unique especially the dry down. I get pretty decent longevity but do carry a small bottle of it for refresher around 2-3pm After a 8:30 application. Is it worth the money? I would say yes this is one of the few fragrances that I constantly re-purchase. I do look for opportunities to pay less for it but that’s just in my nature I do that with everything but I have never had an issue paying full price for it. I’ve been very satisfied. If you never experienced one of the Gucci guilty fragrances for men I think this would be a very good first time buy for that line. Honestly I think this has the best longevity and silage (outside of absolute and the GG Parfums) I’m such an ADD individual when it comes to fragrances I cannot consistently wear the same one every single day because I need my scents to go along with my mood and what I’m feeling for that day. But I wear this more consistently as a signature fragrance than I do anything else during the summer.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I get why this fragrance is polarizing, it's certainly not a crowd pleaser and in fact I felt a little disappointed after the first wear. I did enjoy the opening when I tested it at the store, I didn't love but I liked it and it was on sale so I went for it. First actual wear started fine, very nice opening but the dry down not so much but the damage was done and I wouldn't just leave in the back of the closet, at least I'd wear it when I stay home but after 2nd wear I paid closer attention and by the 3rd it became almost a love.

Yes, Guilty Cologne is challenging to some extend, it does have a gorgeous opening and then it turns into a baby wipe kinda smell that can be off putting at first but it's different from your average freshies and blues. The baby wipe vibe is not an actual bad thing, it does smell clean and fresh and longevity is actually real good (7hrs plus).

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci guilty cologne smells like a strong laundry detergent when first applied. It’s just alright, nothing different, but the dry down is a bit softer and the green notes become more prominent.

Your average Joe will probably enjoy this fragrance, but it’s not for people who want something a bit more unique.",12/04/19 01:27,Alanitoo
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Cologne’s reception seems to be lukewarm overall, and while I can understand the bar being set fairly high by the three prior releases of 2017 and 2018—Guilty Absolute Pour Homme / Pour Femme and Guilty Oud—and I agree with some that find there to be a sort of calone-like prominence that makes for a very sharp marine vibe..

However, I don’t find Gucci Guilty Cologne to be synthetic or general to the point of being unenjoyable—quite the opposite, as I really enjoy it, though I do have a little bit of difficulty describing it. It smells mainly of bergamot, cypress, violet, and, as mentioned before, a bit of a calone vibe, though no such note is listed.

Overall, it’s fresh, but quite sharp, and I imagine that’s what turns some people off to it, but that it’s a bit biting is part of what makes it interesting to me, perhaps not quite as inoffensive as its cologne name suggests. It performs pretty well but not anything outstanding—it’s loud during its opening couple of hours and then fades fairly quickly into a skin scent. It’s a nice option for casual or daytime summer wearing, in my opinion.

As with the retail pricing of the other beloved Gucci Guilty offerings, Cologne’s pricing of $95 for 90ml / $75 for 50ml is a reasonably tough sell, even tougher than the bolder, stronger Absolutes and Oud, so this would need to be a discount, grey market, or p2p type of sale. Still, I’m happy I blind bought it.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"This should have 100% be a stand alone new fragrance release from Gucci and not a flanker. It is so unique, so pleasent, so different, i like it a lot.

The violet, the cypress and the rosemary with heliotrope and juniper berries create a vibe hard to explain. Some said it smells somewhat medicinal and I can see that. I find the vibe it gives being a gentle metallic, with a little sweetness (probably from patchouli) and some greenness, but both the sweetness and greenness are one with the gentle metallic smell, not on their own (this is very well blended).

It does give a fresh vibe when you wear it, but don't think about citrus or floral or herbal freshness, it is a... well, metallic freshness for me. Just try this and you will smell it too.

If this DNA gets popular and people accept it, I am sure many other houses will go this way in the future.

Edit: I tried this for the 3rd time on skin and I was blown away... Why? First 2 times it lasted for about 7 hours on the skin cause I had to go to sleep one time and the other time I had to take a shower. The 3rd time I sprayed it 2 times on the forearm at 14:30. I went to bed at 2 and I could still smell it... WTF??!!??. And don't think about some leftover generic ""I sprayed something here"" scent. I could 100% feel Gucci Cologne on my forearm. Maybe it's my skin, I don't now how it manages to last so long on my skin, but I am buying this tomorrow. It already made it to discounters, I will get the 90ml for 56$.",07/19/19 23:58,MyaboSores
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Not a bad fragrance. Must like juniper and rosemary. For a general idea of what this smells like, imagine Pure Shot by Mugler mixed with L'eau Bleue d'Issey Miyake.

This has me almost ready to throw SMW in the ""to sell"" pile. The drydown is herbal, mildly green, semi-sweet, woody and astringent, it does everything that I like in SMW just much, much better.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Guilty Cologne is a fresh aromatic woods. The fragrance opens with an aqueous cocktail accord based on juniper berry. The aroma is mildly sour, with a subtle sting and abrasive texture. It has a mellow feel to it—and is a bit enjoyable to my tastes.

Naturally, anyone over-familiar with fragrance crafting would think that this is a take on a gin essence—and with that—that this was intended to be marketed to the British. Smashing. Can't say it entirely has that feel though.

The opening sets somewhat of a stylish, mature tone, from which the woods (cypress and juniper) begin to step out onto the front-line. This presence increases the mature tone a lot, but the aroma retains this cool and composed oversoul to it.

I find this fragrance to be very neutral toned overall. Light and breezy; non-offensive. Fresh—and subtly stimulating. With its qualities, it strongly feels like a fragrance that would be perfect for the office. However, something else about it feels like this was intended for gays. I'm trying as hard as I can to be optimistic about it.

I would have said they're trolling in the first place by calling it a ""cologne""—yet it has no citrus in it whatsoever. You simply can't do by Italian heritage. I don't find that this has an entirely a bad style though. It feels very new age—like a Neo-style take on the Cologne style. Very artistic. Nice technique.

Not a bad fragrance by any means at all. Very short, sweet, and to the point. It obviously sets out to capture a certain essence-in-style and does so simply, and very well. It's elegant—in much respect. Easy to wear, easy to enjoy. For those who can behold it, an easy daily driver; with plenty of room for fun (to blend up to your higher expectations or tastes).",07/11/19 00:33,ReapThaWhirlwind
Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Like the cyan shade of its liquid – neither blue nor green but something in between – Gucci’s new Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme treads the line between aromatic and woody genres without ever stepping into either.

Bergamot, a very astringent juniper, and rosemary open the composition in a bracingly fresh accord that comes across almost medicinal – a quirk not dissimilar to the opening of Gucci Guilty Absolute. It’s in the heart though that Gucci Guilty Cologne really shines as the green freshness of cypress marries the sweet (but not candied) powderiness of violets and smooth creaminess of heliotrope, carrying through and eventually coming to contrast the rather raspy base of cedar and ice-cold patchouli.

Befitting the Guilty line, this is a rather daring release from Gucci but one I expect will prove quite popular as a sort of avant-garde masculine.

Longevity is good at 6-8 hours, though sillage is rather soft.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Honestly, I don't understand the extreme reactions people are having to this. This is in a similar dimension to Zegna's Florentine Iris. They don't really smell alike, but where the Zegna plays out like iris and violet battling for dominance over jasmine, this is heliotrope and violet becoming best friends over gin. The musk is actually surprisingly warm and human in this which is a really nice surprise. It is sweet, but in a very aromatic, fresh kind of way. I love it!

I just tried layering this with Absolute and they really compliment each other well. Cologne adds sweetness and freshness to Absolute's black heart. I wonder if this was intentional",07/01/19 04:36,mhobba

Instead of being bitter/fresh as I expected, this is strangely ocenanic and sweet. To top if off I detect a weird gingerbread spice way in the background which is rather unpleasant.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"I was introduced in the department store due to being new and was to be compared with a new Hugo Boss fragrance. The Hugo Boss sample smell was generic, but I liked this one - in the first few minutes I could detect a sharp minty, spearmint freshness. This could be from the juniper berries and spanish cypress. I don't know what heliotrope smells like so cannot comment on that. I don't get the violet - which to me is a good thing. It's also not sweet - which is good too.

UPDATE: Wore it today, and noticed a masculine smokiness and then I could almost smell the fruity smell of the juniper berries - that's with the minty-freshness. Then you may start to pick up a well-blended white musk. This is a new take on a clean long-lasting top-note without the typical reliance on the citrus theme.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Allow me to start with the positives here this is not just a cookie cutter, eau de cologne freshie. Nor is it the ultimately bland aroma chemical mess of a eros or Invictus, some small merciful praise can be bestowed upon Gucci Guilty Cologne for this fact.
Gucci had really turned a corner injecting life into this Guilty line with the divisive release Guilty Absolute (Men's one) which people either found to be a blissfully animalic leather or an inept, antiseptic, nightmare. Stranger still that it had come from the nose of Alberto Morillas, and this one does too, with the use of a note/accord seldom found in men's designer perfumes and that's Heliotrope. All this sets us up for an interesting fragrance and cologne is not without that merit let's just let it have this credit, before I rip it to shreds!
So the opening is actually very fresh, truly aquatic, fresh a bit salty but with a steady decent into more floral territory. This is that violet leaf, dry ionones sort of tinge but if this was a violet fragrance I expect I would like it. I sampled this without prior knowledge of the notes and I KNEW there was heliotrope in here....I couldn't place the name and kept saying Angelica no...mimosa, no....artemisia no....what is it?? I knew what I meant and seeing it here just validates how prominent it is in this fragrance.
Three stages are... unusual fresh, seaside floral opening, into a heart that is almost a scrubber, it's that bad. Let me just say that this could be a taste thing on my part but I found it really sour and unpleasant combination. Then when nearly dead and settled right the way down comes a woody, synthetic aroma chemical heaven of timbersilk, clearwood, synth ambers? and like that.....all is well.
Too little, too late and overall I have to say I plain dislike this fragrance and would never wear it, categorising it as a stinker.
Just let me highlight once again that this was not a failure for any of the reasons I thought it might be, and I respect that Gucci and Morillas have tried somewhat to follow suit from the barnstorming Absolute, with something different. It fails because perfume like this should be at the least pleasant for all it's challenges and this wasn't to me. Sorry it just wasn't.",06/04/19 04:59,Houdini4

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Cypress and juniper fresh opening, with a foggy/musky heliotrope drydown, giving an impression of ""baby diapers"". Actually, it's a hard scent to describe, because heliotrope is the main player here, which smell may be unfamiliar to most of us, so try before you buy! Average performance.

Creativity at its best, surprising both from Morillas (a perfumer that used to be more focused on commercial success than creativity in the last 15-20 years), as well as from Gucci (who recently got out of a 10-year creative desert with Gucci Guilty Absolute.... inspired, if not copied from Terenzi's Ursa, but that's a different discussion...)

Unlike GGA, it's not a love at first sniff. I like, but not sure I could pull it off, as I'm not sure it would fit my personality... will have to waer it again before thinking at a full bottle. But for sure, I have to admit that it's really a new kind of masculine floral, very unique, that Gucci has issued here. Great job!

Spring days, 25+

Edit: 2 years later, I bought a bottle. On my skin, it's way more juniper/cypress forward than florals. In the base, it's a musky wood acccord, the violet and heliotrope, while noticeable, are more toned-down compared to the paper strip test.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"GGC is a lovely flanker and is all about the dry-down which has a high-end designer scent character. The top and mid notes also smell lovely. But may smell unappealing to those that have limited experience wearing niche/indie/premium fragrances. Patience is key with GGC...you will start to appreciate and enjoy GGC once you start entering the 2 hour mark which is when all the notes start to smooth out and play in harmony with each other.


GGC has an earthy, vetiver, iris, aquatic and fresh sort of concocted smell. I was surprised to realize that GGC smells similar to Bleu de Chanel without the citrus notes, and shares a slight resemblance to Alien Man with toned down incense/resinous notes. Consequently, GGC is excellent for both professional, casual, and night-out wear and is ideal for the spring and summer seasons.

It’s a good blend because I only get a breezy cypress and a faintviolet. This definitely smells completely different from the usual generic guilty.

i tried yesterday in a store and im pretty impressed and im considering to buy. it's one of the bravest fresh cologne ever. it's something completely different from the other fragrances on the current market. the opening is a blast floral, then the patchuli and soapy notes are definitely stronger. u can also detect musk and cypress.i think many will hate this release but for me is very interesting, it has a strange manliness inside. maybe im saying something completely wrong, but i consider this the wild, aggressive version of prada infusion d'homme, especially in the opening. they are not identical but have something in common like the floral notes. the one from prada is more gentle and natural for sure.
i prefer gucci cologne to the absolute version, which smells like old shoes. absolutely try before buy.

Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme Gucci,"Wow! This fragrance is actually really good! Definitely not what I was expecting but I'm happy about that. Very modern and not your average designer spring/summer fragrance. Where most are all citrus and aquatic, This cologne is floral and woodsy. This one really reminds me of Dior Homme, but not in smell rather in genre. The more floral, soapy and woodsy with be a nice change and make you standout from all the other heavy citrus and aquatics this summer. Like Dior Homme this one opens with a pungent almost medical citrus smell, I'm assuming from the bergamot but that dissipates in seconds and the florals takeover. The Heliotrope is centerstage in the fragrance and again like Dior Homme gives a really nice soapy/powdery scent with a little little spice from the rosemary I'm guessing. From there the scent remains this soft clean floral with a warm base and the scent stays this way for most of the duration until maybe around the 4 hour mark and then the woods and patchouli completely takes over and finish off the night. And honestly the woods is really what made me a fan of this fragrance. The warm cypress with the patchouli gives this a animalic, balsamic aroma that almost comes off as a cleaner more musky Oud. This fragrance is label a cologne but the opening is pretty wide and comes off more like a edt but once it dries down it becomes very soft which I'm sure others will confuse the performance with being weak but I think this is a A+ fragrance from the house of Gucci and another one of those fragrances pushing the boundaries and starting conversation of what men fragrance can be just like Gucci Guilty Absolute, this one belongs in my collection.",03/20/19 09:20,djhecutsa

Flora by Gucci Generous Violet Gucci,"A very synthetic play on purple florals. I should love this and honestly, I hate when people bitch about synthetics, but, here, I get it. I should love this, it has some of my favorite notes with no other filler and my purple florals should be sparkling and coming to life, however, because of the quality of the notes here, it doesn't smell like a pure purple floral. It doesn't really smell like violets and iris, I do get violet leaf and maybe some orris. Mostly I get a musky perfume, like a white musk with synthetic violet, orris, violet leaf and red berries. If you don't like purple florals, I think you could still wear this. These gucci perfumes may smell nice but I don't know WTH I'm smelling in any of them. It's a very non-descript, generic floral. After about 5-10 minutes I also get a soapiness. Clean, fresh, artificial iris and violet.",01/20/25 22:53,Blossomlove

Flora by Gucci Generous Violet Gucci,"It has taken me a long time to warm up to this scent but I can finally say I like it. I received it in a swap some time ago and wasn't impressed. I wouldn't go out searching for this perfume or spend money to buy it but I can appreciate it for what it is. It's a very delicate, sweet violet scent that sits relatively close to the skin and doesn't change much. I don't get any suede whatsoever, this is a sweet floral violet through and through. It runs in the same vein as Ellis Brooklyn Myth and Mon Guerlain, both of which I also classify as ""kind of boring but kind of interesting and very pretty"" scents. It's almost like these perfumes are giving you just enough to want to keep coming back. I don't know how to explain it very well, but I'm sure someone out there understands what I'm trying to articulate. This scent perfectly embodies the color violet imo, or even a periwinkle blue. It's fragile, light, and pretty. A perfume for Cinderella. Lasting power is surprisingly good with this. I've only worn this a few times out of the house but I don't need to respray throughout the day, as I still get whiffs of it while I'm moving.

Flora by Gucci Generous Violet Gucci,"One of the fragrances that I rediscover, over and over again. Each time I wear it, I get another new side of it. I believe that translates to complexity, a little bit unusual for a fragrance with rather few notes. It's violet, it's purple, it's mauve, it's baby blue and white, and soon after is crispy green.

Amazing mix of violet leaf, iris, lilly of the valey, violets and orris. At first it can be missleading by sharp, smashed green leaves opening, but it settles soon into a beautiful powdery orris note. A Holy Grail for me, as I declare myself a big iris lover. It has rewarded me lots of compliments and devotion, because it's very long lasting. Especially in cold temperature.

Flora by Gucci Generous Violet Gucci,"I don’t normally seek out Gucci fragrances, they’re not my style. However, I was on a violet trip and I thought I would give this fragrance a go. I have to say I am reasonably satisfied with my purchase. I don’t think it’s got a lot of backbone, but it’s very pretty, in a spring time soft violet kind of way.

I think labelling this as ‘generous’ violet shows a distinctly ambitious view of the product, unless of course the marketing department decided to inject a sense of irony into the label. However, longevity...about 10 hours!

Nice office scent though, and compared to the absolutely vile blind buy I made along with this one, it’s saved the day. I can’t even begin to describe the other one...I won’t be naming it because I have to sell it first...after that, it will be all guns blazing.",11/30/17 02:47,Annabear

Violet is by far the strongest note, but I do smell both the iris and the suede quite well. I do like the suede, it gives the fragrance a bit of an interesting twist I think. The drydown is a bit more powdery and sweet, but pleasant. I would describe it as a innocent and cute spring scent.

Flora by Gucci Generous Violet Gucci,"This is a nice entry-level violet + iris scent that feels very modern.

While violets can feel ""old lady"", cosmetic-like, or dense and candyish, Generous Violet uses the powdery flower in the softest way possible. I smell a tang of watery green apple in the opening, which dissipates and is replaced by powdery floral sweetness. A cooling aspect from the iris and orris root is present throughout the duration of the composition, but like the violet, it is used in an ""easy"" way - not too steely, melancholy or cold, but cool and soothing instead, like resting under the shade of a big, beautiful tree. The suede note seems to function as a ""blur tool"" so no one note dominates.

I wore this while walking around my college campus recently - the building is all concrete with jutting, modern architecture. This scent fit the cool grays of the campus and the studious, deliberate way I was feeling.

Initially I get a bit of iris, and within a minute the violet comes through and starts to dominate the fragrance. The powdery aspect gathers steam with time as well, and I suspect that if you don't like powdery fragrances you may recoil in horror. There is nothing ""wet"" about this violet - it's all powdery and very Victorian to my nose. There is a hint of sweetness. Lasting power is acceptable, and it stays quite close to the skin. In the battle of the violets, I greatly prefer Penhaligon's Violetta and will stick to that for the moment. But who am I kidding!

Everyone can tell. Even people who have no connection to the fragrance community and have not been pre-biased to expect either sameness or difference can tell they are very different.

Even the ingredients on the labels are different. Get a clue.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Who would belive me if I said that it's one of the fragrances i paid the least for?
Reason i bought it blind was its classy packaging. I remember spraying it and immediately thinking I'm too young to wear it. I was about 25 back then. Another thought I had was that it's calming, composed, autumn/winter scent. I remember exactly thinking the pencil shavings and smell of whiskey.
I'm 41 now and still have half of 50ml bottle.
It's melancholic and reserved. Ite a picture of a father figure we all would love to have- wise, secure, calm but strong. Its so perfect that it's hard to put this scent on as you just feel out of place. One day you hope to be that person to your own child.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"I will write right away that my adventure with perfumes began with this first notification a few years ago... it was signaled to me by a friendly distributor, with a trademark for years... it was not the main user of this perfume, because of the keyword it smells...
that it's some Gucci, but I don't remember the name, and it was given to me by my wife... additionally, that the perfume is contained in a square bottle made of thick glass....
on the same day that PH itself comes 😉

There is one of them and the most charming fragrances available, which will be available to touch and which will always be in my collection…
there is also one of the last Gucci fragrances that is safely marked (the last one is Gucci PH II), which has its logo and at the same time appears as ""the last of the Mohicans"" - the quintessence of a characteristic, sophisticated style and substance...
something that Gucci lost, consciously - in pursuit of Boss, Lacoste and other brands with fragrances that are nice, light and bring nothing, but provide considerable profits...

So what is Pour Homme?
It is heavy, spicy, woody and slightly oriental…
It starts on the skin with a characteristic masculine pepper note, which, however, politely withdraws after a while, allowing the composition to breathe with its full spicy, powerful heart...
Although the composition doesn't show it, I also feel cinnamon, cloves and much more precious wood than the manufacturer declares...
It's hard to be surprised, after all, who would reveal the full composition of such a masterpiece...
And the composition is undoubtedly a masterpiece that no manufacturer would be ashamed of - even a niche one... There are several fragrances similar to PH on the market, including: Azzaro Visit or Piver Epices, but none of them comes close to the ""cinnamon prince"" in terms of nobility, complexity and perfect combination of ingredients...
It's hard for me to believe that a fragrance so complex and full of heavy, difficult to tame and strong scent notes was combined into such a uniform, smooth and coherent composition, in which each individual ingredient is a perfectly fitted element of the intricate puzzle from which this perfume was woven...
Gucci PH is a fragrance that dominates its surroundings, is suggestive and does not allow the person wearing it to pass by indifferently...
some people say that it smells like a pharmacy or a doctor's office... I only smell a composition filled with oriental spices and noble wood for a decisive and domineering man...
if we combine it with wonderful projection, the dignity of the composition itself and the unprecedented lightness with which it bounces off the skin to leave a pleasant spicy tail and is characterized by the legendary durability of almost 12 hours... - we get a perfect fragrance!...
yes, my dears, this is an example of good old Gucci... they don't make such fragrances anymore and they won't make them at Gucci...
In addition, a beautiful warm cinnamon color, perfectly reflecting the character of the composition and using a massive black cork suggesting the use of the fragrance for the evening time of the day...
The whole thing was enclosed in a relatively simple bottle made of thick glass, with an even thicker bottom resembling the shape and weight of whiskey glasses... what a simple but refined form... charming simplicity and a thoroughly masculine form, without unnecessary frills...
The bottle perfectly harmonizes and blends with the color of the liquid and the fragrance itself, creating a perfectly tasteful and harmonious whole...

I sprayed it on a was instantly in love and we went back to see if they had anymore. Unfortunately they did not. Well I used the bottle up until it was bone dry thinking I would find another somewhere and by the time I did it was already going for over $100. Now it is astronomical if you can find it.

The closest alternatives I could find to it (based on my humble efforts) is Lalique's encre noir which I also stopped using years ago because it started to smell bitter & sour in some batches.

Another amazing alternative which filled the gap for me is loewe 7. However, this gucci has middle eastern vibes in it. And with the emergence of many middle eastern fragrance brands in recent years.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"This 100% is not a 1:1 with Bentley Absolute and anyone saying that is either nose blind or hasn’t smelled both. Bentley Absolute clearly has an added ingredient I believe it’s synthetic ‘western Oud’ and pepper removed from the heart. I’d say they go in the same direction and Bentley Absolute is a great substitute but they are NOT the same.

I like Gucci Pour Homme I more because it is cleaner smelling to me. Smells more versatile and classy.

What can I say about the scent profile?

The market has determined a 100ml is worth about $300 at the time of writing this and I think that’s a fair valuation. It’s as good as fragrances that resell for that price on discounters I think of Creed Royal Oud, Louis Vuitton Ombré Nomade, and YSL Babycat as examples and this scent is just as good as all of them with added historic value. The bottle is shockingly thick glass and heavy feels very well made. I imagine it will 100% appreciate in value imagine what it’ll be worth 15 years from now? Probably a lot.

A 50ml goes for about $150 to 200 and is enough to wear it once a month for about 10 years…

Amazing smooth classy scent.

Theres a lot of auctions at $5-800 but they are not selling at those prices it’s just sellers that are daydreaming.

This is a classic Cedar scent with pepper. If you like Bentley Absolute you will like this but may not find it worth the price difference. I do. Since I’ll only wear this on special occasions a $300 100ml bottle is a lifetime supply and it feels special. As it ages in my collection it’ll feel even more special. Can’t get that with Bentley.

And to everyone saying the original perfumer claims Bentley has the same formula - maybe he lied? Since a lot of people buy Bentley thinking it’s the same formula as GPHI the lie worked.",02/12/24 08:06,POTFORTY2

I long for the day a proper 1:1 clone of this surfaces because Papyrus and Bentley Absolute both miss the Tom Ford additions/subtractions of GPH1 - ignore those that say they're exactly the same, they're not, if they had the original to hand to compare they'd know the difference a mile away.

Will only wear it on special occasions now. Bentley Absolute IS a very close replica of it, especially the dry down.

It was deep, superior, masculine and irresistible. I looked across at the sales assistant and she held up the bottle for me. I just had to buy it too even though I'd told myself no more. To be fair, it later seemed that I was more attracted to Gucci Pour Homme than those around me. There's a mystical incense vibe that doesn't suggest youth, sexiness or sportiness but it doesn't reach fart-in-suit territory like many other scents.

I proceeded to dispense one spray onto the back of my hand and I was worried…. But the scent immediately transported me back to my twenties when I must’ve bought this. I must’ve had “baby nose” as I probably didn’t appreciate what a masterpiece this fragrance truly is. It gives me this really warm cozy feeling.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Here’s the deal. I spent months trying to track this fragrance down. Months of sifting through absolutely ridiculous prices, months of finding nothing but the new ‘Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme’ or ‘Gucci Pour Homme II.’ When I finally found a bottle of this fragrance for a realistic price, I jumped on it. And… well.

It’s good. It’s really, really good. But when we’re talking between $400-600 for a 50ml bottle, forget it. It isn’t that good, no matter how you spin it. Normally I try not to discuss price too early in my review, but it’s impossible not to here. Unlike it’s brothers Pour Homme II and Envy, Pour Homme I has been cloned rather successfully. Bentley for Men Absolute is the first one everyone points to, but Michel made a very similar fragrance for his own perfume house, too.

To be completely fair to PH1, it’s certainly deeper and richer than its clones. It really is magnificent. It’s a cedar bomb, with some pepper and incense through it. Very refined and very masculine, yet very subtle. Not as subtle as the likes of Gucci Rush, but it’s not going to choke people out. It’s a tantalising scent, just begging to be discovered. The closest thing I had in my collection until getting this one was Creed’s Royal Oud, and this smacks Royal Oud around so hard it isn’t even funny.

It’s a tragedy that this was discontinued. If it could still be found for $50 a bottle, it’d be the biggest steal in all of fragrance, bar none. Hell, even $100 for a bottle would be perfectly justified, maybe even $150 if you were REALLY pushing it. But for the prices it commands today, I just can’t recommend it.",12/15/22 14:50,Captain Odour

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Presented as a work of art: its stylish, distinctive flacon is simple yet elegant, the golden amber fluid inside is captivating in its beauty.
Warm and woody with a hint of pencil shavings, subtly sweet with facets of tonka bean and ambery vanilla and resinous depth conveyed by frankincense and labdanum.
The woody and incensey aspects really emphasise the meditative impression of GPH.
To my mind it summons the image of a Buddhist temple.
GPH always struck me as an elegant man’s fragrance that could easily be unisex - stylish and innovative, yet fairly linear.

Mr Almairac created a variation on a theme in Bentley for Men Absolute, whose similarities to GPH are striking.
Although there are some differences (like the Western-style oud in Bentley Absolute) there are way more similarities between the two - both GPH and BA feel like they share the same DNA.
Not identical twins but siblings.
In addition to the overall formulaic similarity there’s one note in particular that both GPH and Bentley Absolute have in common - maybe it’s Papyrus?
In any case, it’s like a paternity test.

Although a supremely beautiful fragrance, GPH’s performance and longevity are disappointing.
The discreet simplicity and elegance of the solid, cubic crystal flacon with its golden nectar is a perfect visual representation of GPH.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"My son just got a decent of this from someone with a little less greed than most on eBay. Why would you discontinue this? I mean this is like their only good scent. I mean you have a designer company with many many departments. Doesn't someone with a little analytical sense see the love for this? Like can't they even see a pattern of flagship fragrances? Like Bleu De Chanel will be on Earth past the cockroaches. Same with Dior Homme. Like if they brought this back, they realize the profits?

But enough of that. This scent I just smelled and wow is that so nostalgic! I mean serious love was used and it's such a true 10/10 for me. I mean just look at the notes. I mean there are a shitload, and how they compliment and supplement each other just you don't see that anymore. Sadly now they want to use less and less to make a scent. No one even takes risk and does something in a different direction than mainstream. Like Moschino Toy Boy was as close as a risky one that I can think of and they knocked it out of the park

The fact that some of these companies discontinue such gems just baffles me. Like look at Mugler. The Angel Men and flankers are some of the very best fragrances out there. And they discontinued each and every one except the blue OG. I mean all's that does is hurt the loyal customers and causes deep resentment. I mean the name Mugler used to have clout when you thought of it. Now I think of them as a flop. Just take a whif of that Alien garbage. That was like a F YOU, literally they have to be laughing at all those who blindly bought that. Like it's aweful. Now they target women and far as I'm concerned, they are out of my conscience.

Makes me think all the people at Gucci huddle together one rainy morning. All them watching the love on here and YouTube. They maybe a little smarter than anyone gives them credit for. They have a retirement investment that uses no bank and is guaranteed 500% or more on your investment. They get a few, not like everyone, and they buy up pallets and truck loads of this. Then stop the press. Discontinue. Wait a few years, the longer the wait the more on your investment. Just like a bank but more secure. I mean you don't even need a safe. Just think even if you get burglarized, they are not gonna haul away with heavy cologne. I mean a backpack full trust me you can't even carry without the straps breaking. I mean this idea is proven true just look on eBay how much people are getting a bottle. Hey you buy a bottle say $70-80. Now I seeen one go for $500. 6 times the cost, or 600%.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"GPH feels warm and friendly, comforting yet dignified, self-assured and serene.
GPH’s distinctive woodsy backbone reminds of my father, his library, desk, and armchair, and the subdued resins and incense add a meditative dimension, perhaps from memories of old temples in Kyoto, which have a very particular smell, probably due to centuries of burning expensive fragrant woods and temple incense.

For me GPH is warm, relaxing and meditative.

There’s a beautiful rich woodiness that reminds me of the finest aspects of sandalwood, cedar and patchouli united, then enriched and enhanced with other notes, that persists through to the dry down and create an overall impression of luxury.
Don’t detect any leather in GPH but I think leather is more of an idea or an accord based on a fantasy rather than an actual organic component. Like the dried skin of a dead animal soaked in a putrefying enzyme solution.

Performance is best in Winter, when GPH becomes an understated aura of meditative serenity that elicits compliments (from those close enough to smell it)

Bentley Absolute is one of my favourites and unquestionably the closest thing to GPH on the market at present.
Given the cult status of GPH it seems as though Mr Almairac created an heir to its legacy, a successor.

I really enjoy GPH and as is the case with so many fragrances (like Egoïste) just wish I’d been a bit less profligate with it in the days before it became such a precious commodity.

It is a very beautiful fragrance and one of Michel Almairac’s finest, but I wish it weren’t so rare and so expensive.",06/30/21 01:14,rowan.walters
Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"I used to work in the fragrance and beauty section of a pharmacy in my early twenties, and I used to own two or three bottles of this fragrance at a time. This was back in 2007-2008. One of my colleagues and good friends, who was from Slovakia, could not understand why I liked it so much and always used to say, “ it smells like church"". My Greek Cypriot friend agreed. But I absolutely loved it.

Gucci pour Homme was my first dry woody scent, and I have kept a soft spot for this sort of scent ever since, always on the hunt for something that scratches that itch. I just wish I had shown all my bottles more respect knowing now that this masterpiece would be discontinued and turn into a rare gem. A brother-in-law from Trinidad shared my appreciation for this dark and smoky incense perfume, so I gave him a couple of bottles to take home with him when he had come to visit in 2009.

In many ways, this was such a pure scent, which seems at odds with the array of notes that had been used to create it. I can only go by memory - and trust me, when I close my eyes I can still smell it - and this scent always made me imagine what it would have been like to live in the 70s. Dark, elegant, and a classic of its time.",06/29/21 19:32,RejdaPersa

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Smooth and smoky, incense and cedar. Finally got myself a sample of this to compare to my much loved Bentley Absolute.

Most of my review will be from the viewpoint of comparison with Bentley Absolute, because I bought that first, and have experience with it. If you have tried Bentley Absolute, you've smelled this before, it is that close. The 604 ""reminds me of"" votes here (as of May 2021) are spot on. The downvoters are most likely purists and diehard GPH owners who say that the Bentley could never compete, and in some regards it doesn't - but it is very close - and in all fairness, it doesn't need to compete.

From the perspective of a Bentley Absolute wearer who may be curious about what this fragrance offers, I can attest that Bentley Absolute does not deviate far from what Gucci Pour Homme 2003 did first. The sour smoke note is incredibly similar. When I opened my sealed sample pouch, I knew instantly what I was getting - it gave the very familiar smell of Bentley Absolute.

The best analogy I can come up with is that it's like two twins singing perfectly the same note, but their minor personality differences and differing life experiences allow you to distinguish which is preferred, ""nicer"" and more rounded.

I find GPH rewards you for smelling up close, whereas Bentley is more akin to a large artwork that you're best admiring from a distance. Bentley sniffed too close can break the illusion as your nose picks out certain elements that contribute to the overall image. GPH up close does not suffer the same problem, but rather invites you to keep sniffing closer and closer. Bentley will constantly remind you of its presence all day, whereas GPH is content to wait for you.

GPH is smoother - by which I mean there is a tighter focus on the woody notes with smoke and this makes it more photorealistic overall, whereas I think Bentley focuses more on pumping up the volume and giving the smoke some space, perhaps at the expense of some fireside realism. Bentley Absolute opens a touch greener/bright/woody/smoky, whereas Gucci tends more resinous/woody/smoky and stays that way. Again, the sour smoke effect is done in exactly the same style.

I don't think it is over hyped. GPH 2003 is beautiful and there's certainly good reason for the love it gets. If you're just curious about the similarity to Bentley Absolute and don't want to shell out $500 for a bottle of this (if you could even find it) then rest assured, the scent is 90% similar in character. The 10% difference for me is in the overall aims of each; Gucci being a bit darker, closed off, rounded and realistic, high-definition, more reserved while Bentley's is slightly more loud, more open, a bit obvious, and less concerned with subtleties while still getting the same job done.

If I had to boil it down to one point I'd suggest that Bentley Absolute was perhaps tweaked for loudness and cost vs GPH's more fleshed-out smoothness around the same theme.",05/18/21 21:49,Freshaquatic

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"This is pure sex in a bottle. The first time I encountered it was with a hot one nighter from VMU. It was in the middle of a winter blizzard of 2003/4. I met him online and he made it to my apartment from his dorm by foot, down the hill, enshrouded in a swirling mass of snow and this amazing scent!

The next morning over coffee, I asked him his name, and the name of the scent he was wearing. It was Gucci Pour Homme. I was at the Burlington, Mall the following afternoon to buy it at Macy's.

That was almost twenty years ago and I haven't had another bottle since. But I have often remembered it, and that Greek God who introduced it to me in the best way one could. And now, I am in disbelief to find that it has long since been discontinued. I feel as if the world has lost something akin to the recipe for Channel No. 5.

This is a bold release from the house of Gucci.....in many different ways! This was brave for them to release this as the main mens fragrance of the line (homme). This is a incense beast! A 2 second blast of citrus and papyrus up front then its straight into the deep, dark, smokey resinous woods and burning incense! The minute I sprayed this fragrance it was WOW! Oh man! What a statement! Then I thought, when could I ever wear such a smokey beast? An hour later and you will realize how fantastic this scent actually is! Burning wood and incense in a orange grove is the top. This beautiful monk in a church vibe is the mid. And the base is a smooth, sweet wafty musk, amber, smoked wood and incense. What a trip...what a fragrance...was perfect to experience while working in the yard on a crisp/clear winter afternoon! Amazing creation but I will say...these 3 2ml samples that I have will probably last me the year...a very situational scent. Pour homme II is better and more versatile btw.",12/29/20 14:41,chascall86

Not just the overtly sexualized clothing but also fragrances. In the end, Ford’s “Porno Chic” era had to give way to Millennial post-genderism and that left nowhere for the likes of GPH to hide. I still have about a third of a bottle of this but never wear it. Indeed, it is almost certain that any replacement “signature” scent I find WILL go the same way....into the furthest reaches of memory.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Very daring designer fragrance! Defiantly not a crowd pleaser.

Overall I love this fragrance, and have since I smelled it in 2007 at the age of 15. I received it in 2010, but I was still very young for it. Most people who commented had not positive things to say. But since first smell I have had a special connection to this. It reminded me of something very cozy and spicy - and so different.

Extremely peppery, extremely smoky and extremely woody.
Excellent - gives the cozy vibe of a fireplace without smelling just like it (check Demeter Fireplace for that).

This one is way better. But even though I love this one, there's still plenty of juice left in my 30ml bottle. That's because it gets too heavy and bitter for me to use for several days in a row. It has to be sprayed at the days where the mood is right for this mysterious smoky head turner.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"★★★★★

A very interesting and refined blend of incense, cedar and pepper. I was gifted an 100ml bottle (only 40ml remaining) and I had to do the usual comparison with Bentley Absolue.

I must confess, back in the day when Gucci pour Homme was around, I didn’t get the chance to test it. I was only focused on Envy, which is my favorite Gucci fragrance.

Years later, after all the praise I blind bought a bottle of Bentley Absolue so I can sniff what the fuss was all about. I loved the smell, even if the performance was not that great on me.

At this very moment, I finally have the original Gucci on my right hand (batch 0273) and the Bentley on my left. They smell almost identical, the only difference is that the Bentley comes across a bit brighter with a slight leathery oud nuance, whereas the Gucci in the dry down has a more prominent incense note.

Having said that, I will say that both are average performers. (the Bentley has a bit more projection while Gucci better longevity)

Please, do not spend the insane amounts on eBay! As a fellow fragrance aficionado who still misses his favorite scent D&G By Man (which I still haven’t found and I’ve been searching for so many years), I guarantee you the differences are very very minor. It’s the same formula! The same aromatics were used! Bentley doesn’t smell cheaper, you will get the whole effect with it. The statement that the same perfumer used the same formula in both scents is absolutely true!

I feel like I need to get this out there (like many other reviewers have done) and prevent people from spending the crazy amounts of money instead of giving Bentley Absolue a try. Sometimes, when we can’t reacquaint with our favorite scent, we only keep the memory of it, therefore our perception is altered. I feel that’s the reason why many people here say that the Bentley is not even close to Gucci, which is f a u l s e.

Bentley is really keeping this beautiful fragrance among us! I wish there was a substitute for D&G By, but I’m not as fortunate as all of the Gucci Pour Homme cult followers!",11/06/19 17:12,Cerulean

""BENJAMIN: We started 2 years ago with our boutique and eight eaux de parfum. We launched two new scents at the beginning of 2018 – Chypre Mojo and Orris Tattoo. In June 2018, we launched a new exclusive perfume for Selfridges London and our boutique, it's called Papyrus Oud. This perfume may remind you a lot of Gucci Pour Homme, which was made by my father. So it’s OK, it’s still our formula. A lot of people enjoyed Gucci Pour Homme, it's like a religion.



SERGEY: Yes, people are still looking for it on ebay…

BENJAMIN: Actually, my father made three Gucci Pour Homme – the first was created for Gucci, the second was made for Bentley (Bentley Absolute For Men), and the third is Papyrus Oud. The first two are discontinued. There's a little less incense in our formula, and it's a little more oudy-musky, it's warmer and comfortable, my father likes our version better, since he does not like too much incense.

He said he father made 3 versions of GPH, no where does he say that the version he sold Bentley was the same as Gucci, and actually if his father made one single formula he wouldn't say,..""my father made 3 GPHs ""....he would say that his father made one GPH, and sold it's formula 3 times. It's nuanced and I don't blame Andy, so don't attack me Andy, I'm just pointing out that you making fun of people spending money on GPH aren't buying an ""identical"" scent,....sorry they just aren't, i own 2 bottles of each.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"The early to mid two thousands were a Golden Age for masculine perfumery, and those of us who were coming of age and interested in fragrances at the time probably didn't realise it. I had--and loved--Rive Gauche, Rive Gauche Intense, Rive Gauche Light, the glorious original formulation of Armani Code, Richard James Savile Row, Davidoff Good Life, CGD Kyoto, and of course, this gem. This was the one I wore to nice restaurants or on winter nights out, and while it was not my favourite of the lot, it scented many great coming of age memories.

It was only after it was discontinued that I really started craving it. Something about the dry, vaguely pencil shaving tinged incense and amber in it became addictive. By that point, it was beginning to command huge prices on the grey market. I'm not sure anything will ever replace it, though others have tried and mostly failed.

You summed it up and ackowledged what I said: the power of branding, and that brands want people to buy the brand, not the content.

In the wine field it's the same: what counts is who is the winemaker (and the terroir obsviously), not who the owner of the estate is. Most people are looking for the estate name, history, legend (aka ""label drinkers""), while others look for the winemaker (wine experts)... What the first one want to drink is the image, while the latter focus on the juice. I am part of latter (not as an expert though).
The mass has a hard time admitting, as you said, that who created GPH1 is Michel Almairac, not Gucci... The only brand honest enough to disclaim it is Frederic Malle.

Thanks for sharing your views, I agree!

Suggestion for poor Gucci fans: get BA and transfer the juice in a GPH1 bottle ;)",01/12/19 13:08,Andy the Frenchy
Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"@ Andy the Frenchy, the thing is, this very same formula was introduced as a Gucci Scent, and the prestige, heritage and clout the Gucci brand became synonymous with, meaning, those of us who could relate to Gucci and what it stood for, bought more than just a scent- we bought an experience as a result of what we associated with by the the shape of the bottle, the color of the juice, the image portrayed in the ad, the spark it created when we, those die hard fans of this masterpiece, experienced back the. Like you've said with the Coke experiment, that demonstrates the power and force of association. As crazy as it might sound, few people would be willing to even free of charge, proudly accept a LV Speedy or Never Full bag, however identical it might appear, without the LV logo on the inside of that bag, simply because they know they will not have equal ""bragging right"", in case someone requests to see the inside of the bag- heritage is what separates the icons from the more younger and easily available ""houses"". What this scent represented and introduced us to to, is imprinted in that time capsule and our memories and this still has that gravitas to eclipse most of the more ""palatable"" aromas in this segment, so to say. Remember, it's only been over the past few years that noses became public knowledge, the designer was seen and regarded by the public what we could relate and aspire to be. pity as it might sound, I'm not willing to buy this formula unless it's presented as what I've become accustomed it to be, cause that's its identity,for many of us who went weak at the knees...People will have a hard time believing this to be ""that "" Gucci smell- hence it will take much effort for the nose to lure them, especially if without mentioning its relation to the original scent from 2001, people will naturally be skeptical. Gucci as a fashion house has been intriguing us mere mortals for many for years, Bently is known as an automobile

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Haha. The womanizing I did in this. Heavy on the sprays back in the day. Had to buy several bottles of it and I still have half a bottle left. Pencil sharpenings and sweat. Women loved it. But other stuff came along for me, TFTFE, then TFBO, then TF everything. People say this is irreplaceable, but that is not true, because you will have to replace it with something. Find that something sooner rather than later. GPH1 had its day, it is not coming back, get used to it.",12/31/18 13:42,Old School Tie
Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Agreed with @ShotsK.

I'm sorry for who has spent hundreds of dollars on GPH1, but Benjamin Almairac (the son of Michel Almairac, the nose behind GPH1) admitted in an interview to Fragrantica a few months ago, that his father made 3 twin versions of GPH1 (lowest price found online as of Dec 2018 on the side):

- Gucci Pour Homme 1 (2003) - $350/400 on ebay
- Bentley for men Absolute (2014) - $32 on FragranceNet
- Parle Moi de Parfum Papyrus Oud 71 (2018) - ~$180 directly on their website in France (excludes export taxes)

In the interview, Almairac said that the 3 versions were identical, with Papyrus Oud 71 having a minor variation and the version he would have liked GPH1 to be without Tom Ford reviewing it.
I think that is the demonstration of the power of marketing, branding and packaging. Take 3 bottles of Coca-Cola with 3 different labels, and people will feel 3 different tastes.

Minor variations or not, I'm asking you and all the super collectors and fragnerds: which of the the 3 bottles is the best buy, given that Almairac himself admitted that those are 99.9% identical??

Note: I have never smelt GPH1 or PO71. But assuming they are identical I am happy to have spent only $32 on BA. Because, while I think that $32 is a good deal for such a scent, I would have felt scammed to spend more than $50 on that (independently of the bottle label) since there are much interesting frags around over that price range.",12/29/18 22:07,Andy the Frenchy

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Gucci Pour Homme I is a vintage oriental incense. There are two versions of the formula. One is very dark brown with an extremely potent incense note. And the other is a golden light brown, with the incense note strongly blended down into a sweet-spicy complex.

I personally favor the dark brown stuff for the vintage flare that it brings. The potency of the incense note is just otherworldly, and projects with the most amazing clarity and realism to it. It provides this vintage experience that's so life-like, it's amazing!

The incense takes you straight back to the 1920's...where you can literally smell the aged wood and atmosphere of the manor; you can see the people walking along the cobblestone streets; and everything around you optically appears in a monochrome vintage filter.

I personally enjoy every minute of it. I wore it on a trip downtown while walking around in Tower City, and it really emulates the scene of the old world architecture, and brings those vintage roots to life.

The golden brown stuff is a little more modern styled, but I'd say the vintage essence is still there; and it's a little special tastes, so possibly still not for everyone. It's just in the intended style. Gucci Pour Homme I is moreso a fragrance for those that are old at heart—and those with ties to the past.",02/10/18 18:48,ReapThaWhirlwind

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Excellent fragrance for a gentlemen. Classy, masculine, rugged, warm, and versatile enough to wear on most occasions whether in a business suit, or a casual Saturday in jeans and leather jacket. Better in colder months (fall and winter).

It's one of my wife's favorites on me and every Winter she asks when I'll be wearing it. My bottle is getting low (less than 1oz) so I have to wear it very sparingly. However, I must say Bentley Intense Absolute is nearly identical so I picked up a bottle so I can use the Gucci as little as possible. Unfortunately, neither the Gucci or the Bentley projects much, and sadly the longevity is only average at best for both of them. After all, they really are that close. Honestly, I can't tell the difference nor can the wife and friends.

GPH is probably the most masculine incense-based fragrance in my collection, along with Interlude of course. As much as I love it, I would not want to smell it on my wife because it's too masculine and I prefer her to smell like a lady, and which she prefers anyway thank God! I know the ladies that like ti wear men's colognes will down vote me for that comment, but I could care less. I'm a traditional kind of guy. And Gucci fits my personality perfectly. Probably the only fragrance that fits my personality better is Fahrenheit.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"I recently found three 50ml bottles of this beauty at my local fragrance shop for approximately $42 each. I had never gotten my nose on this, so I was a bit hesitant to purchase, as the tester in-store had clearly gone bad (liquid had turned green!). I pulled the trigger nonetheless and bought two bottles initially, and what can I say, it's an absolute masterpiece! I rushed back the following day and purchased the remaining bottle.

The fragrance starts off with a heavy dose of spice and wood and settles down to a beautiful and rich blend of the two as it dries down. Makes you feel empowered in no small measure. On first sniff, my better half thought it smelled too strong, but later got used to it and liked it. Although she did say that the woody notes gave off a wet wood vibe which was slightly off putting in her opinion.

I for one love this, and given that it has been discontinued, I will treasure it even more. It's definitely a fragrance more suited to more mature men and is perfect for formal occasions.

Wasn't really into frags that much back then but remember this being warm spicy sweet woodsy with tang and floral aspects going on.
I kept the cold heavy glass bottle only about 1/8 used for years and never used it then went off frags and then chucked it away! What an idiot!

Happy memories and now that I am more interested in frags am gutted that this cannot be obtained any more (except risky Ebay over priced half used bottles) so that I can see if it still envokes the same emotions and actually smells as good as I remember.
It would be great to be transported back to my carefree youth in the days when I wore this but also probably risky as would it still smell the same now anyway if it had carried on being produced?? (with the new rules on ingredients and volumes in frags etc....). Maybe it is best left to most people's memories or those lucky ones that retain some of the original.

Case in point being Polo Sport which was one of my other first frag loves - boy what a synthetic mess of a cheap frag this is now but what I remember was totally different and to be honest I don't think I've got it wrong as I think smells stay with us imprinted on the brain.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"The mighty Pour Homme I. The legend. If Rive Gauche started the legend of Tom Ford, then this one solidified it.

Upon it's release, nothing at all smelt like it. It was totally out there. A total throwback.

However, despite most throwback scents, GPH I is still valid in 2016. It smells mature, but not outdated. Grown up, but not old.

The opening is a woody affair. For all it's listed notes, I mainly get a dusty papyrus accord with ginger and hints of pepper.

As we reach the middle, the pepper is amped up. It becomes very spicy. An accord of earthy patchouli is here as well. This is the stage where GPH becomes very grown up and mature. It's very in your face at this staged, almost unrefined.

A woodsy combo of sandalwood and cedar ends the accord. It's a peculiar type of woodiness. You have the creaminess of sandalwood, with a slight briskness of cedar. It's impeccably crafted, and is a real headturner. Combined with the pepper and patchouli, it's possibly devastating.

After the quite raw middle stage, the base rounds it all out. Smoky incense, earthy vetiver and smooth vanilla are all here. In combination, they give this scent a distinct smoothness that sets it apart from the many vintage scents it borrows from. Where they are raw and unpolished, Gucci is a refined best of, a greatest hits collection of the best 70s and 80s scents in one bottle.

This a very smoky fragrance. However where CdG's 2 Man is artistic and unrefined, GPH I remains tamed and contemporary. It isn't as artsy nor raw as 2 Man, and this is what makes it timeless.

2 Man, it's closest contemporary, comes across as nice but weird. The incense is amped up and gives it a very distinct edge. Here the incense is used to fill out the composition. If 2 Man is a catholic church, GPH I is the refined gentleman attending mass.

GPH I isn't perfect at all, but GPH I and GPH II are by far the best things Gucci ever gave us.

Longevity is excellent 12+ hours. Unlike most scents with great longevity, GPH I remains restrained, always there but never in your face.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"Does price have a significant influence on perceived value? It can... sometimes unwarranted.

It's hard to believe now, but when Gucci Pour Homme was discontinued, you could find bottles of it for discount prices... as cheaply as $60 USD for a 100ml bottle! Today, it's not uncommon for a NIB 100ml bottle to be snapped up for $235 USD. What happened?

Rarity. GPH is not ""super"" rare, as you can see from the available inventory in that great resale channel known as eBay. But the quantity is low enough and resale price history high enough that most sellers drop them into an auction and watch in amazement as the price skyrockets.

Colin Maillard said this is not a masterpiece. I would have to disagree. GPH is easy to ""miss""... meaning, the impression of the top notes is rather ordinary. Nice, but no Mozart of fragrances. What I've found is that you have to be patient. And into the dry down, you can eventually realize just how wonderful this fragrance truly is. To say ""pencil shavings"" is to be guilty of quick presumption. It is not a distillation of pencil shavings. It is so much more than that.

Personally, I'd say GPH is well worth about $150 USD for 100ml, and not much more. Clearly people are paying more than that, as they fervently want to own something scarce. To catch a fleeting whiff in the air as though James Dean was flying by in his vintage Porsche speedster into history.

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,smells good but like cedar soda if that makes sense. I prefer something like Wonderwood or Encre Noir to this actually (especially factoring in the asking price on ebay). I think Gucci Envy is a much more interesting frag compared to this if you're going to pay that hefty ebay price. Not bad just not worth the hype. Love the bottle design tho.,08/24/16 00:11,jaydemm17

Now that I've sampled and read about so many fragrances, I've realized most ""commercial"" fragrances are more or less the same cheap chemical soup, so I started to dismiss them (with exceptions of course) and quickly move onto niche or ""private collections.""

Gucci pour Homme (2003) Gucci,"I think the notes on this are right on target!. As with so many reviews, I think this is a perfectly blended scent and no individual note overwhelms. I am not sure smoke or incense belongs in the #1 spot because this will not remind you of church or the smoke of lets say Sahara Noir or L' Air du Desert Marocain, but there is certainly incense in there. Manly. Dark. Cedar, leather and a slight bit of pepper. Sandalwood to give it a spicy smoke.
I blind bought this at $100.00 for 1.7oz because I simply had to experience it myself and while I like it a great deal I would not say it was worth what I paid. Close to the skin and so many have noted. Still detectable 6 hours later but its on its way out.

Today there is a trend to oud. And even oud seems to be the setting trend. The whole circle rotates again.
Gucci Pour Homme I isn´t an individual fragrance, but it was pretty popular, so is the hype after the discontinuation.
There are a few similar male fragrances out there, don´t pay those kapitalists the hundreds of Euros for the stocked up bottles.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"This is one of the best lilac inspired perfumes. It's very sophisticated and lasts for days on my skin, hair and clothes. I've been looking high and low and Gucci surprised me with this springy creation. It is not powdery, nor sweet and definitely not airy or too green like other perfumes I've tried. It's amazing and the ambery drydown is very original, not a powdery soup of notes. It's not similar to the Guilty original. I think they should rebrand it and call it Purple Love. An ode to lilac.

It is a little green, very light, the lilac note stays throughout the life of the fragrance on your skin. This makes it an ideal perfume for spring.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"I just left my grandmother's viewing. Her funeral is tomorrow and I came to macys because I wanted to buy a lip product for me to use.

I walked past the fragrance counter for a spritz drive by. I usually don't pay attention to the gucci counter but for some coincidence i spotted this matte lightish purple bottle. Automatically, I reach for it ...I sprayed and didn't even think anything of it until this wave of light flooded my brain..I couldn't even believe what I was smelling. Its a beautiful lilac with a lovely musk that's not the grungy musk . Its a calming, comforting scent that's almost as if you're getting embraced by an angel that's come to let you know everything will be alright even though things aren't looking right.

My grandmother's casket is a lilac light purple color with a slight mauve sheen tint to it. . So I leaned into the fragrance even more. It smells the way the color looks. Its not linear on my skin. It evolves and gets better as the time goes.

This review is getting too emotional. I appreciate the time to sink into this smell. I love it so much. First spray and maybe ill just grab a 2nd bottle just because. My grama and I used to bond over fragrance. The last time she complimented my perfume she asked for it and I swiftly gave her the bottle. Grama, I miss you so much.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"The opening is lovely. I am quite enamored with it. I feel skin-like lilac and musk. It is carnal and sensual. On my sample card it states only patchouli essence, vanillin and oak moss. I think in addition to the ingredients of the classic. Vanilla indeed sweetens it but in a great and restrained way. Patchouli or oak moss are not prominent on me. It feels present but light and solar. In how it wears it reminds me of J'Adore, sillage-wise. Close to the classic, lilac is the main focus. If one has the classic this is not needed, I think.
It is a feel good, smell good scent that does not make a statement and won't offend anyone. It is however sensual, luxurious and effortless. 6 hours in and I feel it gently around me, which means good performance.",04/22/25 07:11,MademoiselleMaya
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"Gucci Guilty has been my signature fragrance since 2011. Started with the OG EDT and the intense, and I remember being devastated when it got discontinued and replaced with the newer EDP, which smelled completely different. Things got a little better with the more recent EDT, which has become my new go-to and was a lot closer to the original notes I love, and then a little worse with the new intense, which I can’t stand. But having recently purchased this, it’s brought back everything I remember loving about the original EDT and more. An easy, classic, soft-powdery-sweet floral.

I can tolerate it because it's dialed back here and the scent overall is very intimate and close to the skin.
Unfortunately after a short 10-15 minutes it dries down to a very uninspiring ambery musk base with a hint of sweetness to it. I don't think it worth the price.",03/22/25 12:22,vargadorkaluca

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Love Edition 2024 is hands down my favorite version since the original gold square bottle that I loved! I've tried every version since then, trying to recapture that feeling lol. It's very lilac-forward at first, and to me it lasts much longer than the 2021 version. I sometimes have a love/hate relationship with patchouli, but thankfully the patchouli in this is the sweet earthy, green, fresh kind. It really adds richness and longevity to the perfume. It might start off feeling cool and realistic like you're burying your head in a lilac bush, but it gets richer as it dries down, and becomes more warm, deep, and ambery. I think that is where the genius of this version lies. This is so pretty! The ingredients include hydroxycitronellal and alpha-isomethyl ionone, but this is not a powdery violet, it comes off as a freshly floral, sweet (not sugary) lilac mixed with lily of the valley. It's not really fruity either, like the raspberry 2020 version. Modern, not ""matronly.""

I use 4 sprays (both elbows, both sides of neck) and on 4 out of the 5 days I wore it last week I got complimented and asked what I was wearing, so apparently people can smell it a few feet away about 4 or so hours after I applied it. Would be appropriate during Spring, Summer, and even Autumn. Days, not nights. It really smells PURPLE and I love the dusky purple bottle. I bought a 50mL, but will be going back for the bigger bottle before this limited edition disappears! It's not as rich or sweet as the Elixir, but I think it would be lovely to wear this one during the day and then spritz the Elixir over it in the evening for a little more oomph!",02/11/25 16:14,UtCal5rn

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"I have this in my collection now and I will say a positive thing about the performance. This scent profile typically lends itself to being an evening scent and I originally thought that this was going to be that for me but I've found it appropriate for all day wear and easily worn in temps of 70-80F. I live in Palm Springs; CA and it never gets cold here during the day, so I don't really need that many cold weather fragrances in my collection. For me, I get a good 5-6 hours of wear with this with moderate projection and scents have a way of just slipping off my skin. Also, with designer scents, I'm much more likely to overspray and not feel bad about it. I wore this to my parents and they mentioned how strong my perfume was. Yes, they both have sensitive noses, but I ALWAYS wear perfume and they don't ALWAYS say this to me, so I say the performance of this fragrance is actually good for me. I've just opted to purchase bottom filled fragrance decant travel sprays and make a travel spray for most of my perfumes at this point. Like, the only ones in my collection that don't need to be refreshed during the day are Hibiscus Mahajad, Delina, BTSO (they have PHENOMENAL performance), Angel, Perris Monte Carlo, Althair, BDK. Performance of perfumes just suck in general for me so it's nothing new for a perfume to last 5-6 hours. Actually that's good for me.

Lilac always gives me an innocent impression, but not here. This is a sexy and mature lilac.",01/24/25 04:25,rylai
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"Sampled this on skin. The lilac is quite nice. It's ambery, but with that typical somewhat soapy, soft Gucci Guilty DNA. It's quite likeable, but at the same time not very memorable. Dries down nondescript ambery. It's nice, but I'm not wowed. I guess that typical Gucci Guilty DNA just isn't for me. I can't handle white musk whatsoever.

It's been 8 hours or more and I can still smell it on skin from two sprays. I guess with sufficient sprays performance should be quite decent.

The bottle is the wrong colour though. Should have been lilac, like that Gucci Flora Magnolia bottle. Why is that one lilac anyway?",01/17/25 12:31,Rhialto the Marvellous
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"There's a soft green note at the top that I couldn't discern, then I found out that it was lilacs! I don't think I've ever smelled fresh lilacs so it's very unique. Definitely fits the bottle color. Doesn't last too long though.

If you've seen Nosferatu (2024) I feel like this fits in with that vibe (iykyk). The dry down is light and powdery, almost like baby powder. I like it, it's different. It has a mature, yet ethereal edge to it.",01/16/25 17:00,candieskulls
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"OMG! The moment it hit me, it took me straight back to my fave memories. This is so subtle, so simple, and far from generic.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,I really love this fragrance with the subtle powdery lilac and the sweet ambery dry-down.

Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"After the first spray, I thought that this was my ultimate lilac perfume. That thought disappeared within 10 minutes. My grandma used to soak lilac flowers in this cheap chipre cologne to create some sort of rubbing alcohol. This is what it smells like after 10 minutes: green amber, or cheap lilackish cologne. Super disappointing.",01/03/25 18:12,yuliannart
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"I was really looking forward to testing this but sadly I'm very disappointed. I own the elixir version and that is a violet, rose, fruitachouli with vanilla bomb with excellent lasting power. Very sweet, yes but it's fun and easy to wear. This new love edition is quite frankly very much like the original Gucci Guilty pour femme but weaker. It is more fresh I will give you that but it didn't bring anything really new to the table. I was expecting more of a real lilac presence and this isn't that. A fresher version of the original. And it is sweeter than what the above accords would have you think. Nothing new, weaker and quite boring.

Edit: 1/4/25 the review above mine nailed it. Right, totally right. This is very weak. The lilac accord starts off nice but disappears quickly. What the hell Gucci?! The rest of this line is a nuclear bomb. Also, after 5 minutes it turned into a weaker version of the original. I am sooo disappointed. I wanted to like this one and have it in my collection. If you are looking for lilac search elsewhere this is more of a fruity/floral/patchouli just like the original. Nice but not really all that floral. But then again the younger crowd will probably think this is very floral. It is somewhat more floral than many so called floral newer fragrances on the market today.",01/03/25 09:54,LSAUG
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"Smelled this today at Sephora, really surprised to not see violets on the note list. I definitely smelled a violet note in here and to me lilacs and violets do not smell alike. I'm a huge violet fan and lilacs are definitely not a note I seek out. The patchouli was very well done and not overwhelming whatsoever. I found this to be clean, fresh, and it had that violet cooling quality that they possess. This wasn't powdery. It was listed as being woody and perhaps I didn't smell long enough for the woody notes to come out but to me it was much more of a fresh floral fragrance.",01/01/25 22:35,Blossomlove
Gucci Guilty Love Edition Pour Femme 2024 Gucci,"As with the male version in this love edition 2024, the notes are not 100% as declared by the brand, according to Gucci are essence of Patchouli, vanillin and oakmoss accord, but here there is much more and you can especially notice flowers, I feel the pristine cleanliness of the lilies of the valley and the most modern lilac like A drop by Issey and above all, the one it most resembles is another fragrance from the house of Gucci, which is from its private line. ""Tears of the moon"" I suspect that these love editions, like the previous ones, are the work of Alberto Morillas, as is Tears of the Moon, this love edition is not so similar to the one compared to 2020, that one had a very present raspberry along with it to the violet and in this one the floral of the lilac is felt more like in the 2021 edition but even so it is not as similar, this one has its own path, it is a clean floral fragrance with an almost solar lilac accompanied by the whiter and soapier lily of the valley, bathed by the slight sweetness of Patchouli and a shy bitter touch of that oak moss accord with a base (like inj the masculine one) of that very modern ""ambroxanic"" vanillin, but without sweet excesses, no extremities and just like the men's version, the color of the bottle honors the fragrance inside, bravo for these two new Gucci releases, I completely loved them.
PS: if you like tears of the moon but find it excessively expensive, this would be a good option, although they have a similar vibe, it is not that they are the same.",12/24/24 01:35,Abry_81

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This smells like a daytime version of Dolce & Gabbana the one desire. If you get it on your clothes it will smell identical the next day, and you get more of a vanilla/caramel scent.

I think the reason why some people smell banana in this is because of the sweetness from the vanilla and freshness from the ozonic notes, which combined give off a hint of ripe fruit + yellow bottle = banana",11/12/25 12:34,okmnm
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Love it! Sweet fruity vanilla, cosy yet fresh. I could still smell it on my skin next day. I don't smell banana, more like a melon like scent. I used to have the Atheeri by Lattafa, that perfume caused me mayor headaches and nausea, despite me liking the scent, there was something off. Later I found out about the gucci one, and was expecting banana, but after smelling it, it immediately reminded me of the Lattafa one, so I was expecting the headache and nause to come, and it never did. This perfume is just perfect, some say it is not unique, however I find it very unique in it's own right amongst my 30ish perfumes. Maybe I am not a total connoisseur but to my nose Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid is delicious, clean, sweet and long lasting.",11/10/25 07:36,Liluanita
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Gorgeous Orchid leads with a melon-mango-aquatic note (or ozonic, if you prefer...), but there is also some generalized floral sweetness, and powdery, non-gourmand vanilla in the background. For me, this is a pleasant stand-out among the Gorgeous Flora line, though overall it does seem generally similar to many, many other fruity-floral aquatic scents.
Regardless of its degree of distinctiveness, it certainly is a freshly wet-sweet fragrance for casual wear.",11/06/25 19:31,Marck Menke

I'm sick of Miss Dior (I used up my travel spray and thought I liked it, but the moment I bought a full bottle I couldn't stand wearing it anymore, I really need to sell that thing). I don't know what it is, because looking at the pyramids they don't even have any notes in common, but there's something musty and powdery about both perfumes that makes me want to gag now.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I don't even know what's going on here, so much fruit, and a note of... Fig? Maybe it's my nose but even if it's not listed in here I swear, this has to include it somehow. It reminds me of a cottage lost in a flower field in the middle of spring. I mentioned the fig cause I sense something reminiscent of jam, powdered with a mix of honey. There's also the need to mention that this perfume is STRONG, not so sure about the sillage but damn, the projection might've fill up an entire room with a tiny spray. Also there might be some mangoes going on here... And almost banana too, as I mentioned, super fruity. And there's also this signature clean vibe to it as well, similar to Gorgeous Gardenia, but more diffused. It has more depth than Gardenia, with all the fruitiness and sweetness going on, so if you like fun, bubbly fragances this might be a good find for you.",10/14/25 04:45,_chaekoo_

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I tested this many, many times and was obsessed with the idea of it. I love vanilla and I loved the cheerful and feminine yellow floral bottle. I really got it in my head that this injection of yellow was what I needed in my life.

So even though I always felt unsure after testing, I went ahead and bought an 8ml decant. Oh boy... this stuff gives me nausea. Really badly. As in, I get so sick that I feel on the verge of vomiting.

Not to say that this perfume smells putrid or anything. It doesn't. But whatever they use to create ""ozonic notes"" does not agree with my body. In general, salty vanilla scents make me uncomfortable. The whole concept is odd to me. Either be vanilla or be marine, but don't try to be both.

This to me smells very chemical, like watered down banana cough syrup. If you like banana then that might actually be great for you. It also has intense longevity.

The entire Gucci gorgeous line is just... not for me. What will be very interesting is if and when they make an ""intense"" version of this scent. I'm afraid, but also curious at the same time 😅",09/19/25 02:02,LaMiaRosa

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Beautiful, vanilla, floral with an interesting ozonic fresh fantasy accord.

Atheeri does not smell like this! Sorry, it doesn't. Not at all. And, if I need to wait a year for it to mature, Lattafa do better. Either macerate the perfume properly before putting it out on the market or use better ingredients, like other affordable Middle Eastern brands, so upon purchase your customers do not have to wait so long to use their purchase.

Perfume is NOT wine, when one buys a perfume, ideally we want to wear it out of the box.

An additional thought, Lattafa, usually after 30 days an item is not returnable. SOOO, if a perfume takes 6-months to a year to develop, then it just does not make sense for many buyers to discover if the fragrance is right for them. Especially with some retailers not having testers available on site and/or telling you a perfume is a ""final sale"". This is no bueno for sales and/or buyers.

Thank you for considering my thoughts.",08/31/25 21:29,CatDatMeoOws

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I absolutely adore this scent, despite it being rather simple and linear it reminds me a lot of fresh mornings in spring. I personally get a bit of lemonade when I smell it on my skin but others have told me it smells very floral with an underlying tone of vanilla which becomes more prominent once it dries down throughout the day.

I normally prefer gourmand scents, but this hits just the spot between gourmand and fresh for me and I've fallen in love. It's a great everyday scent for spring and summer (and warm fall days) that I think anyone regardless of age (or gender if you're a man who prefers florals) can wear. Longevity is surprisingly decent and the silage is good enough to not be overwhelming unless you drown yourself in it.

If you like soft, feminine, floral, happy, sweet, fresh yet cozy scents then I recommend gorgeous Orchid!",08/25/25 04:34,Appelfizz

So, this is actually rather difficult to describe. It feels bright, happy, cheerful, and charming. It’s a fresh and airy vanilla, but it’s also sweet, and somehow even cozy. It’s delicate and powdery, but also has a kind of creaminess to it. It’s basic, linear, and rather simple, yet somehow unique. It’s like its uniqueness comes from its simplicity. It’s sweet, but not too sweet, and never cloying. If sunshine and happiness could be bottled, this is what it would smell like!

I bought this as soon as it was available to pre-order from Gucci, and I was apparently one of the first people to try it. Oh my goodness it was so very beautiful to me! It’s been just over a year now, and I still love it just as much as I did from the very first sniff! This is easily the best of the whole Flora collection! This has actually ended up becoming one of my top favorite vanillas! I absolutely adore it! It’s one of the few fragrances that I keep a backup bottle of. It’s also one of my most complimented fragrances. Everyone just really seems to love this one!

This is perfect as a fragrance to wear everyday, and would make a lovely signature scent. It wears beautifully throughout the entire year, and feels suitable for women of all ages. It’s a super easy reach that works for all occasions. The bottle is really beautiful, it gives the perfect vibe for the fragrance it holds. Also, the spray nozzle works wonderfully, it always sprays evenly and the perfect amount.

I get excellent performance with Gorgeous Orchid. The longevity is incredible, it lasts throughout the entire day on me, and I can smell it the next morning. The projection is great, it radiates out at least a few feet from me.

For reference, some of my other favorite vanillas include Kayali Yum Boujee Marshmallow, Kayali The Wedding Silk Santal, Kayali Vanilla 28, Kayali Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar, Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato, PDM Oriana, Kilian LDBS, Burberry Goddess, The 7 Virtues Vanilla Woods, Ellis Brooklyn Marshmallows, VS Vanilla Lace, BBW Beach Nights, BBW Boardwalk Marshmallow Clouds

Not in a terrible way but just not in a way I necessarily want on my skin! One of my favorite YouTubers rants and raves about this one,, and I just have to disagree it’s mediocre.

The beginning is almost unbearably too much for me: strong, intense, heavy, sweat... and something else that I don't really know what it is (maybe the vanilla?). Someone said that the 'dry down' reminded them of Marc Jacobs and I really want to know WHICH Marc Jacobs. Because the far dry down is, to me, the best part - yet still not quite there.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Nose Note #450

A great new release from Gucci that's getting really popular in 2025 and for a reason. Really sweet, very yellow (bottle ycolor is matching perfectly). The three notes given don't tell the story. It's a little peachy and very flowery. But maybe it does consist of only handful of notes, because this bears minimal complexity and doesn't develop almost at all and thus can become a little annoying.
But my wife loves it - that's most important.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"It absolutely reads as banana, not full on banana pudding but a more green banana, sweetened by vanilla - banana has a slight floral smell (to me anyway) rather than all out fruity.
It’s bright, fresh & summery, the opening is quite green. It lasts reasonably well on clothing, on skin maybe 4 hours? A little longer perhaps. It’s one of my favourites right now, perfect for spring and summer.",07/27/25 02:16,LittleDolly
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Smelled way better on the test strip than it did on my skin. On my skin it was a plastic, air freshener like vanilla. I can see why people enjoy it, it’s just not my style. A lot of reviews mentioned banana but I don’t really get any. Very little to no projection. Meh.",07/24/25 18:42,Vannamae__
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I have to be honest. I think many people are imagining a banana note because the bottle is banana yellow. This is very vanilla and creamy, with a bit of a zing (I think that may be the ozone?). I don’t smell flowers at all, this is very gourmand. I tried it out today and kept smelling my own wrist, I just found it very delicious.",07/21/25 21:52,cagewithhumansoul
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This layers so beautifully with Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 59. I love 59, but since its a mist I was looking for an EDP to enhance its longevity. I love Georgeous Orchids' soft, sweet and fresh aura. 59 adds a depth and sweetness that makes it really stand out.",07/20/25 14:45,Scentalicious25
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I actually enjoy this. It reminds me of when I chew on haribo banana sweets 😋. Fresh banana vanilla flowery summer scent.
I enjoy this quite a bit. Its a simple scent nothing complex.",07/20/25 04:57,Arion

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"beautiful summer scent :) nice simple straight forward scent but done very well :) to me it has a sunny sweet disposition............nice smooth vanilla topped with the aroma of orchids............i dont get ozonic notes but maybe thats where i get sunny lol this is easy to wear for any occasion too :)

good one gucci :)",07/15/25 16:27,violetstorm
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Very very sweet and delicate vanilla carrying a soft lingering hint of banana. The opening is super pleasant, green, fresh.. i just hoped it lasted a bit longer",07/14/25 05:47,Aleeecstasy
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Really interesting! From the sample strip alone I would not have tried it on skin, it was to my nose vegetal, green and dry, no vanilla. But I did spray it on my hand because I'm in search for soft vanillas and I knew the composition. Glad I did! After a minute it transformed to a sweet and light vanilla with ozonic qualities. It sometimes reminded me of vanilla scented soap (in a good way), a really luxe and expensive soap. Maybe not full bottle worthy, but overall really nice fragrance!",07/11/25 10:07,Rekaniusz
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I was expecting a slightly soft sweet vanilla , but instead i got strong garden flowers mixed with mango . So its very floral green . But its a quite pleasant and unique scent, it catches attention for sure .",07/10/25 06:17,Inessneyssa
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,Very poor performance. Why couldn’t it last longer and have a bit more kick to it?,07/07/25 19:14,Caramelkisses
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I tried Bosca Vanilla Forte from Guerlain a few months ago thinking I would love it, but it ended up being way too salty for me. this is exactly what I imagined it would smell like - a slightly aquatic, powdery, and salty vanilla. this is lovely! it has all of the correct facets that turn an ordinary vanilla into a perfect summer signature scent. I only have a little sample but I love it and if you’re looking for a perfect summer vanilla that you can equally wear on your beach day as well as evening dinner, this is the one. it is fleeting on skin but lasts nicely on clothes!",07/06/25 09:09,fraghead97
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"A very floral vanilla fragrance with an ozonic background. Simple but dramatically good—not groundbreaking! I can't imagine how anyone could dislike this perfume.
It performs well with excellent projection. I would definitely recommend this to vanilla fragrance lovers as it's an easy-to-wear, everyday perfume.",07/06/25 04:57,Princessy
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Received a full size bottle as a gift. I wear it anytime I go out literally every day and the bottle is still going strong after a year and a half. I have a complicated relationship with this perfume because it does smell good, indisputably, but it doesn’t really fit my vibe at all. I prefer a woodsy, spicy, more unisex scent. I also use Lush’s “Super Milk” product daily (orange, lemon, oat milk, subtle florals) in my hair, so this fragrance REALLY mingles well with that. I just don’t want to wear it forever, because its silage is powerful and the creamy floral blend is quite memorable — not really the kind of smell I want associated with my memory or lingering in every space it touches. If you don’t believe me, ask the kids I teach — they are telling me every single day how good my classroom and office smell, even when I’m not there.",07/06/25 03:01,han_banan
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"To me this a perfect summer dress perfume, vanilla but airy and fun. I am very picky but this one is a 9,5 / 10.",07/05/25 03:22,orchidso
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"When I spray Gucci Orchid, I kinda imagine fruits, such as bananas (maybe banana pie?) and passion fruit. I smell vanilla, as well. It is very sweet, may not be hot-weather-friendly, it is a bit heavy :)
I just loved this perfume as soon as I smelled it! People smell it from me quite actively, it has a good projection. This scent gets me compliments even from people who do not like any fragrances :) Longevity is nice: my skin makes perfume evaporate fast, usually, but this one lingers to me for 5+ hours.
Not a safe blind buy, seems a lot of people find this one too generic (I strongly disagree), but definitely worth to test it out! People around me and I all love this beautiful orchid.",07/04/25 07:36,FlowerPower020
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"So many strange perspectives of this below.

This is not like Burberry goddess because it has no lavender, the similarity is vanilla. Many perfumes have vanilla that doesn’t mean they all smell the same.

This is also no green. Maybe slightly because of the florals but it is sweet.

There’s no banana note but the way vanilla is done here and in my opinion it’s the vanilla orchid note i believe is what creates this illusion of a banana ish scent. To me it reminds me of the little yellow banana runts candies.

With that said i don’t feel this is juvenile like most candy style perfumes can be.

I do find this to be a sort of casual elegant easy type of perfume.

It’s definitely not like “ a generic every department store perfume”. That’s a very generalizing statement.

The closest I’ve smelled of this is Lataffa Atheeri BUT it is not exact as that one has a bit more of a heaviness in the base/ dry down that this one doesn’t have and i believe it’s the amber wood note.

Personally i really love this one and to me it does stand out in my collection of over 150 fragrances both designer and middle eastern and even some niche ones as well.",07/02/25 08:37,Arlene_witha_Y
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"The reviews are all over the place with this one, seems like it reminds every single person of a different fragrance than the last. I don’t get anything ozonic or salty in this so not sure how people are getting some of these in the “reminds me of” section. I do however get a very generic perfumey department store smell, no one note really stands out. It’s sweet…and that’s about it. It almost gives me Nishane HSW vibes just minus some notes. This is one of those fragrances you’ve smelled before, a dozen times probably. I also don’t get banana which is why I bought it.",07/01/25 11:18,Catmo
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"It's very linear. I get sugary-banana candy floss and I honestly find it too sweet for the amount of time it lingers.

I'll wear it because I own a bottle, but there's many other scents I gravitate towards before this one.

Faeriecoma is correct, it's a vanilla Little Trees air freshener scent.",06/29/25 19:45,stargoose
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,This smells great layered with Sol de Janeiro 59 body mist! The orchid notes meld together and SDJ adds depth to it.,06/29/25 16:49,Scentalicious25
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,it’s lovely and nuanced but almost not enough. gorgeous orchid can easily be mistaken for a vanilla car air fresher. the tree shaped one. similar to queening by mind games not quite but the vibe of a quiet vanilla.,06/29/25 16:11,Faeriecoma
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"this smells like walking into a victoria's secret by the food court.

very sweet, almost cloyingly so, but also a bit creamy and oddly powdery (especially on first spray). it does smell pretty generic white floral initially, it reminded me of a sweeter jimmy choo, but after several minutes the vanilla seems to be the only note that really survives. i don't get the ozone at all.

i can definitely see the ""white chocolate"" comparison, but to me it ends up smelling like warm cinnamon bun glaze. really wasn't expecting a gourmand out of this one !",06/29/25 10:55,intmcy.02
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"It smelled delicious on the tester, but dried down to play-dough on my skin. I have this problem with a lot of vanilla perfumes - I was really sad it happened with this one since I was hoping to buy the full size.",06/25/25 09:28,jy.lisa1
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I have had this on my wishlist since last year and finally got it. I've been testing it for months through samples. It's worth it! Everybody thinks they smell bananas. Y'all this is the ozonic notes that give a (water)melon, 🍈 like a salty type of vanilla vibes. It's a salty, summery, beachy vanilla 🏖️ and I can for sure imagine that vanilla orchid note 🌺, but let's be honest: it's vanilla and sea breeze 🌬️. That's what we get! Perrrrrrrfect for the summer 🏝️ 🌞 ⛱️",06/24/25 04:45,Celenian
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I don’t know how to tell yall this but I sprayed this on my wrist for the first time today without reading reviews and I swear to everything when I wave it past my face I get Burberry Goddess. Replace the lavender in BG with a green note and you get this. Sorry but I do, and I am obsessed with BG and I know the opening isn’t similar or the notes but the dry down….I immediately loved it and was like wait, no wonder I love it. You can be mad at me but its what I smell. I would describe it as a sunny green vanilla fragrance personally, perfect for the spring and summer. I don’t really get the banana note mainly just a beautiful fresh vanilla but not soap fresh like green smell fresh if that makes sense. Lovely.",06/23/25 09:49,Des96

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I really liked this scent, but there is a few things that held me back from feeling bold about liking it or recommending it. Imo this powder ozonic combination effect it has makes me think of roll on cream deodorants for some reason. Given the insane price point it has, my mind thinking about some deodarant makes me a little reluctant to like it...but it was my top pick in a collection of samples I had.

It's a great fun but ""daily nothing too much"" because of that ozonic effect, but again..I can't help feeling people will just think this must be a deodorant??",06/20/25 21:23,nevashiva
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,is this not alien goddess?,06/19/25 08:13,ivorianangel
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This really reminds me of Killian Princess, I haven't seen many comparisons but I'd for sure sort it within that same DNA. It's nice, very pretty. The dry down is more of a powdery, sweet vanilla.

I don't really understand the Burberry goddess comparisons. I have both, but Goddess is definitely 'sharper' because of the lavender.

The longevity is pretty decent. I sprayed last night on my wrist before bed, and my wrist and shirt still smell of it this morning",06/15/25 09:46,pizzapiee
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Aquatic melon with contemporary vanilla base. I can see young girls wearing it to the beach, will perform best in humid and hot climate.",06/13/25 12:47,rasteria

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Great fresh and bright vanilla. The orchid accord gives it a sensual and intimate feeling. I smell a banana that isn't fully ripe yet, but don't worry if you don't like banana scents, I usually don't and this is my favorite vanilla perfume. It's so creamy and uplifting. Picking up on the subtleties of the accords, I don't think this is boring at all. It suits a cool winter or spring day. I don't think it smells cloying on a hotter day, but the lactonic scent of this really shines when it's a bit chilly out. I always overspray my perfumes and this one lasts all day long.",06/11/25 00:03,thiccfruitsnacc
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This is my gourmand perfume for summer from now on! At first sniff, I thought this was mango-y and exotic, reminds me of a Cantonese dessert mango pomelo sago (I am Cantonese so this reminds me of home). I was kind of right cuz this is actually best worn in summer since it’s got a heavy ozonic note but the other listed note being vanilla surprised me. It’s a bit like Rabanne’s Fame, I get mango from both of these fragrances but to me this is even sweeter and this has a thick creaminess to it. I use 3 sprays on my wrist after applying lotion, it lasts a good 4ish hours and dry down turns more floral and less sweet or creamy as time passes. I think this is a bit overpriced but so is everything so I won’t even complain anymore, still a good fragrance, would recommend if u like mango scents!",06/10/25 15:50,AbbieChan
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Tested this in Sephora. In the top notes, there's a fruitiness that's not listed, as others have mentioned, sort of a banana-mango. But the main body reminded me a lot of Flora Gorgeous Magnolia. The body is nicely filled out, with a powdery, creamy, floral vanilla that leans a bit to tonka. Could be worn year-round. I quite liked this. It's a love for me. Enjoy!

Contrast to Alien Goddess Mugler:
These are different, but there are similarities with a powdery, creamy vanilla. Flora Gorgeous Orchid has a more forward fruity note in the top, while Alien Goddess leans a bit more beachy with coconut & a recognizable jasmine running along side. Both have excellent performance, although a bit stronger for Alien Goddess.

Contrast to Flora Gorgeous Magnolia:
These are different, but there are similarities with the Gucci Flora DNA, a fruity top note, and powdery, creamy & floral tones in the main body. Flora Gorgeous Orchid is sweeter and more vanillic in the main body, while Flora Gorgeous Magnolia has a more obvious berry top note, more waxy magnolia in the heart, and just a hint of patchouli in the base. Roughly equivalent performance.",06/10/25 07:36,suzanne_ronald
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"The vanilla accords are almost identical to Mugler Alien Goddess. Strong, sweet, creamy and cloying. I find this and Alien Goddess quite suffocating. It's not a particularly interesting nor charming fragrance to my nose.

I consider Paradox and Guidance to fall under this same cloying umbrella.",06/04/25 11:58,ruin_raider
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Gucci did something special here.

This is the best floral, vanilla scent I've ever tried. It is intoxicating. To the point where I am repeatedly sniffing my sleeve, because it's just that good.

My boyfriend smelled every single fragrance in Sephora and landed on this one as a gift. I wasn't ecstatic about the other Flora flankers. To my surprise, this is now one of my favorites out of my whole collection.",06/02/25 22:29,Cymbra
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,exactly same with VS bare vanilla sol,06/01/25 16:03,hper
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Holy fuckinf shit this is the most beautiful creamy vanilla I have ever smelled on myself. I’m a vanilla fiend but literally every and I mean EVERY vanilla perfume I’ve ever tried turns into this disgusting cloying artificial rubbery playdough scent on me in the drydown (ie Middle Eastern brands’ eclaire, vanilla voyage, cream velvet etc) and it breaks my heart every time. This is the only one I have ever tried that stays smelling like clean clearly fluffy vanilla ice cream with whipped cream throughout. Totally worth the price and I’m mad at myself to not just committing to it sooner. Idk if maybe the iconic note in this stops that from happening or higher quality ingredients or what but it’s really the best vanilla I have ever smelled. If the same problem happens to u with vanilla fragrances I 1000% recommend pulling the trigger and buying this, as the name suggests it truly is gorgeous. I feel gorgeous wearing it",05/30/25 06:02,sammismells
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,I got a sample of this with my Sephora order. I like the scent and got compliments for it from people I work with. I won't be getting a full bottle tho. Because it is nice but not necessairly my vibe. Maybe I'll gift a bottle of this to a friend.,05/29/25 03:47,comfortcookie
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This is so beautiful! It has a zingy green mango skin note which is so unique. Like when you eat a mango scored off the cheek and you are finished down to the mango skin. And then the floral note is so fresh and green, so well balanced. The vanilla just grounds it doesn’t overpower. Oh my gosh, I can’t stop sniffing my wrist. I bought a decant of this because I am searching for a perfect banana scent. There is a very faint banana note to me but not very prominent. I don’t care I’m in love and will wear it this summer in Costa Rica so I can use it to associate it with one of my favorite vacation spots forever. The projection and longevity is great and worth buying a full bottle.",05/28/25 08:42,MalibuMermaid
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I forgot I ever owned Snoopy's Let's Mango. Until I sprayed Gucci's Flora Gorgeous Orchid.

We start this fragrance off with a very clear, ripe mango. Why it's not listed is beyond me. This is so present that it managed to trigger a memory of a long forgotten fragrance from over a decade ago.

Over time the mango fades into the background a little while a floral vanilla takes center stage. The sillage is good. The longivity is surprisingly poor. I struggle to pick up much of it 90 minutes in.

I wasn't expecting to compare Gucci to Snoopy. But the association is so strong, I can't stop thinking about it. If you're not burdened by this association, I can imagine this to be a pleasant fragrance.

Another reviewer mentioned putting it back on the shelf to explore again in 6 months. I will do that. But for now, it's a no for me.",05/26/25 01:25,greentearex
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I think this is the best vanilla fragrance I’ve ever smelled it’s not too gourmand and it’s not too floral it’s a good balance. Some people say it smells like mango I kind of understand why they might but it smells amazing I would bathe in this. If you want people to complement you and stop you and ask for that fragrance it is I suggest you buy this. If I could only use one perfume in my life it would be this , I kind of wish there was a dupe for it because it’s a bit pricey and I’m tired of fragrance houses not being inspired by other fragrances besides delina, tom ford and the infamous BR540.",05/23/25 13:37,Rinny_bty07
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I have had this one a while. Initially I didn't particularly like it as it was too Ozonic. Sometimes I find that with Ozonic notes, it leaves almost a blank space in the middle of the perfume and that's what I got with this (and with Gaultier Divine). It smelled floral on one end and sharp on the other with this blank space in the middle which wasn't particularly pleasant.

However, I've left the bottle sitting on a shelf for a good six months or so and tried it again today. Now I get much less of the Ozonic note and more of a banana note. It starts with underripe sharp banana and as it dries I get banana peel. I wouldn't say it's as vanilla strong as other perfumes which is surprising given the reported notes. It comes across quite tropical to me rather than floral. It's unusual and I can't really decide if I like it or not.",05/23/25 02:25,Inscentful
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"VERY similar to Dolce Gabbana Light Blue Sun. This is a bit stronger while LBS is softer, but you can get it for a third of the price on Joma. Both are great summer scents but my nose prefers Light Blue Sun.",05/22/25 08:18,Hawaii618!
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Beautiful beautiful fragrance.

to me it does not smell like gourmand or vanilla at all. the florals come through more which i'm assuming is the vanilla orchid. (bear with me, i'm not very familiar with notes so i can't give it the proper terminology) it is SOOO SO yummy beachy fun refreshing and BRIGHT!! all without being too heavy. it's very sweet and feminine, but still very refined!! she's light and feminine without being juvenile. this is definitely one of my favorites i've tried and absolutely a crowd pleaser.

i got so many compliments wearing this one. longevity is okay, it took a lot of sprays for it to last me a good 4-6 hours? not beast mode by any means but with how gorgeous and well-rounded this scent is i really have no qualms.

this also reminds me a lot of alien goddess by mugler, which has a bit of a ""sunscreeny-but-delicious"" feel. the two have totally different nuance though, and i prefer gucci flora gorgeous orchid by leagues to my mugler (however the mugler definitely outperforms gucci orchid!)

TLDR: yummy bright summery refreshing feminine perfume while still being refined and not cloying. highly recommend!",05/19/25 16:41,smellyummyyum
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This is a delicious fragrance, it is light, gourmand, delicately flowery and airy at the same time. It is just so perfect, with a warm but delicate/acquatic vanilla. I, fortunately, can't smell any banana ( I don't like artificial banana smell), just a ""milky"" kind of base. It is a soft and sweet gourmand, with light flowers, which is ideal for spring, early summer. This is stunning, and I am obsessed with it. Longevity is ok, it creates a nice scent bubble for a couple of hours 💛",05/18/25 09:32,Federica76
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I was both wary and curious to try the last one from the Flora range. The bottles still don’t do it for me, they look plasticky and cheap, which doesn’t exactly help set the mood. But Gorgeous Orchid turned out to be a pleasant surprise (but again, what kind of drug store name is that?). It’s delicate, airy, and creamy, fresh enough to feel light, but with a sweetness that keeps it from sliding into the vegetal territory.

Out of the range, Jasmine is my favorite. I never quite clicked with Gardenia and Magnolia, but Orchid joins Jasmine as the second winner for me. Two out of four isn’t bad, and I’m glad this little Gucci escapade wasn’t a waste of time as I thought it would be based on the bottle design.",05/18/25 08:27,MetaMystic

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I received this perfume as a sample. I am not a lover of gourmand, so even if it was ""flowery"", I could smell vanilla almost all the time.

I could not test the longevity much because it was a sample and it is not to my taste.",05/12/25 03:31,Giù_giù

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,This is incredibly unique. All anyone can say to describe to those who haven’t smelled it is that it’s a fresh floral vanilla but you just have to smell it.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Oh wow, what a beautiful surprise this scent is! I just now made the purchase after ordering a sample and loving it. It's a creamy vanilla lovers dream for sure with a touch of soft floral. I agree with an almost banana scent or something similar too. I own many perfumes and this one just seems unique, different in a wonderful comforting way. With 3 notes listed I was not expecting to fall so in love but it happened",05/09/25 14:43,ShannaLa
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid is a beautifully unexpected take on a floral gourmand. While the official notes highlight vanilla, vanilla orchid, and an ozonic accord, what truly stands out—at least to my nose—is a soft, creamy banana note that weaves through the florals. It’s subtle, natural, and completely non-synthetic, adding a tropical twist that feels playful yet elegant.

This is the banana-tinged perfume I’ve been searching for—not overly sweet, not artificial, just a gentle, creamy nuance that blends seamlessly with the luminous florals and airy vanilla. The ozonic freshness keeps the scent light and breathable, preventing the gourmand elements from feeling too heavy.

The result is a soft, radiant floral with a tropical soul, creamy without being cloying, and surprisingly beautiful. If you’re looking for something that combines familiar sweetness with an unexpected twis, this fragrance is absolutely worth exploring.",05/08/25 09:06,raque.sugarplum
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Flora Gorgeous Orchid is a delicate, airy beauty that captures the essence of soft elegance. The vanilla in the air is sweet and light, but not overpowering, giving it a dreamy, almost ethereal quality. It feels like the fragrance is floating around me rather than settling on my skin. The scent is subtle, and while it may not last long, it leaves behind a delicate trace that feels almost like a soft whisper in the atmosphere. It’s the kind of scent that doesn’t demand attention but gently enchants anyone in its vicinity. A beautiful, fleeting floral experience, but not one for those seeking longevity.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Definition of creamy. I don't know how to explain but it really smells creamy. It's very sweet but not cloying at all.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I tried this perfume once it was launched and it did not touch my heart. Later (because I love the bottle, it's so pretty) I gave it second try- sprayed it in Sephora and wear during the evening. Honestly, I hope that longevity is not great, cause it bothers me for 2 hours already😂 No, first impression was correct. Next :)
No banana (it was not even a note :) ), no good vanilla, no ice cream. It's just something unclear, boring and irritating.
No ofence, it's just my 5 cents. If you enjoy this perfume- please enjoy!",05/02/25 21:54,Istra

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,I sprayed this on myself in a perfume shop earlier today and as soon as it started to dry down i started getting perfume deja vu. It hit me about an hour after smelling my wrist constantly - this smells just like Diesel Loverdose to me. Maybe the combo of floral and floral notes - it’s hard to put my finger on. Definitely don’t get the people saying it smells like Burberry goddess but maybe that’s just my skin chemistry!,04/29/25 09:57,woothie
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"The pyramid is obviously incomplete (as usual...), and honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if ylang-ylang were in there.

To me, Flora Gorgeous Orchid is a sunny fragrance, smelling mainly of vanilla and ylang-ylang - which might explain the banana note some people perceive.

It's very pretty, bright, and fresh, perfect for summer. It leans a bit conventional because of the vanilla, but it’s still a pleasant scent to wear.",04/28/25 02:10,Saveria
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This is a total BEACH scent. Absolute summer fragrance. I believe it has a unisex surfer energy. The most unique of the Gucci Flora fragrances, I don't get flowery vibes at all. Sand and ocean. The vanilla gives it that creamy banana/coconut vibe that some users have picked up on. This scent only works with a very HOT summer day. Its downside is that it is also a very POWERFUL fragrance with a strong silage, which usually is not the type of fragrances people like to wear when it's hot out. Those who are sensitive to strong fragrance, beware, this can definitely be headache inducing for you. I recommend this scent for a fancy summertime outdoor lunch or dinner near the beach. It smells like a high end sunscreen, which is enjoyable but only appropriate for a slim number of events. It does dry down to a sweeter, vanilla scent close to the skin - but most of the wear has the BOOM in your face sandy beach feel.",04/24/25 10:46,caulicakes
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Banana, coconutty marshmallow floral on vanilla base. It's my favourite Gucci flora and I like it for being a bit less mature smelling. It's a guilty pleasure perfume. I personally enjoy it.",04/24/25 06:35,Lebkuchen
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"wait why the hate? this is the gucci flora scent i like the most, but i might be biased because i love any scent with vanilla in it. but i like this! it lowkey reminds me of a banana milkshake!",04/21/25 15:46,myadbest
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I went to Sephora to try it because people on YT said that it smelled a lot like Burberry Goddess. Well, to my nose it's totally not the case. Nothing like the Burberry, at all! To me it smells like a basic designer vanilla flower perfume. Really plain, nothing special.",04/20/25 12:32,ellajounane
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,Honeydew melon?? I know it’s a far cry from the notes but there’s something fruity. It is vanillic but like it’s added into a fruity smoothie/milkshake,04/20/25 05:42,Venumb
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I sampled this and it smells like a soft creamy marshmallow, pretty basic. Also, the sillage is kind of disappointing",04/20/25 05:00,jqltn
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Why is it kind of giving toasted marshmallow?? I was not expecting that! I like it and the bottle is pretty but it's pretty boring, won't be purchasing",04/19/25 17:08,sunnybun
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Simple, inoffensive, but BORING to my nose unfortunately. I was hoping for more sweetness or more vanilla, but I don't detect that note at all. Just the generic designer fragrance floral and the freshness of outside air, with a very slight suncreen vibe to it.",04/19/25 08:14,Make_It_Make_Scents
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,OK so this reminds me of So Miami Vibes body spray. It’s quite a headache inducing vanilla. I love the other fragrances from this line but this is not for me.,04/18/25 07:44,SublimeUtopia
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,This sells like a banana. Full on banana smoothie,04/18/25 02:33,theperfumemaniac
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"very pretty & creamy. i know theres no fruitiness in the notes, but somehow this smelled like mango sticky rice on my skin. sweeter than i usually go for, but it was just so nice i had to get the travel size. i’m addicted! i keep smelling myself and it’s delicious every time.",04/14/25 12:41,xiahsshi
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Such a nice fragrance! It's very simple, but so delightful and happy. There's something slightly fruity about it despite there being nothing like that in the notes. I would've sworn there was a mango note. It doesn't smell like pure mango fruit (no sourness) but mango in an almost creamy way like a mango smoothie.",04/11/25 21:21,fraglog
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This reminds me of Burberry Goddess. Nothing ground breaking. It smells nice when freshly applied though. But it doesn't last. After a few minutes, it ends up being a rather bland, boring scent. It also quickly becomes overwhelming to my nose, it's headache inducing if oversprayed.",04/07/25 12:28,naeris
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"The opening was gorgeous - floral, creamy, sweet but that drydown is disgusting. It smells like chemical nail polish & vanilla.",04/05/25 10:44,stephm42120
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Tested today in the local perfume shop. Reminds me if Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise.
A very nice girly fragrance but not 'outstanding' or 'groundbreaking' it is pleasant but that's it.",04/01/25 12:27,Christie-Jack
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Smells like a cold, creamy vanilla milkshake on a hot day with a hint of freshness and orchid! I also get a slight banana note, it's stronger when smelling from the bottle.
I havent tested longevity but even with just a spray and a half the sillage is like 2 metres!!
This was just a random sample I got and so far I didnt expect to like it as much as I do, super delicious.",04/01/25 07:24,liuliu
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"legit one of my favourite fragrances. i smelled this in the airport and i could not stop thinking about it I had to buy the full size, but here's the thing, the longevity and sillage is BAD. Not good at all. Spray it on your clothes and it lasts for a really long time but on my skin it just dissapears :(",03/30/25 14:00,Flowerfume
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,its very sweet u can smell the vanilla and also the ozonic notes are very noticeable its good but if u wanna wear it in summer u should probably pair it with something fresher,03/29/25 01:03,Musiiiii
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Glittery lip balm from a coin operated dispenser. Kinda dirty. Smells identical to something from my childhood, like makeup you'd get in the party favors for a little girls birthday",03/28/25 21:21,kelpy1000
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Pretty straightforward. Nothing complex here. A light and lovely springtime spin on the classic vanilla. Comes through heavy on the vanilla for me, but this is not a complaint! Dry down into that ozone scent is very pleasant and makes this a nice one for spring/warmer weather.
Sillage is pitiful and longevity isn't as impressive as the other Flora flankers.",03/27/25 14:56,geminimeanie
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I love it! A fresh twist on vanilla. Not for those who prefer heavy spicy vanilla fragrances - this is airy and light and smells like a sunny day out. Weak sillage, but stays on my skin for the whole day.",03/27/25 01:24,bell4d0nna
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This smells like bubblegum and a fresh, juicy pear. Delectable!

I spritzed it on a tester card. Two days later it was still discernable. Highly recommend spraying on clothes.",03/26/25 20:25,Midnight Raine
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I distinctly smell lemon in the opening of this fragrance. I'm surprised it's not listed or talked about, and I THOUGHT when we were trained on this fragrance for my work, that we were told it contained a lemon note. Very confusing. Anyway, I'm not a vanilla girl, nor a gourmand girl. I don't like basic and this is very much that... And yet, there's something really enjoyable about this that I can't pin down. I had to have it.",03/26/25 05:22,The_Hellcat
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid offers a fresh interpretation of vanilla, making it perfect for summer. The vanilla here is soft and luminous, paired with the floral richness of orchid. It strikes a beautiful balance, sweet yet airy, with a breezy elegance that feels effortless in warm weather. Perfect for us vanilla girlies who don’t want to miss out on our beloved vanillas, even in the high heat, this scent is light and radiant, ideal for sunny days and balmy evenings.
💛💛💛",03/24/25 08:53,Dinaina
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"An airy and uplifting vanilla! Crowd pleasing in a good way. Vanilla has been a hot trend for a while now, but this is distinctive enough to give a try. The ozone notes give it a nice touch that it could work spring, summer, and fall. Maybe not dense enough for winter. Overall, Flora Gorgeous Vanilla is an inoffensive, high-quality, easy reach.",03/22/25 08:38,As Above
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"A lot of people are saying this is basic. I however, love it!! It’s warm and creamy, not too strong but just enough projection to form a bubble around you. I really enjoy this one and I think it’s fresh (green) enough but also sweet and buttery. I picked up a small bottle because I do have other vanilla fragrances but I think it’s worth a 1oz. Lovely, and that banana opening is everything.",03/18/25 09:22,TheLB
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I wanted to love this, but it's sooooo green. It's a basic green floral. Very little vanilla from start to finish, and one friend told me it smelled 'sharp' even 3 hours after putting it on. Glad I've only gotten the travel size as this was just very underwhelming.",03/17/25 10:09,Lipglossjunkee
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I sprayed both the orchid and gardenia versions on two cards about 36 hours ago. The gardenia has definitely faded, but the orchid one is still going surprisingly strong.

Initially, I wasn’t sure about the orchid scent—my friend and I fell in love with the gardenia in-store, while this one felt a bit confusing for some reason. But after letting the sprayed card sit on my bed, I’ve grown to adore it. I can’t believe I didn’t immediately love it or immediately notice how similar it is to Burberry Goddess and Angham by Lattafa. It’s a warm, floral vanilla, and I can imagine it layering beautifully with Burberry Goddess or even the intense version. Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid is that gurlll she is gorgeous she’s kind she smells like a girls girl

That said, I’m hesitant to buy it right now since my last eight perfume purchases have all been vanillary 🥴😭. I was initially drawn to the gardenia, but after reading reviews about its poor performance—and seeing firsthand how much weaker it is compared to the orchid—I’m put off for now.

Anywayyy, the orchid version clearly has much better longevity, and I’ll definitely be purchasing it in the future!! For now, though, I’m still on the hunt for a strong-performing summery scent—ideally something floral or citrusy/ fresh, sweet (ANY BEASTMODE VERSION OF GARDENIA ??😩)",03/16/25 22:39,azifah97

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"it smells like sunshine & cheers me up :) people are saying this one is too simple but i think it's simplicity is its charm, it's sweet and so so easy to love. i got my sisters bottle and i really enjoy it! i only wish the sillage were stronger & its initial banana note was as strong in the drydown.",03/12/25 11:46,peachsiie
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"An effortlessly pretty scent. It's a light floral with a vanilla/banana twist. I know there's not a banana note listed, but I do not care. Inoffensive, yet still can fill a room.. The projection is there and it lasts atleast 5 hours or so. Spray it on clothes if you need it to stay longer than that. I layered it with banana flower passionfruit lotion. From experience, men will wanna eat you up wearing this. Do with that information as you will!!💋",03/12/25 11:41,hola gigi
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I stupidly bought this based on the opening scent which is AMAZING. So fresh, sweet, floral and slightly citrus. Unfortunately it dries down to a smell I can only describe as 'old lady'. The longevity is terrible and Gucci has something to answer for given the price point of £135+",03/11/25 10:54,Rachgod
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"The most inoffensive, plain, generic floral perfume you could ever imagine. A scent you'd conjure in your head when you think of a flower perfume. Weak silage. With Gucci's prices it's kind of a miss... Maybe on a clearance or with a very big discount?",03/11/25 07:40,BrickShithouse
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"This actually lasts well on me. The dry down is a strong, pure vanilla. Sadly, I don’t get the banana others do, but I still love it anyway. The bottle is very cute, I love the happy yellow with the floral label. Great addition to round out my fragrance collection.",03/06/25 04:02,Malmal8604
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Am I the only one smelling salty in this? Yikes, it ruins it :/ I want to love it, I'm in the mood for a Gucci Flora Vanilla, but this just complicates it way too much. Can't we have just a basic vanilla? lol",03/04/25 15:54,MichelleAntonia

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"The only Gucci Flora I like and one of the few perfumes I liked out of the 15 I sniffed today at Ulta. This is better than Alien Goddess (to my nose, they are only slightly similar). I wish I smelled this before I bought AG. It’s slight banana, slight orchid with vanilla amber. Really nice. I’m sure someday I will buy it.",02/25/25 14:32,brandiwine1980
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"i got a decant tester of this and after the first wear i knew i needed a bottle of this. i couldnt stop smelling myself throughout the day, it's soooo addicting to me. all i smelled was pure delicious vanilla. it wasn't until i read the comments here that i could smell the banana. there's definitely banana laffy taffy in there somehow but despite hating actual bananas i love banana laffy taffy so it doesn't bother me at all lmao. overall it's a very yummy scent!",02/24/25 13:12,posydoodle
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Yes, it is vanilla, but it is also very banana which is strange yet intriguing. It's not a banana foster, but it is a dessert that is sweet without being overwhelming.",02/22/25 17:08,nickinicole
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I was very excited to try this as a vanilla, floral, and ozone lover. On my skin, this is screechy playdough banana. The banana is noxious. I had to scrub it off 😣 So glad I didn’t blind buy this, which I was tempted to do.",02/16/25 13:52,Chezshey
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Smells just like Luxuria by Memoize London, which is a niche version of CH good girl.",02/16/25 12:25,Bibi16
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"As soon as I sprayed it (department store fragrance counter, on skin, eventually worn for 6 hours), I was immediately reminded of Kenzo World Power (which is reminiscent of JPG Divine), with slight differences (Orchid being perhaps slightly more floral and vanillic). I think it’s the ozonic saltiness that links them?

Confirmed with side-by-side test; obviously not a clone, but would be redundant in my collection, as I already own and appreciate World Power.

Initially thought the comparison with Wild Vanilla Orchid was way off, but there is indeed half a ghost (maybe a quarter?) of that perfume (which I also own) in Gorgeous Orchid.",02/15/25 17:17,SheNoseKnows
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"very pretty, and very likeable. it's a sweet, airy, vanilla floral. i'd recommend this to any girl wanting a nice fragrance because that's what it is - nice and inoffensive, and it isn't just the generic designer white floral that has been done to death.

there's too many fragrances i personally like more to buy a bottle, but i wouldn't turn my nose up at it; i don't think you can really go wrong with it.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Love at first sniff. Bought it immediatly.
I don't get the banana note, but a king of candied mango note. The ozonic note is very light to me.
Love this yellow bottle.
A great perfume for spring and summer nights.
To me, this perfume is in the same vibe than Alien Goddess from Mugler, Yara Tous from Lattafa and Valentino Born in Roma Intense.
This same fruit/amber/vanilla trend.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"this is my favorite in the gucci flora line, it`s a light vanilla, it is well balanced between warmth and freshness. so you smell effortlessly innocent and sweet.
i think as in debut 2025, my current taste gravitates toward uncomplicated scents with clear imagery.",02/12/25 14:29,eyabt
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"It really reminds me of Floral Street Wild Vanilla Orchid with the bamboo and interesting green nuances stripped out. I enjoy it, but I prefer Wild Vanilla Orchid (which is apparently close to Poets of Berlin). If you didn't like the green aspect of those scents maybe this would work for you. The ozonic note makes it a cut above some of the more cloying, juvenile vanillas out there, and more suitable for warmer weather.",02/11/25 11:29,SouthLondonFox

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I love the ozonic note in this, especially mixed with the vanilla. I definitely get a banana candy from this, but I also pick up a lemon cake or lemon muffin scent from it as well. I tend to stay away from vanilla fragrances in the spring and summer as they can be a bit too heavy, but this one has just the right amount of vanilla, and it is not at all cloying. This is a favorite in my collection 💛",02/06/25 16:42,cinnamorollstef
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"Recibí una muestra de este aroma Un aroma floral y dulce y ligero para de verano. Se puede oler especialmente la vainilla y la orquídea en este perfume. Permanece presente de una manera agradable, pero no demasiado abrumadora. ¡Especialmente un maravilloso aroma de verano! Podria funcionar como aroma en trabajo, ya que no es tan intrusivo como otras vainillas en el mercado y es bastante lineal.

Olor dulce
Acordes de vainilla
Perdura sutilmente, no demasiado abrumador.",02/01/25 01:13,Conniec
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I liked the vanilla aspect but somehow ozonic notes don't go well with me. I am the type of fragrancehead who doesn't define my choices of perfume by weather however-- ozonic / solar fragrances dont jive with me even though I'm from the tropics! I gravitate towards balsamic/resinous/ smoky/suede/leather types of scents

I have learned in 2025 blind buying is not an option for me because everyone loved this when it came out and it is nice when I spray it in the air. But on me it is an ok scent . Its not great and its not horrible. Its just not for me...if you happen to love the scent you will find that it lasts so long so thats a plus. . Another thing is that it is very linear on my skin. I'm trying to sell it locally but nobody wants it.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"way too sweet for me. though i will say, the ozonic notes made it a lot more tolerable compared to other really sweet scents. i got some underlying vanilla, but the banana is definitely the strongest note here.",01/28/25 15:26,teasleeves
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I really, really love this.
A sunny, bright and creamy vanilla. There is a crisp quality to this I can’t quite place. I sense a little musk? Regardless, it’s beautiful. I do not get any banana, instead, I get vanilla with some kind of yellow floral and a green note in the background I cannot identify.

It’s my favorite from the Gucci Flora collection- though I think it’s better suited for spring/autumn, not summer. It can be a little too sweet, at least for hot and humid weather.

I’ve never owned a full bottle from the Gucci Flora series, but this one might be my first. Absolutely lovely.

Extremely long lasting (8+ hours on my skin)
Silage is moderate to heavy- do be mindful when you spray.

Edit: I understand why people might smell banana. There is a fruity, creamy quality to it- but I think it’s mostly a very sweet, musky vanillic floral.",01/22/25 20:56,sashazor

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"So interesting what people smell.

I don’t get bananas. And not gourmand. I get a warm floral, not spicy. It smells like a bouquet of flowers with lots of white and yellow florals that opens with a fresh green background and settles into a floral with creaminess. I don’t get overwhelming vanilla even in the dry down.

It’s very pretty. Is it my fav? No. But I reach for it occasionally when I want something floral and different.",01/14/25 09:24,Ahump55
Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"If this perfume were any lighter, it would probably float out of the bottle and hover around your head like a fragrant halo. It’s so ethereal!

Some people say they smell banana. I don’t, but I can kind of see where they’re coming from. It’s not “banana” in the “here’s your morning smoothie” sense. It’s more like, “What if a banana briefly dated a coconut, broke up amicably, and now they exchange polite emails once a year?” There’s a tropical vibe, but it’s subtle, like a whisper of piña colada memories from a distant beach.

The orchid is the star here; soft, creamy, and sophisticated. And then there’s an ozonic, breezy undertone that makes you feel like you’re standing on a cliffside with the wind in your hair, except the wind smells amazing.",01/13/25 09:46,Safira

Flora Gorgeous Orchid Gucci,"I read a review that said that this perfume smells like yummy cream and bananas. As a gourmand lover, I had to buy it…well, it turns out that our smelling abilities are very different. To me it smells like my grandma’s aloe vera body lotion. My husband said that it smells like a face cream, however he likes it on me, meanwhile I do not. It is a light, body lotion-like, slight flowery-orchidy scent to me. Disappointment. I am never buying a perfume based on influencer reviews😅…",01/07/25 21:29,Nixi199623

It is evocative of drinking a vanilla milkshake with some banana blended in while sitting on the fresh green grass of a sunny meadow. There is an orchid bush nearby and it is wafting a subtle aroma your way. Everything is ok and life is good :) I think yellow was an excellent choice for the packaging because it is such an optimistic scent. I fell in love with it upon first whiff. The other Gucci Flora flankers were not my style, but this one is different. The vanilla in this reminds me so much of a vanilla I’ve smelled in different Dior fragrances.

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"It's okay, very harsh florals, a bit of a tea smell at the end that I couldn't quite discern",11/09/25 15:17,creepygirl444
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Originally posted 23Jun2025 but accidentally deleted when updating my ranking of the Flora Gorgeous line:

Thank you @Camilovely for detailing, because Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense can be summarized as smelling like classic B&BW Dark Kiss especially in the opening. I'm surprised there are no dark fruits like a berry or other dark notes like amber and patchouli listed. I do see why the magnolia flanker was originally voted as similar since it has those dark notes made in a fun shampoo way.

As the intense dries, the hedione musk and sandalwood shine more creating a lightness in here that will work for some parts of spring and fall weather. Lush gardenia was not something I really picked up in the original, but I do pick it up a little more in the Intense and it has a nice sweetness. For the brown sugar, it's not quite the same as the original; imagine berries being cooked and sweetened by brown sugar. As I wear it more, I also get a juicy orange in the opening. Very interesting to see what other people get.

Like the original, projection on my skin seems to dissipate into a closer bubble or maybe that's the airy hedione quality, but longevity is better at 6-7 hrs. But that could just be me, since others think differently about performance. For the bottle, I love that you can still see the liquid inside, but the glass color is still dark. This is also the first Gucci fragrance I've felt inclined to add to my collection, that clicks for me. From the line so far, Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense is the best, then Gorgeous Magnolia, original Gardenia, the Orchid which was a bit underwhelming to me (I now love this as for me it is a smoother, less fruity dark, light airy version of this intense), and lastly Jasmine which I just didn't like the smell of.",11/08/25 03:05,jassca99
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"It does what it says on the tin! Flora Gorgeous Gardenia indeed, such a delicious Gucci scent! This is NOT a fruitchouli fragrance at all. The original GGG might be, but not the Intense. It’s an intriguing fragrance.",11/04/25 07:12,Gabizz
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I tend to gravitate towards hedione notes because it smells addictive to me.

This flanker would be my best out of the line up. It’s Jammy, sensual, and garners compliments (guess it’s just how I layer my fragrances or how it comes off on my skin.)

There is definitely no patchouli although the sandalwood is what some might perceive as the whole Fruitchouli vibe when I can definitely say this is not that.

Fruitchouli would be alongside the lines of YSL Mon Paris, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle, Lancôme La vie bell, even the new MiuMiu with the strawberry and patchouli note is a heavy fruitchouli (the name escapes me)

So yeah, this is not a fruitchouli to me although I do see how some might perceive it as such.

It’s more of a fruit jam with a little bit of spice and warmth- the sandalwood is a gorgeous woody cozy scent with juuuuuuust a teeny hint of a smokiness to it. It’s also pretty sweet - basically it’s a rather complex scent

At first I didn’t really give this a chance. I too thought it smelled like a basic designer scent (which I could see how most might get that impression)

Through the wear it develops in stages so yeah that’s it- fruity, jammy, creamy, woody, spicy, hint of smokiness like incense wise but not like a church incense.

I gave it a chance and love it now !",10/31/25 01:10,MareaCamacho
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Very basic fruitchouli vibe from these notes. I have smelled so many of those since their 2000s explosion, it's exhausting. Same same. I don't dislike this, but hard pressed to find something to actually like. I can say that I do prefer the dry down to the initial blast. It is smoother and more coherent. The opening is scratchy to me.

Ultimately, it makes me slightly irritated that I even decided to test it on skin because it took a day out of wearing something I actually like, but that's on me. I just did not expect to be transported to a mall in 2005 based on these notes.

It is strong and it is long lasting. Definitely has that going for it.",10/30/25 10:27,minag
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"The opening is more woody than the edp, but the drydown is the same as the edp. I didn't like this one because I didn't like the original.

I'll be waiting for the intense version of jasmine and vanilla.",10/29/25 13:04,loveofparfum
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I bloody love this, the dry-down is so nice and woody leaning unisex, and lovely white floral tones softening the edges. It smells clean and fresh instead of too sweet or high floral. This is my favourite of the line by a wide margin.",10/28/25 14:08,jeszz
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"i have all five flora flankers and love them all. I can recognise the gorgeous gardenia dna in this one, but this one is more complex and deep, it is a bit more fit for the colder months in my opinion. For some reason this is my husbands least favorite out of all the floras. I love it tho.",10/28/25 03:21,vsemietaq1
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I tried this at kicks. On paper it smelled really nice. So I put it on my wrist.. it smelled nice at first like the paper. Then it smelled like a mans cologne.., really manly.. I took a shower and it still smells. I have tried soap, oil, shower, other perfumes and I cant get the scent of my skin,, so the lasting is really long. I am on day 2 and still smell the perfume., I now hate the smell.. dont buy unless you really like the scent.",10/28/25 02:54,Sus4an
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This is way more sweet than i was expecting. There is something here that reminds me of Angel. I wanted a strong and pure white floral, but that was not it. The florals are soft. I will have to pass.",10/26/25 04:08,raiza1990
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"sweet and soft to begin with. yes, it has „intense“ in its name but it’s not too overpowering. perfect for a warm spring or fall night. it smells like a fruity cocktail. i find myself smelling it from time to time cause it’s just so lovely. people will definitely give you compliments and the scent lingers for hours! if you love sweet, dreamy scents, this will be for you.",10/23/25 23:49,minilover92
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"LOL, apparently the sillage is enormous!! My husband came downstairs and said he could smell it to the second floor!!
He likes it!! He prefers it to La vie est belle Vanille Nude that I had yesterday (that he also liked!)
But he thinks this smells more charismatic and mysterious ;D.
My own opinions are below;

It starts sweet but then turns spicy. After drydown it smells equally spicy, floral and sandalwood. Compared to some other perfumes out that smells too young for someone in my age (42), this seems age appropriate for any woman, not a girl. For my taste it is too spicy though.",10/23/25 08:26,The most freebies
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Why??? It is seriously underwhelming. Too much of everything and also boring that every perfume now is full of artificial ambroxan and after dry down it is just a chemical mess. After an hour it is like an Arabic male dupe cologne. All the same Armani Si Intense, Coco Mademoiselle Intense. Chemical warfare 💥",10/21/25 04:49,MomGodess

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This was so intense for me. At first it was just a strong and overstimulating scent , then it turned into a men's cologne on my skin. it was not feminine at all and i had to walk around Dresden smelling like a man who just bathed in cheap perfume.",10/11/25 11:26,tojisbicep
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Gorgeous gardenia intense opens with a sweet, slightly fruity/jammy opening. It contains mandarin, but this comes across more fruity than citrus/sharp (I was left wondering if it had lychee or red berries, but apparently not). This is very soon succeeded by a very heady gardenia scent that is very pretty. This is not a perfume to overspray - it is quite heady, and those easily overwhelmed might not like it. But the gardenia scent is lovely. The base notes of this are quite woody (from the sandalwood) so the dry down is quite stemmy/woody and a little citrusy.

I think this is a lovely scent for autumn into winter, but would avoid on hot days.",10/08/25 05:44,Christina.jane.cox
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I do not dislike this at all however this reminds me of grandma soap. I love white florals but I would not wear this, don't ask me why. And I know this one is being compared to VLJ but there's some kind of fruity note or maybe the actual gardenia, that smells a bit off to me.",09/27/25 06:36,soapycarla
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Sweet florals turned bold, juicy mandarin, creamy gardenia & warm sandalwood. Feminine, luxe & impossible to ignore

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,Jammy and sweet,09/22/25 15:41,oblyth
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,Just sampled it and I think it's really lovely. I'm not a fan of the Flora perfumes but this one is pretty different to me. It's flowery but in a grown up way. It's sweet but not too sweet. The woodiness works very well in this but the dry down on me is mainly gardenia and a hint of rose.,09/22/25 10:23,basiawaluszko
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Mmmmmmm it's okay!!! Normaly intense perfume versions are nice.
Its a one dimensional perfume with only one single note in it.
Is that really what sandalwood smells like? Cause to me it feels like patchouli.",09/21/25 01:52,dovey
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,They should have called this gorgeous sandalwood because that’s all I’m getting: sandalwood with a whisper of mandarin and an even smaller whisper of gardenia.,09/19/25 13:57,ashmcint
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I have a sample, and I kinda want the full bottle now. It is the intense so I’m not surprised, but it is STRONG like only one spray and I can’t breathe. Smells like the color red in a bottle to me, but sexy.",09/11/25 20:39,Dashister
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I just bought this perfume and I'm in love. It smells so strong, my brother immediately asked me what perfume I had. It's expensive, but I think it's worth it and I think it will last me a long time because I only need to spray it once or twice. It's perfect for the autumn days ahead. Of all the Gucci perfumes, this one is definitely the best for me.",09/03/25 23:43,Kiks59
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,I love the way this smells but would get nauseous trying to wear it due to how syrupy and patchouli heavy it is. It’s a dark sweet berry and patchouli scent. Enjoy smelling it on a tester but not on myself.,09/03/25 22:10,blake.lee
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Still sweet and candy fruit like but not as the original GG obviously
Soo bubblegummy not tuberose bubblegum at all more like jasmine bubblegum",08/31/25 13:01,Onlyclean
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I'm not very aware of the scent profile on the original Gorgeous Gardenia by Gucci, but I can def say I really like the profile on this one.

Very heavy with patchouli, but also incredibly sweet and rootsy from the mandarin and sandalwood pairing. Of course, this is INTENSE and has an incredibly strong silage and wear time.",08/28/25 15:40,miakat888
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I’m not familiar with the original Gorgeous Gardenia, so I can’t say how the Intense compares, but this is a piss-poor perfume I must say. Zero personality or originality, just a boring musky floral which you’ll have smelled a hundred times before.

Initially it smelled like wet makeup wipes to me, with a typical perfumey smell, but this started to become more dry and more powdery as this vague barrage of scratchy white musks and amber molecules abused any delicate presence of white flowers. It’s just bad.

It’s overloaded with hedione, so no doubt the general public will enjoy it, but it’s just so painfully boring and generic. It doesn’t exactly smell bad, but it’s existence annoys me.",08/27/25 13:37,RGH01
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Update: The patchouli in the drydown totally ruins this. After a few hours it’s all you can smell, smells like a spicy sweaty sceant and I can’t stand it.",08/27/25 01:54,riri92000
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This one is an exact copy of the original Gorgeous Gardenia. I wore that one for 7 years and it was my signature scent that I have missed dearly. When Gucci repackaged their scent from the clear bottle to the new one the scent changed. I am so happy they launched this. It does not smell like the notes at all, it is very sweet just like the original. I like the colour of this bottle as well. Only downside is the crazy price, can’t believe that normal designer perfumes now cost the same as niche! I would get this so fast if it weren’t for the price! Will wait to see if I can find a discount as it is very overpriced in my opinion.",08/25/25 02:25,riri92000
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I like it a lot, but then, like many have noted, it reminds you of several fragrances. The one I get is Nest's Black Tulip. It's not as intense as Black Tulip. But, it's a safe fragrance and gets the job done.",08/24/25 15:23,Jmala22
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,Same as the original but a lot woodier. Sugary white florals with fake woody aroma chemicals. Nasty. Opens with an extremely tart bergamot. This line just doesn't live up to Gucci's other much better lines.,08/24/25 08:43,LSAUG
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I really like this a lot (it’s very designeresque - you’ve smelled it everywhere before and since I love perfumes in general I felt like it really smelled nice but that’s it just that nothing really grabs at you - it tries to but you’ve met it before 1000x

The hedione interests me plus sandalwood- I love a good sandalwood.

I would so buy this but I already got vanilla nude lveb and the new Q Parfum by D&G yesterday which I absolutely love them both

I miiiiiiiight buy this one but only thing stopping me is that I get this waxy smell I would pick up in Gucci magnolia flanker - purple bottle. I decluttered that one because it was turned up on the waxiness/thickness

This one does have that but it’s wiped away or smeared into the fragrance . The bubblegumminess takes a drop as the drydown comes as well.

. I’ll finish my sample but it does remind me so much of the “not so pleasant” phases of Magnolia


edit to add: this smells like it has blackcurrant in it. It has that fruitiness you can find in many other designer releases. Very loud . Similar to euphoria the red bottle and Ralph Lauren romance intense. Would be considered fruity woody scent profile",08/20/25 23:26,MareaCamacho
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"It's very sweet sugary with white flower and woods in the background, it's like the original but way more sweeter and stronger which I really like, it's a 10/10 for me, but I don't know I'm gonna get it or not cause lately the price of perfumes are going insane.
longevity is more improved but still bad. For the price point and as a brand, I need more than 5-6hrs not like a few mins.
/crying lonely",08/18/25 22:57,aartelier
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This is one of the better in this line, definitely more sophisticated than the original. It has an addictive sweet white floral trail with a hint of citrus. It is pretty linear throughout. I don't get a lot of woods but I'm sure it's there to ground and give some depth. I love gardenia and although I enjoy this there are of course better representations out there. Sure, it is designer style and not the most original but it's not bad. It is a fairly versatile grown up fragrance suitable for many occasions....an easy reach if you will. I'm still debating a full bottle. I don't need it but I find myself reaching for the travel size enough that it's almost halfway gone now.",08/18/25 15:43,desertdweller
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I am obsessed with this!! One of my few “must haves” upon first smell. It is designery and reminds me of some other fruitichouli frags (Dark Kiss, Secret Wonderland, Angel, Euphoria (Intense), Fenty) However this one does everything I want and not too much. On my skin the gardenia isn’t actually the star of the show. I get more musky woody notes. It’s sparkly, floral, and rich, but not heavy. It is sultry but in a bubbly way- think someone like Sofia Vergara. I love it for an easy reach. It brings me to a nostalgic place of becoming a young woman in 2011, getting dolled up for a party to impress a crush. Fun, fabulous, sexy and feminine. Chefs kiss!

Update: after testing more, I have second thoughts. The chemically smell is real in the dry down. Smells like rubbing alcohol/fake woods :(",08/18/25 15:35,jdb_
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,This is the grown up mature version of Juicy Couture Viva la Juicy line. Better than the original Gorgeous gardenia and more deep and surely better than Gold Couture. This lady is flirty and carefree with sex appeal . I admit that the opening is more intersting than the dry down as the dry down is a bit gold couture vibes But I love it. Its signature scent worthy except in the heat of summer.,08/15/25 12:30,MrAbbas

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"someone sent me a sample of this with a purchase I made and I avoided spraying it as I just figured it wasn't my thing.
however, I am trying a new way of using my fragrances so I am doing an alphabet challenge. When I got to G I decided to give this one a go and boy was I wrong.
This fragrance was an absolute delight from first spray. Slightly darker in tone and something that could be worn not just on a hot summer evening but a fragrance that would suit the autumn and winter months as well. I could smell this on myself most of the day and only topped up once.
This may just have to go onto my list of full bottle worthy fragrances",08/12/25 07:41,Muddy Monsters

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"smells like a grown up version of taylor swift's wonders truck. as soon as I smelled it I felt incredibly nostalgic.

it leans very fall/winter, which I love because I find that it's super rare to find a floral that feels like fall/winter. its got this woodiness and spiciness that I just really love. I can't wait to wear this more in the fall.",08/06/25 16:37,tay.sor17
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,Voní to jako CK Euphoria a je to velmi drahé.,08/03/25 00:07,Sicilanka
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense opens sweet, fruity, and flowery. As it dries down, the sweetness intensifies and a soft but pungent spiciness appears.
I tried the original a couple of months ago, and this version smells like a more intense version of what I remember the original smelling like. As I tried it in Boots on my way back home, I had to buy a 30ml bottle. I like the original; I particularly loved the brown sugar note, but the performance is so poor that I could not bring myself to buy it.
This intense version seems longer lasting, still very sweet and flowery but spicy: it seems ideal for late summer weather, turning into autumn 🤎❤️🍂

Update: after 3 to 4 hours, this fragrance is gone. Just as well I got the cute little bottle, I can bring it with me and re-apply... Longevity is still better than the orginal, but not that much, so that you know...",07/30/25 09:03,Federica76

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I tried this at Ulta and it's definitely stronger than Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia, but I also found it to be way too sweet for me. It lasted a good 4 hours and the drydown was definitely better than what I smelled in the top notes, but still not a fan.",07/29/25 15:19,hslevcove25
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"got this as a sample. i smell the juicy mandarin straight away. there are white florals that somehow feel more cold weather adjacent as apposed to the more common summer fresh i'm used to from them.

unfortunately i get a strange cheap plastic undertone from the fragrance which puts me off heavily.",07/29/25 03:13,shizumafu
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"After smelling so many intense versions of perfumes that smell nothing like the original, this is truly what I had hoped the intense version of Gorgeous Gardenia would be like-- 100% met my expectations. Gorgeous Gardenia has a fresh and clean undertone alongside the bright fruity florals, and that freshness is totally missing here. BUT as a freshie girlie, I was actually surprised that I didn't miss those facets! This version is less clean and a bit more deep and rich without losing the initial DNA. It is still a sweet, fruity white floral, but the sandalwood gives it a creamy, spicy depth that is really pleasant. I enjoy it so much, and I really would like a full bottle!

The sillage is not beast mode but certainly you get a decent scent bubble, and this lasted 4-6 hours on me in a dry climate-- definitely has more throw in humidity!

I love this perfume because it is truly just a slightly more intense version of the perfume we all know and love.",07/28/25 11:21,LunaLovespell
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This one gives me the same vibes as the orchid (not the same smell but the thiknessy if you know what i mean) and I'm in love.

The lovely opening is unisex to me.",07/28/25 10:00,F Aerts
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I will have to sample this again, but somehow on my skin it smells strikingly similar to Jimmy Choo EDP (the original). One of the few perfumes I've tried that lasts all day and has crazy sillage though! Impressive.",07/27/25 06:41,VioletScented
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"to me, it reminds me of christmas (in the best way)
it's got a really interesting spicy note (kind of pine-y to me?) that evolves the more you smell it, and the sweet notes gently get stronger and leave a pleasant impression",07/26/25 15:45,fruitofsue
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,This is interesting. I can detect a pepper rose note in this. I also get a very syrupy drydown with notes of berries. This is more of a bold floral fatale night scent. They took the intense very seriously with this one. Intense gardenia is not your typical fluffy white floral. Not a blind buy. I really enjoy it though. A unique scent.,07/20/25 10:34,Eline091
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"On my skin, it's light floral, and there's spiciness. To me it doesn't smell same as the original. Woody dry down. I think men can wear this. It's for women with strong personality. Not for me. I like floral feminine perfumes. Not a safe blind buy.

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,Dry down smells similar to Zoologists' Rabbit but with added florals and not as much of a biscuit as Rabbit is. 6/10 floral gourmand unique but not big on this scent profile. Defo better than Zoologist because it is more wearable.,07/19/25 09:44,kasemx94
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This Intense version smells exactly the same as the regular one (to my nose, mostly sweet red fruits), but it lasts longer. If you like the original, you’ll probably like this one too.

For the record, I tested it at the same time as the original version (one on my left arm, the other on the right).",07/19/25 06:32,Saveria
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"In my opinion this one is the best of the lot because it's richer. It is more in the category of, say, Elle - YSL, Midnight Poison - Dior. It couldn't be mistaken for either, don't get me wrong. It is a rich, sweet, modern fruitchouli. I don't go in for many scents of this ilk but I really like THIS one and I like the way this range is presented too. Think rich berries, rich florals like ""orchid"" style, purple (really, that's just the vibe I get), soft patchouli and cedar, with sweeeeet wedding cake icing.",07/19/25 04:14,chimidoro

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"If it wasn't for niche perfumes I'd be obsessed with this (and I'm even on the other side of the fence about buying this eventually) but one minor thing putting me off is (now don't if you're not a mum let this put you off) it smells like a mumsy designer perfume. It's definitely a good blind buy though if you're not sure on what mature-ish smell to buy.

I'd say this fragrance suits someone best around their 20s",07/17/25 13:18,RDUK
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Male here, can’t say no to free samples, so when this came through the post and found it in a gucci bag on the entrance floor after a long day at work, I thought f**k it and gave it a go.

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This is for your elegant vampire princess. Everything about this is so Autumn coded, even that gorgeous cranberry, blood-red bottle. It's fruity with a spicy woodiness from the sandalwood, which is the dominant note for me in the drydown. A bit reminiscent of wine, and somewhat similar in vibe to JPG La Belle Parfum. This is definitely its own entity from the original Gorgeous Gardenia, they're nothing alike. Out of the whole range, I'd say this one is the most elegant and perfect for a date night.",07/15/25 17:53,candieskulls
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I smelled this in a Gucci store on a tester card and really liked it. The original, Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia, was one of my first designer perfumes. This intense version smells like a stronger and richer version of the original. I think this would be perfect for the colder months. I have yet to try the intense version on my skin though. This could potentially be added to my collection depending on how it performs and smells on my skin.

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I loved the original gorgeous gardenia and plan to use this as a base to layer over since that one doesn’t last long. Same dna to me in the intense but this is stronger brown sugar through out. When I sprayed the back of my hand, there was a sheen from the oils. The juicy fruits at the opening are mouth watering. I never really smelled the gardenia in the og, But here in the intense, the florals are creamy and enveloping like a hug. I’m asking for this for Christmas.",07/11/25 15:41,LLayton
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I like this 🙂 I'm not so sure if I will ever buy it, but its good. Creamy flowers and strong sandalwood, i have the image of berries in my mind also, although not listed as notes, may be just the red bottle. It does not inspire me as much as I hoped.",07/11/25 10:15,Rekaniusz
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I received a free sample of this and it was love at first sniff!

I have a body mist from Impulse called Purple Petals and Smokey Sky that smells quite similar in my opinion and will layer so beautifully. This is super woody but in a sweet way if that makes sense and dries down to such a nice vanilla smell.
I can also smell really fruity berries (blackcurrant like) but can’t see it listed in the notes so not sure what I’m smelling.

I would definitely wear this during the evening and probably the winter time as I think it suits colder weather a little more.",07/11/25 06:14,Mymble
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Definitely on the woodier side, almost none of the sugar from the original. I prefer this one, it's distinctly different, more grown-up as well. There's patchouli in there somewhere - hence the Flowerbomb vote in the 'reminds me of' section. Also reminds me of something I smelled years ago (could be early 00s?) but can't quite put my finger on it.",07/10/25 02:24,cradiata
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Love the original, so thought I'd try this while it was in store, and got a big surprise. Whilst I wasn't expecting a stronger dupe, I was expecting some resemblance but this is a heavy, fall and winter perfume - more night time. On me it strongly smelt of Euphoria. Performs well, but not what I was looking for.",07/09/25 09:41,HippyDippy57
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Very much like Baciami and Crystal Noire Parfum to me. More woods and less vanilla in comparison to Baciami. Warmer and more ambery than CNP. The white florals are creamy with a slight peppery bitterness, which I like. The woodiness is more like guaiac instead of sandalwood to my nose. I like it but it would be redundant as I have similar scents. Beautifully done nonetheless.",07/09/25 07:45,Lauren387
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Oh there’s no way there’s no patchouli notes listed. While it’s not as intense as the Gucci guilty intense edp in the gold bottle, the patchouli profile is definitely here. It’s a little softer, musky and slightly sweet from the creamy white florals.

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"I get a strong bubblegum note in the opening. Like a lighter less dense version of Kayali's Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar.

Very long lasting.",07/02/25 08:59,SpinningClouds
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,Love it. All the Floras smell amazing on paper but do something strange on my skin. This is the first one to not do so. It stays smooth yet slightly uplifted. It’s a bubble bathe scent. Scented and fragrant but not heavy. Just pretty and clean. Will def need a bottle!,06/30/25 14:09,SSBurn
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Nice, very different from original Gorgeous Gardenia. But you can definitely snell gardenia and hedione note which I find a more sophisticated and balance then jasmine. Woody, warm, goos for fall and winter or as evening perfume all year round .",06/27/25 19:11,Alina Mir
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"Overly synthetic and far too sweet.
Unfortunately, it just smells cheap.
The overall structure (the “fabric” of the fragrance) feels like something you’ve smelled everywhere before.
I usually adore gardenia for its clean, angelic vibe, but this doesn’t give me that at all.
A hard pass from me.",06/26/25 09:43,rylai
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"The opening reminds me so much of dark kiss from bath and body works, something I wore 15 years ago! To me this is a dark and sweet, mysterious and seductive scent. This would be a head turner to wear on a summer night out. But it also has a cozy feel to it so this would be good for the fall and winter too. It smells like a dark sweet fruit, almost like a dark berry or plum or something. The florals are present, but not too strong so they don’t make you smell like an old lady. The sandalwood is a great note in here to round it all out. I can imagine this scent lasting allll day. The reddish burgundy bottle is very pretty too, I feel like the color matches the fragrance very well.",06/17/25 15:05,Camilovely
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"This is not a more intense version of the previous flanker. You really smell the gardenia and jasmine and it smells so luxurious. There is a fruitiness that lasts throughout the wear of the fragrance but I get a more berry feel than mandarin but it is fresh and not juvenile. The sandalwood is perfect, it's anchored deep and really keeps the florals from being to heavy and dense. This fragrance is perfectly balanced being warm, creamy, but fresh at the same time. This fragrance is a head turner for sure and I'm really impressed. Definitely sexy and screams luxury, but you must like your white florals.

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense Gucci,"The best part about the original was the brown sugar note IMO. I'm curious to smell this flanker although I'm skeptical it will smell better. It looks like it will smell very different compared to the first one. A flanker should retain the DNA of the original while adding its own flair. Either way, I'm eager to get my nose on it.

The bottle is gorgeous! I am also curious if the others in the line will get an ""Intense"" addition?! I imagine so but it could widely depend on the success of this one.

Gucci Bamboo Limited Edition Gucci,"This was a blind buy that I truly regret. On me, there is no floral. There is a weird chemical fragrance. It's starting to trigger a migraine.",05/10/24 10:43,PerfumeFerret
Gucci Bamboo Limited Edition Gucci,"I loved the fragrance in the bottle but it reacted quite poorly to my body chemistry - it loses all of the floral smells and just turns into a sickly sweet smell, which is disappointing. It's not bad but it's not great. I learned a lesson here to never pay for a full size perfume unless it's very reasonably priced or I've had a chance to test a sample or travel size. I'm not sure if other people have had similar reactions, but for a Gucci perfume, at that price point it's definitely worth testing before buying. I think I just fell victim to the packaging, which is really beautiful.

Update - this turned quite badly. I've had other perfumes turn after 5 years, which is not unreasonable. But I've had other perfumes that lasted much longer, because I store them in a cool dark place - like I've had Dolce&Gabbana perfumes stay great for like 9 years. But usually when other perfumes turn I find they either just lose potency or smell alcoholic. ...but not Gucci Bamboo. It literally smelled like a portapotty. It's truly bizarre. I thought I was out of my mind, and I had my friend smell it before I threw it out and she said ""it smells like a toilet,"" and that was the end of it.

At the end of the day, this is the only perfume I've ever had that I would NOT recommend. It's the worst perfume I've ever had in my collection.

Gucci No 1 Parfum Gucci,"I decided to open and test my vintage sample of Gucci No. 1 in honour of the new House of Gucci film (not that anyone at my local cinema would notice - purely for my own satisfaction!) What a treat - G1 is a beautiful, high quality, well-rounded scent. Of its time, but not dated, this floral-aldehydic scent smells elegant and expensive. It is quiet yet rich - this could be due in part to the nature of the parfum concentration. In general, I find that sillage can be stronger in EDP or even EDT form compared to the extrait/parfum version, and as a result I sometimes consider the latter to be more elegant. Here, the subtle, quiet depth of the parfum suits the ladylike elegance of G1.

G1 opens with soft, slightly soapy aldehydes. There is a prominent hyacinth note that is reminiscent of the flower, and is rendered in soft focus by the aldehydes. Rich, vintage-smelling yet soft, the hyacinth is a masterful addition here. When hyacinth is done right, it is a beautiful addition to perfumes (see Goutal Grand Amour for an excellent example). There is a lovely green background to the opening, giving G1 a damp freshness, reminiscent of a garden after rain. The spicy-floral green notes of carnation and geranium enhance this. Lily-of-the-valley is also prominent to my nose here, enhancing the white floral-green accord.

As it develops, more floral notes unfold. There is a subtle sweetess provided by the rose, ylang ylang and some clean jasmine. It is a natural and restrained sweetness - ladylike and elegant, a far cry from modern candied vanilla scents. The greenness remains, and the florals become powdery thanks to the iris and heliotrope. The drydown is musky, mossy and woody, tempered by a subtle hint of vanilla in the base. A sweet amber accord emerges as it fades.

G1 is a beautiful, dense, complex floral bouquet. Feminine elegance in a bottle, it has vintage charm but does not smell dusty or old-fashioned. There is something delicate about it despite its richness. It is extremely well-blended and is long lasting. Sillage is intimate-to-moderate. Technically a chypre given its base, the aldehydic florals dominate. I must track down a full bottle of this masterpiece. They don't make them like this anymore. 5/5.",12/13/21 04:56,Enrium

Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"@psychocandy regarding counterfeit alchemist bottles. Yes, they are everywhere. I recommend visiting a Gucci boutique if you can.

I own a handfull, I've sold a couple over the years, and I've tried nearly all of them. I consider myself pretty well versed and in tune with this particular line. I have inadvertantely purchased counterfeit (decided to repurchase midnight stroll and seller I bought from was genuinely unaware, and I got my money back) and, I literally live down the street from an Gucci boutique. I go there at least once per month, for many years.

To be clear, the smaller, thinner box batch code is above the larger bulkier box code on genuine alchemist garden bottles. I can post photos of both the genuine Gucci boxes, and the fake. I took lots of pictures before returning the fake.

The best way to tell if they are counterfeit is to know the smell, because they're never accurate. This is true for 99% of counterfeit bottles from any house. Another way, specifically for alchemist, is the material of the bag is totally wrong on the counterfeit. Additionally, the print is never quite as robust and seems to fade, and the straps on the bag should not be frayed. Otherwise the counterfeits are very good. I even weighed the bottles and the caps separately, and they were pretty close. But the thing is, the weight of the caps when comparing genuine caps have slight weight variation.
Italian brands like Gucci are not exactly known for laser like focus manufacturing consistency. Yes they are well made, but they are artisan.

P.S. The juice should be blue. Counterfeit juice is clear",02/26/25 01:16,The Wolf

The accord I’m getting would be Ginger, Vetiver and Cedarwood. But these 3 have so much character that it morphs differently on skin. The ginger is fresh and medicinal. The vetiver is earthy, wet soil-like, and rooty. The cedar is pine-like, smooth, yet camphoric. Completely androgynous and well-made",12/04/23 07:18,brokesta911

Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"Some key differences in the real vs the fake:

-real has visibly thicker box
-real has significantly more rigid box
-real has visibly more rounded box edges when compared to other authentic Alchemist Garden boxes
-the real tote bag silk screened cat logo will be ON TOP of swirl pattern, the cat will be very crisply printed without the swirl pattern visible in the printing. The fake had lines and stripes visible in the cat print and was much less crisply printed.
-the real tote bag will feel more like nylon, noisier crisper in texture like a nylon windbreaker, NOT ‘satin’ like a pair of satin sheets, the fake was visibly more “silky” in texture.
-the real tote bag has a considerably smaller tag, sewn in precisely. The fake had a tag at least twice as big and was sewn somewhat crudely when compared to authentic.
-the real bottle cap will have NO casting flaws or texture in the groove, the fake had some flaking/texture in the groove that looked poorly cast
-the FAKE used a known batch code “0023”, my REAL bottle also has this code so be cautious as Gucci may have only made one batch…
-Real box batch code printed to left side just above center of the white area for the barcode with the last digit actually touching the white area, the fakes seem to have the batch code printed well above and to the left of the white bar code area.

Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"My friends, I too could weep for joy.
I managed to score a bottle at an excellent price on eBay and it all worked out for the best- very satisfied.
The beautifully made nesting coffin style textured box with the inner nylon bag (made in Italy) makes for a stunning presentation, better than many bottles costing many times more.
The batch code dates it to January 2020- so the 1st (and only?) batch.
The scent reviews are close to accurate, a ginger spicy opening blast with smoky vegetal undertones, almost beet-like. Sebastian had compared the scent to barbecued roses which is strangely accurate.
The dry-down becomes earthy/musty and woody, very hard to describe overall but intriguing.
Opening sillage is very strong and dries down to moderate sillage and longevity.
I’m thrilled to add it to my collection when I realized too late that Gucci had cancelled it in March.",07/10/23 16:16,Messner8850
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"My friends, I could weep for joy. After scouring the internet for some time, I came across a bottle that, based on detailed photos, appeared to be genuine... and at an unbelievable price. I got so lucky to snag it, especially now that it's disappeared from the Gucci website.

This perfume is challenging and intriguing, with a shocking medicinal and metallic opening blast that quickly paves the way to the promised bone-dry papyrus. Then deep, dark roses start to smolder on resinous wood, alongside more papyrus, menthol, and spicy, rich roots. There is a feeling of stepping into an apothecary, a hint of dusty books, metal implements sanitizing in a basin, bundles of plants hung to dry, 100s of materia medica on the shelves, all of which sit behind the fragrance of the fire heating the room. After years of medicine being prepared here, the scent has permeated the walls, no longer the discernible notes of the ingredients of a remedy, but the scent of the space itself.

The frag head in me appreciates this as a work of art. But as a practitioner of herbal medicine who appreciates the history of my field, this scent transports me. I couldn't be more pleased by this homage.",05/18/23 11:25,Cambium
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"This has a simple note tree like all from the line, but it's also a deep and meditative. The first thing I thought of was historical artifacts in a museum. It's earthy, smokey, woody, and I can sense (in my minds eye) old metal equipment like swords and shields used in Roman Gladiator battles in the colosseum.

If this was named bronze and wood it would make sense. There's also an old worn leather vibe. This highlights the best parts of papyrus and wood. Some may also catch a medicinal smell of a doctor's office. Might be challenging for every day wear as it's serious and not light-hearted at all. I think it would be perfect on a well dressed man heading out for a night on the town. I keep smelling the spray spots which is usually a bad sign for my wallet 😵.

Deep, meditative, ancient, transportive, I love it, and ended up buying it. This will appeal only to niche fragrance lovers imo.

Scent 10/10
Performance 9.5/10

P. S. This is way better than Le Labo Patchouli 24. Although they share a little similarity in the opening, P24 smells like you're wearing patchouli smothered in BBQ sauce.",03/12/23 14:28,The Wolf
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"This fragrance was synthesised by Alberto Morelas by Astlham Gucci for Hortus Sanitatis’ book “Garden of Health” is one of the first and perhaps the most influential books printed on herbs and is one of the most important works of the Middle Ages that contributed to our knowledge of natural history, especially in the field of medicinal plants. The book consists of sections of plant knowledge and drug extraction.

Alberto Morelas has formulated this beautiful fragrance made up of papyrus, vetiver, cedar and ginger with a wood combination of your earthy that resembles the smell of medicinal medicines and the amazing combination of foreground and finish.

When smelling the first spray of perfume, you start smelling a nail-like smell and ramming plants 🪵with a dumbbell of smoke and the combination of burning vetiver and ginger with a background of the smell of wound healers “Ditol” 💊, all this with one spray, when the perfume proves after about 15 minutes it begins to smell

I didn't find the perfume similar or the same composition.

A very wonderful and amazing perfume, a winter perfume par excellence.

I recommend it to lovers of exclusivity, you will evaluate 10/10.

When I smell this smell, I remember the cold winter nights in the middle of the land and the warmth with fire, the smell of burning ramids and golden sand 🪵🏜",12/14/22 06:36,khalidbloom
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"How did I not know about this earlier? Stumbled upon this on a casual visit to my local Gucci Boutique and felt beyond delighted! Hand down the best in the Alchemist Garden Collection so far! It’s way more complex than what described here. I picked up notes of spices, some iris, cade, birch tar, vanilla, patchouli. It’s really close to Le Labo’s Patchouli 24 with a green spicy opening and a more powdery musky base (Gucci Alchemist Garden DNA - very similar to Voice of the Snake or Midnight stroll). It’s more smokey woody than aromatic to my nose. This also seems to last the longest for me compared to other similar scents in the collection.

If it smells like GGPH to you or has weak performance, it’s very likely you might have gotten a counterfeit one. Real bottles are sold only at certain boutiques and DSM",10/17/21 22:31,teh
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"The sent trail of this fragrance is mouth watering. Relative to what's out there, this is very mentholated with hints of sweetness and some woods. Its dry..its unique..and very underrated. I'm a girl and purchased it blindly afer I got Voice of the Snake which I also love (also a blind purchase). Its perfectly unisex. Don't sleep on this fragrance.",09/23/21 09:40,Hansolo
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"In light of all the fakes apparently circulating out there (see psychocandy's review below), I guess I should start by pointing out that my bottles of Hortus Sanitatis were both purchased directly from one of the Gucci botiques. So I am reviewing the genuine stuff. That's a good thing, because this is going to be a glowing review for one of my favorite fragrances of 2020.

HS is not just part of the Gucci Alchemists' Garden series of haute partum releases, its name is also the Latin nomenclature for a ""health garden"", or a garden comprised of plants having medicinal properties. This scent opens, appropriately enough, with a medicinal, mentholated note that is unique in my experience. Fans of Gucci Guilty Absolute will be reminded of the band-aid note in that fragrance, but here there is more depth and complexity to this note--it smells like a medication with several aromatic ingredients, not just a bandage. I think this note is a manifestation of some real camphorous oud at work in HS.

The notes here are hard to pick out because the blending is exceptionally intricate. Papyrus, in a very natural and lifelike grassy, dry form, is about all I can pick out distinctly in the initial phase of this scent. Later, as things progress, there is a smokey incense note which is joined by rose. One of the well-known YouTubers has said that this phase of HS smells like barbecued roses. I don't quite know if I would have used that description, but it is as good as any, I suppose. Barbecued or not, there is nothing jammy about the rose in HS. This rose is herbal and astringent in nature and somewhat spicy, perhaps with a hint of ginger.

I have seen suggestions that this scent is similar to Gucci Pour Homme I, or Parle Moi de Parfum's Papyrus/Oud 71. I own all of these scents and I do not see any such similarly beyond the presence of papyrus in all 3 fragrances.

This fragrance is most certainly unisex. Projection is considerable and longevity stretches out over 10 or more hours. The presentation is reminiscent of an old laboratory bottle and also the containers of the Louis Vuitton fragrances. Perhaps LVMH, which owns both Gucci and Vuitton, is utilizing designs submitted for consideration in response to a single request for ideas to get the most for their money or to avoid wasting a second good design when they need only one per product line. In any event, the bottle looks very good and the atomizer is among the best.

This is one of those fragrances that is so unlike anything else, and so far removed from trends and fashion, that it is amazing that Gucci has created and marketed it. I love HS. It is expensive, but the quality is extraordinary.

HS is hard to find because the distribution is so very limited, but if you should find yourself in a Gucci boutique where HS is sold, don't miss the chance to smell this wonderful fragrance. Most highly recommended. Beautiful!",05/27/21 16:47,Akscent
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,This is essentially a sequel to Le Labo’s Patchouli 24. The scents are very similar. This Gucci is a tad more sharp and candied than the Le Labo. Crazy that Gucci is selling something so utterly daring and complex. Major props to them!!!,12/14/20 19:15,BirkinSmell
Hortus Sanitatis Gucci,"I want to put this up as a public service announcement to be very careful when buying this line including this one: I just purchased on a reputable auction site and the product I received was in fact a fake. It looked quite convincing but upon comparison to an authentic packaging presentation it was clearly a fake. This fragrance has been faked for certain😳 the box will have a smoother texture than an authentic, it will be noticeably thinner and have flex which the originals do NOT. I compared side by side the boxes and my fake Hortus was immediately noticeably thinner! Next the little pouch of the fake will be more silky and satin like, the real deal is a raspy nylon type bag. My fake Hortus sticker on the bottom of the bottle had a nearly unreadable batch code, the real things will be bold black and look almost embossed.

A Nocturnal Whisper Perfume Oil Gucci,"In the collection 'The garden of the alchemist' Oil version, ode to melancholy is no longer available.
I was intrigued by this name, whose subjects correspond to my favorites.
So I chose this night murmur, filled with sweetness and poetry.
This time it is the leather with the saffran accompanied by incense scrolls against the background of Oud whose oil makes its name wonderfully.
The idea of including the glass applicator like Arab perfumery is daring for this very commercial house.
Admittedly, this range is of a higher level whose choice of Alberto Morillas is no coincidence.
The Atkinsons house, with its Mystic Essence collection, had released in its time some perfumes in this format of oils, which I have Oud Save the Queen.
With this method, we perfume ourselves with details, the perfume is just deposited by applying the glass rod behind the ears and on the neck by small touches, instead of receiving an often clumsy wavy with sprays except for people who flavor the clothes, yes I say the clothes, by them.
But now, the Prays broadcasts the alcohol in which the oil is there but only it is not feasible.
A shame that other brands do not offer this means, just to revive the pleasure and the art of perfuming.
It is therefore a real pleasure for me with this perfume.
The oud here must be that of Laos, already used by Morillas for its original Oud to mizensify accompanied by a sumptuous geranium, and which I find here this lightness surrounded by saffron, giving this impression of leather.
The outfit is very good and the wake is light, as its name suggests, since this perfume is not intended to attract attention but to seduce the one who carries it and not strike a very little receptive entourage in the OUD in general.
And moreover, a very beautiful collector's room, with its glass bottle dressed in its silk pocket, in a pretty box and all with green and gold green colors.",08/18/25 05:22,Chanel de Lanvin

A Nocturnal Whisper Perfume Oil Gucci,"Far from a whisper, this is a quite intense take on an oud/leather-combi. I'm not a fan of oud in general, but this is very well blended with a hint of sweetnes from the saffron and benzoin. Imagine one of them andalusian equestrian clubs with polished leather saddles, elegant horsemen and the finest breed of horses. It sure smells lavish and the bottles in the collection are very beautiful, yet I don't find it distinctive enough to warrant such an exorbitant price.",11/16/22 12:25,Selfscentred
A Nocturnal Whisper Perfume Oil Gucci,So I dabbed Nocturnal Whisper at Dubai airport while waiting for my flight. The heady incensy dark notes just hit me straight in the heart and I was in lust. I nearly fainted when I heard the price so it was a pass. But unfortunately I couldn't forget it on returning back to London and as the days passed I couldn't forget that intense love that literally mesmerised me as did the beautiful enchanted bottle and name. So I bought it and we have been in love ever since. I've layered it with A Reason To Love since the perfume oils can layered... And well that burning love has just become eternal.,11/02/22 11:32,SomaNyx

A Nocturnal Whisper Perfume Oil Gucci,"Beautiful skin scent, nice balance of leather, real oud, spicy saffron and slightly sweet benzoin. I’d never buy it at retail price, discounted yes, I blind bought it heavily discounted and I must say that yes it has real oud, not the best quality oud but nonetheless real oud. This perfumed oil is way better than all the other trash Gucci has offered before so I’m very impressed and happy with the way they’ve gone with Alberto Morilla. It leans more masculine than unisex because of the heavy oud presence but if you like pungent, daring, leathery scents this will provide a nice backbone for layering. BTW this ain’t no whisper.",03/11/21 19:40,noseyboysniffy
A Nocturnal Whisper Perfume Oil Gucci,"At the opening this is a blast of leather, which softens up very nicely. I found the dry-down to be largely woods, with a slight leather in the background.

A Nocturnal Whisper Perfume Oil Gucci,"Gucci is sinking.... who do you caaaalll??? Ghost-bust....No..... AL-BERTOOOO!

Yep. After 10 years of creative desert (with the excpetion of the great Gucci Intense Oud) in the fragrance department, Gucci woke up 2 years ago by calling Alberto Morillas to save the ship. This started with the non-mainstream beautiful Gucci Guilty Absolute. (even if probably highly inspired by Terenzi Ursa, released a couple of years before..)
Now, Gucci wants to capture value by launching is high-end line to compete with Armani Prive, Dior La Collection, Tom Ford Private Blend & co...
Well... I would suggest: keep cool Gucci. One can not go ""dalle stalle alle stelle"" from one day to another... (an italian expression litterally meaning ""from the stables to the stars"")

That said, I have to say I tested a couple of their Alchemist's Garden line, and these where very nice blends.

This oud oil is a beautiful oud-centered fragrance, made with real oud oil (from Thailand I would guess).

Will I buy it? At $415 (for just 0.5oz) retail, that's simply a no.
If I was rich, would I buy it? No, because while it is well blended, it is not unique and thus not worth it.
If I had to spend $400 on a fragrance, I would choose a couple of beautiful and really unique niche fragrances for that price, or just double the $ amount to get Frederic Malle The Night (at $900/1.7oz, it ends being less $/ml, and it's much more potent - need just one spray, will last much longer- and unique). I have the felling here that what the price counts is the unicity ( of the beautiful old style bottle - personally I care about the juice, not the bottle or label).

In one sentence: great fragrance, horrible price.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I haven't seen anyone commenting on this, but I've been using this EDT for a few days now, and I sense something that reminds me (in a very watered-down and simplistic way) of Guerlain's Champs Élyseés. Perhaps it's the common notes: lilac, peach, and blackcurrant. They seem to have been crafted in a very similar way to the masterpiece that is Champs, but much weaker than Guerlain's. Anyway, just because it reminded me of my beloved Champs, I like this Gucci Guilty EDT and will have it in my collection. It's a beautiful floral scent, fresh and pleasant. I don't see any situation that would make it unpleasant—quite the opposite.",09/05/25 13:01,Aline Bourges
Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Okay wow. I sold my original 2010 edt several years ago, but heard someone talking about it recently so I went to try this newer, available version. This is incredible. Truly amazing. It is admittedly less intense than the original formulation of the edt, but for me, that translates as a very good thing. This has the same mysterious sexy clean scent, but is a bit sweeter and smoother.

I will say, I’ve only had it for a week and already ran through a third of the bottle :/. It lasts pretty well for an edt, but obviously I’m over spraying, which I need to do, because otherwise it wouldn’t be worth spraying at all. Aside from that (which is a huge con) I am truly in love with this and will be wearing it forever.",08/31/25 08:19,$ortabroke

Saying that I was swept away by it is underestimation. Unfortunately, that limited edition is far pricier, so I was looking for some alternatives. Having sniffed all the possible Guilty perfumes, I realised the EDT is the closest to Love Edition. It is so gentle and sultry at the same time. The lilac note is the most delicate and mesmerising. I wish I had discovered it sooner",08/07/25 10:56,valery_perfumejunkie

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This used to be one of my favorite grab 'n go scents. Was caught off guard when I noticed she no longer came in her cute little rounded square flacon.
I blind bought this new formulation after discovering the notes are almost identical to the original. They've added raspberry and removed bergamot. Considering bergamot has a deeper spicier accord than other citruses, in its absence, we arrive at something less sultry, slightly softer and fruitier.

Initially, I didn't appreciate it, as I was pining for the OG but over time, I've grown to love this :)

EDIT: Just purchased a 30ml of the original on eBay. In a side-by-side comparison, the original is spicier, and soapier than this new EDT. During the dry down the original also projects stronger and for longer.

Conclusion: While the original fragrance is a little edgier, in it's absence I've grown to love my new EDT version",05/18/25 00:57,LuckyLei

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"It is a very sophisticated veil of an angelic scent. The most vivid part is lilac and skin-like musk. A dash of pink pepper, a drop od jasmine, a note of peach and amber.
Surrounds me in a fragrant cloud that feels universal occasion-wise. Lovely concentration for the spring and summer as it is more airy than the edp as I know it from the Love edition. When you want a light pleasure and not to make a statement. It still has enough presence to satisfy me, I feel it for 11 hours already. It only was absent when I was hiking, but whenever I stood still I could clearly detect its lovely aura, so its parameters are spectacular. Faint remains of it I feel the next morning.
And it can be oversprayed to my heart delight.
It feels luxurious and well done.",05/10/25 04:09,MademoiselleMaya
Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Very subtle, elegant. It won't offend anyone.
Like a warm breeze carrying the scent of lilac and other florals and a fruity nuances of mandarin and peach. With time pink pepper makes an appearance. I feel also musk.
I love the soft veil of opening. I bought it wanting a subtle floral breeze and it delivers.
Gucci Guilty the Love edition has stronger presence as an eau de parfum. Also the opening of the original, old formula is more lilac and stronger.
It might be a good companion for summer.
It feels carnal and skin-like. Your skin but better scent.
When I was going to sleep and my skin heated in bed, I could suddenly feel the pretty projection of the scent, a musky-floral goodness 10 hours after application.",04/24/25 04:49,MademoiselleMaya

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"A scent so smooth, yet bold and bright,
Gucci Guilty feels just right.
Citrus sparks with lemon zest,
Lilac follows clean and fresh.

Hints of spice and floral play,
Soft and subtle, never stray.
A touch of musk, so warm and light,
Keeps it mellow, never trite.

It’s easy, breezy, hard to hate,
A classic choice a simple fate.
Not too loud, but lingers still,
A scent that’s chic yet fits the bill.

And though the name may hint at sin,
There’s nothing guilty locked within!

On the surface it doesn't seem that original but there is something about it that stands apart from other florals and I'm having a hard time saying why. Maybe because none of the other perfumes I've tried were lilac? Maybe it is the lilac? But I feel like I've found he perfect floral for me. It is comforting, elegant, classy, not overbearing and but subtly unique. It is light but has good longevity. I like that I can wear it out to dinner and it doesn't clash with food. It's safe for wearing to work and also special enough for an event. I went out and tried all the other versions of Gucci Guilty and I definitely prefer this over the EDP. I love the bottle too.",01/14/25 16:12,Slink

The pyramid of this and 2010 are almost identical on fragrantica, but I can tell 2021 is definitely different thing.

2021 jasmine is much much prominent than 2010. Initial spray of 2021 definitely reminds me of 2010 but just 2mins later it’s turn to the cheap mass-appealing scent… longevity and sillage are good as cloying for some even as EDT.

I personally felt this disrespected the original Guilty 2010.

Guilty eau de toilette smells like a glamorous 50s starlet on her days off, when she doesn't want to be bothered. She puts on beige striped pajamas and her glasses and curls up with a book. The scent is unobtrusive, feminine and soothing.
It's a very perfume-y perfume, in that it smells like more like a smooth, musky floral blend than one identifiable scent. That being said, the peach and lilac are prominent enough to ease this into a vintage-like territory.",10/23/24 05:31,Treachaseff

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is going to sound weird, but this reminds me insanely of what all of the perfumes in the fashion magazines of the early 2000's smelled like, but in a good way. I really like the men's version of Guilty so I had a feeling this would be just as nice. This reminds me of a department store. Sharp mandarin and raspberry, and then there starts to be a mish mash of a lot of different things going on as it dries down. The sharp fruit sticks around, then I smell the lilac and grassy patchouli. I seem to smell everything but the vanilla. This is very weird because I scrolled down just now through the comments and someone said EXACTLY what I envision when I smell this. I'm glad I'm not the only one that pictures the perfume counter at JC Penney and the perfume samples in Cosmo. I really want to try the original version. It gets softer and sweeter the more it dries down.10 minutes later and it isn't hardly there anymore. Well blended, but not worth the price tag to me for a skin scent.

Anyway, fast-forward to today and I got a 30 mL from Marshall's. It smells so good and similar to the edp just lighter and it doesn't last as long. But it is so good, they don't make fragrances like this anymore.
I get a lot of baby powder fresh lilac, with a bright opening and a hint of the pink peppers, but not all that spicy, and a sexy amber-y musk at the base.

It essentially smells like a grown up, sexy and sophisticated baby powder, perfect for any time of the day and season. I honestly wish it lasted longer but it's really good if you're into fresh scents and powdery scents.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"The first thing I want to say about this is that it smells expensive. This is the fragrance to wear if you want to smell and feel like you're wealthy.

Expertly blended. There's no particular scent note that dominates this.

I notice the pink pepper but it doesn't burn my nose, it's subtle. The mandarin orange brings a clean and slightly aquatic vibe to the top notes. I sense the lilac and geranium, some blackcurrant too. This scent doesn't change much between the different phases.

You don't have to spray a lot for good results.

Good for basically any occasion and signature scent worthy

Classy and suits a grown woman.

I have the matching lotion too. I put one spray of this on my other arm with nothing on it and a spray on my other arm with the lotion first and the lotion does make the scent stronger and last twice as long but even without any lotion it still lasts about 5 hours before it starts to fade away and the projection's good without it too.

I received a sample of the edp and loved it but only had enough loyalty points to buy the edt so after reading all the reviews for both, I took a chance and blind bought the edt. Zero regrets, love at first sniff. I prefer this to the edp as the addition of the raspberry and the vanilla notes are really noticeable giving it even more appeal for me as they’re favourites of mine.

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"As someone said, this is VERY close to the original Gucci Guilty and my beloved OG Gucci Guilty Intense. It is about 97% and I am soooooo thrilled as the OG was a masterpiece and discontinued and impossible to find similar sexy lilac frag, lilac gets a bad rap these days it seems and can be very old fashioned if not blended well but this is STUNNING and so close to the original and intense which i've gone through 4 bottles of! Thank god they made this cuz all the other reissues smell nothing like the classic I almost gave up! I'd say it's slightly lighter and a bit fruitier, lending it a touch more sweetness but several side by side comparisons with Gucci Guilty Intense had me buy a bottle immediately as they are NEARLY IDENTICAL THANK YOU GOD!!! The new bottle is not as cool as the original and I feel its a bit top heavy and scares me it may tip but the juice is incredible and will have you GUILTY OF SMELLING DELICIOUS. This is a lilac with secrets. An extremely warm and a little spicy purple flower. It used to smell like the color lavender to me (not the flower) but now i get more of a black and it's hot and sexy in the most subtle unexpected way. Not your normal sexy sweet gourmand it's a sexy floral IMO. I've never smelled anything like this and its been my signature scent since the day I met the Intense flanker in 2017. I do not like powder or playdoh but I can sometimes pick those up but for some reason it just works and i find this to be utterly intoxicating and my most complimented fragrance. It does smell expensive and I'd say not for the teens. I wear it day or night hot or cold and will be buried in this scent.",01/28/23 07:19,FRAGLORD3000

So I hoped I would enjoy this...and I was right! On my skin the opening is all lilac and peach. It's subtle and very pretty. The musk and amber come out within the first thirty minutes. This scent is truly so lovely. I went a little heavy on the spraying. I have a large sample and I sprayed 3 times on each arm and once on my hair, but I work alone in an office so don't worry about anyone around me being offended. I think that's a good amount to spray because the scent is not overwhelming, it's the perfect amount to really get a sense of how Gucci Guilty EDT smells. I kind of wish the lilac projected more. I think I would consider buying this on a discount, although I want to see how long this lasts on my skin.

This scent would be gorgeous during the winter-to-spring transition. It's safe for the office or running errands/casual events.",01/06/23 06:01,realitygreene

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Not at all what I normally gravitate towards. I usually go for musky, spicy scent. But this is gorgeous! I get that pink pepper and some peachiness right away. Then the lilacs come in, and they radiate such beauty! Definitely a soft musky drydown, a bit powdery, but not simple or overly vanillic. This is sort of sweet, which surprises me that I like it; it's not a gentle floral, but very feminine. I wore it all summer, and wondered what it might be like in the cold weather. I put it on today (it's 12 deg F here), and Gucci Guilty edt is still lovely! I have a rollerball, but will certainly purchase a FB!",11/19/22 16:33,pisces3774
Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"This is very pretty. Smells like a powdery makeup smell. This actually smells exactly like a body mist i have from ted baker I purchased years ago. A very light slightly sweet powdery smell. Gorgeous and sophisticated would be the best way to describe it, but unfortunately because of the poor longevity and poor sillage I don’t think I would buy a full bottle of this. I think I’ll stick to my ted baker body mist (in case anyone was wondering it’s the light mint color bottle and has iris in it)",08/20/22 15:32,ajfragrances
Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"A like or a love! This is a surprise to me because I initially didn't like the Gucci Guilty range (way back when it was in the gold bottle) and thought it smelled weird. But I took some time to let it dry down and started to get addicted. Slightly sweet and surprisingly great for summer days in the A/C. The star of the show is the dry, slightly powdery amber. It's not as sweet and full bodied as my Ambra del Nepal, but that final drydown is reminiscent of it. I find GG EDT 2021 so elegant as it dries down to the base. I used to like the 90s Calgon (?) Lilac body spray a lot, but GG EDT 2021 is not that. The fruits here seem nonexistent to me, as this is blended well and not a ""fruity"" fragrance. I don't consider this to have a strong patchouli either. The most prominent notes are easily amber, lilac, and geranium for me, but again it is smooth and something easily worn for the warmer months. I spray liberally, and maybe went through a tenth of my 30 mL this month. GG EDT is a soft, pretty fragrance appropriate for anytime during the day: office, picnic, etc. I tried the EDP in store (2019) and liked something about it, but the base notes were quite masculine. The EDT is lighter, more ethereal, and sophisticated.",07/16/22 20:07,KylieBooFace

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Ooh, lovely. I'm not 100% sure if this is the version my sample is of, but I'm just going to guess it is. I remember when Gucci Guilty first came out my friend and I were so confused because nothing about it smelled guilty to our noses. I'm not sure if the scent has changed or I have changed, but I can sense the fruity soft sexiness of this perfume now. It's very sexy in a gentle way. I get a lot of peach and amber, but it's not sticky sweet like some peach ambers, more tart - lilac and musk bring a beautiful floral powderiness to this scent. Sultry but demure. I just picked up the intense version, and although they don't share the same notes, I do smell the link - the fruity, musky, stone-fruit link.

P.S. There is a baby lotion waft to this one, so beware if that's not your thing. Also, in the drydown it starts resembling Michael Kor's Sexy Ruby - they have that same fruity ""sexy woman"" smell.",06/24/22 13:20,ntabassum92

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I have a lot of perfumes, and I know the original came out around 10 years ago, and I have to say the new EDT is one of the best perfumes of the last 10 years, and I am kicking myself waiting this long to get it, the only other Gucci Guilty I have had in Gucci Guilty EAU that I bought in 2016, but I don't have that anymore, but to me this is similar to that, but this new EDT is even better. I think if you aren't a perfume collector, and only like to have so many perfumes, this should be one of them hands down. This perfume is very romantic to me, and very Spring like, but that doesn't matter to me, I will wear this all year round. This perfume is a must have for me. I love how all the notes in this mix so well together, it's so nice and smooth, I get the lilac the most, I smell a slight powdery peach, white musk, and just a slight touch of amber and patchouli. Wow this is just mesmerizing. I have to suggest this to all the men reading this, and their Girlfriend, or Wife doesn't have this perfume get this for them for Christmas this year, Macy's among other department stores, have Gucci Guilty gift sets, in EDT, and EDP. Don't sleep on this perfume.",10/06/21 09:34,duckiescents

Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I LOVE this scent. It makes me feel rich and sexy. I've only had it a few days and I'm contemplating buying a back up bottle because I know I will go through this bottle fairly quickly. The reason for that is the longevity is pretty much trash. I can get a solid 2 hours out of this then I have to reapply. If you are looking for a long lasting 12+ hour fragrance that projects this isn't the one for you. But if you want a soft, powdery, floral scent that smells rich, this is for you. This is like the only perfume I will still support with no lasting power. I just love the scent.",07/05/21 12:24,Perfumelady88
Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I really like this fragrance, which is a total surprise. I never expected to like lilac in a fragrance. I always loved fresh lilacs as a child, but my experience with it as a fragrance note, was in soaps and strong scented candles, at my grandmother's house. Not really something I want to smell like.

However, this is really beautiful.. fresh orange, pretty lilac, sweet peach, black currant... all of these notes together are heavenly.

But, this fragrance is too light for me. I like a STRONG perfume. I want the neighbors to smell me when I am at home, and I like to have a personal scent aura when I am at work. Otherwise my day is dull, bleak, and unbearable.

It does have some projection, but it's mostly the lilac, and it's light. I only smell the other notes nose to skin. For someone who likes a pretty skin scent, I recommend you try this one.

For me, I am intrigued enough to try the EDP.",07/04/21 15:21,RainbowGirl

Warm, floral, fruity, and romantic with some freshness to it. I hate patchouli and pink pepper and this is the first fragrance with those notes that I enjoy. I don’t detect them (or they are so well blended they don’t screech at me like they normally do). If you normally steer clear of those notes don’t let that stop you from trying this one. I have never tried the EDP so I can’t say how it compares.",03/23/21 23:12,lauramarie100
Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I haven't ever smelled the original EDT, and it's been a while since I smelled the original EDP so I'm coming to all of this with a fresh nose. This fragrance to me really took me by surprise. I don't usually love powdery scents, but this is so soft and inviting. Very fresh at first, but it become this lovely, comforting, soft cloud. I'm not a fan of sweet scents unless there's something tart to balance it, but this is just soft and every so slightly sweetened by the peach and blackcurrant. I'm not a huge fan of patchouli these days, and thankfully I don't get much of it here. I have not been able to wear any other fragrances since I purchased this a week ago. Just gorgeous!",03/23/21 06:10,carolinelparrish

They have just put the old EdT into a new bottle. Perhaps some details have been altered, but they are not detectable without direct comparison. Overall it smells like the good ol’ Guilty EdT! :)
What I love about Guilty is its versatility - it just fits any occasion, so it makes a great signature scent. It’s not a bold fragrance, but rather simply pretty. Yet, Guilty is still unique and recognizable due to the lilac as its main note, which is rarely found in other designer perfumes. I would sum the scent up as a musky lilac with hints of fruit.",03/14/21 08:09,livprn

So far the hands down best thing about ""The Alchemist's Garden"" is the names.

Cypress never really ends in woody monstrosity like other woods. I don't feel like all the votes for oud-centric things are correct... TF Black Lacquer is dead last in votes but I'd put that way closer to the top.

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"Originally intended by Gucci to be layered with other fragrances, this one can also stand alone.

However... I've layered this with several other perfumes and have found the results to be incredible!

Fragrances that I've layered with this are:

Quir De Russie, L.T. Piver

Ameer Al Oud

Obsession For Men

Chopard

Amouage Jubilation XXV

And believe it or not, Avon's Black Suede.

It's worked BEAUTIFULLY with each... And each has either brought out hidden qualities in the scent, or it's magnified certain aspects of the fragrances that I've mentioned.

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"Smells like my garden, but with a nice pleasant smoke scent, reminds me of the smell from burning garden waste brush wood on the bonfire. Tested on skin and cloth and got different notes. Skin: rosemary / sage opening, which then gave way to the lovely evergreen tree and smoke notes. Cloth: evergreen tree and smoke opening, oddly sweet middle note, dry-down was complex with evergreen, smoke, sweet, and rosemary/sage/palo santo smoke. If I didn't pick up the rosemary at all on the cloth I'd think it was just my skin but it's definitely there-- not rosemary EO, that's a completely different scent, this is rosemary fresh from cutting, with the sap all over my hands. Definitely smells like my garden, even kind of smells like the extracts of my garden fragrance I've made in my kitchen.

It's funny how so many people say it reminds them of witches, because, well... Yes, I do like it. And I do think it would be excellent to wear while setting up my Halloween bonfire next week. I'll probably wear it other times too. It's always witchy around here because well...",10/25/24 18:57,erinlale

Not sure if i have the guts to wear this out in public.",10/23/24 19:46,Rperfume7!
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"A Midnight Stroll isn't as morbid as you may have been lead to believe. Yes it's leathery, smoky, and all of those things you'd expect given the black, lacquered bottle, but there's a spectral sweetness keeping the evil at bay. It is possible for a scent to be simultaneously Halloween appropriate, and wearable. A Midnight Stroll pulls this off well, and it's quite addictive.

While projection and longevity seem light on the surface, I got a much better interpretation after smelling this on a friend. It projects without blasting the room. And that's great, because you really don't want something this Gothic to be loud and brash. Those in the camp of ""fragrances should be discovered not announced"" will be pleased. It drifts off the skin here and there, making it's presence known without throwing haymakers.

Given the notes, I'm not really sure where the aforementioned sweetness is coming from, though I assume it's the incense. While very different, it's perhaps in the realm of Comme des Garcons Zagorsk or Kyoto. Think heavy incense with remnants of vanilla or berries. That being said, I'm gonna file A Midnight Stroll in the Autumn and Winter only cabinet. It may have seasonal limitations, but that's also why it will last you for years. 9/10.",10/20/24 18:59,Yourhumblenarrator
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"Originally got this and it was very, very smokey, to the point of not being able to perceive any other notes. After mellowing for a while, the smoke definitely settles a little and moves out of the way for other notes to be ""heard"".

This one is fairly linear, the opening brings equal parts smoke, incense, and camphor, right from the get-go, while the same chord is played all throughout, the base (bass, heh) fir-needle note, becomes more and more prominent, as the smoke gently fades into a soft, mellow tone. The fragrance is very, very dry (not sweet) and extremely smooth and elegant.

As for how beautiful this scent is? Maximum points. It's addictive, rich and almost intoxicating. When I wore this I felt like I was wearing something sexy, and mysterious. It *screams* autumn. It also just *smells* expensive and like very fine perfumery to me.

Unfortunately, this scent also falls into the category of things that I think smell fantastic, but have very restricted wearability. The total lack of sweetness, and strong smokiness make it very much a limited-context sort of frag. It is also too linear and one-dimensional for my liking. I wish there was more to it; more going on. For the price, I don't think it's too much to ask. But I get it, for what it is - it's unquestionably great. For my personal tastes though, I like something dynamic and complex; again, especially with this price tag.

Conclusion: Fine perfumery, intoxicating, addictive scent, definitely will wear it at times throughout this time of the year, but wish there was more going on in this bottle o' juice. Scent is 9.5/10. Over all 8.5/10.",10/09/24 14:05,Nick-Euphonia

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"Holy shit, you fragrance-huffing lunatics, strap in for a wild fucking ride through the demented nostrils of whoever cooked up this ""A Midnight Stroll"" madness. Gucci, in their infinite wisdom or batshit insanity, has somehow managed to bottle the essence of a midnight bender in Transylvania.

Let's cut through the bullshit, shall we? This isn't your typical eau de whatever-the-fuck. No, no. This is what happens when a coven of witches decides to open an upscale head shop in the seventh circle of Hell.

The incense hits you first, like a face full of smoke from a burning church. It's downright ecclesiastical, I tell you, as if some defrocked priest decided to hotbox the confessional. But wait, there's more, you degenerates!

Just when you think you've got a handle on this olfactory circus, the cade oil saunters in like a leather-daddy at a Mormon picnic. It's smoky, it's raw, it's the kind of scent that makes you want to howl at the moon and sacrifice a small rodent to the gods of hedonism.

And then, like some cosmic joke, the cypress shows up fashionably late to the party. It's as fresh as a midnight skinny dip in a forest lake, assuming that lake is swarming with the ghosts of lumberjacks past.

The real kicker? They put this unholy concoction in a bottle that looks like it was designed by Edgar Allan Poe on a morphine binge. Black as a raven's heart, with a jaguar slapped on it because apparently, we're all secretly furries now.

In conclusion, ""A Midnight Stroll"" is the olfactory equivalent of dancing naked around a bonfire while the bastard children of William S.

To my nose, both fragrances share a similar essence, yet the latter carries a more intense scent signature.

However, there is something else about A Midnight Stroll that makes it even more appealing to me—perhaps it's the smoothness or the way it evokes the magic of a blooming night flower, even though no such flower smells like this.

Side note:

This is in the same vein as ""A City On Fire"" from Imaginary Authors in the opening and ""Fille en Aiguilles"" by Serge Lutens in the dry down. Both are excellent fragrances and I can't get enough of this scent, but I could never justify spending $300 for it.",01/12/24 09:06,Ksj_
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"<<< This is a review of Maison Alhambra The Trail, a clone of Gucci A Midnight Stroll. Posting it here since it doesn't have its own page. The previous one was somehow hidden by the administration (?) without any downvotes. What is your point in doing that? You don't even update the database frequently enough so I could put that review in a proper place. >>>

Maison Alhambra The Trail is a sensorial journey that veers into the realm of the esoteric, bearing an air of elegance that could easily be mislabeled as otherworldly. When sprayed, imagine standing at the edge of an enchanted forest at midnight — a forest laced with smoke, saffron, a touch of gourmand peppery allure, and underpinned by a harmony of medicinal dry oud and leather. There's no barnyard oud here; it's all sophistication, as if the woods were dressed in a tuxedo.

This fragrance embraces you with its addictive opening that might remind you of a forgotten antique shop selling vintage tobacco products — curious, but utterly captivating. Its character is deep, mysterious, and irresistibly sexy.

However, it doesn't take you on multiple twists and turns; its charm lies in its consistency. From its luscious start to its more muted end, it holds its olfactory notes close, slowly fading into a scent reminiscent of ancient sacral rituals. It's consistent, though. It may have a short-lived presence, leaving you in just a few hours, its longevity resides around 2 hours, which then turns to a skin scent, but it leaves an indelible impression. For something so one-dimensional, it makes that dimension incredibly seductive.

In summary, The Trail by Maison Alhambra is a beguiling experience that casts a spell you'll be reluctant to break. Though it doesn't evolve dramatically over its short lifespan, it doesn't need to — the opening alone is a masterclass in perfumery.

With this bottle being so cheap, it's an intimate secret you might be tempted to keep all to yourself.

But important remark is that... smoky rose will delight your nose not at once..
Not at once at all :D
Because... at fist sniff it smells like... no, those who write about some churches, no,
actually this smells exactly like something being burnt out in some village, at some fireside
Therefore the very first notes may be really overwhelming and way resine, even repulsive
But those who wait would be blessed so much! With that delightful gorgeous rose starting
to open from the heart of the composition and it still lasts for a few hours on my skin!

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"One of my favorite incense scents, I find this much more full-bodied and hearty than most of the others, which can lean a little churchy, dry and whispy. Tar like, astringent, smokey and intensely green too. Amazingly I sense something creamy and ""rounded"" in here too, which works well among all the harsh and intense smoke and acidic green. No idea what it could be. Imagine a bit of cold cream in the midst of deep forest air and woodsmoke. Extremely linear, you get what you get in the first five minutes. The name is appropriate too, it really evokes a late-night little walk, perhaps back from a party, or after a big dinner, when you have a couple drinks in you and take big lungfulls of the cool night air, admiring the lights and shadows of the night with your companions, while looking forward to the warmth of home.",11/15/22 12:12,morkant

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"I had to remove my original review because I realized what I had wasn't authentic. So now for the authentic one...
It smells weirdly interesting. Someone described it as emerging at the dawn from the woods after a night of rituals and it's very nicely said. It's extremely woody aromatic with incense and balsamic notes. It's quite enjoyable. It gets a lot better on dry-down. Not sure in what occasion you can pull this off and it's one of those perfumes that whoever likes it would answer ""I don't care"".
It's definitely a niche quality perfume with no boundaries. Also very masculine. Don't think it would be easy for any ladies to pull this off; but, again if you like it, probably you won't care.
Although I really like this, but I can't justify its price tag. For The Voice of The Snake I can but not this as it's not an easy perfume to wear.",06/27/22 21:15,tecfield
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"For its ""simplicity"", as only having three notes, it is paradoxically quite complex. A Midnight Stroll definitely fits the pyramid note.
The incense is dry and smoky, while the cade oil sometimes gives a low but pleasant ""leathery"" vibe, resting on a background of green, dry and earthy notes of cypress.. Very elegant, intense and dark, as if you were walking through a forest at night.
Good longevity, moderate sillage. Very original and exquisitely executed. Great bottle too.",06/15/22 13:16,Josu01

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"Really nice fragrance for lovers of incense and/or marine notes. That's right, marine notes.

Opening is very smokey, not like BBQ grill (what i get from AdP Leather), but a pleasant airy smoke/peat, akin to an islay scotch. As it dries down the smoke disperses/diffuses and becomes lighter, more of the green cypress comes out to play, and perhaps the cade? I honestly don't know what cade smells like. The image above looks the same as juniper, which to me seems to blend with the cypress to greate a green/herbaceous accord.

Drydown stays peaty and airy, which recalls sel marin to my nose, maybe more brine/peat putting it closer to oud minerale from TF. The same feeling gets evoked, but in this it's smoother and better blended, and slightly more dense than sel marin too.

I think it's a great colder-weather alternative to sel marin or oud minerale, and for people who like those 2 I think they'll love this too.",05/02/22 16:04,spiceysauce5
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"This is a very unique and beautiful incensey perfume. The smokiness in the open doesn’t last long and then it becomes very bright and “clean”. It’s very powerful and after an hour or so, I feel suffocated by it. I love the smell, but I can’t describe the note in it that becomes problematic for me. Maybe it’s ambroxan or another synthetic ambergris note. But there’s something that lingers beneath the overall composition that bothers me when I’m wearing it. It’s very thick. I wouldn’t let that deter you from giving this a try as most ppl aren’t bothered by ambroxan. Extremely unique and I understand the “mysterious” descriptions that ppl have said about it. Glad to have it in my collection.",03/03/22 13:49,SANDYDE

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"Immediate church incense that is soon overtaken by the green of the cypress. Then the tar-like smell of the Cade Oil appears. These three main accords actually work very well together, harmoniously, each one appearing and reappearing throughout the journey. So it is not a pure incense fragrance, as the green forest vibe of the cypress and the cade are also prominent. The incense is calming, the cypress is more refreshing and lightens everything up, and the cade oil is stronger and tougher, waking you up. This is more formal and semi-formal for the cooler months. Although the green gives it freshness, so could be okay for warmer months and daytime and the outdoors. (I don't know about the height of summer, though.) Fairly strong projection and longevity. This is good quality and really quite impressive. The name suits it- it conjures up a night out in the city, a light rain falling, out on a special occasion.",12/20/21 02:34,JupiterMoon

A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"First impression/wearing = Smells like a haunted house and storm clouds.
Tarry, gooey, smokey incense, cade and vintage woods. Reminds me of a better version of Kilian Pure Oud without the chemical bonfire.
Very interesting and perfect for October 🌃🎃

Full review: Great fragrance that gives me the impression of something mysterious and perhaps supernatural happening at night.
It's an ethereal almost meditative experience wearing this.

This fragrance is for the first half and almost puts me into a trance. The smokey tar of cade and incense are very well blended with the cypress, although I feel I also pick up nuances of cypriol and dark leather or suede. Additionally, I don't think it contains only cypress as I'm certain I pick up cedar, ebony woods, vetiver and earthy petrichor. Don't be beguiled by the simplistic note tree.

Longevity is fantastic around 10 hours. This is feels very well made and I don't get even the slightest hint of synthetics, although like all fragrances, they are there. Bottle is a work of art and atomizer is pressure sensitive like Penhaligon's portraits series.

It's a deep, bewitching fragrance, that will take you on a journey first deep into the darkness, and return you to the moonlight. 🌙",10/15/21 17:47,The Wolf
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,I get the notes and whatnot but to describe this scent you have to paint a picture. This smells like an evening in the Verona gardens. You're surrounded by iconic statues and and well manicured fragrant green foliage in all sorts of shapes reminiscent of Edward Scissorhand shrubbery. As you sit down and watch the sunset beyond the greenery and divine garden symmetry ou sip a slightly sweet wine as a satyr darts by at the far end of bushery ahead. You know you're in a magical place.,08/12/21 21:42,Art501
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"A Midnight Stroll is one of many excellent fragrances in Gucci's upmarket Alchemist's Garden collection. This fragrance is, as has been noted below, a fairly straightforward leather incense composition, but it is brilliant in its simplicity. Cade and birch tar combine with a spice and incense blend to produce a classic leather accord that smells very high quality (as well it should at this price point) and has good longevity and projection. As the scent reaches its deep drydown, it is grounded by a cedar-esq aromachemical that lingers for a very considerable time on my skin keeping the leathery aroma alive.
This fragrance is simply one of the very best incense-forward scents available today. Whether you, like me, decide that A Midnight Stroll is worth the high asking price is, or course, entirely up to you, but if you do decide to buy this fragrance, you will encounter one of the best presentations out there. The vintage apothecary style bottle with its painted logo is pure class and everything else about the way this product is delivered to the customer, from the box to the atomizer and even the bag (if you get it from Gucci) is clearly intended to make you feel good about parting with the asking price.
I love this fragrance and look forward to the cool weather for which it is best suited so that I can wear it again regularly. The scent is masculine leaning, but could easily be worn by anyone regardless of how they identify. This fragrance is OK for work, but really impressed me as a great choice for an autumn night out.
Try to sample A Midnight Stroll if you can. If you are a fan of leather/incense scents, I bet you'll love it as much as I do.",07/24/21 19:50,Akscent
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"I continue to be seriously impressed by this collection from Gucci, it has no right to be so good. I think I need to give Gucci a break and forgive them for that horrible period they spent in the fragrance wilderness in the late noughties until recently, because before that and since they’ve produced some excellent iconic fragrances. I need to stop typecasting Morillas too as this, ubiquitous, designer freshie, journeyman, because there’s so much more to his repertoire and Midnight stroll is yet another example of that.
This is a Smokey cade/birch tar affair but used affectionately to create a leather accord in the traditional sense. I found it incredibly smooth and deep when smelling for the first time from one of those little bell/closh things on the Gucci counter.
Genuinely a leather type fragrance with a unique look and one I’ve never smelled before. Upon wearing it on skin and experiencing the top notes it actually has even more intrigue in that it has fresh aspects, totally different to the drydown.
I need to wear it properly and I will update this review, but I was even tempted to purchase, even at the outrageous prices Gucci want for this line. I accept that the packaging is beautiful and they are competing with other designer ‘exclusive’ lines of a similar price bracket, but these are still more expensive than Dior & Chanel and I find that hard to get by in the same way I do with Creed or similar brands.",07/11/21 01:19,Houdini4
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"This is the first one I have been blending with others from the collection, 'A Voice of The Snake' and 'Last Days of Summer'. True, it doesn't last all that long, but it is a very good coniferous smoking incense, the Alchemist Garden atomizers spray out a fine prolonged mist so I find myself spraying this one on like a body mist, up and down the arms, my hair, clothing...it is addictive! My wife says she can smell it on me, so I'm guessing the aroma chemicals used are the kind you can easily go anosmic to. If you can get it under $200(got mine $160, tester) Id say its worth it, but I would rather buy something like Mississippi Medicine for a similar experience for much less. I must admit...I am a sucker for these black bottles!My 'A Voice of The Snake' needed a friend on the shelf...and it has a jaguar on it, they really know their market! If your a hopeless lover of incense fragrances like me you will enjoy dousing yourself in it and walk around reeking of smoldering resins",07/02/21 15:59,psychocandy
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"I got a smoky, leathery green scent first on. It got more sharply resinous as the cypress or cade took over, relegating the smoke to a background feel. And then it didn't do anything else. I ended up smelling mostly tar, and a strong note of turpentine. Not loving this one. Disappointingly boring and just not evocative enough for the gorgeous bottle, the amazing title and the rather stiff price point.",05/04/21 16:10,tessture
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"I bought this in Harvey Nichols and when I first smelled it from the bottle I was absolutely bowled over and in love with it, it is absolutely beautiful.

But... and this is an absolute fact it doesn’t last more than half an hour. I can’t smell it on myself I can’t smell it at all and I’m pretty sensitive to perfume it’s just got zero longevity and I was so annoyed by by this that I had paid £250 for it that I told Gucci I wanted my money back and I got it.

Bottom line is whilst it smells absolutely divine it doesn’t last five seconds that’s my opinion.",03/27/21 04:04,missdaynatg
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"Okay, this, to my nose is extremely similar to Bois d'Encens by Giorgio Armani, 90% similar to my nose. AMNS has a bit more sweetness, I’m not sure where the sweetness is coming from, I’m guessing the Cade oil/cypress mixture and I smell a lot of frankincense. It seems as though perfumers are taking known masterpieces, cloning them but putting their own little twist on them and trying to present them as something new. It’s a very nice fragrance but having Bois d'Encens Makes this totally redundant for me. It is a very, very nice fragrance though.",03/16/21 17:01,noseyboysniffy
A Midnight Stroll Gucci,"A Midnight Stroll is my first try of Gucci’s collection The Alchemist’s Garden and is a lovely dark blend of incense, cypress, and cedar, so it fittingly is incense-dominant but leans wood as well. It’s dark and smooth, reminiscent in execution of By Kilian Incense Oud but fittingly with more incense and less oud. It’s not quite as ashy as Profumum Roma Olibanum—which I usually regard as one of the best incense-dominant fragrances in the market—so it’s an even smoother, slightly more mainstream/designer-esque incense-heavy mix that is nonetheless very wearable and fairly enjoyable, without much bite in the opening.

It performs pretty well overall, and in the US, is sold via the Gucci website and the department stores Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom, and its retailing pricing is $330 for 100ml. Also, I usually don’t gawk over bottle design the look of The Alchemist’ Garden’s bottles, most even more colorful than the black of A Midnight Stroll, are lovely.

Overall, A Midnight Stroll is great, and would certainly be made better by a lower price point, so I’d be curious to see if it’s available anywhere on the secondary market, and I’ll have to seek out some others in The Alchemist’s Garden.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"It did not charm after release I thought it something lightweight without much character but I received it as a gift and decided to try it in summer. And it seems a perfect setting for it.
It is gentle but with clear character and very present without being strong or overwhelming.
Perfect for applying it in the early morning before going to the office. It opens refreshingly with zesty bergamot tones that together with lily give a watery bamboo impression.
It is floral at heart, the lilies are gentle and only their best part, ylang mellows the flowers a bit.
It is still a bit heady thanks to lilies but in a sensual, clean way.
It is elegant. Professional. For a lady that does not like nonsense yet won't stand loud scent for her days and still has her feminity intact and wants to enhance it.
It feels a bit aquatic.
Now that I wear it - it feels better on than Gucci's Bloom and Gorgeous Flowers series. Better than many offerings. Better than Acqua di Gioia. It might have competed with it.
Brings to mind elegance of Fan di Fendi and delicacy of Premiere by Gucci which is also a perfect everyday scent for the office. The romantic floral part reminds me a bit of Yohji by Yohji Yamamoto. His flowers also work so subtly but delectably in summer.
But it is also a perfect signature for a romantic, gentle and feminine soul.
It feels fresh on, leaving a gorgeous floral trail.
Romantic evening? Perfect for it.
Now that I have a bottle I am impressed.
There is a need for such scents. Waking us up, dressing in flowers, caressing with base. Calling it a masterpiece is not an overstatement. It is quite dreamy.
If I was to wear it daily, I would be happy. It is this close to a perfect floral.
Oh, it reminds me also of Boss Femme, too. But better.

Anyhoo, I knew i just HAD to have that smell. That perfume. Whatever it was. Throughout the 5 hour wedding I kept getting wafts. It was only until after I came home and was getting changed, I got the wafting of this gorgeous woody spicy, clean sandalwood smell again. The same smell i couldn't detect where it was coming from throughout the whole wedding. It was ME all along. I just fell in love with it after that and was soOo happy that it was me and I had a bottle of it sitting safely at home. It was a gift in case you're wondering why I hadn't discovered what it actually smelt like. I hadn't tried it properly, all I knew was that it was a safe inoffensive scent at first whiff. And i hadnt really worn it anywhere. So.... LOVE THIS. Pesca by Reef smells a lot like this but without the strong ylang ylang note (which a lot of people dislike, but i dont mind it because the dry down is soOo worth waiting for!) And I have a 200 ml bottle of the Pesca Reef, so I am a happy bunny.🐰",06/23/25 13:26,mashuda
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"How good would this be if it actually had bamboo in it?! Bamboo is such a good and under-utilised frag note.

Honestly, this is really good anyway. It's different than all my other scents - it's a mild citrus/green woody vibe even though there's no actual light wood notes in it... Which is kind of crazy and fun to consider.
I don't get any of the warm sandalwood, vanilla or amber in this. The whole fragrance is pretty cold, but in a nice way.
The only notes present that I can correctly identify are white flowers, with unspecified but lovely and well-blended citrus.
I like the white flowers they chose for this, Lily and orange blossom are less popular in fragrances than say jasmine or tuberose - that adds to the uniqueness.

Wearing this makes me feel elegant, sophisticated and unique without being controversial.
I don't reach for it everyday but it's lovely to wear when you're in the right mood.

It's a great job interview perfume! lol. Professional yet memorable.

I disagree with the reviews that call this masculine. It's really feminine, just not little girly feminine. If you love D&G Light Blue and want some variety for another occasion, you may really like this. It's less powerfully tart (and a totally different scent), but you'll probably appreciate the sharp yet well-blended, citrus note.

I also find it surprising that this one is a Gucci scent. No offence intended to people who like Gucci clothes etc, but I don't associate the apparel label with elegant, classy lady 'crisp linens, loafers and no visible logo wearing' vibes like this scent evokes.",06/07/25 19:01,RidiculousDicko

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Don’t let the pink fool you, this is not feminine. Technically it's unisex, but heavily leans masculine, almost cologne-like. The bergamot opening quickly transitions into a clean base. Very Y2K energy. Very white-shirt-and-blazer, ready for a boardroom.

The dry down is sharp and structured, and has more sleek power than delicate. I’d say it wears better on someone who enjoys traditionally masculine-clean profiles. I layered it with Armani The Yulong to pull out a bit more freshness and edge, and it worked well. It added clarity, direction and had a more grounded feel. Not something I’d grab for myself, but for a tailored look, it's fine.",05/10/25 03:14,MetaMystic

First spray when I opened the bottle was VERY citrusy and unpleasant. But after one day it changed and is round and softer. It’s a little nostalgic and yes, someone said it’s 2000 kind of scent and I agree. I enjoy it now that’s spring is coming. Not too strong, but I can smell myself for few hours after spraying. I like it a lot.",05/01/25 05:57,Toromusic2020

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I have tested it in a perfume store, this perfume is citrusy fragrance in the top notes, but this scent fades a way fast, in the middle notes the perfume moves to white flory fragrance, hence, Ylang-Ylang and Orange Blossom were very clear to my nose, in the dry down, this perfume settle on cozy balanced white flory with Sandlewoods and amber fragrance, also a hint of vanilla exist in the background. For my own taste, or from this kind of perfumes, I prefer ""Love Story Chloé"" perfume, I found it more mature with more ingrediants, also more Classy and fiminine perfume, but most of people they are influenced by the ""name of brand"" to buy a perfume.

If you didn't smell this perfume before, I advise that you can blind buy if you interest cozy balanced perfumes without gourmand or a lot of sweety notes, also search on a perfume contains clear amount of white flory with woods and amber. I think this fragrance suitable for sensitive nose people.

This fragrance very suitable to wear it at summer or Spring seasons, It lasts 6-8 hours on leather and one day on clothes.


لقد جربته في متجر للعطور، يتميز هذا العطر برائحة حمضية في النفحات العليا، لكن هذه الرائحة سرعان ما تتلاشى بسرعة، في النوتات الوسطى، يتحول العطر إلى رائحة الزهور البيضاء حيث أن رائحة الإيلنغ إيلنغ وزهر البرتقال كانتا واضحتان جدًا في أنفي. أما في نوتات القاعدة، يستقر العطر على رائحة متوازنة ومريحة من الزهور البيضاء مع نوتة كل من خشب الصندل والعنبر، مع لمسة من الفانيليا في الخلفية. بالنسبة لذوقي الخاص، أو من بين هذا النوع من العطور، أفضل عطر ""لف ستوري من كلوي""، فقد وجدته أكثر نضجًا بمكونات أكثر، كما أنه عطر أكثر أناقة وأنوثة، لكن معظم الناس يتأثرون باسم العلامة التجارية عند شراء العطر.

إذا لم تشمِ هذا العطر من قبل، أنصحك بإمكانك شرائه شراء أعمى إذا كنتِ تستمتعين بالعطور المتوازنة المريحة الخالية من الروائح الشهية أو الكثير من النوتات الحلوة، أو تبحثين أيضًا عن عطر يحتوي على كمية واضحة من الزهور البيضاء مع الأخشاب والعنبر. أعتقد أن هذا العطر مناسب جداً للأشخاص الذين لديهم حساسية في الأنف.

هذا العطر مناسب جدًا لارتدائه في فصلي الصيف أو الربيع، ويدوم لمدة 6-8 ساعات على الجلد ويوم واحد على الملابس.",04/23/25 01:31,Abeer Alatrash
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This could very well be the fragrance that solidifies my distaste of ylang-ylang. At the opening it smelled perfectly fine, but then it turned on me. I'm not sure if it is my body chemistry, or my nose, or perhaps both, but the ylang-ylang was all I could smell after about 30 minutes. I always tend to gravitate towards fragrances that feature all the other notes (both on their own and in combination with one another), so this leaves me with no other conclusion than that ylang-ylang just smells horrible on me.

That being said, if you like ylang-ylang, then this could be the fragrance for you, but it's definitely not for me.",04/06/25 14:14,AubreyNoel

This baby is spring in a bottle. It’s a florally, floral, white flower. I usually like my white flowers creamy or fruity, but this straight up lily for me, but it’s powdery in the dry down, which I love! This has to be one of the least talked about Gucci fragrances, I just happen to come across on clearance on one of the fragrance sites years ago, but it’s my absolute favorite of the house.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"What a lovely perfume for spring! The lily is the star of the composition from start to finish. In my opinion, what elevates Bamboo is a slightly animalic and indolic undertone that adds to the impression of being surrounded by flowers. The sandalwood adds to the creaminess in the drydown, while ambery notes provide gravitas and staying power. Despite the rather intimate sillage after a few hours, I can still smell a powdery residue of the fragrance on my clothes the next day. Surprisingly, even though only created 10 years ago, Bamboo is so different from most of today’s new fragrances and worth trying if you crave a change.",03/21/25 02:15,KöbiD
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I tried this on a paper sample and I fell in love right away, but then there was this odd note I couldn't put my finger on, it must have been a whiff of the ""animalic"" note, but then it luckily and quickly went away. After that it was just beautiful and the dry down is like nothing else I have smelled, just so pure, classic, and somehow nostalgic. I usually don't like vanilla scents, but its not strong here, and very well blended into the dry down, so if it was not shown on the notes I would have never guessed it was there, but it warms the dry down so much, that I would use this as an autumn, winter and evening scent.

I kept smelling the paper all day and fell more and more in love, so I got a bottle. The weird animalic note on paper I don't seem to find on my body chemistry, but somehow it seems more mature when I wear it, compared to on paper, and there's this super weird note in the dry down I cant put my finger on, but its slightly off putting. I can see how it could be a divisive scent.",03/10/25 02:54,locg

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I really liked this one, to be honest. Just after spraying you can really feel the citrusy notes and it dries down into a more of a calm and gentle, flowery-amber scent. Even though I really liked it, I'm quite disappointed by the longevity and sillage. After approximately 30 minutes to an hour of applying it, you can only smell it when you bury your nose into the place you sprayed it on. 💔",02/02/25 07:05,Ieva Jefišova
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This is so masculine that I was surprised it was actually advertised for women. I'd wear it, but that's because I like masculine scents (they bring me comfort)! It is fairly unisex, and I think it's more masculine at first and then settles more unisex later. I could smell on either man or woman and wouldn't bat an eye. You shouldn't be discouraged if you like this perfume just because of the 'intended gender'. I wouldn't have even known had I not read the description.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Update (4.17.2024): My original review was a first impression of a blind-buy, so now that I got to know this fragrance a little better I wanted to give an update. First, I changed my vote from ""ok"" to ""like"". I wasn't impressed at first but since wearing it more I have more respect for the quality of the product. This juice needs the warmth of skin to really perform at it's best. Also, it beautifully develops from a floral opening to a deep and creamy sandalwood dry-down with powdery, warm and sweet nuances. In other words, this fragrance is a lot more complex than it may seem at first. More recent releases aren't really doing that these days so I appreciate that. And the longevity on the skin is out of the this world (over 24 hours!). But it's still a little out of date without being completely old fashioned so my only challenge is wearing it often because it's not suitable for my lifestyle. But if you have more sophistication to your day-to-day lifestyle and want a scent that many people aren't wearing (I'm looking at you Coco Mademoiselle) then this might be for you.

I purchased this fragrance today for a discount at a rack store and here are my first impressions:

Firstly, this is a blind-buy purchase, however I have tested the edt version and I liked that one so I decided to get the edp thinking it wouldn't be that much of a difference.

Well, I was wrong and the two are very different and Gucci Bamboo edp was not what I was expecting.

I was expecting a fresh and modern floral scent with some aquatic nuances and maybe some greenness and woodiness (hence the name bamboo).

Instead, I got a very classic floral scent with some woody undertones and a little bit of brightness up top with a bit of fresh spicy in the base.

And it smells retro but with a modern twist but still classic. I like those types of scents because I find them elegant but I was thrown off by the packaging and appearance of the bottle it just gave a modern vibe.

So, if you do not like straight up floral scents or old school fragrances or spicy scents this may not be for you.

It's also a bit mature leaning and a little more business and elegant than young and playful. So, this one may not be for everyone but I'm happy to have it, although I think I could've lived without. I prefer the edt but this one is ok.",03/27/24 15:02,la.femme.scent

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"“Ewwwwww!” was my initial reaction to trying this for the first time. I’ve had a sample that I never opened. All I can say is thank goodness it was in a dabber and not a spray. But I am mad it is all over my arms and hands!

Gucci Bamboo EDP smells EXACTLY like my grandmother’s cosmetic powders (I am 32 for reference, but that scent is forever tied to my childhood in the ‘90s).

When products used to always look lux and come in hefty ornate frosted glass containers and golden caps. Scented powders with big puffball applicators and a slim ribbon you could slip your fingers through to make applying a breeze. What a time to truly feel like a woman.

As I wear Bamboo EDP longer, I get a bit past the overpowering lily note. I’ve avoided most fragrances with anything lily-involved, as that always seems to bring the smell of a bygone era, that I don’t particularly love to wear at my age, especially surrounded by the sweet-gourmand trends since Baccarat Rouge started reigning King.

The sweeter notes (orange blossom, vanilla) come up to modernize just a smidge.

Now, when I sit with Bamboo EDP for half an hour to an hour minimum, I will be honest, I still smell a vintage fragrance. I would not be surprised if I smelled it blind and was told it was a perfume from the ‘90s.

Maybe if sprayed one time on an older woman, she could pull it off. It’s definitely not one to overspray unless you want to give off that “old lady smell”. I never use that phrase, I find it rude, but for here, it just seems accurate. 😔 I apologize.",01/27/24 20:49,girldeadbug
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Bamboo is a beautiful floral perfume with depth and character. It's not your generic floral. It's versatility makes it appropriate for work and for play. I believe you should wear what you love, no matter the season or time of day. Bamboo is a proven compliment getter, if that's important to you. It's certainly inoffensive, making it perfect for work as well as for play. I prefer niche fragrances, however, Bamboo has a niche quality. It's a safe blind buy in my opinion, as well as an excellent value for what you're getting.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Everytime without fail a man tells me I smell absolutely divine or incredible or just super good. Men love this scent! It really attracts the men like crazy and I know it's because of the musk. I won't wear this for a long time and then all the sudden I pull this out and remember how crazy it makes the men lol Narciso Rodriguez pure musc has a similar effect as well. Im telling you those kind of scents are the best even though they aren't my favorite which would be vanilla based scents that are sweet. This is super underrated and the reactions I recieve are unlike anything else with any of my other perfumes. I always overspray especially on clothing but it does last and project well. I do around 15 sprays and I'm super solid from morning until night. I love musk based scents 💜 so happy I pulled this out today and was reminded how good it is. If you dont want to smell like everyone else then wear this baby and drive the men crazy and wait for their crazy reactions lol

Edit: I owed the edt and now I am half way through the edp. They are super similar while the edt has more citrus in it but the edp definitely lasts longer so I prefer that one. The edt lasts well if you overspray but you have to spray A LOT(like 25 sprays) on clothing for it to last all day but you will leave a sillage. The edp is way more noticeable so just go with that if you care about performance.",12/26/23 20:49,Bondno9girl
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"First impressions (sorta):
This was the best one on paper in perfumania. I finally got a full bottle for Christmas. I have to say if you think that this is going to smell like bamboo you’ll be surely mistaken. I also think people who do not appreciate white florals would be apawled by this for being too indolic for them. I will have to agree it’s a tad bit on the generic side of white florals, no matter. This to me reminds me of Versace Versense -way less crituses, and no fig. +kick up the Lilly and you’ll have this concoction.
Edit 1:
This also gives me Armani my way in a way with the dry down, but more dusty. Or maybe like 212 Carolina Herrera just less hair spray.

At the end I thought it seemed too green for my taste and I also, as others, felt the “pee note”. Overall office suitable daytime scent, nothing bold or interesting.",11/17/23 14:22,vilkel
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Extremely basic, it has that floral Gucci DNA for sure. Too mature for me though. It smells like a fresher, cleaner Gucci Guilty, but I still prefer Guilty over this. Like others have said, the bottle and name doesn't really match the scent... like why bamboo, lol?",11/14/23 11:51,sesi_shikorina
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,It does smell a bit like pee,10/25/23 10:37,yellowdock
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Like others have said, completely underwhelming and basic. But with that said, it’s does smell nice, just nothing special. Has a 90s vibe kinda reminds me of Pleasures. Highschool me would love it but I don’t see an adult wearing this and being taken seriously. I don’t smell the creamy notes much at all, it’s just a slightly sweet floral with no real identity of its own. I can see this being a good layering perfume to soften some sweeter scents.",10/24/23 09:37,Ana's Mia
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"My friend wears this as a signature and it smells great on her, so I was intrigued and got a sample.

On me the lily does initially smell a little indolic (that “pee-like” vibe others have mentioned). However thankfully this wears off quick and it’s mainly a thick ylang-ylang freshened up by bergamot. I really like it, possibly don’t love it as it doesn’t last long on me.

However despite being a bit paranoid about the pee note, I have been complimented on this perfume and my family said they can’t smell that note on me at all (believe me they’d tell me if they did!!!).

This is a lovely one for spring and summer, especially at work, or running errands.",10/22/23 15:18,Scentfrommanna
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"On skin it’s a good first spritz. Fresh notes are there. But then after 3-5 mins, oh my god. Cat pee or a fart. IDK WHY but it smells like fart. Then after 10 mins from the fart smell, it becomes citrusy vanilla musk, which my brain can’t tell if good or bad because I still get the hint of cat pee. Dry down (minus the cat pee) is a bit similar to Armaf CdN Woman.",10/14/23 02:59,danielabalgos
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Wow the cool fall weather has brought this one to life, this is gorgeous now 😍. It's no longer a whisper of a scent, you can smell the spice, the florals and the powder. It's nice, still a nice soft scent just quietly beautiful.",09/27/23 09:52,Gemsense
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"It took months for me to warm up to Gucci Bamboo. At first I felt sort of nothing about it and it spent quite a bit of time on the margins of my collection. I gave it another full honest wearing before moving it into the out box, and that's when I realized how lovely it is. The scent is beautiful. Bamboo is not the knockout who turns heads when she walks into a room; it's the the girl next door who is pretty but becomes gorgeous after you've talked to her a few times and seen her sincerity and goodness up close.

If you like subtlety and discretion, femininity and grace, and are impeccably polite, you may love this perfume. Or if you simply have occasions where you hope to embody those traits, this is the scent for those occasions.

As a former design and marketing professional, I actually think the branding and bottle design don't represent this fragrance super well and that's one reason I think I didn't gel with it at first - I think I was expecting something a little green, a little herbal, maybe spa- or zen-like. The idea of bamboo evokes those things for me - bamboo is a specific object, it's an actual thing you can picture. But what I feel when I wear it is a gentle, very classy, feminine, warm white floral. The bottle shape and design are cool-looking, but it comes across as a little bit aloof with that cold, chrome-colored cap and smoky grey. If I were leading a design update, I would change the cap to a warm, polished nickel, and change the lettering to a creamy white on top of the soft grey glass. This fragrance is not aloof and individual, and not the smell of a spa lobby - it is warm and inviting and soft.

Once I adjusted my expectations, I've grown to really like/love this fragrance!",09/21/23 06:18,barbiegirl
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This one is seriously underrated. Almost no one seems to know about this gem. The bottle is beautiful, the scent is the best ""clean girl"" perfume. Many won't even notice it's an actual perfume, it's discreet in a good way. Suitable for work or situations where you can't wear a really strong perfume. It's completely inoffensive and is never inappropriate. It doesn't matter if you bathe in this, it will never be overpowering. Ever. I feel so clean and super calm and put together when I'm using this. A lot of times I spray this on me and my pillows before I go to bed, it's just relaxing and peaceful. I just purchased my fourth bottle, used up three 75 ml during this year. I don't even like freashies usually, but this one hit home. This is not too citrusy and soapy, it's just beautifully floral. I absolutely love the lily and ylang ylang in this. The absolutely only con to this is that it's very expensive. I mean, I'd get it if it was a powerful scent, but this is a light fresh scent. This price point is close to many different niche brands, which doesn't make any sense to me. I never buy this full price, I get it from like Ebay or something like that for significantly cheaper. I do make sure it's legit of course. But I do think this is such a gem and will keep repurchase this over and over. Highly recommend this hidden gem!",09/01/23 04:42,johanna.lindholm
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Smells floral yes, but to me somehow spicy? Maybe more like fresh (because of the bergamot), and light. Don't get any sandalwood though. I don't tend to get any vanilla or amber, as it most stays at the middle notes for me. Lasts me almost 6 hours on my hijab, and it has a moderate projection. I'd say this reminds me of a mature, slightly more masculine vibe. I wear it usually when I want to feel ""grown up.""",08/31/23 07:53,yayimhere
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This is soo basic and unmemorable all I really get is that lily note which I’m not enjoying in this fragrance. Why did they make such a bland fragrance, with absolutely no kick or nothing to it, it’s such a waste. The funniest thing is that I have a small bottle and it seems suitable for summer but I just couldn’t bring myself to wearing it. It was the last thing I would like to put on. I sprayed it here and there, but I’m not able to make a significant dent so I’ll be parting ways with it.",08/25/23 19:24,Flexwithviv
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"For me, this perfume is unique because it is Elegantly Fresh as ChayChama perfectly described. I went swimming on a late summer's night and then showered and got into PJs. I didn't want a sweet or energising zesty fragrance, I wanted something serene and fresh - this is exactly that. This holds a unique place in my collection for being both elegant and zen.",08/23/23 04:12,Sofifeee
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I'm usually never in the minority who finds something strange off with scents. But this literally does smell like urine to me. Not even just a little bit. Right from the opening, it's like someone who peed themselves tried to cover with fresh floral perfume. I really thought something was off with the sample bottle at first, because no mass-appealing perfume could smell like this. But reading other reviews here, I'm apparently not the only one. The urine smell does dissipate in 2-3 hours, after which this becomes a pleasant sorta mature floral.

I wonder how this happens with designer perfumes. Are mass-market fragrances not tested by a lot of people before they're released? Will the release still go forward if 10% of people think it smells like the person wearing the perfume wet themselves?",08/21/23 10:10,santeripe
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,I could see this working so well on a tropical vacation to a luxury resort. I wish I got more of the woody notes. It is pretty when my mom wears it but it smells like fresh-cut grass & lily on my skin.,08/02/23 13:41,stephm42120
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This is ELEGANTLY FRESH. I am not into summery fragrances in general, as they tend to be generic with common zesty citrusy notes. The bergamot here disappears after few minutes, the Bamboand the Moroccan lily elevates this scent and makes it special yet simple and inoffensive. I receive compliments at my work about it every time I wear it. However, I needed to go heavy on the trigger to get a better sillage.",08/02/23 12:37,ChayChama

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Really nice feminine woody fragrance. Thats the perfect description I feel, because usually woody scents are associated with mens perfume but this is definitely feminine. Its quite a clean scent, perfect to compliment that just showered feeling. The silage isn’t very good and it stays close to the skin. I would say its nice and works for a lot of occasions, but not interesting or anything special.",07/23/23 17:58,ru2
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"i’m very surprised this is described as a basic white floral. At least on my skin, the smell very closely resembles the bamboo i had around my house when i was a child. There is definitely the soft sweet of a white floral, but there is also fresh green citrus that reminds you that you are smelling the stalk, not the bloom. On me, this smell is very literal, as literal as the earl grey in Jo Malone’s earl grey & cucumber.

Though I understand why at first, its just another citrus floral, the dry down is such a nostalgic green smell, and layers perfectly with more aromatic, herbal tea smells. Lovely perfume <3",07/12/23 20:28,luv66
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This is a fresh, airy, citrus yellow-floral. It's lovely, light and a great choice for the summer months, but there's not much to say about it.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"EXOTIC & SPICY Pacific Garden. Opens with multi-faceted bergamot that has citrus, fruity, fresh, aquatic & sweet nuances. The opening transitions to a floral heart of lily and ylang that has plush, succulent, violet, peppery and sour aspects, resting on a vanillic amber-woody base. On the skin, I get faint pencil shaving touches, and the woody notes lean to incense-y wooden church pews. Moderate performance with a small scent bubble for a light, summer wearing experience.

Contrast to Un Air de Samsara Guerlain:
These have very different note structures, but the ylang-sandalwood combo has reminders of the Samsara range, in it's lighter, fresh approach. Un Air de Samsara has green touches and outperforms Gucci Bamboo, although GB will be easier to wear for some, and is more universally appealing.

Contrast to Sira des Indes Jean Patou:
These are different, but there are some similarities with spicy-sour white & yellow florals. Sira des Indes has more animalic touches and ouperforms GB, although GB will be easier to wear for most noses.

Overall: Beautiful summer spicy scent profile, with moderate performance, this is the perfect scent to wear for adding some spice to your summer. I'm a longtime fan of the Samsara range, so t's a love for me. Enjoy!",04/19/23 10:38,suzanne_ronald
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I didn’t know what to expect from this I am surprised at how rich church mom it seems to be. It smells very powdery and like a classic smell that a well off Chanel wearing lady would wear to take care of the toddlers and babies in the church nursery. I’m reaching that age, hmm… I’ll wear this to rock the babies 👶 😇 . It’s a comforting scent, it makes you feel safe and well cared for. Perfect really, if any scent should have been named “Perfect,” it should’ve been this one. Not because the scent is perfect but because the feelings it evokes are just perfect in every way. Life is grand wearing Bamboo. Sorry I can’t pick apart the notes they’re too unfamiliar for me to distinguish between them.",04/18/23 10:30,Gemsense
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I would describe this scent as elegant and crowd-pleasing. The bergamot lends a sparkling opening that acts as a bright counterpoint to the white flowers. For me, the lily takes a backseat to the ylang-ylang, but I know many people find the lily overpowering and unpleasant. It lasts up to 8 hours on my skin and dries down sweet and woody, owing to the vanilla and sandalwood in the base. Though the citrus-white floral scent has been done to death, I still really enjoy Bamboo for its simplicity and freshness. Is it a little bit boring? Maybe. Does it smell like a classy, rich woman on her way to amaze her company's shareholders? Yes.",04/01/23 18:31,emeradora
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This opens really nice with the citrus and then quickly changes to a woody fresh scent. If you like that scent profile, it would be a mass crowd pleaser. Isn't nothing unique. That's nothing remarkable about it. We have seen this done a zillion times. Nothing about it wows you and makes you say, ""Ive GOT to have a bottle of this."" It lasts forever and ever.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This is easy to love ! I actually find it perfect for me. It is not a sugary or sweet scent , and it is a light floral that is not intense. To my nose the lily is beautiful . I find it lasts a long time - I always spray on my clothes to avoid chemicals in my blood stream.

Gucci Bamboo is feminine , understated, elegant and very classy . It has just the right amount of presence and it lingers many hours . It suits a woman who aspires to be polished in any setting , but who does not want her perfume to scream loudly .

I am grateful to have found something that is feminine, not drowning in fruit or sugar and that is so very pretty . I find it to be an excellent value for the quality . Another plus with this fragrance is that it is unique and not worn by everyone around me .",02/01/23 15:03,annxyz

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"If someone needs to find a cheaper clone of this Floyesa ""Ginazzi"" is quite chlose. On me it smells a little animalic and I am wondering if there is some note that is not listed that gives this frag a bit of muskyness? Top bergamot is refreshing and sparkly in this and first spray is very bittery fresh, green and joyful. In the drydown the bergamot vanishes a bit and you get this woodier, white and yellow floral base. It settles into white floral/woodsy smell that someone said reminds them of funerals and I agree. The lily in this is more the ""dirtier"" kind which gives this frag some maturity and some might not like that. It is an office scent for a confident and calm person to me. The amber and animalicness in it makes me think of 90s fragrances and I was surprisen it came out 2015. It has a 90s vibe. It is not overly sweet. If you don't like greener and more animalic frags with heavier base maybe this won't work for you. On my skin it works really well. I have dry combination skin. I get a multifaceted, fresh, a little sexy and mature scent that sits chlose to skin and is inviting but energizing. Sample before buying!

7.5/10 I think it is a bit more unique fresh, clean office scent. I like it and all the different aspects on it. I wish it lasted longer. On me I get 4h.",01/28/23 11:37,Neurotictoc

There is nothing unpleasant about this to me, if it smells mature to your nose maybe you’re just missing the sweetness that usually accompanies frags like this.

Overall it's a very good daytime scent, and personally I'd say it's a pretty safe one. Dunno if I'd buy the full size, but it's slowly growing on me.

UPDATE: This might sound super weird, but - both my sister and I think this is a ""funeral"" fragrance. Similar vibe to Death & Decay by Lush. Sooo incredibly heavy in white florals, with a dash of wood at the base, that it quite honestly smells like attending a funeral service in a room full of flower bouquets and a wooden casket.",11/08/22 13:33,Mira20040313

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I accidentally bought a 75 ml bottle of the EDT first, and I finished it at a record speed (a couple of weeks!!) because it was so weak. I did really enjoy the scent though, so I purchased the EDP version this time around. They are very similar, but the EDP is deeper, has a creamy softness to it and has better projection and longevity than the EDT. The EDT is greener, fresher and more sparkling, but the longevity is crap unfortunately. I do like the EDP a lot, it's really good for daytime wear at work or in the heat when you don't want a lot of perfume. It's really nice and fresh, makes you feel uplifted for sure. It's really floral, and has a warmth to it as well. The bottle is beautiful, really minimalistic and classy looking with the heavy glass and the metal bamboo cap. Looks good on the vanity table. The only thing is that this perfume really is pretty expensive for what it is. I don't imagine me buying this full price, I bought this second hand at a very good price.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"This is a very pretty perfume. Its not sexy, its pretty.
It isn't complex or groundbreaking. However, its very feminine and clean. Not soapy, but rather perfumy. Office appropriate.
I wouldn't say CEO, rather accounting supervisor.
I was horrified in reading the reviews that it smelled like cat urine, as not to say the vulgar word used.
Good grief, that's a little extreme. That must have been some bad bottles that somehow turned idk.
However, my experience is that its a fantastic little fragrance.
I'm incredibly picky. I don't like too floral, or powdery, and this is a fresh bouquet of fresh white flowers with Lily being the star, but not in a bad way. Believe me I easily get nauseous, and this didn't induce a headache.
The opening is my favorite, its a crispy bamboo illusion like, but beautiful Bergamot with department store perfume. I like it.
Its a safe buy, I think. Buy a sample if you're iffy.
All I can say is that the reviews scared me, but I'm glad I bought it because its a very pretty one if you want a quick clean, perfumy scent to run errands.
It lasts a good 8+ hours. I sprayed it this morning, I've showered, am ready for bed and I still smell it a bit.
Hope this helps ツ

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Oh, this is so bad it's actually putrid. To me, it smells like I am wearing a pretty fragrance, then a baby puked on me. i think the sandalwood (a note that I often hate) and the lily may be responsible for wrecking this fragrance for me. Both notes can turn foul for me. I have since learned to not blind buy fragrances with these notes. There are some beautiful components in Bamboo. The bergamot opening is bright, fresh and sweet, but fades very quickly (a couple minutes). Once that fades away the lily really dominates the fragrance and it has that smell of death and decay that lilies sometimes get. It's too bad because the other florals in the background are quite pretty and I like how the amber and vanilla round out the base. They stay light enough to make what could have been an easy to wear, everyday fragrance.

This fragrance is better in the air and on clothes where the lily stays lighter and fresher. This tells me that a lot of my distaste for this fragrance is my body chemistry's fault. I can see how it could be lovely if it behaves better on your skin. Also the nauseating element is more pronounced with a heavier spray and in heat. I could probably tolerate wearing this very lightly and only on my clothes. But I have so many other fragrance I love, I think it's better to find this one another home.

The performance is reasonable for a lighter fragrance. It lasts 4-6 hours with very strong projection for 1-2 hours then stays much closer to the body. I find the sillage much more attractive than how the fragrance smells up close. I find it a feminine, but not girly fragrance. It could almost be unisex.

Although there is no bamboo in this fragrance, it is present in the bottle design. I find the bottle simple and attractibe with the faceted, heavy glass bottle and a cap shaped like a bamboo stalk. Unfortunately the cap fits very loosly on my bottle, I don't know if I just got unlucky or if that is the case with this line.",05/08/22 07:17,takema

When you spray it initially, it can be a little strong, but then it settles on your skin, and it’s not suffocating after that. It does last a lot of time in my clothes and skin, but it’s not really a strong smell, you’d have to actually sniff me to get a whiff of the perfume (that is, unless I wear a lot)
I mostly get the lilies and sandalwood notes from the perfume, and I really like that. It’s really refreshing, and just what I was looking for.

A lot of people mention that it’s “too basic”, but in my case, it actually stands out from what my friends tend to wear (they usually gravitate towards more “sweet” fragrances, and they use a lot of rose scented stuff too). It might be because of my age group, but it really does stand out.
I’ve actually gotten a bunch of compliments on it, including today.
I was in class, and I had just sprayed some of this on after lunch break, and my friend (who was standing next to me) asked if someone had just sprayed perfume because it smelled nice.
When I mentioned it was me, she said it was a really good smelling perfume lol",05/06/22 10:11,honey_eyed

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"First of all is it strange that im commenting and reviewing ladies perfume? i guess not when you are enthusiastic about scents : ) while everything and anything is subjective this is my take on this one and right of the bat i Dislike it....
Ok the name is Bamboo its written right there so i expect there be a bamboo note like D&G light blue femme or MB Starwalker but nope its just a name ,... and now a bit of detail , upon first spray there is bergamot , O/blossom with underlying hint of Ylang^2 , the bergamot is just gone in seconds, i ask myself was it really there? this part is cool floral and sweet after a white i can detect hints of lily but its overpowered by the O/blossom note this part remind me of lady million , then after couple of hours there is a soft sandal woody mildly ambery sweetness at the base probably with white musk galaxolide , still reminds me of LM and thats that , i wonder why ladies perfume should be this bland and simple but tbh there might be a problem with my nose or either with my skin i assume !! anyways what i stated is what i get with this one , i think for what it offers it's over priced , longevity is meh ok-ish (im testing a 75ml edp 2016 version,... and no its my sister's;) projection....!!! its non existence what are U talking about , nice bottle though in conclusion dont even bother with Gucci Bamboo its a waste",03/31/22 17:59,Dead Memories
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"A grown-up elegant perfume, perfect for spring and summer! A very ""easy grab"" kind of scent. The lily and ylang together creates a beautiful ""tropical"" smell. I imagine this would layer very nicely with a coconut scent or body butter! It can seem a bit heavy in the initial spray, but after 10-15 minutes it's beautiful. It's actually quite light.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I'm just beginning my perfume journey but I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that designer fragrances although beautiful are incomplete concepts. Layering fragrances isn't a choice, it's a necessity. This one is a perfect example. At first spray, a full-bodied, juicy note entices me and makes me want to keep smelling the journey of this scent. Its a quick turn around thereafter because the lingering pungent ""pee"" note I heard of and thought I was going to be able to surpass lingers long. I've made up my mind to keep all my fragrances for at least one calendar year so I get creative at night and experiment with fragrance combinations I don't like on their own (with many fails in between).

I am so enamored with the opening of Gucci Bamboo. I am glad layering it with Valentino Donna's cosmetic/powdery scent seems to do the trick of keeping that urine note at bay. Not a perfect match but they really help bring out notes in each other that makes me appreciate them more together than on thier own.",01/03/22 23:26,ScentBliss555

I thought this was intended, and went back to check the notes, to figure out what gives me this impression. Didn’t find the note who is to blame for this.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Versatile and unique (yes really) beauty!

My second review for this, that’s how much I love it! Still love it years later. So underrated. She gets called generic but at the same time there is noting actually similar in the ‘reminds me of’ section apart from the other iterations. This is like an updated Pure Poison with added Ylang and vanilla. The scents aren’t similar apart from the white floral-citrus-musk aspects but the effect is similar. It will envelop you in a soft scent-bubble of attractive feminine goodness. People (especially men!) will think you smell so good, and wonder if it’s your shampoo or laundry detergent. Lasts the entire day with perceptible sillage.

This would make a great gift, layers well with any vanilla, great pick for both dates and work, and is suitable for most weather conditions. Very versatile. Get the EDP, the EDT is just a weak impression lacking depth and creaminess.

There are rumors of this getting discontinued but the big retailers still carry it. I got backups but I hope they won’t actually discontinue it.",11/28/21 01:20,Scentedalterego

It smells of freshly printed dollar bills. I just wish the lily was toned down.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"(29 F. Combination skin, leaning toward oily).

I have been sampling some fragrances for the summer, including Gucci Bamboo EDP.
I was pleasantly surprised by how this turned out. Opening notes are definitely citrus, but dries down to a white-flower (as many have pointed out). Not a fan of citrus scents in general, but love bergamot, so it hasn't bothered me that much. I can pick up on the sandalwood, and a little of the ylang ylang, lily and orange blossom.

I agree with FiligreeAngel that it is on the weak side (longevity, and silage-wise), but that makes it perfect for the summer. And, for someone whose skin is prone to projecting perfumes quite strongly, this is a bonus. Plus, it is one of those linear scents that can be layered, and I have been doing just that!",06/28/21 22:04,Junej
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Gucci Bamboo is one of my favorite low-maintenance perfumes. By that I mean I don't really give it much thought day-to-day, but when I wear it I always enjoy how I smell. It's incredibly underrated as a well-blended white floral that can be worn year round and for any occasion. I can see why it's overlooked - there is nothing loud about it nor is it full of trendy notes, but I think it's such a beautiful fragrance. It smells so lovely in general, but especially on my skin. My only gripe is I hate how Bamboo doesn't come in a 3.4 oz size....2.5 oz is some BS. Currently I own a rollerball, when I use it up I hope to buy a large bottle. I have a feeling this fragrance will be discontinued/phased out within the next few years which is upsetting to think about, but I think Bamboo is a really unique composition of these notes.

To me it smells like three different people were given the same ingredients but they combined them in different amounts. I like them all but don’t see myself reaching for any of them this summer.

I mean, judging by the notes listed it could be just very simple, but I've smelled other perfumes with the same amount of notes or less listed that smell more complex and nice than this. It needs something more to elevate it. The bottle is nice and I appreciate having this.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Bamboo is a white floral of purity, simplicity and elegance. But, it takes a bit of working out. There's more to Bamboo than first impressions.

I have an olive skin, and on it lily, ylang-ylang, orange blossom and amber find their full expression. The sandalwood and vanilla convene to balance out the florals to effect a 'green' airiness, a powdery softness and crisp freshness of hotel bed sheets. Bamboo projects unobtrusively but does at least last many hours on me even in the warmest of weather.

If you've ever been to Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II on the north side of the Piazza del Duomo, this is the scent of the forty-something exquisitely attired lady who helps you choose your €300 cashmere jumper inside the noiseless, deeply carpeted, more exclusive boutique. Everything about her is a projection of understated Milanese sophistication and eunoia. Patrons seeking her poise can't quite replicate it. Part of her intangible allure is her scent, which is entirely in step with her patrician beauty – just in an understated Miss Moneypenny kind of way. Bamboo is her scent.

I have always loved Gucci scents. Something about them marks them out. Others notice when I wear them too. Bamboo is versatile: a perfectly good choice for daytime and evening. For all its simplicity it doesn't stray from the Gucci ethos, and it is actually my favourite from the house since their outstanding and much missed 2002 Eau de Parfum.

A brief mention of the bottle: a sturdy and pleasingly faceted flacon with good heft and a stylish stopper. A distinguished combination that would grace any dresser. 💚🤍❤️",06/05/21 06:05,Pamilo
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"To my nose this smells almost exactly like honeysuckle in the late afternoon of a hot day.
General description:
I get white flowers blended really well with something citrusy and spicy (the spice is barely noticeable to me but enough to make things interesting, like fresh cut flower stems) and something slightly sweet in the background which I'm guessing is the amber because it doesnt smell vanillic at all.It doesnt smell artificial at all which I really like.
A little timeline of the scent progression:
Upon spraying, I sometimes get a sharp jasmine note which thankfully goes away after a minute, and then I get lovely orange blossom and white lilly. After about half an hour it gets a bit sweeter and spicier and it really does smell like honeysuckle. Thankfully, it stays that way until it disappears from the skin.
Longevity:
It stays for about five hours on me. So far it seems to be on par with most white floral dominant fragrances that ive worn. These notes don't stay a very long time on my skin and I'm used to it so I reapply.
Projection:
It sits kinda close to the skin, but it doesn't go unnoticed if someone is sitting right next to me. I am satisfied with it, because I like discreet scents that dont make others notice you because of them.

In conclusion:
I have to say that this is a little bit generic and I dont think it would jump out to anyone but it is so lovely. A very inoffensive spring and summer scent that I could easily wear every single day and still find interesting.",05/20/21 07:58,basicbae

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I read so many reviews that this was youthful, fresh and light that I expected an aquatic citrusy fresh floral. It doesn’t smell like that to be at all. I was put off initially by how warm, powdery, and soapy it was to me. I kept giving it a chance and now that I’ve let go of my expectations I find it quite nice. I would describe it as a warm white floral. The initial spray is very different from the dry down but it’s because of that bergamot and it fades within minutes. Then I really get the flowers, sandalwood, vanilla and amber. It’s hard to pick up one note because it is very well blended, but I do think they are all there in the dry down, minus the bergamot. It is a comforting, feminine, sophisticated. I don’t find it youthful, I think girls will find this too “mature,” however, it isn’t old fashioned.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I'm surprised I didn't care much for this because I'm usually a fan of white floral fragrances and the white floral in Bamboo is very apparent. I thought it was pleasant at first. It starts off like a typical white floral, I could easily pick up on the orange blossom and a bit of the lily. It has a fresh, green opening that I think could be partly due to the bergamot but it doesn't smell very obviously citrus-y or fruity to me. The vanilla and amber are there in the beginning but they come out more as it dries down as does the sandalwood which remains pretty quiet until the fragrance has some time to settle. Bamboo gets less sweet and starts to smell a bit soapy the longer it sits. All that is fine, but the primary reason I find this fragrance to be just OK is that as it dries down, there comes a sharp, way-too-much-pepper note that coupled with the sweetness fading makes this too piercing and not soft and fresh like I wanted this fragrance to be.

I also found the strength to be rather low and doesn't project very well. It also faded pretty quickly too. OrientalVanillaGourmand mentioned it might be discontinued. It's definitely no longer on the Gucci website, but if it was discontinued I'm not all that surprised. I wanted a lot more from this scent and I didn't get it.",04/08/21 18:24,Phemia

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I love this so much! It is elegant and classy. It smells expensive. It doesn't crowd the room or choke anyone being overpowering, but it IS there, and I like that perfect balance. It is sexy and mature. Capable and focused. It conjures images of people perfecting their talents and snatching success that awaits them. Like, you know how Marylin Monroe was asked what she wears to sleep, and instead of saying 'nothing', she said Chanel No5? At first I thought maybe she said that to tactfully NOT say she slept naked, but with this perfume and my attachment to it, I can understand how her mind identified it as something she actually wears. I feel like it IS an accessory in a way that I really could just wear this to bed and still feel like I'm accessorized. I'm wearing something that makes me feel beautiful and confident, so if I want to dress up or wear jeans and a sweatshirt, I put this on either way and still feel like I am the expensive investment and not the clothes. Maybe that's when you know you've got your signature scent; when you find the scent that makes you feel like YOU and comfortable in your own skin. The ylang-ylang is intimate and enticing, and I think that and the vanilla is what gives it the sex appeal. The sandalwood grounds it nicely as the citrus pulls it all up from sinking too dark and brightens it just enough. I think the lily must be what is solidifying it as a definite feminine scent. This is my signature scent, and though I can still easily get it, Gucci isn't selling it on their site, and when I contacted them they said they don't know if they have plans to make more but didn't want to flat out say that they discontinued it, so that makes me nervous. It will be very hard to find a replacement, so I'm hoping they are just coasting until they sell what's in stock before making more.",03/19/21 08:45,Billysniffs
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"I have not written many reviews, but here is my experience wearing Gucci Bamboo eau de parfum to work for the first time (which was today). I am a female auto parts sale rep, so I work with about 30 men and I also visit (service/sales) over 100 more men throughout my work week - therefore, I do not wear flowery floral perfume to work. I typically wear Liquid Cashmere Black (Donna Karan), sometimes Mon Guerlain, and Black Opium once in a while. But today was the first time I spritzed on Bamboo for work. The temperature reached mid to high 50s, with a breeze, and a tad bit of moisture in the air from melting snow and a faint mist like it might rain later. One of the shops had just opened the large overhead bay door when I walked in. One of the 2 main head technicians said to me, ""Wow! Doesn't the air smell so much nicer for change. Spring must be almost here."" Then a few minutes later, as walked past him, he commented that the fresh spring air was actually the scent trailing from me. I had perceived it as a skin scent on myself. But others could pick up on the light, refreshing, spring-like fragrance. It is not a strong, nor overpowering, perfume. It's a light, fresh, clean, smooth citrus (not sharp) with a soft floral hidden in the background. Maybe a faint touch of green vibe. I get no powdery vibe from it. And definitely no animalistic scent. I also do not detect any woodiness.",03/10/21 15:33,Cheribomb

It is a unique scent that starts with a pleasing bergamot that turns to a lovely white floral scent that trails through the air pleasing your senses . It caught my husband attention when he hugged me and i was told just how yummy I smelled to him.
Winds down to a nice vanilla amber scent that is long lasting with a good sillage. When I woke up the next morning I could still smell it on me.

White silky woody powder floral freshen up by tangy bergamot on top, it’s have this cosmetic vibe to it maybe that’s the shampoo things people talk about but I like it
Not sure how to put it, this perfume for me feels professionally pretty like imagine what a strong, refined, white shirt, grey pencil skirt and suit person probably wear but if wear this dress down formal casual style wouldn’t be too far fetched.
This seems to work really nicely on a cool spring days, those day where the sunlight is warm fuzzy but the air is cool enough for you to not sweat type days however I can see the potential for this to turn sour so testing it first would be great.

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Gucci Bamboo EDP is beautiful on my skin. I actually blind bought it as a gift for a friend who loves this type of perfume to wear to work, but I fell in love with it. I find this perfume uplifting, light, clean, sophisticated, classy and fresh. Bergamot is the strongest note, with its naturally sweet refreshintg scent . I'm not a big fan of orange blossom, but it's not so noticeable here. The florals are well blended, softly melding together into a more green than sweet blend. The sandalwood is gentle and calming. A bitter animalic amber emerges after the first 2 hours, but thankfully, it's not too intense, and serves only to give this delicate fresh scent its longevity. Gucci Bamboo EDP projects about a foot for an hour, then clings close to skin for another 4 hours. Non offensive, fresh clean scent perfect for office. Leans feminine, but could easily be unisex. I love it !",02/25/21 06:47,joliecat

It smells incredibly clean with hints of citrus. Very classy.
It's generic, non-descript really, clean, inoffensive, popular girl kind of fragrance but that is it's appeal!",02/24/21 12:09,dorotaloveslifexoxo
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,it’s a blind buy based on notes and reviews and I hate it on me. The ylang ylang and animalic notes are dominant. The reviews are pretty positive. Maybe it will blossom in the summer heat as recommended.,02/18/21 20:42,Golden Butterfly

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Sometimes when reading reviews on hear I wonder if some of the people have actually smelled the perfumes, the opinions are so diverse. Take this for example, Bamboo is sweet, with warmth and sophistication. White florals with gentle vanilla and sandalwood dry down, a silk shirt worn over a strong toned tanned body. A perfume for every occasion. Simple classic and ultimately female, not the least bit bathroom cleaner, or harsh or granny. We are all entitled to an opinion but let's make sure were not just venting here, people read these reviews before committing to spending money, we owe them our honesty folks.",01/25/21 11:03,Lucritia darke
Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"Pretty nice Gucci-style perfume. Very uniform, not bright, rather grayish and complex, there is a little cotton sweetness, for me it really smells a little of some kind of bamboo and bitter medicinal herbs.
Sagebrush, liquorice root, pond, moss and tree bark.
After woody-bitter aroma goes sweetness, as if you are drinking a concentrated decoction of wormwood and licorice. Strict and formal, but not luscious or simple. The perfume is more for winter-autumn, very persistent like all gucci perfumes. In my opinion good and very rare scent.",01/21/21 01:07,Bgm_1923

Excellent sillage (the only fragrance I have where someone stopped me in the hall and asked what I am wearing). It works with me, and when I first smelled it in 2015 in Heathrow, it just made me smile. It is satisfying and was vaguely familiar... evocative of some dreamy yesterdays that I can't quite pinpoint. Bamboo takes all of the easy beauty of a ""shampoo scent"" and elevates it to a perfume that would be a charming, clean, professional, likable signature scent.",01/16/21 18:11,agp293

Gucci Bamboo Gucci,"The sales assistant sprayed some of the Bamboo EDT on a paper, and although I did not appreciate the opening, I did enjoy the way Bamboo EDT develops. The sales assistant asked if I would like EDP or EDT. The little devil in my head reminded me how I've tried EDP before, and how it smelled similar to Voulez Vous Coucher Avec Moi by Kilian, and how beautiful the ylang was. I've decided to go for the EDP although it was the EDT I tested on that day.
It is not that I actually regret having EDP instead of EDT - but I think I would have enjoyed the EDT more. It has a bright and sheer citrus kick in it that makes those florals bloom. The EDP is more tamed, perhaps longer lasting, but more tame, more of a skin scent. If you enjoy non complicated classic florals with a modern take you will enjoy Bamboo EDP. If you would like a more sparkling scent, go for EDT.",01/05/21 09:17,bel.gravia

It gives you that pencil shaving scent with a hint of spice. So nice for fall. I am a female and I love it but I would imagine this being more for men but it isn’t masculine at all just very woodsy.

Love At Your Darkest Gucci,"The name and description suggest darkness, but it's a dry, astringently peppery, light wearing fragrance. Sheer, almost transparent black pepper opening, linear dry down and base of elemi and cedar.

Not a chemical, ""cologne"" or ""perfume"" smell, but one of true and natural cedarwood. Simple and straight forward, but very high quality.

An awesome minimalist woody fragrance or one that would be great for layering.

Initially an intense sweet dark wood, kinda reminiscent of patchouli, but it quickly reveals itself to be a pleasant peppery cedar, and later dries down to a subtle smoky incense wood.

Love At Your Darkest Gucci,"This smells really beautiful. It’s a whisper of a perfume. It’s so intimate and fleeting and expensive though that I cannot imagine purchasing more than the sample size I have. It’s unfortunate, if there was more than an hour longevity, I would consider it, because even though it’s intimate sillage, if it were too strong I don’t think I would appreciate it as much as I do. Anyway, it’s warm and spicy and resinous. It’s a very straightforward perfume, but smells expensive. As this is from the Alchemist’s Garden line, and I have several samples, I’m going to play around with layering this one and hope that I can create something beautiful, as also happens when you layer The Voice of the Snake and The Eyes of the Tiger.

ETA: so I layered this with Tears for the Moon and damn, they are great together. I’m starting to really like the intimacy of these perfumes. They are special, for you only, or anyone special enough to get up close to you. These 2 together just made my skin smell so clean and beautiful. It still didn’t last long, but I really enjoyed it while it lasted.",11/09/23 14:28,cgaleb

Love At Your Darkest Gucci,"I tried this today at the boutique and I can explain this one pretty easily. Take Tom Ford Oud Wood and dilute it with 50% water and you have Love at your darkest. Alberto Morillas mailed this one in, and the executives at Gucci who gave the okay for this, did the same.

I got about 30 minutes of performance before it completely disappeared from my skin. This is only my first impression so take it for what it's worth. It was a hot day so I only put on two sprays. Maybe I should have put on 7 or 8 sprays instead but regardless, this should be stronger and more present at this price point.",07/24/22 20:37,The Wolf
Love At Your Darkest Gucci,"Love At Your Darkest is a beautiful presentation of black pepper.

Fresh, spicy pepper shine from the the first second, woodied up with a soft and musky cedar note, possibly the best cedar note I've smelled. The cedar's warmth counters the pepper's freshness beautifully. The olibanum is not overt and it exists to shape the woody spicy facets of the 2 former notes.

Fresh spicy, pepper, musky, lightly-woody, clean, and slightly-soapy

There is definitely more at play than these 3 notes. There is obvious soft, fuzzy, and soapy-clean white musk here. There is, also, a lightly green and slightly sweet green earthy note, very reminiscent of a minuscule amount of patchouli. Yet, it could be just the combination of cedar wood and olibanum.

LAYD (lol) is a beautiful clean, fresh spicy scent with some warmth. Lovers of pepper and cedar wood would surely enjoy this. However, at its exorbitant price, LAYD is just another severely overpriced Gucci product, especially with its very poor sillage.

The fragrance LAYD reminds of the most is Versace Pour Homme Oud Noir, but lighter. Also, there is faint resemblance to Issey Miyake Nuit d'Issey, Tom Ford Oud Wood (the cedar wood), and Davidoff Hot Water Night & Amouage Journey Man (the pepper).

Unisex leans masculine, mild-to-cool weather wear.

Very ""Likeable"" but the price is a repellent, and the performance doesn't help.",05/30/22 20:03,AMajeedQT

Love At Your Darkest Gucci,"A nice light and fresh incense fragrance. Very much a designer fragrance as opposed to a niche fragrance. This isn’t a heavy-hitter, but more of a Jo Malone-style fragrance. It’s good but definitely not worth the price if you are on any budget whatsoever. I was surprised at first that Gucci would release an incense fragrance in a white bottle, but I get it now.

Edit: The performance is some of the worst I have ever come across in my life, and that includes neroli fragrances. I am genuinely curious if Gucci messed up their batches and if they will have to pull this from the shelves. For the 15 minutes that I can barely smell it, it smells like the incense note from Bleu de Chanel isolated.

Couple of years ago I saw this discounted (I'm a bargain hoarder) and snatched it even though there was no tester.
To be perfectly honest I haven't worn it much, but I do crave it in certain occasions. I find it quite different from the original, it's more strict, almost metallic in a way. It's performance is also quite different, it's very present, very much in your face and loud, almost in ways that powerhouses of the eighties or early nineties were, yet it does lack complexity, but still manages not to smell cheap. I really love the lilac in this, I guess it must be the note that I associate with cold and metallic bells ringing in my head.

It's fresh spicy, warm, earthy, woody goodness. Iris and soft leather is making it just so much more interesting. It has a gazillion notes in it and if you try to guess them by smelling it, you will be lost in an ocean of beautiful notes.

Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"Smells very natural and high quality.
A classic gentleman's fragrance, but considering when it was released projection and longevity are pretty crap.
Have two bottles, one is a travel spray in brown plastic (that looks surprisingly tacky for Gucci) and the other, a glass bottle, has condensed, oily accretions around the spray and rim, which happens with a lot of old fragrances, and the congealed gloop is almost like an extrait, a concentrated version of this fragrance that more closely resembles what I would have expected.
Although pleasant, the fragrance itself is very linear and doesn't smell very Italian.
Totally different to fragrances like Lancetti, Romeo Gigli, Fendi Uomo, which (to my mind) embody the heritage and traditions of Italian perfumery.
Considering the legendary, cult status of its 2003 successor and namesake, along with the other Tom Ford era Gucci fragrances, especially Envy for Men and Rush for Men, this seems singularly uninspired and conservative. Boring even.",08/26/21 20:55,rowan.walters
Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"I have been wearing this fragrance since 1979. These days I nurse my last bottle since it is virtually irreplaceable. I will not pay the ridiculous prices asked for sealed box bottles of this or any of the other ""Guccicorns"".

This is a great aromatic fougere and one of the best of its era. In its day, there was nothing remarkable about the ingredients in this scent, although these days, many of them are virtually unavailable. The net effect of the way the ingredients work together is to create a very French version of an Italian scent. As such, the fragrance opening is somewhat spicy with citrus notes as you'd expect in a fougere. The lavender is there, but it is faint. Later, before the oakmoss, slightly animalic leather and musk (unabashedly real musk) in the base notes arrive, there is an unusual camphorous note that is medicinal but soapy at the same time. I have always thought that this note might be a hint of natural oud. Perhaps it is just caused by the way that the various spices, geranium and patchouli work together. In any event, this note, transient as it is, has always been what made this fragrance better than the scores of other aromatic fougeres that came out in the mid-1970s through the early 1980s.

All-in-all, this fragrance is masterfully structured and compounded. The fragrance is both a bit dirty and beautifully risque (the French part) and also a soapy, clean gentleman's scent with clean florals and sparkling citrus (the Italian part). I love it.",04/23/21 00:36,Akscent

I first noticed this fragrance somewhere around 89-90 by a ""Sebamed"" soap free cleansing bar (light green color) which I bought because it was soap and alkaline free and etc. They still produce the same soap, but I don't know it smells the same. If I see it somewhere, I would like to give it a snif. I was crazy about the scent and I was thinking why they use such a nice fragrance on a soap, but don't make a fragrance of it. One or two year later by a chance I met with this ""Gucci Pour Homme"" in a drugstore. I couldn't believe my nose that this was the same fragrance. It was the only bottle and I bought it immediately. After that I have searched everywhere for a second bottle, but I was never able to find one. I still have the same bottle. Almost the 2/3 of it is used. I keep it in a cool dark place and it smells almost the same. Time to time I use it. I notice that the top notes are bit changed, but the middle and the base notes are still the same. After the top notes are gone it smells still fresh as before. I wonder if there is another fragrance which smells like this one. Iceberg which is mentioned above here is not the copy cat of it.

Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"I'm so excited I can barely contain myself. SO, I've been knocking myself out trying to find the HOLY GRAIL because seriously . . . with 199 specimens I'm out of shelf space. I just blind bought a vintage Chanel Egoiste and also it's flanker, Cologne Concentree for a steep but respectable price. I thought I may have hit the jackpot with these but, although they're very nice, they aren't the end all in men's perfumes.

Well, I was surfing for cologne bargains just now and stumbled upon a little vintage-mementos site; quirkyfinds - there, in the clearance section, I see a tall, clear, 8 oz. bottle of Gucci Pour Homme 90° (Ninety Degree) EAU DE PARFUM by Gucci filled half-full with a dark amber liquid. So I get to searching and come right away to this page and see the picture which is only similar.

The perfume I was looking for is in a tall, clear, square, rectangle bottle with a brass metal cap. On the front, near
the top is the Gucci crest and below are the words:

GUCCI

In the center:
eau de parfum

Beneath that:
The green, yellow and green horizontal stripes. (no center buckle)

At the bottom:
8 FL OZ _____ 90° _____ ml 240

I have found no other information about this vintage but I think I struck the mother-lode with this and for only . . . $42.63 w/tax & shipping for 4 OZ!
Gucci Pour Homme - 90 degree EDP (1976) My 200th bottle!

I'll keep y'all updated.

1st update - 40 y.o. G.P.H. received and it hasn't soured one bit. At first splash it's a bit reminiscent of Aramis 900 and also
Chanel #5. But quite puts them both to shame, it's that good. It's manly, masculine, classy and bold.
For men only - Soy boys need not apply!

2nd update - it's a powerhouse of projection & longevity. It takes several hours to dry down to its sublime birthday suit. This is beautiful stuff. It may very well be the pinnacle, the zenith, the apex, the holy grail . . . you get the picture.

3rd update - This ambrosia is 4 oz. in an 8 oz. splash bottle so when you dab it on it's pretty much in your face when you've applied enough to start smelling it waft into your nostrils.

I was pretty sure that I wanted more precise performance than a splash bottle gives so I thought about diluting it with 190 proof grain alcohol and maybe a dollop or two of Jojoba oil for good measure.

So I started reading up on ways to do that and found several opinions, both here and at basenotes, which I thought were pretty lame for the most part. So I bought an 8 oz. perfume atomizer-bottle from Amazon (best price there) and I went with my initial thought. I said a prayer and then poured about a third of an oz (I eyeballed it) of the oil in. Then, with a funnel, I poured in approx. 2 oz. of the Everclear. Then I topped it all off with the 4 oz. of Gucci Pour Homme - 90 Degree EDP (1976)

Voila, this is perfection! I can now spray fine mists, just as you'd expect, and this stuff is actually going into the dry-down much sooner. Oh, my wife just looked into the room and made eye contact with me, and with her forefinger, and a big smile, she made that Follow Me gesture. See ya'll later :)",02/16/19 17:00,mardabo

Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"I would wear this in 1986. It is a spicy leathery note, and with a top note of citrus. Quite remarkable as it does encapsulate the era of 80s. Many fragrances tried Gucci approach, Quorum, Sybaris, Halston, YSLPour Homme, Eau Sauvage. This was in the days of Porsche 911's loads of money, the first mobile phone, and when people going for a curry was good for taking the mick out of the poor waiter, and builders vans would go past any brown skin person saying ""oi Abdul go back home"" then they would pile into the Rise of the Raj drink Skol Lager and order egg and chips. For me this was sitting in the back of the biology class, whilst listening to Grand Master flash while Mrs Jordan with her pale skin and dyed brown hair with white roots, wearing a lime green dress would say there is a locust missing and the guy called Randolph later to be committed to a mental institution for a string of offences and molesting children and rape,would be toasting the locust on the end of a compass on the bunsen burner. Yet I think every time she smelt it she would accuse me of day dreaming and call me to the front to sit next to her. Years later I met her and I said why did you do that, I was well behaved, and she said yet but you smelt so nice. In a group of teenage spotty kids, you smelt like a man would smell. It was really nice as I would always wear YSL, pour Homme, Aramis, but when I wore this, she would just say come and sit near my desk your not paying attention. She would often say right 30 mins detention for you. I was perplexed as I had not killed any locusts! No locusts were hurt during the write up of this review, only the fact as my school reports say, must pay more attention! It was sad when Gucci discontinued this fragrance. Even applying it to your skin it felt luxurious.",04/02/17 10:54,Escoteric
Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"Gucci Original is an absolute classic and the fact it is no longer available is just WRONG! Imagine if Aramis, Polo, Tabu, Joy or Chanel No. 5 were to cease to exist --- or if a classic piece of music were to disappear from the earth --- or if one of Shakespeare's plays could no longer be seen. Each represents a loss of a vital piece of human culture and imagination.

H & R's Fragrance Guide lists the notes as:

TOP: Bergamot, Lavender, Basil, Artemisia, Petitgrain, Lemon
MIDDLE: Geranium, Carnation, Patchouli, Jasmin, Orris, Pepper, Pimento Berry, Sandalwood, Cedarwood
BASE: Moss, Tonka, Musk, Vanilla, Labdanum, Amber, Leather

This fragrance is a near-perfect balance of fresh, wood, leather, and mellow notes … strong enough to be assertive, but not overpowering, and sophisticated with an undertone of rawness. It lasts many hours, but stays close to the skin, so it's not an ""in-your-face"" all day scent bomb like some more recent creations. It's not only a perfect representative of 70's class, it's a timeless statement, and I still get compliments when I wear it nowadays.",07/12/16 10:28,Mysticman

Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"OMG......this fragrance is ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!!
I agree that there's never too much elegance which is an excellent way to describe this frag. Gucci pour homme and Noble are the pillars of Gucci's early success creating two amazing men's fragrance's.
The open notes of this luxurious frag is a hint of bergamot, lavender, sandalwood and a refined mixture of spices.
The heart of this frag is the aromatic and masculine scent coming from leather, cedar wood as well a warm/sweet scent of amber and musk.
After this frag settles you can pickup all the subtle floral notes of jasmine, iris and french labdanum making this juice very desirable hands down.
Having worn this frag both during the day and evening I'm always have someone come up and say that you smell sooooooo good.
Both longevity and Silage are EXTREMELY high-quality. On my skin this fragrance lasts beyond 10hrs.
Finally thoughts,
How can anyone not find this fragrance amazing? Regardless of your skin type or your body chemistry, this fragrance is priceless. Rating this frag less then perfection is an insult on those who worked behind-the-scenes in the birth of this fragrance.

I do have Gucci Pour Homme II, and recently purcahsed this vintage version of Gucci Pour Homme.

This is a very sneaky scent to me. I sprayed some on a card, and the beauty of it eluded me at first. Then i sprayed some on my wrist, and I have fallen in love with it. This is a dynamite fragrance.

I do not so much get the woody notes, as some spiciness with citrus and a hint of what appears to me as vetiver,and definitely musk.

In conclusion, i love this shit! I adore the sheer masculinity and power of this fragrance. It is the scent for an ideally strong and driven man.

Take the time to sample this on your skin a couple times, as you will not be disappointed.

It's a 'reserved powerhouse', lemons, masculine yet high-quality woods and leather then appear over a background of oakmoss. The mid also feature the famous florals (geranium, carnation) and herbal-lavender of course! See- Gucci Pour Home 1.

Old-skool for sure, but with a touch of assured quality and luxury the brand simply could not translate properly into the 21st century. Gucci Pour Homme 2 remains their best for me, a 3/5 for the surprisingly elegant herbal tea-fume.

High 2/5 for this one. Knock off a point (or 2) if you're an 'old-skool' hater.",07/27/12 05:04,jeffwithfrags
Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"First impression after spraying it on cloth: a perfect blend, with clear lemon, vanilla/amber, leather, patchouli, and a floral accord. I don't really get the wood but there's a hint of geranium and some spice element that helps to create a somewhat creamy quality overall. In some ways, it strikes me as Pub Cologne made elegant, though the notes aren't exactly the same (PC has clear anise whereas here there is a suggestion of anise). Though there's a touch of the crude here, the overall suggestion is that of a man with power who uses it judiciously, cognizant of what the masses desire. There is considerable richness and weight here, but it doesn't have the dryness required to produce great depth, not that it's necessary (Joint for Men is the deepest fragrance I've experienced). This is an excellent example of a high quality, blended designer fragrance, and to be honest, I prefer it to Patou Pour Homme. To me it is what I'd call a citric oriental, though with a chypre accord that becomes clear eventually (but it's never very strong). It's sort of like the citric oriental is covering up the chypre, and as it weakens you get a sense that a chypre is present. I get no fougere accord, however.

UPDATE: I wore it normally today and my assessment is roughly the same, though I find it a bit more refined than on cloth. Clearly, it's not for the young, fresh, sport, aquatic or party crowd.

UPDATE: Wore it today and got more lavender this time around, in a fougere accord, but it's light and nicely blended into the whole. The wood notes are no more than a bare background hum. It's a slightly powdery fougere/chypre/oriental hybrid with quite a bit of complexity, but it's subtle complexity. If you felt that Z-14 was way too crude this would be one to try, for example. There's a bit of an animalic quality, presumably from the jasmine.",06/03/12 02:01,Bigsly

Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"Perfection.

This is a true masterpiece created by Guy Robert and one the most iconic masculine chypres ever created. Gypsy Parfumista's articulate (and wonderfully enthusiastic) review captures what this scent is...for those of us lucky enough to have it, or to have even ever smelled this divine juice. One of my favorite classic male scents of all time. It is simply stunning & timeless.

I am left, almost speechless...but remember that Gucci has always been a very high-end house of everything their logo is upon. This is exquisite, chic and very suave with its classic lines and composition. Desmondorama, I second your wish that this iconic and sensual fragrance somehow be reissued. But, sometimes it is better to let the days of yesteryear be forgotten by the new generation and only sought out by those really want to relive them or experience what existed in a bygone era.

Alfarom, who I admire greatly on this forum, has it fully correct. You cannot compare this to anything created under Tom Ford. This is truly a 70's chypre with an awesome warm leather, musk, woody, amber and oakmoss base covered in lavender, sparkling citrus, and beautiful florals - green jasmine, earthy geranium, lush lavender and powdery iris in the heart. Spices are dashed upon everything...offering 'flavoring' and depth. It can be worn year-round although Spring, Fall and Summer evenings offer more strength and richness due to the warmth, I find it creates it own sunshine on cool, cloudy winter days. A scent that commands respect and will always be one I reach for on the day of a special occasion. No note or accord is dominant...it is the epitome of a balanced fragrance, so impeccably blended.

Gucci Pour Homme Original holds a very dear place in my collection! If ""liquid heaven"" has a price tag - then it is on a bottle of Original Vintage Gucci Pour Homme. ""There can never be too much elegance in your life""...what a marketing tagline and this came out when I was a very young child. I have finally discovered what the beauty and hype is all about - it only took me three plus decades to do so in my existence. 5/5 stars!! 10/10 and, anyone who does not know what an incredible chypre is, should try it and understand the art of perfumery that is captured in this glorious composition. One cannot 'quantify' beauty like this...it is olfactory bliss!

A moment to share: I put a couple of dabs from a perfect 4oz/120ml squared flacon on the back of my hand just 5 minutes ago. I will put this poetically to evoke my sentiment: ""To me, this is like coming home to my beautiful wife...and she kisses me the way she did like the first time we kissed, years ago."" It is simply...stunning! For me, Gucci Pour Homme Original (1976) is a timeless, masterpiece of scent that will forever be relevant and captivating...",12/28/11 13:28,ericrico

This scent, also, is the perfect example (at least for me) of a stunning male chypre.

*Many thanks and reverent bows to Action for the gift of a full sample vial of this wonderful manscent!* You are still the High Priestess of Perfumes...and always will be!

This opens beautifully with clean citruses combined artfully into warm greens and clean floral aromas, manly from whoa to go!! First it is clean and manly then, as it develops, it becomes wonderous with dry flowers like carnation and geranium and irises with the warmth of pepper and earthy woody notes...HEAVEN! Like most TRUE chypres, this takes a while to unfold all of its beauty. And, as it does, I am amazed that Gucci even thought they needed another fragrance besides this one. If this is ""dated"", you may call me an 'old fogey'! GPH is another disastrous loss at the hands of either the IFRA or those who sought to dilute everything within an inch of its life, while supposedly making things ""more modern"" and I simply cannot imagine why!?! God, words cannot do this justice, it just HAS to be smelled. There is nothing even remotely feminine (even the jasmine is ""butch"") or ""unisex"" about this scent. It is all man, all the time! Strong, but not brutal, and amazingly luxurious without smelling too ""rich"". The eventual drydown is perfumed paradise for this guy! Warm, like a favorite wool fisherman's sweater, it eventually gets covered with a beautiful soft leather note and sweet tonka, resins and musk. Oh, and the oakmoss here really shines! OAK moss, now, not tree moss or black moss or whatever else they are using these days...REAL honest to goodness Evernia prunastri, that grows on oaks and other deciduous and coniferous trees and has a woody and sharp slightly sweet smell you cannot mistake. Gucci Pour Homme makes me feel like I am dressed in a vintage Italian leather coat and loafers, hand woven sweater and bespoke twill pants; even when I am wearing bleached out ripped jeans and a tee shirt (like today). What I wouldn't give to own an original vintage bottle of this golden elixir...

Sillage: very good
Longevity: amazing
Overall: 5/5 Chyprefect!

It came to my attention when using the search feature on here to bring this page up that the 2005 version is ""pour Homme"" and this magnificent melange is ""Pour Homme""...that P should be capitalised! Everything about this scent is upper case, upper echelon and upper crust! I bow humbly in the face of Greatness...",05/20/11 13:55,gypsy parfumista
Gucci Pour Homme (1976) Gucci,"The original Gucci Pour Homme and the later Tom Ford's version perfectly represents the two peaks of Gucci's success. The first one back in the 70's when the Gucci family was at the top of their popularity and always protagonist in the main fashion magazines. A family surrounded by mistery, intrigues and extreme luxury and elegance. In this context Gucci Pour Homme (original) was perfectly fitting the bill with a superbe combination of woods (mainly cedar), deep leather, pipe tobacco and some floral notes (lavander and bergamot). A complex composition, that's rich and elegant but not too mannered and one of those perfumes that we can't forget. Great!

In the late 80's the big success of the house started to decline due to several conflicts and scandals in the Gucci's family, but fortunately Tom Ford came in and saved the brand from oblivion. 1999-2003 (perhaps 2004) was the best period for Gucci and the new Gucci Pour Homme, was the expression of those creative years and one of the last good releases form this (once) gorgeous maison.

Gucci Oud Gucci,"A fruity, floral, woody, musky, soft, warm fragrance that was nicely blended. This aroma is 100% unisex. Doesn't smell masculine or feminine. This also doesn't smell like a designer fragrance. It's more leaning in the aromatherapy category in my humble opinion. Nothing really groundbreaking about this. This is not a crowd pleaser, an attention grabber, or a panty dropper. Overall this is a boring scent that doesn't smell offensive & probably won't get you really noticed either.

The longevity is pretty solid. But I still normally layer my cologne with essential oils that are inspired by the fragrance itself to get the performance that I truly desire without having to keep overspraying myself to get that scent trail I like leaving behind as I pass by.

Then it evolved to fresh/clean scents. Then my taste became richer and darker. I have been looking for the perfect oud for a year. I have bought many high-dollar ouds that were highly recommended. Most smell great but I just got this one today and it is THE ONE I have been searching for all along! It is a WONDERFUL combination of fruit and oud. sweet and oud with rose. NOTHING beats this so far. I have paid up to 400 for designer niche oud perfumes and they don't even come close to this in my opinion! Best blind buy ever! By the way, most all of my selections have been blind buys. I live in the mountains of WV where there is little to no good shopping alternatives.

Gucci Oud Gucci,"I will admit this was my first Oud perfume , I might have tried and that is a strong might have at a perfume counter , they knew me by name in Nordstroms and Macy's , or spritzed a friends . I had no other to compare { in owning } until recently . I was looking for a unique Oud Blend and found reviews on Oud Asgharali , on a different site . I decided to look around and found Habat Al Oud , after reading the notes , it was a blind buy that I was excited to purchase . I purchased a backup bottle without waiting to receive my first purchase , just because of the notes , a lustful scentual indeed . Seriously , I do not understand why HAO is not listed . It is superior , now my signature scent . The reason I even bring this one up is it sadly puts Gucci Oud to shame , literally . I don't think I'll wear my Gucci Oud , it is so weak , it stinks { on me } what you can detect , I truly don't get any notes singly or in a group . I bought the Gucci Oud on eBay and unless I got a dud it literally has little too no smell of Oudh . I paid about $60 for it 3 / 4 years ago . I'll wear Habat Al Oud or Trish McEvoy Black Rose Oud , Club de Nuit by Armaf . The notes of GO are so much weaker and really have no oomph to make it special or stand out on its own . I'll apologize now for going on about the Habat Al Oud , but truly you can smell it from just taking the lid off , and it is the same as when spritzed , that is how much I love . I dislike Gucci Oud , I'll have it a very , very long time if I don't end up throwing it away ~ On Ending , if you get a chance to smell or sample the Habat Al Oud , do so , yes it is sweet , longevity is 8 hours at least before she gets lighter , but honestly I can smell most , if not all the notes . I'll be on the look out for more Asgharali scentual fragrances as they're that special ~ I kept smelling my wrist after spritzing , I showered that night and used it just so I could go to sleep with this on my sheets . I slept well and with a smile on my face ~ /=^} ~",12/18/17 23:21,divakitty24

Gucci Oud Gucci,"An oriental masterpiece from Gucci. After reading some guys saying this could be a unisex scent, I tried it.
Westernized oud, spicy rose, slightly sour, rasberry, a noticeable powdery feel with the ethereal note of aromatic incense, I guess from the smooth combo of amber/saffron/patchouli . Very sensual and very pleasant. I'd love to smell it on a woman. I don't know if I could wear it.. I guess not.
If it had more depth and a touch of darkness, maybe more oud, resins, smoke etc, it could be easily unisex scent equal for example to Amouage or something very special.
Well, the price for the big bottle here is almost 11.000 rubles. In my opinion the smell does not justify the price tag.
Conclusion. It's an overpriced but beautiful feminine scent. Gucci could have done it better, I'm sure.",01/22/17 03:09,GRAF

Gucci Oud Gucci,"Here I am, I’ve come back. It took me quite a while to form a ""more rational"" idea of Gucci Oud, perhaps because whenever I wear it I feel it kinda intimidates me.

I love the opening, a triumph of bitterness and rose that I find absolutely remarkable — every time I wear it, for the first forty/fifty minutes I can't help but sniff and think: ""WOW!"". In the initial concoction saffron is rather noticeable because I get a leather-spicy twist; as for the rest, I cannot say I distinguish every single note…anyway it’s very well blended and the result is harmonious. As it begins to dry down, Gucci Oud becomes sweeter and sweeter, but it never becomes too sweet because of the initial bitterness...it's an ""oriental bitter-sweetness"", very hard to find the right words to describe it! This second stage definitely pulls the scent closer to the feminine side, not too overtly feminine though, at least on my skin.

The presence of oud and patchouli is massive and in the final stage these are the dominant notes. In fact, oud is there since the beginning and it’s a “continuum”, patchouli instead shows up little by little and *sometimes*ends up being a bit over the top. No way you will go unnoticed while wearing Gucci Oud — this is a heck of a perfume with great longevity and strong projection. It does leave a powerful oriental trail, people will turn their heads and look at you as you walk by.

My only objection is that with a softer patchouli and perhaps more rose/different varieties of roses (Taif ❤ for example) this perfume, maybe, would be even better…who knows? I guess that Gucci, after this and Intense Oud, won't re-invest in oud so soon; it seems that the oud-frenzy of the past six/seven/eight years is now calming down. Oud has kinda “lost the wow-factor it used to have” and each mainstream designer has to ponder very well what he/she is doing with agarwood.

Anyway, in spite of the tricky patchouli and the boldness that characterizes this fragrance, I will always keep a lovely memory of Gucci Oud and pull it off proudly on more or less special occasions — like yesterday, for example. I don’t care if in the Middle-East they have plenty of cheaper/purer/truer oud-based perfumes that smell similar to this one. Gucci Oud means a lot to me and I got the feeling it will always be by my side to make the difference, to impress a memory, crystallize a moment.

Side note: The bottle is marvelous, I could spend hours staring at it on my dresser.",08/31/16 12:02,FabulouslyLazy
Gucci Oud Gucci,"I finally found my new signature scent in this perfume. I used to wear the Gucci EDP (the brown one in the clear glass bottle), but it was discontinued and it's very hard to find now.

After a 2 year hunt, I happened upon what I had been missing - a strong, oriental female fragrance.

It is marketed as unisex, but I'd find it difficult to imagine a man wearing it. It's a bit on the heavy side, but definitely still within the female range.

The fragrance makes me feel sexy and confidence, and the Oud smell is so unique that to most people it's quite intoxicating. I've used two bottles of it now, and find it suits me as a strong signature scent and you can smell it for days afterwards..maybe even weeks. It definitely lingers - my now-ex-boyfriend used to say he could smell me for days afterwards in his car.",07/26/16 05:24,victoriasviews

Gucci Oud Gucci,"This was enjoyably surprising. When I first smelled it, I instantly thought of the original Gucci by Gucci for women because of its similar fruity notes. On first spray, you immediately get the oud note with pear and raspberry notes. It subsides in a few minutes to reveal a woody rose in perfect pitch with the oud. At this point it reminds me of Arabic oud mixtures, less geranium which can make it very high pitched and overly stringent. No problem here however. I'm a fan of rose notes which puts me in the minority of contemporary perfume lovers who seem to equate rose scents to dear old grandma.

With a lot of oud scents, Arabic and Western versions, the oud tends to overpower and take over everything. It becomes insistent and to me, rather irritating. I start to feel worn out by the oud. Gucci's oud stays around, but doesn't start to smell sharp or too dry. It keeps its gentle pace and lingers subtly.

Overall though, I still think it smells like GbG, though lifted because of the oud's woody and resinous nature, where GbG becomes a sweet juicy ambery ""new chypre"" concoction.

Marketed as unisex, it teeters towards feminine IMO, so men might step back a little in wearing this because of its floralcy and sweetness. The scent doesn't seem to go big and permeate a room, but stays close. A great go to when I care for something floral.",01/07/16 11:18,iMaverick

Gucci Oud Gucci,"Not at all creative nor innovative for a perfume, but let me tell you something.

Next to Gucci PH II, it's the only Gucci that smells natural, without, more or less pronounced, synthetic accord. The rose here is really beautiful. Until I've sniffed this fragrance, I thought the best rose in the mainstream genre is Cartier Declaration d'Un Soir. But the thing with d'Un Soir is that rose presented there is kinda' to jammy for my taste. This smells like plenty, thousands, millions of rose petals cascading from the air. And I mean it. Ok, we have a jammy moment here - right after it's sprayed on the skin, you can feel the jammy raspberry. But after 15 minutes it's gone.Luckilly, it's not too oudy when it dries down, the oud here is like a woody backbone to the whole fragrance.

Longevity is solid, over 10 hours on my skin, projection is rather moderate.

It should be cheaper though, it doesn't deserve the niche pricing.",05/14/15 01:33,Martin__
Gucci Oud Gucci,"Here's my problem. Any Oud fragrance that is marketed as ""unisex"" has either rose, saffron, vanille, raspberry, and all that jazz. This is one reason I feel such Oud fragrances are synthetized and emasculated. By this, the perfumer is flirting with the idea of having both sexes have fun (original oud from the Middle East is worn by men). Being an Oud-conscious cologne collector, I won't get this (Gucci Oud). But I could get Oud Wood, Tobacco Oud (Tom Ford), Oud Oriental (S. T. Dupont), Black Aoud (Montale), Bois D'Oud (Perris Monte Carlo) and of course Interlude (Amouage)! The aforementioned colognes are remarkably masculine scents that would suit my olfactive personality! And to make matters seemingly worst, Gucci is offering me a 50-75ml flacon of amorphous synthetized oud! Well, guys mail me if there's ""Gucci Guilty Black Oud Pour Homme"" in at least 90ml, EDP! Ok. Nevermind. Thanks!",03/11/15 17:17,TheMan McEssien
Gucci Oud Gucci,"Decided to stop off at Bloomingdales to hunt down & sniff Gucci's latest creation ""Gucci Oud"". It's well put together with many subtle notes of raspberry, saffron, rose, orange notes, white floral lilly-like with a synthethic musk-amber-oud hiding in the background. Yep, you guessed it; synthesized artificial ""oud-amber-musk"". After applying a single-squeeze on my inner wrist (no rubbing it in) it last for about 5hours which isn't bad for the price. It's not a horrible fragrance, although if you're a guy with thoughts of getting Gucci Oud blindly without smelling; the notes are slightly sweet, fruity, and floral while presenting a synthethic oud/musk/Amber as mentioned. Not worth retail price which was $135 for 2.5oz/75mL EDT. However it is made in a 1.7oz/50mL EDP for $110, but I doubt the overall notes would change. It's not bad, not horrible, but in my opinion this would fit best on a lady for a movie/dinner/office/fall/spring/winter.",03/09/15 17:32,Mr. TomFordHermessence

Gucci by Gucci is honey-flowery-smokey with a little bit of masculin bitterness. This one is an oud bomb with a little bit of fruity sweetness and rose.
I would not recommend it for men, I think it seems to be unisex in the first couple of minutes but grows to be very feminin in the drydown with the sweetness and the rose. It smells like a rich Arabic lady from the Gulf Bay (no offense, half of my family is from there).

Since Gucci by Gucci is now harder to come by, I am nose-shopping around for other perfumes I like that fill the same spot,preparing myself for yet another of my perfumes to become elusive.
I tried Oud yesterday. I like Oud perfumes, though a lot of them tend to be too dry.
I found the oud scent to come through loud and clear as a top note, though its dryness was cut down with a sweetness that reminded me a lot of the way Gucci by Gucci cuts its very masculine flavours with honey.
As time went, it reminded me more and more of Gucci by Gucci.
When I got home, I looked it up and recognized the saffron from its description on the Gucci site.
All in all, I liked it very much, though I wouldn't own both this one AND Gucci by Gucci due to their similarity.

Just tried Gucci Oud this evening at Hudson's Bay in Canada. Very, very beautiful and molto Gucci! Opens strong and woody and approx. 30 mins later... rose and saffron unfolds with a Smokey veiling that is Oh so alluring. The underpinning is certainly Gucci by Gucci EDP with a new twist, a hint of OUD. Has a post lingering of marsala wine (laugh) leaving a feeling of coziness and deliciousness. More of an evening perfume because of its depth, although very wearable in the daytime too. Easily a signature scent. Very long-wearing. This is Gucci alright and brings back memories of Gucci in the 80's...""the prominent female"" (perhaps the days of Tom Ford with Gucci).

Gucci Oud Gucci,"After having lived in the middle east and exploring many fragrances around the world in my military travels and have been exposed to Oud plenty of times. I agree with many that Gucci jumped on the bandwagon of the newest gimmick of including Oud in fragrances. I've smelled many different varieties of Oud mixed in many combinations. Westerners don't know this so of course its new and new can always be priced at a premium. I was very intrigued by this perfume and bottle and the fact that this one is labeled unisex because I really loved this bottle also so I went and got it. So far very hard to find as i'm typing this up. It was delivered to me and very excited to spray it and at first I was moved, WOW this is an amazing smell , very beautiful, but wait a minute. Why does this smell familiar? I realize looking over at the many different middle eastern oils I have of musks and oud , this perfume by Gucci isn't something new, its just repackaged. One can say all combinations of fragrances have been found and honestly todays ""new"" fragrances are just repackaged fragrances. The oils I bought in the middle east are cheap. They are pure perfume grade and if packaged to look expensive they would be, but they don't bullshit you. What you have here is just repackaged scent. I love it but the arabs have had these oud fragrances for the longest times and the idea of the european companies to try to get in the arab market is silly, because arabs are laughing at us for spending so much on these ""oud wannabes"" as I like to call them.

It's very pricey for its quality ..... If I was to purchase a rose oud, I prefer to spend on Dior Oud Ispanan instead. Oud Ispahan is more expensive, but the scent and quality you get from it is much more that what you get from Gucci Oud. Acqua de parma Colonia Intensa Oud is also amazing with similar price. Consider it if you want a Oud perfume ......

Longevity and sillage is better than most of the fragrances in the shop. The scent can be excellent, or it may turn to gum.

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Black? Seductive? Mysterious? Vampy? Guilty?
Where?!
Bad? Absolutely not.
It’s just that the whole marketing from name to bottle to add campaign is way off from the scent IMO.
GGB starts with juicy sweet red berries on soft powdery florals, ending with a well behaved patchouli and warm sweet amber. Lovely and pleasant, maybe flirty at most, but not deep or dark by any means.
I find the Guilty and Flora lines from Gucci pleasing but not ground breaking. However I love their Bloom line. It has so much more character.
Also the performance of GGB is like a weak edt not an EDP.
To be considered if you have a small collection and you are looking for a fruitchouli where patchouli doesn’t overpower, but if you are a collector with a wide selection, it’ll probably be redundant.",05/06/23 14:06,Tinabill
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Call it basic but I always loved how soft and pretty this scent was. Of course- Gucci watered it down and then discontinued it, making my remaining bottle a serious disappointment.
However— I got Lattafa’s Nebras today and since it has some similar notes but is just a touch linear, I thought it might layer well with it. Well guess what Guilty Black girls n’ boys— I have something even better than both Guilty Black or Nebras now. The Nebras makes the Gucci pop again and then turns into a vanilla velvet with the faintest florals. Let the mint die down for a minute, but once it does it’s very smooth.
I also layered with Lalique Amethyst, which I like but does get a hair too sharp for me at times. The Nebras accentuated the red berries that I love and smoothed over that sharpness that I don’t always want with a light vanilla frost.

Tried to layer with Very Good Girl (Carolina Herrera) and it was just meh, took the sparkles out of it.

Hope this helps someone rejuvenate an old bottle of Guilty Black! Happy Spraying!",04/12/23 16:08,Juliusq75
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I am from Brazil.
The text was translated by Google.

The dark bottle has nothing to do with the fragrance.
The output is comfortable and a little creamy, reminiscent of a moisturizer.
The sweetness of the fragrance is very light and refined.
The exit brings me memories of perfumes used to aromatize designer stores, remembering the smell of a mall.
The red berries and raspberry are more sour than sweet.
In the evolution, the violet note leaves the fragrance slightly powdery, and the fruit smell (which was already very light), practically disappears, leaving the evolution, zero sugar.
In the final phase, a sweet smell appears (would it be the caramel note?) But it is a very light sweet, nothing gourmand.
Gucci Guilty Black is NOT the style of club perfumes. The fragrance is simple and smooth, but very tasty and well balanced, like those perfumes that you can't stop smelling.
At least on my skin, it's a joker perfume, which can be used in the workplace and in the classroom.",03/05/23 17:40,Amostras e Miniaturas

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This is way, way better than the original and all other flankers. It is standing on its own, though vaguely retaining their DNA.

The red fruits here are so well balanced with flowers and Patchouli and Amber. On my skin, reacting with my pH, this exudes in a much refined, smooth scent. Very classy, and I wouldn't have guessed without testing it.

It does not project beastly, but it's perceivable and persistent with a great consistency. It doesn't fade or morph into a disfigured rendition of its top notes. All seems to work in harmony creating a demure sophistication, a comforting aura around me. I only sprayed it once on the back of my hand and yet people stopped me to ask what it was that I wore.

I love it and recommend it to those with rather dry and colder type of skin like mine. I'm pretty sure that the slightly alkaline pH would make this fragrance sing like a nightingale. As it does on me. Who'd have said?

Buy testers as I think that this needs a particular chemistry to release its magic. A keeper for me, and a decent 7/10. I'll enjoy wearing this daily, everywhere.

PS: this nose knows magic, I'll check his other works!

UPDATE: 2 hours in, the Amber and red fruits are singing from my skin!!!!

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Super pretty. I ended up falling in strong like/love with the slightly sweet, lilac-patchouli amber of Gucci Guilty EDT (2021). Gucci Guilty Black (2013) is a slightly sweeter, fruitier, bolder version. I adore the raspberry blast at the start but the drydown is very similar (but not completely the same). This is the more outgoing older sister of GG 2021 EDT. Gucci was foolish to discontinue this! I don't think it smells dirty, but it has an interesting accord from the purple floral amber patchouli that may not be for everyone. I find it soft enough to wear in multiple settings.",07/16/22 19:54,KylieBooFace

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I remember testing it when it first came out and it took me this long to get a bottle. I have been looking for a lilac perfume, which I love to wear between mid April and mid May when the lilacs bloom. To my nose this is a very clean, gentle lilac and peach, with surprising longevity. I actually smelled some lilacs in bloom and can't say it is a realistic lilac scent, but somehow it is recognisable as lilac and the peach makes it less floral and more sweet. I can see how it can be dismissed as a clean floral, but to me it is very special and it feels posh. Definitely prefer it to Idyll Love Blossom, which I used to have. Bottle doesn't match the scent at all. It is more ""strength in gentleness"" than femme fatale. Husband asked why I got a ""Batman"" Perfume and now I can't unsee it...",05/03/22 13:35,Emera1d

The patchouli, pink pepper & violet where more prominent and gave me headaches.

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Most misleading name and bottle design ever? Gucci Guilty Black is not a dark, sexy fragrance for illicit encounters or date nights - or it wouldn't be my first choice for that anyway. It's actually a pretty, friendly, easygoing floral I wear to work and to hang with family! Very berry, lilac, and violet forward (but not just another candied violet; the berries are the star with lilac as a strong supporting act). Good for any time other than high heat, particularly cooler weather. Moderate longevity. Familiar smelling, but nice enough to use up before moving on to something else not blind bought :P",04/23/21 08:51,Letitlinger
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I love Gucci so I had to try for I found it at Saks 5th off for half price . The opening reminds me of Alien Fusion with it pink pepper opening with a touch of its Mandarin sweetness. It not a bold or over a powering opening, but a light pretty scent but I did have to spray twice for it's either really light on my skin or a very close to a skin scent.

But wait, time passes and now I can smell it very nicely. I can smell the Lilac and Geranium with the peach blending them together for a lovely floral scent with a touch of the pink pepper lagging behind them. I really like it for the projection is growing still but its not annoying, but fun, a very feminine scent that feels like spring/summer is here.

It was very impressed how long it lasted. It goes into it's dry down of a creamy amber combine with Geranium and Lilac which the I love for they both have a lovely floral sweetness . I don't think this scent will appeal to some people for you have to like pink pepper along with the floral notes I listed but to me they blended very nicely into a different, lovely, fun, pretty, scent.

Can't wait to try it this summer for its working great in cold winter months. Good for day or night use!!",03/23/21 22:40,carlahoffman
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"With a name like that, I expected something dark, sexy, warm and spicy. Instead I get an overwhelming fruity sweetness that dries into a powder with a hint of spice. This isn't at all what I expected and I was let down.

On me, this initially went on very sweet with an almost waxy kind of quality (I was getting slight Lipstick On from MMM vibes right at first). The fruitiness was right there at the front as well. Through the middle I picked up on some of the spice and then it dried down to be less sweet, more powdery and creamy. Still, this doesn't smell like a mature, elegant, or classy fragrance. Someone mentioned it's more suited for parties and dates and I have to agree. Definitely a fall/winter night fragrance. I couldn't imagine this being worn any other time, it's way too cloying for me.",03/07/21 20:06,Phemia
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This is absolutely my new favorite perfume - I love it so much! Beware of dupes, those smell vaguely like Gucci Guilty Black should, but they are just a puff of air compared to the real thing.
The real GGB is sweet, subtle and fresh, and the longevity is quite good. I can smell berries with pink pepper and possibly raspberry, with sweet and tender amber caramel base.
On top of that it's somehow different from anything I smelled/owned before, win-win for me definitely.
Surprised to see people comparing it to regular Gucci Guilty, they are very different on me, the latter missing the tang of berries and caramel sweetness. On the contrary, it's rather similar to Dior Addict Eau Delice (unfortunately discontinued).

So here's to my new found love for berry scents!",03/03/21 06:47,Masha_latte
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This will be an unpopular view, but for me it's just 'meh'. I got bought this as a birthday present a few years back and I have continually tried so hard to like it.

It's safe, granted, but to me smells generic. It's trying to be dark, but there is no depth behind it. It's what good girls wear if they are trying to be daring. It's not sweet, but there is no oomph here. There are no stand-out notes for me, and sillage and longevity is weak.

I think what I'm trying to get at is that this is a perfume that just... smells like perfume. Does that make sense?",02/25/21 05:51,u24masonl
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This is what regular Gucci Guilty is supposed to be.
I was never bothered when it appeared: I simply ignore all perfumes advertised and pushed hard into my throat. While decluttering my home I found a small sample, this peel off one and it smelt just gorgeous. Very similar to City Rush by Avon which I own but wasnt aware GG was an inspiration. I tried to found a good deal, bought a mini bottle off Ebay, found a small sample at home and in a meanwhile I blindly bought GG black. I tried my sample of GG and huge disapointment.... I cannot stand initial note of it. I was worried about my blind buy of GG black, started to consider resale or return... but, we only live once! Opened it yesterday and this is the beauty from my peel off sample! It has nice fruity opening and carmel! It also smells beautiful on clothes. Great buy, Ilike it a lot and find it much better than GG EDT.",02/18/21 16:08,plum
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I love fruity scents that have a little substance beside the fruit notes, and Guilty Black is just that. It opens with peach and raspberry, which are sweet and remind me of gummy candy here. But the intense, dry pink pepper, musk, powdery violet and hints of lilac balance the scent, so it smells like a good perfume and not like some gummy bear bodyspray. In the base I get patchouli and amber too, so the fragrance turns warm and slightly sensual. It becomes better the longer I wear it, contrary to Guilty Intense, which has a nice opening, but is lacking in the drydown, at least on me.
The only thing I would criticise about this is that I wish the lilac note was a little stronger.

Guilty Black is more flirty than deeply sexy and ""guilty"", and not a black or dark scent. I would say the gold packaging from the other scents of the Guilty line would be more fitting with this, maybe with some red or dark pink accents.
I don't think I'll buy it, because my collection is so large, but this is a pretty and versatile scent. I'd happily use it if I got it as a gift or if I found it for an extremely good price.",11/30/20 05:50,SailorV

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This v lightly spiced, it's incredibly smooth, it's not a nose hitter. In terms of being sexy you'll need to be feeling fairly sexy already n have got close up to smell this on someone, it doesn't project that much. I don't get obvious berries either, it's very well blended, nothing stands alone, which I personally prefer. It's soft, smooth, sweet n creamy, skin scenty, maybe a tiny bit of smoke in the vanilla at the end. It's a fresh vanilla, not heavy. I may have to get another bottle before it disappears. Don't know how I failed to notice this until just now, I think it's perfect.",10/14/20 11:05,Siv7Stars
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Beautiful, very well blended. Smells like juicy berries (but it's not immaturely fruity, not in a way I'd consider 'girly' and juvenile), smooth milk chocolate, and yes, as someone said below, paper money.

The red berries are definitely there, but very well blended with the sweeter, smoother notes, so they aren't sour or stringent in any way. I don't particularly distinguish the pink pepper, it's well incorporated and gives spice and body to the fragrance. The amber-caramel medley makes it particularly warm and cozy, and gives that 'freshly opened chocolate' feel.

The reviewer who said this smells like the purple Johnsons Baby was spot on - it really does! However, the gourmand notes add extra sophistication to the blend, and the berries make it a bit more fun.

Something I don't quite like is the smoky note in the dry-down - where does this come from? I think the fragrance could have done without, which would have made it my ultimate any occasion, extra cozy, ultra huggable but still sexy and mysterious fragrance. That smoky note, probably added for additional pretentiousness, is a bit too mature and contrasts with the general vibe of the perfume.

Speaking of which, the general vibe is not really 'guilty'. It's more like 'warm, embracing, but I have a couple of secrets of my own'. I love it, but the longevity and projection make me sad, really weak.",09/11/20 12:31,alexandradaos
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Oh. Well, that's disappointing. I love Guilty Intense and I was giddy with excitement trying this because I thought it would be an improvement on Intense, but... it's a little boring? Opens very sweet with the red fruit and I can also immediately pick up on the caramel toffee scent, but it's not a real, molten caramel. I think Boss Private Accord does that a lot better. There's a mix with some soapiness that stays clear from being sharp, but only just. The patch is dry and heavy, but the development of the notes is a bit disjointed, like they don't mix well together and they're fighting for dominance. The pepper is hardly noticeable in the beginning, but after half an hour I do get spicy. Still, I'm left with a very distinct feeling of 'meh'. Overall, it even smells a little cheap.

It's as if someone requested Guilty Intense to be sweetened for sexiness. Instead, Guilty Black is only sweet in the opening, and then it dries to a drab dry soapy scent with a vague caramel background and something else that reminds me of deodorant spray. It's not an improvement. It's not sexy. And it gives me a slight headache. Pass.",05/17/20 04:38,Nijntje
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This opens VERY sweet raspberry. At first I thought OH NO but as it dried down more nuances came out to play. I once heard that every Gucci fragrance has a note in the base that in reminiscent of paper money. So now I hallucinate that note in every Gucci scent.

Anyway the opening on this is very different than the drydown, which is less peppery berries and more powdery ambered peach.",05/12/20 11:57,stacia79
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"First whiff is very juicy and sweet, the red berries hit you on that first spritz immediately. Then I get a very heady, powdery patchouli that's very sexy and powerful. I enjoy the dry down most, I get the caramel and it's not so assaulting on the nose which it can tend to be. I get a lot of compliments on this one, people seem to enjoy this a lot. I guess it's less painful on the nose when it's smelled from afar. My boyfriend likes this a lot, I own a lot of perfumes and constantly am rotating which one I wear each day but he never fails to compliment me when I wear this one. He keeps asking me what perfume I am wearing when I have this one on. I guess he can never remember LOL
Projection for me is close to beastly, I can walk into a room and people can smell me from afar. Longevity is a good 8-10 hours on my skin, I can still smell this even after scrubbing myself vigorously with a loofa and copious amounts of body wash.
This is generally a likeable perfume for all. If you're meeting someone or a group of people for the first time and not sure what to wear in order to not offend yet still leave an impression on them (albeit that impression might be one of sexiness) then wear this. It's very rich and sexy and strong enough but does not offend at all.",04/30/20 02:01,Kìmonanthe

Now, as a 19 year old in college, I remembered this perfume and went to repurchase. The first thing it reminded me of is....baby powder!? I don't get that sharp freshness from the berries at all, but rather, a sickening powdery smell. The pepper definitely comes through, though. I just remember this perfume smelling gorgeously elegant and mature, like a strong, sensual young woman. Perhaps my body chemistry changed.

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This is a warm sweet fragrance. The fruity sweetness hangs just on the edge of too sweet but never crosses the line. The patchouli, amber, and floral notes keep this fragrance in control and give it the warmth that tempers the sweetness.

It feels a little young but not so young that I am uncomfortable wearing it. It also seems to lack something to really give it a unique scent. Its not exactly generic but it doesn't have the wow factor.

Longevity is moderate and it leaves an impressive scent trail. All in all its nice but probably not something I need a FB of .

Edit: I had a mini bottle of this so I continued to wear it. The more I wear it the more I love it. It last about 7 or 8 hours and almost everyone finds it to be pleasant. It isn't particularly complex but its a nice basic fragrance. I think I have changed my mind about the need for a FB after wearing this scent for about a week.

This smells like red berries done right, that it doesn't smell synthetic or like syrup. Just right. It also makes me think of chocolates. Lastly I love the blown up patchouli on this one. It's heavy so it smells like dollar bills that have been sitting in the wallet for a long time. It smells like men in dark business suits and vegas. Money money money and POWER. It smells sophisticated, and rich, and sensual. Definitely one for night time but I wear this even to work and I get so many compliments from men and women alike.

I'm not a fan of the opening, but the dry-down is too feminine, sensual, and remarkable. It could be light in sillage, but it's longlasting and noticeable from a close range.

Again Aurelien Guichard is behind such a subtle perfume. Now I can call him the powdery-notes-man, for his (Narciso Poudre) + (Valentino Poudre) + (Trussardi My Name, which resembles the most innocent baby powder ever).",06/18/17 06:39,perfume_infatuated

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Hmm... it's a fruity-sweet fragrance that becomes powdery in the dry down. I wouldn't say it's original or sexy or dark for that matter. I get the pepper only in the first few minutes, then the fragrance softens and becomes creamy. Still, probably better to use for the night as it might be too cloying during the day. The original is definitely more 'guilty'.",10/04/16 00:18,dyaver

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This fragrance is almost as confusing as its predecessor, boring, mildly fruity, and peppery but I can't really tell a difference between this and Guilty. This one is slightly more fruity.
This fragrance is in a word, nice, not bold, daring, mysterious, dark, just nice. I really don't think this is an addition to the Guilty line, it's almost exactly the same to me.
Just like Guilty this perfume is only guilty of having a misleading name and the only mystery I'm left with is why its called Guilty Black as though it was a sexy or sexier version, but it's not. Although the long winded description says it, this perfume is not breaking any rules

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I think I was expecting something a little darker and more mysterious than this, based on the name and the sleek bottle. It's not a particularly inviting scent.

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Right off the bat, this one smells a little like sweet baby powder because of the pepper, violet and lilac, but after a few minutes, the peach is definitely noticeable.

It is so delicate and dry and warm, though the fragrance was inspired by ""danger."" Patchouli isn't really present on my skin until the end, but it isn't super prominent and just gives a good edge to the violet. After eight hours of wear, I can finally notice raspberry and amber, and it pulled something vanilla on me!

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I like a fragrance with patchouli in it. I, a person who can't stand the thought of patchouli let alone the actual smell, like a fragrance with patchouli in it. There is hope for every patch-o-phobe out there, LOL!

On a slightly more serious note, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by GG Black. I have the original GG and I don't know what I was thinking when I bought it because all I can smell is patchouli when I first spray it and it makes me gag. This, however, comes across in a much different way to me. The patchouli is present, but it seems more well-behaved and tolerable. Perhaps it is the opening sweetness of berries and gentle nuances of lilac that calm the patchouli down; whatever it is, this is a thing of delightful beauty on my skin and I'm seriously considering buying a full size version once my little sample is gone.",04/18/15 21:58,DarlingNikki

It has maybe a dollop less of Vanilla, but the Cranberry/Vanilla combo is definitely there. The beginning notes are quite pleasant, and almost interesting but it's sort of vaguely fruity, slightly sweet and a tiny bit creamy.

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Black is an amplified version of its predecessor, Gucci Guilty. This is not an intense fragrance, per say, rather Black is sweeter and juicier. The bottle is, ironically, quite colourful with the red glass design; which I really like.

The opening of Gucci Guilty Black is all fruits. Raspberries and red berries and pink pepper. The lilac of the original is replaced with violet to give Black more warmth. The patchouli note is so quiet as to be almost non-existent and the amber is sweet and musky.

I love this fragrance; it's in the same sweet/musky/floral family as 212 Sexy by Carolina Herrera and Wink! by Avon, both of which I wear. It's not terribly ground-breaking or original, but it's still a great fragrance. Don't be put off by the dark packaging and marketing; this scent is entirely appropriate for daywear because of all those berries. Longevity is around 6 hours, although it becomes difficult to detect at around 4. Silage is moderate.",12/30/14 16:32,CatherineLaundon

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS

I am a big fan of the originial Gucci Guilty and Guilty Intense so I was expecting to like this. I sprayed it onto my hand and I instantly loved it. It was definitely Gucci Guilty, but much sweeter, much more fruiter. The pink pepper and red berries are definitely detectable. The patchouli is just a hint, so all you patchouli-loathers need not worry. Nicely blended fragrance, not too much of anything.

SILLAGE & LONGEVITY

Not great. Around 4 hours max. Stays close to the skin. Considering perfume never lasts long on my skin, no matter how strong it is, I'd also check other reviews.

FEELINGS PROVOAKED

Sexy, edgy, modern

CONCLUSION

A nice edition to the Gucci Guilty family, It's definitely worth a try. And I think it's worth mentioning I've seen Guilty Black selling online much cheaper than the originial Guilty so shop around for a good deal (I've seen the 75ml selling on allbeauty.com for £31).",09/18/14 18:07,dcookoo
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"When I first tried this I immediately disliked it. I thought it was loud and obnoxious. The second time, I realized I might have been influenced by the name and the bottle. To me, what's inside is more playful than seductive as its image would suggest. I still wasn't won over, but I went from hate to dislike. The third time, I went from dislike to interest. And now, I think I can safely say I like this. Though who knows what the fifth attempt will bring.

It opens with a blast of berries, then pink pepper, then raspberry, then patchouli and nectarine. Slowly the florals start to peep out as it sits. It's spicy, but definitely not dark and edgy. It's warm and pretty sweet, actually. It's well-suited for a fall evening out or a winter evening in.",09/18/14 16:53,HanamiTsukimi

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"While cleaning out my room yesterday I found a sample spray of this hiding away somewhere. It's not the kind of thing I usually wear, and I'm not even sure where I got it because it's not the kind of thing I would be drawn to, but because of that it was the first thing I reached for this morning. Surprisingly enough, I'm very impressed!

This starts off with a juicy fruit note (current, I guess, but I actually thought it smelled more like raspberry) and then mellows out into a creamy peach/lilac combination. There's just a hint of spice in the background but it's not overpowering--even my dad, who usually hates patchouli, decided he likes this one. It's less ""dark"" than I was expecting but it's very pretty.

Since I haven't tried the original I might do that before I decide if I want to get a bottle of this, but I really like it and I'll have fun using up my tester.",08/05/14 08:43,blue_belle

It smells completely different on me, than it did on the card. My skin tends to turn things super powdery, while on the card it smelled more berry.

This is sexy, sweet, but not cloying. Powdery, but not in a baby powder way. It's a sexy type of powder. It's sultry and dark. I feel that it could be worn day or night, depending on the person. It's heavy on the patchouli, and pink pepper, with a touch of raspberry, and amber. I don't reach for this one often, but I'm glad to have it in my line up.

So, when I first smelled the guilty's, I thought, No Way!!but I'm finally tired of playing safe so I made myself try the One and was pleased. It was okay, actually. Then I tried guilty Black and at first it kind of scared me. Then as I started roaming around Macy's, I could smell it on me and was like WOW!!! It smelled warm yet fresh. I really like it. It's a flirty but still classy. Definitely, snuggable!!! I've gotten many compliments wearing black. The only downside is the longevity. No more than 3 to 4 hours. I wish they made an EDP, for sure.",05/14/14 03:31,Jartan*555
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I picked up a roller ball of this a few weeks back and I have wanted to write a review on this but I'm having trouble figuring this out. Not because I don't know if I like it or not, because I defiantly do, but because I can't really pick up what I'm smelling. It's like when you wake up from a good dream that immediately starts to fade away from memory but you can remember small bits and pieces and you try to put the pieces together but you can't, all you remember is it made you feel happy but you don't really know why.
To me, this perfume is just as soft as those hard to reach memories. With the black and red bottle and named ""Guilty"", I guess I keep expecting this to be loud and in your face- but it is soft, slightly sweet and demure. This should have been named ""Innocent"".
The opening is all pink pepper, then somewhere in the middle it's a soft....I don't know! It's just ""soft"". Maybe amber with a touch of the lilac? I really can't tell what any of these notes are other then just ""pretty"". I sprayed this on about 20 minutes ago to revisit it and I have to press my nose to my skin to get any scent. I really wish this was longer lasting and had more projection because it is very pretty and I'd probably get a full size if that were the case. Unfortunately it's a bearly there skin scent that could use more punch with a name like ""Guilty"".",05/09/14 07:14,Coconutmusk
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I'm a BIG fan of Gucci Guilty so I was eager to test this today when I saw it in a perfume section of a department store.

At first I liked it and thought it was very similar to the original Gucci Guilty, maybe a little bit fruitier though and the lilac is far less noticeable sadly, and I thought it was very pleasant. Luckily, I didn't even notice the patchouli in it, which was a VERY good thing because I really hate that note! Sadly though, after about 3 hours Guilty Black virtually evaporated and I can only smell it very slightly if I stick my nose right against my wrist! I tested two other perfumes as well on different parts of my arms .. Chopard Wish and Moschino Cheap & Chic Chic Petals .. and both of those have outlasted the Guilty Black.

So, for me, this would be a perfume to skip because I don't see the point in buying a fairly costly perfume that has almost no staying power. Luckily I have a bottle of the original Guilty which I got in a swap and I'd definitely get another bottle of that when I run out but I wouldn't waste my money on Guilty Black, despite it smelling nice while it lasted!",05/08/14 09:17,Kittycat63

A few years back I tried the original Gucci Guilty and liked it but not enough to buy it. The original actually smells more masculine on me than the Black. As we all know, each person's skin chemistry is different, therefore, you should always try before you buy. It's extremely frustrating reading strong, bashing negative perfume reviews when a person's skin chemistry rejects a certain scent. We all wear what smells good on ourselves, there's no need to totally bash a perfume. Constructive criticism is much better than bashing. Just saying....",03/08/14 06:43,PepePurFume
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Hmmmm....testing it out for the second time in the dark. First time I thought it was sexy. But i I didn't like it on my skin. I think it's the terrible patchouli note that Gucci overdoes a lot of the time. It's in several of their fragrances and it kinda smells like wet pencil shavings or sweaty money...the dry downs usually make me feel sick. Gucci if you are reading this a lot of your fans don't want this note in your scents. So get rid if it please. ..I really got a good blast of this when I first squirted.....however, it was mercifully gone within a few minutes and in really liking the masterfully present lilac uniquely associated with guilty. The Same really elegant clear scent that the regular guilty has and it is a quality scent. It does smell expensive. Maybe that's why they have that paper smell in there because they want to be associated with money perhaps. A few reviewers cited that it reminded them of Vegas and turning heads and lights and it does.....but also expensive suits and cutting deals. Fancy floral arrangements in front of waterfalls in five star hotel suites. Something about this scent makes me feel alive and like I am really good...like a make it happen girl.

Juicy, dark and sweet at initial spray and then developing into something sexy, cuddly and warm still with a little kick of sweetness. Although it's an EDT it really lasts a good amount of time, close to 5 hours on my skin.

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"The openings of the Gucci's have not impressed me. The are rather soft and I would suppose I have acquired a taste for a stronger, more robust perfume that can take me away, one that will grab me by the shoulders and shake me. Granted, there is no horrible alcohol whizz at first hint, just a soft hint of something to come. Maybe peach. Maybe vanilla. So we have generic fruity-gourmand blended into a soft cream sitting low, so low that I must put my nose into it and therein lies the problem. The patchouli is so weak I don't know it's there. Another common scent packaged oh-so-prettily, rather vampy to catch the eye of unsuspecting wallets, a designer name for those that care enough about labels, pretty packaging and the money shall be spent on commonality.",11/06/13 13:06,SorceressOfTheDark

That is why when I got Guilty Black, I thought it was going to be the ultimate buy for me. To my disappointment, it smelled very heady and masculine.. It is a very nice and well crafted perfume, but definitely not for women. Or at least women who prefer to exentuate their tender and feminine side. Sorry Gucci.. This one's not for me. Unless I grow a moustach.",09/06/13 02:11,dalouchi
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Very simple kind of fruit jam. One thing is for sure - it's a true fruity, no florals to be found in this simplistic juice. Berries, peach and a bit of vanilla (not lily). It just strickes me how naive (not young! young can be all sorts of things - smart, preppy, cute, charming, innocent, lovely, pretty to say the least) this fragrance is; especially compared to the price and promo (ad, design, buzz, ""story"").

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"just bought it because il was massively discounted.
sprayed it on my wrist...and now, well I am not sure I did the right choice, even if it was a bargain.
poor lasting power, cheap synthetic berry scent, I shouldn't have been blinded by the price; pretty sure I won't wear it :-(
I hope base notes will be sexier. so far it just smells like some cheap celeb frag.

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Wow, it smells like a cross between my beloved Armani Sensi and Armani Diamonds. The initial blast is Armani Diamonds; fruits and spices, slightly metallic and screechy. Then, almost immediately, there is the drydown: Armani Sensi. Mmmm...heaven. I would call this a love, except it lasts no more then an hour on my skin. If only the lasting power were better. I'll be putting it on my want list anyways and hoping for at least an average lasting power.",07/02/13 20:43,Pari88
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I have to say even though I understand the superhero idea for this campaign I don't believe the smell matches the theme. I do like the black bottle simply from a practical point of view. I have the gold bottle and it always has fingerprints over it even though I wipe it and try to look after it there is a lot of mirror like material and it is hard to maintain if you like to keep the bottles the black one to me is a little more practical.

Gucci have claimed this line of perfumes are seductive to todays customers but I don't honestly find them seductive just pleasant and inoffensive. I think of some of my older style perfumes and to me they are seductive but these not at all just personally. Obviously the current consumers have changed their opinion of what is seductive these days and obviously it usually involves berries and patchouli and I am the odd one out here but Patchouli seems to be relied upon a lot these days to attempt to make a perfume deeper and more sultry but rarely works in my humble opinion because you wind up smelling only patchouli and not much else. I cannot follow that trend I am afraid, I refer to my oldies for that purpose when I want to but that is just my experience with this line from Gucci so far.

I prefer the original as it didn't try to be sweet and innocent and sultry all at the same time which to me has resulted in missing the boat completely. At least Gucci's previous perfumes were strong and following some type of originality but this new edition is nice it is not a horrible perfume just for me it is nothing to get excited about and as usual the ones I liked are discontinued as the majority of their customer base found them too strong and these ones that I think are not so earth shattering are expanded upon with never ending flankers!!:)

Maybe in todays world strong just isn't what people want anymore but I do!",06/17/13 17:00,takeasniff
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I don't get those bad rewievs.
This is not that bad. I actually like it... a lot!
More heat and deeper than the original Guilty, a great favorite of mine.
The greatest difference is in the dry down part. There is something vanilla-like scent, patchuli..?
As i've always hated vanillatic scents, this is improvement for me. Dior Hypnotic Poison is absolutely the worst vanilla-oriental scent on earth.
Gucci Guilty black is fresh, warm, sweet and at the end; vanilla.
An for the record; not a granny scent at all.
I love this one.
I won't buy Guilty Intence version, I'll get this instead!",06/05/13 21:46,Perfumefreak
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"This is rather simular to the original but ""deeper"" if you will.
Its full of lilacs so if you don't care for the smell of lilacs, I suggest you steer clear of this. Personally, lilacs are my favorite flower of all time so I love the scent of it.
I don't even get a hint of red fruit-weird I know. Its all about lilacs on my skin-there is depth and sweetness on the drydown, no doubt from amber and patchouli. Patchoili normally lasts longer on me and this is no exception. I get about 3 hours out of it, although after first hour or so, its mostly skin scent but you can still smell it. So far I really like it-normally I like to smell like dessert but this is definately nice for a change.
I will say that I don't see this as ""sexy"" which is what all the ads seem to imply. With this name and ads, I would imagine this would be an oriental scent but its anything but(quite misleading). Also, fragrance itself is red which I find rather offputting. They could have just went with red glass bottle instead of making liquid red which can stain your clothes if you are not careful
However, I am thinking about buying this scent if I get a good deal on it. So on the scale from 1 to 5, I would give it a 4 because lasting power is not that great.",05/13/13 12:32,aqua76239
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"It's nice, but so soft, just not so much existence and barely can be smelled. And, by the way, realized most of Gucci's fragrances are not very strong. Flora is one the exceptions.",04/23/13 23:37,Hrisi
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I am shocked at the negative reveiws of this. I think it's because GUCCI is becoming so popular people must exploit it to make others look good....

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I am kind of disappointed with this new scent from Gucci. Such a beautiful bottle and advertisment photo made me expect some mystical and shopisticated scent, unfortunately on my skin this does smell just artificial.",03/11/13 10:39,mirisfrik
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"I tested this the other day on my wrist and I agree with other reviewers who say it smells too much like the original or of nothing much at all but I have been wearing the Intense version my husband brought a while ago and I have to say the mandarine orange persists on me and mixes with the patchouli and the iris and I like that mixture but sometimes the mandarine orange can come across a little citrusy and scratchy.

I feel with this version the cherry and the strawberry give it a sweetness but a smooth sweetness not a sharp note persisting like the mandarine orange. I felt this one settled nicely and lasted quite a while on my wrist. Due to the fact that I have really enjoyed the Guilt Intense once I have finished that I would consider trying this because I do like this style of perfume Gucci has released and I would like to see how I go wearing it over a long period of time and I do like flankers so there are several reasons for me that I would give it a try but if the mandarine orange didn't bother you in the first one then you could stick to that one this one is very similar.

If you are like me and liked the first one but would like to try the strawberry and cherry version then this is worth a try because these notes I think are noticeable in this flanker enough to bother with it.

I don't like the black bottle I think they should have done a rose gold colour to keep in the line of gold Guilty bottles and to reflect the sweetness this one has as it is more of a pink, gently smell certainly not evoking thoughts of a black and red bottle these colours to me are too harsh to represent this smell.",03/10/13 23:13,takeasniff

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"With all this marketing hype this is the exact kind of stuff i wouldn't dream of testing in a shop. But since I got a free sample, curiosity won and I dabbed it on.... It opens with a blast of sweet and sour perfumy berryness that is ever so 110ties (that's 20 yrs after the nineties). After a little while I thought it was pleasantly bearable, like in the way of a Guerlain Petite robe Noire or a Black XS or Armani Black Carat. But hold on, this one is different and not in a good way. It's not even that there is anything specific or any note here that would put me off. This one is different. It puts me off by the absence of any edge or naturality, it smells very synthetic. Sorry I cannot like this but the good thing is it doesn't hurt very much either. Death by sameness and boredom, rather.",03/06/13 12:57,patxaran
Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"From the beginning til almost the very end I smell nothing but a red berry juice. Reminds me of my childhood and the birthdays when homemade juice was offered as a drink - at first a bit sour, and second serving horribly sweet of all the added sugar. Exactly how Gucci Guilty Black develops. With the exception of detecting some velvety softness on top of everything somewhere in the dry down faze, just right before it turns into a ""plum and black currant jam with vanilla"" on my skin.
As for the floral side - none! Can't find any lilies (why is it mentioned as lilacs on the introduction text?) nor violets.
Seems like this production really is about the packaging, advertising and media buzz, just as the proportions of the introduction text indicates. Sadly.",03/06/13 11:12,meret

Gucci Guilty Black Pour Femme Gucci,"Seriously? Well, Guilty was a miss for me. Premiere was... way more horrible, I hated it so much xD

Guilty Back is tolerable and wearable. It is pleasant, mild patchouli with berries and mild spiciness, well balanced, nice and really unnecessary. There is no point in this edition. At all. Except for making money. Why? It reminded me Givenchy perfumes. I think it's really similar to Play.

I put 5 sprays on my sleeve and it wasn't too intense at all, sillage is quite medium and for this amount of sprays I'd prefer it to be more loud. I've worked night shift this night and can fairly say that on skin it lasts maybe for 5 hours.

There is nothing special, no thrill, no sex and nothing interesting whatsoever. I'm sorry, but these generic flankers bore me. Well, it smells lovely, but that's it. It's like it's made for a day you want to put on something when you really don't care what.

Other point. After an hour or so I started to notice that it smells kind of like a cheap fragrance like... It does smell a bit cheap. Same was with previous one.

I have since turned into a fragrance enthusiast and wanted my first Fragrantica review to be for this fragrance! I think I discovered it when a salesperson at a department store offered it to me, it wasn't something I sought out. No one note stood out and it just settled into my skin so nicely. Sillage was small, but I didn't spray much and it could be noticed by those who were close to me. I had both the EDT and EDP over the years, but like others I preferred the EDT which had a soft, sweet richness.

Eden perfumes do a similar scent called Bye Goochi, but it’s not quite the same (although the dry down is very very similar, so it will have to do when I can’t source it anymore!).
This is my signature, wear anywhere, any time scent. It matches any outfit, work, date, sleep, it’s sooo versatile. I love the EDP too, but the EDT beats if for me, as the dry down is slightly fresher, both are amazing though and I have back up bottles of both!
I’m not a fan of Gucci in gerneral, I quite like bamboo and once used a bottle of it after a blind buy on a plane, but gucci by Gucci is such a stunning scent, so well put together I don’t even have words to describe how it smells. For those saying it doesn’t last maybe it’s a bit of noseblindness? As although the sillage isn’t huge, this lasts so long on me, I can literally smell it the day after I’ve sprayed it. Love it.
Edit: The day after spraying on skin this has gone, but the EDPis still present as a skin scent. Both last days on clothes.

Edit. Just adding that I’ve bought this perfume regularly since it’s release. There has been no difference between my vintage bottles from the time of release or the newer ones I’ve bought or been gifted in 2018, 2019 and 2020. I’ve bought many, many bottles of this and the EDP, and due to keeping back up bottles I can directly compare different years. These are my signature scent, I would know.

The patch is present throughout the life of the perfume (and it is a long life - longevity is 6-7 hours on my dry skin). The pear lightens and brightens the heavy patch, and gives it a shimmery quality that is feminine and fun.

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I blind bought both the EDP and EDT for good prices, and for the first time, I think I prefer the EDT.

The EDP is a pear/guava-green patchouli moving into honey and musk before being boring and faint after 2 hours. I feel ""meh"" about it.

The EDT isn't much stronger, but it's brighter and sparkles a bit. The fruit is amped up, a bit juicy. And hot damn-- that honey is delicious. Mmmm.... I think I'm going to really like this... After the burst of juicy fruit, the honey is giving me this foodie-cookie-spicy-creamy vibe. Patchouli is just supporting other notes here.

But, it's been like 5 minutes and I'm losing most of the scent. F**K!

Well, I'll go spray-happy and won't re-purchase. Phoooey.

Seriously, 10 minutes later on tissue... a sweet musk.

With a proper wear, I found out... The whole scent goes thru it's stages in about 20-30 minutes. First blast of juicy fresh fruit, then sweet honey/foodie/creamy flowers, and then musk. Bam. Done.
Sure, the tissue test from yesterday is a faint musk- kinda patchy but musk.
I layered with Britney Believe, and I also think this would layer well with Elie Saabs. Basically, this would layer with almost anything because it's light and disappointing.

With notes of guava and pear in the top, and patchouli in its base, I guess Gucci by Gucci EDT qualifies as a fruitchouli. This is a very interesting take on the whole fruitchouli trend, and one that I find very classy - unkike, say, La Vié est Belle or Jimmy Choo (not that I don't like those -I actually have them both in my collection), but somehow this one feels more elegant in comparison. It is sweet without being girly and soft without being faint.",02/08/16 22:04,raverdudes

What i can honestly say, it make me feel like I'm in an old library, kind of has the old books smell on me, which I f***ing adore! Thinking of making this my signature scent just because I love books ;)

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"There was a fragrance from Amway in the ""ancient"" times, called Ciel de Nuit. This one is soo similar! I had mixed feelings with it and so do I with Gucci EDT, both of them has that medicinal band-aid smell I can't stand. Except this they are bold'n'sweet, warm feminine scents, memorable and quite unique, though Gucci EDT fades too fast.
update: after a year of sniffing my sample and using it up at the end, I bought a small bottle of it and love it!
I consider it as a year-round fragrance as it fits to both warm summer nights and cold winter days. It's sweet but somewhat fresh and juicy at the same time, with just the right amount of patchouli to balance it out. Reminds me a bit of Signorina Eleganza plus the honey note, but this one has way more character. Longevity is also better than thought initially.",02/27/15 09:39,aiisha
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I actually prefer this to the EDP which I purchased on the false notion that it would smell the same, only with lasting power. The EDT was heady and beautiful -until six hours later when it disappeared ENTIRELY. The scent was altered also. The EDT is somewhat of a hybrid between the Gucci Flora EDT and the Gucci Gucci EDP. Often fragrance companies will slightly alter an EDT for marketing purposes and, yes, that has so happened here. Same scent but different.

I wish I'd bought the EDT and will pick one up to layer over the EDP in an attempt to try to retain the fragrance for longer!

On another note, I have tested all of the Gucci fragrances and will say I really like the way that they complement each other. There's somewhat of a continuum of scent between them which creates a lovely wardrobe of fragrances.",11/10/14 20:47,sasha.heywood

They aren't boring such as very soft feminine perfumes .It is really strange how our taste change and grow, I kept looking at the review in astonishment that I hated this perfume one day. Now it is one of my favourites.",09/02/14 03:17,fatooma

It's not loud. It's a thick and hazy bubble of scent that sticks close to you, but projects enough so that anyone in your personal space will be able to smell you.

This is quite nice, but not as powerful as I was hoping for. I'll definitely use it up, but I think I may try on the edp and see if that has the personality I was hoping for.

All in all, this is a wonderful fragrance, makes me yearn for crisp fall air to pair it with.",08/03/14 03:08,mooglebuns

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"I fell in love with this perfume almost instantly; I received my full bottle yesterday. I was searching for a new fragrance to replace my old signature - Coco Mademoiselle - and while I love that one I wanted something still sophisticated but a little more ""fun"" I suppose.. This perfume is perfection. When you first spray it it is quite in-your-face patchouli (which I personally love) but then as it dries it settles down into this wonderful blend of sweetness and honey with the patchouli taking a back seat. The guava and pear are not tropical at all, just blending with the honey to make a sheer sweetness. It smells classy and elegant but also playful and feminine with the lily and neroli appearing as it starts to fade. It unfortunately only lasts for a couple of hours on my skin but I enjoy it so much that I don't mind having to re-spray.. It just means I get to smell the wonderful progression of this perfume over and over again throughout the day. It screams luxury but in a modern, youthful way. I feel confident and know I smell amazing when I wear this. Best blind buy I have ever made, and my new signature. <3",11/19/13 05:41,ledavis727

If you are thinking of purchasing this or the EDP I would recommend giving this one a try first considering like I said I grew to like this one because that first spray was a little in your face, not a bad in your face like ""old lady"" just much stronger than I thought but I judged it wrong the dry down really softens up and leaves behind a beautiful sensual fragrance. I can't wait to wear this in winter I think it is a classic!

Gucci by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Gucci edt by Gucci is a modern chypre floral with notes of guava, pear, and patchouli taking the center stage.
The guava in it is elegant and cold, nothing tropical about it. The patchouli is light and refreshing and looses its bitterness when paired with pears and honey. I find that most perfumes by gucci share a sharp metallic note in the opening that doesn't agree with me. This one has it too, but it mellows down and softens once it has warmed up on my skin. Honeyed pear and florals gives it a clean, modern twist which smells luxurious. I can imagine rich spoiled women, wives of arabian oil tycoons spritzing themselves with this scent on their way to the mall for yet another shopping spree.  Reserved and snooty, this is how the rich smell like :)",05/15/13 01:43,fragaholic79

I made a mistake. At the beginning all I can smell is a slightly rotten fruit note and some fishy background. It is very powerful for about half an hour, then it tones down, luckily, to something lightly woody and pleasant, I guess the beeswax note is quite prominent in the end and it is actually the only thing I like. It is definitely not a fragrance for me, I don't have the guts to undergo the unpleasant notes you get at the beginning waiting for it to tone down and become nice.

Gucci brings a spohisticated, posh woman to my mind. Some of Gucci's fragrances create an imagination of a mean one, too. I can't help it...

After about 30 minutes it softened and the unbearable (at least for me) heaviness turned into a much lighter fruity sweetness which soon started to mix with gentle floral notes. Not so unpleasant any more but I must admit that for me this fragrance lacks the wow-factor. I do not think it is badly composed but for some reason it smells like something I know way too well. Maybe I just smell it on too many people on the street or there really is something very similar.
In general not a bad fragrance but it is too predictable for me and my nose is not very impressed.",01/24/11 10:21,Martyna
Gucci by Gucci Eau de Toilette Gucci,"Very, very shy and generic. At the opening I can feel fruits, mostly pear, there is some ""flowery"" feeling and I think I can detect some shy rose, even if it's not listed. Honeysuckle is there, but very shy and almost unnoticable, only giving some sweet honey-like accord. For me there is some masculine patchoulli, but as with other notes - barely there.
What can I say?
Well. It's a crowd pleaser, could be gifted to almost every bussiness woman who needs an office scent.

And what do I dislike? That it's generic, almost resembles every fruity floral, patchoulli just saves the day. And don't call it a ""chypre"", just because of patchoulli added.

At any rate, the Gucci is a beautiful example of a modern chypre floral. In spite of those fruity top notes, the fragrance is not really fruity on my skin. I think those fruits just soften the flowers a little bit. There's a faint whisper of sweetness, but nothing too juicy. The EDT gets to the dry-down pretty quickly and stays there for hours. I found this fragrance to have decent longevity in this concentration, but it stayed very close to the skin all day. I may seek out the EDP for what I hope will be a little more ""oomph.""

So you might have already noticed that I'm trying to say this fragrance is old-fashioned and it's such a cliche one from those years. But do I like it? Sure. Would I recommend it for everyone? HELL NO.
This fragrance is not for everyone, but it's mostly for people who adore nostalgia and have a thing for it, so if you prefer modern and minimalist perfumes like Gucci Flora series this might not be yours. This perfume takes you on a journey of different fragrances; now some might love this, and others hate it. That's why I recommend you try a sample before buying a full bottle. In the end, the fragrance is fruity and so juicy with a delightful touch of floral scent, but IMO mostly fruity. It's not modest at all, and it's not going there either, especially first notes, so if you've got a sensitive nose, this one might give you a great headache. Even though it's a strong fragrance, yet it's suitable for both daily and occasional usage, and it's not bothering for people around you and it's a good one for almost every season.",08/18/25 04:44,Nimadai

This reminds me very much of Adidas Adrenaline for women, and a Victoria Secret perfume called Bombshells in Bloom. And maybe even Clinique Happy in Bloom 2014.",07/29/25 13:51,FlowerSeeker
Envy Me Gucci,"Smells like a combo of hairspray,deodorant,lip gloss and body lotion.Very floral and powdery with a hint of sweetness.
I dont like it but its nostalgic.",07/09/25 03:53,Nimu
Envy Me Gucci,Gosh I miss this and the original Gucci guilty women’s perfume! Why do they discontinue their best perfumes !,05/27/25 11:59,emibebi
Envy Me Gucci,I remember loving this in the 00s. Today I got a whiff of Super Moon by Carner Barcelona and the scent was sooo familiar but I could not place it initially. However I suddenly recalled Envy Me and I am fairly certain that it was the reason for the familiarity. If you love Envy Me I highly recommend you to check out Super Moon!,03/26/25 04:48,maisonsomething
Envy Me Gucci,"Mousuf Daisy is the exact dupe of this!!!!!!! This is my highschool scent and I've been looking for it high and low.

Envy Me Gucci,Mysterious and sexy. Does anyone have a sample they can sell? The full bottles are so expensive on ebay and I loved this perfume but discontinued.,02/02/25 10:20,gwmagic77
Envy Me Gucci,I bought this bottle in my 20’s when it first released. I’m now 41 and I found it!! It’s 20 years old and it still smells absolutely stunning!!,11/21/24 21:57,Rosemailee
Envy Me Gucci,They need to bring it back!,11/20/24 20:05,emibebi
Envy Me Gucci,This is one of my Favorite fragrance EVER! Finding a replacement seems to be impossible! I’m so 💔 Please if anyone sees this and can recommend a dupe or something extremely close it would be immensely appreciated!! The fragrances listed above as similar for Gucci Envy Me in my opinion is not accurate at all. Thanks in advance 🤞🏼🙏🏼😊,10/09/24 12:31,Tlovesscents
Envy Me Gucci,Still crying everyday that this is gone *sniff*,07/13/24 19:53,keikofelix
Envy Me Gucci,"I used to love this when I was a teen. Lovely, fresh, juicy, good-vibe, and youthful scent for the spring and summer. It's definitely a day aroma, but I could also imagine it on a nice summer evening, for example, for a walk on the beach. Imo it's more of a sweet light floral than fruity. I don't detect any tobacco or musk. The big surprise is how durable it is - solid 8+ hours on my skin and hair, and even more on clothes, which is very unusual for a floral fresh scent. It brings back memories, so I like it, but even if it were still available, I wouldn't wear it regularly - I'm turning 36 soon, and this perfume just feels inappropriate and unserious for a mature lady. Luckily, I have found a very cheap dupe (7 euros!) that is stunningly similar and just as durable as the original. It's a Turkish brand called Sansiro. This dupe, of course, I keep in my collection and use it whenever I am in a girly, nostalgic mood.",02/21/24 00:18,IVamp
Envy Me Gucci,"I used to love the original Gucci Envy. My mum brought me a bottle of Envy Me in error and I didn't really like it but i kept it anyway because it was from my mum. I wasnt even aware back then that Gucci was a designer scent. I'm so glad I kept hold of it as I recently re tried it and I love it! So weird how our tastes change over the years isnt it! I've had that 50ml bottle since around 2005 and it's still as good as the day I got it, although I try to use it sparingly as it's not available anymore.
Such a shame Gucci Envy and Envy Me got discontinued",01/07/24 13:20,Missjojoh
Envy Me Gucci,"Fruity teas and fresh cut floral bouquets. This scent definitely gives me nostalgia for the early 2000s. It's bright and fresh, but not super light, it's more heady, rich, syrupy fruits and punchy flowers. A happy go lucky, confident, and beautiful woman well dressed in hot pink is who I picture wearing this scent. It'd work as a flirty date scent, and I think it would work in the daytime or evening and year round.",12/07/23 07:17,Pat_Chouli
Envy Me Gucci,"So sad that it discontinued…
It had been my all time favorite since when I was early 20s.
Ran out the last bottle I had and had to find something new. Settled with YSL Mon Paris for some reason. It’s way sweeter but I kinda like it. But I really wish they bring it back someday.
And like the other review said, Divain 154 is very very similar like almost 95% I would say. Top to middle is exactly the same but it dries down on my skin a little differently. It doesn’t last that long like Envy Me did, but it was like $25, so overall I’m very happy with that and it was a great purchase!",11/08/23 12:03,momooh
Envy Me Gucci,It's one of my all-time favorite old-school vibe perfume. I so much love the rose-mixed floral vibe of this. I did a review about this for my Zest Girls YT channel. I highly recommend this for a sensual romantic date night.,09/09/23 00:18,iluvzest
Envy Me Gucci,"It is fresh and clean, on me it lasts an hour, pleasant and easy reach, had to respray throughout the day. I’m not a fan of peony at all😐Unfortunately I couldn’t smell any of the drydown notes except a light musk. There are better freshies out there, just get Ocean di Gioia",06/26/23 17:32,Titiana
Envy Me Gucci,Hey perfume lovers! I finally find a dupe for this beauty.. it was really hard :D divainparfums.com has got the No. 154 which is more than 90% similar to Envy me. I recieved it yesterday and since than i'm just floating on nostalgia's cloud. It was my early 20s favourite scent.... the performance is good about 4-5 hours maybe more but i think is enough :) i'm really grateful for the experience <3,05/30/23 04:48,andiborzi
Envy Me Gucci,I wish they will bring this back.. my 1st designer perfume. So many memories with this scent. It smells really good in summer. Nothing ever smells like this perfume.,05/06/23 09:54,Chrysstin
Envy Me Gucci,"Definitely not getting most of the notes, but it is a fresh (not green) smelling beauty. I don’t love the scent of roses, but in this one I really like it. Do not overspray because this might be too much. Soft, girly, fresh, flirty.",04/14/23 22:47,Utopia76
Envy Me Gucci,To me this is an early 2000's version of a designer equivalent to Delina perfume without the middle eastern notes.,04/02/23 20:19,perfumelovere
Envy Me Gucci,"Pleasant but not groundbreaking. I was actually surprised when I looked at the notes... I definitely don't detect the tobacco in this, nor would I expect it to be part of the composition of a fragrance like this.

Envy Me is a bright, buoyant, feminine fragrance for spring. It is a happy and uplifting scent that is uncomplicated and projects a youthful, carefree essence.

The opening is fresh, fruity and floral. ""Juicy"" is how I would describe it. On me, the drydown leans heavily into the rose notes. This is not a fragrance with much projection, unfortunately. If you really want to project that happy, carefree, girly energy throughout your day, you may need to keep spraying this!",11/08/22 15:03,LaMiaRosa
Envy Me Gucci,"honestly it smells like a mix of sky di gioia and versace bright crystal it has a strong peony note and is fresh, not my cup of tea but it is nice and clean fragrance",10/24/22 18:13,kusama_nowaki_love
Envy Me Gucci,"This perfume smells exactly like Lehcaresor Rose Papier Poudre (powdered blotting paper) that my grandma used. This is more floral than fruity. I can barely smell the other fruity notes which is quite disappointing. It gives a linear scent because the rose and base notes are prominent all throughout. No matter how many times I smell it on my skin, clothes or bottle, I am hit with a dried roses bouquet or potpourri smell. It is heavier on the floral and also has a sharp, citrus scent probably from the pineapple. If you're a fan of rose scents then you might enjoy this.",08/23/22 20:15,lizelloves
Envy Me Gucci,"i got one many years ago for my wife when we happens to see this on a fragrance roadshow. it was quite a new fragrance then. being an asian, i find it familiar and different to other fragrance at the roadshow. recently i stumble on this webby and i realise why we choose this.",08/03/22 19:18,Fongee

Envy Me Gucci,"I coveted this perfume as a teen and would always spray it when going into Ulta or Sephora. It's sexy and flirty without being gourmand or vanilla. Upbeat and coquettish. I mainly smell the pink pepper, lychee, and peony with some musk. I love it and think it adds to any collection, the only downside is it being hard to find. It's one of the only fruitier leaning perfumes I like.",02/18/22 07:07,tinkerbell2614

Envy Me Gucci,"I first smelled this on someone else back in the day, didn't like it. She over-sprayed it, years later I tried it on me and i fell in love! Now been looking for it but sadly discontinued (i got stock up of 2 bottles and still searching for it)

For scent, to me it opens up sharp floral which i don't like that much but once it settles/dried down, my god i can't stop smelling myself! This perfume lasts on me quite nice at the end of the day i still can smell from my cloth but i gotta be close it to it though. Family and friends say at the end of the day they still can smell a very soft and light touch of it when i walk by.",09/30/21 09:32,faly.faye

Envy Me Gucci,"I was really excited about this scent and I do like it, however, the first sniff was all sweet soap. That pink pepper is no joke, the opening is like a spicy peony slapped me. The dry down though, excellent. It becomes this delicious gently sweet almost skin scent that I love. The aggressive opening doesn't last long thank god or I would regret getting it. I would say, if you are looking for a nonspicy floral, don't get this one.",04/13/21 19:11,NatRae
Envy Me Gucci,"It's definitely a nice floral scent and I like it, but I don't love it. Unfortunately it's just a bit too much peony and the lychee doesn't help! This one makes me sneeze every time! Pretty scent, but irritates my nose and reminds me of hayfever season.",03/13/21 23:59,LaMiaRosa
Envy Me Gucci,"You'll definitely find similarities in Versace Bright Crystal Absolu. I received my bottle of Versace and couldn't quite put my finger on the perfume that I had definitely smelled before. This is it. The pepper in Envy Me is very noticeable on me and the fruit is more tame than other fruity florals. This scent has a confident, edgy yet feminine feel if you could describe perfumes as a personality.",02/03/21 19:01,perfumelovere
Envy Me Gucci,"Ok, OK...I understand why some reviewers write this off as a typical fruity-floral frag, BUT...my sensitive sniffer picks up a lot of nuance in this. The opening brings lots of fruity-ness, but its across the spectrum from aquatic-juicy (litchi) to tangy and tropical (peach, pineapple), and it's all zipped up with the zesty pink pepper. In the middle is probably where Envy Me loses some people, it is a very classic peony-rose scent there. As the drydown unfolds, however, I get so much WHITE TEA peeking through the flowers and fruits, ahhh it's GLORIOUS! I love tea notes in perfume, especially white tea. Here, it melds wonderfully with the pineapple, musk, and woods notes. I can't get enough of the drydown. I came back to this perfume after not having sniffed it in about 15 years. It is as refreshing and enchanting as ever!",01/15/21 07:51,Soozatska
Envy Me Gucci,"I'll always have an appreciation for this perfume because it was given to me by my dad. My bottle is almost done and I am so sad.

I think it's a very pleasant, light, a bit fresh, a bit fruity, elegant but fun floral perfume.

Very enjoyable smell. I think it's complex and sophisticated enough to wear as a signature scent. I don't think anyone would have a problem with smelling this on somebody else, I think it's very likeable.

And if I smell this on you... I WILL envy you! 👿",11/11/20 23:49,Bebelusica
Envy Me Gucci,"Gosh, I really miss this scent y'all. I remember it was a gift from an ex that at first caught me off guard... I remember thinking the scent was odd_ too sharp and cold for me. At the time, I was always wearing Ralph and enjoyed that fruity and musky vibe. This was floral and peppery. So strange, and just not my style. However, I saw it was Gucci so I kept wearing it lol. I don't know at what point I decided I liked it, but I finished the huge bottle and was so sad when it was gone. I miss that scent, and feel that I could recognize it anywhere. Beyond sad it has been discontinued. Does anyone know where I could find a good dupe? Anyway, I miss this rose, pepper weirdo perfume, and it will always be one of my favorites. So fresh, chic and feminine :)",10/06/20 17:43,sparklyunicorn
Envy Me Gucci,"This is a truly beautiful, unique and complex composition. It is a fruity tobacco rose, so very juicy and extraordinary. Some things, like some perfumes, have just something about them, something you cannot put your finger on, a little something so alluring, so magnetic, so......... I do not have the proper words for Envy Me. It is the most beautiful romantic take on rose.",04/16/20 07:39,bel.gravia
Envy Me Gucci,"I remember the first time I tried 'Envy Me', on dry down it smelt like a beautiful medley of several flowers with rose, tuberose, marigold, magnolia, peony, jasmine, tagetes etc. irrespective of whether these notes are actually present or not. It also gave me the feeling of something just a tad bit like Dune, but if Dune was white gold, Envy Me was rose gold. We offer flowers at God's altar as a custom, and G-EM reminded me it. Also after drying down, it reminded me of the scent of a Sunsilk shampoo in the 90s with a silver shimmer and beautiful mauve / lavendar colour. But of late, I tried it, it felt like the petals were plucked out and whatever remained of it. Some people say its a meh scent, but I know it WAS NOT meh from what I recollect. I think the formula has changed several times to mimic popular perfumes. Such a metamorphosis in the formula in keeping up with the times, but I still miss that beautiful scent of old that is still fresh in my memory.",01/10/20 01:16,judeaqua

Envy Me Gucci,"This is one fresh and energetic fragrance that never fails to draw in the compliments! I first received my first bottle as a gift from my cousin. When I finished the bottle, I decided that I loved it enough to purchase a large bottle for myself. This fragrance is cheeky, youthful and full of spunk! Suitable for 20-something women on the go, but I still love it today as a 30-something woman still on the go ;).",06/20/19 01:05,novarenata
Envy Me Gucci,"My first time wearing this I HATED it, but either my nose, tastes, or body chemistry has changed, because I tried it again today on a lark and have to say I'm enjoying it.The first time I tried it I thought it was a really immature, fake-fruity scent. Even the drydown smelled soapy to me. I do still find the top notes overwhelmingly synthetic and I don't really get any florals out of it, but it's a very fresh/clean smell, and since I was just out of the shower, it worked for me today. I noticed as I was driving that the warmer I got, the more whiffs of really fresh soapy smell I got. Like a fresh shampoo kind of smell (I hadn't washed my hair, though). About two hours later, I got a nice berry scent from my wrists, which was unexpected but really pleasant. I assume that was the lychee coming through. Finally, the drydown came out as a subtly sweet, gently musky scent. I didn't get any sandalwood, but musk and tonka beans seems about right.

I'm really glad a gave Envy Me another shot, I was about to get rid of my bottle. But the complexity and character of this will keep my trying it for a while.",04/30/19 18:26,Sahagala

Envy Me Gucci,"I love this fragrance! I first bought it during a crazed collecting phase when I had run out of interesting ideas and saw this sitting on a shelf at a discount store. I sprayed it a few times initially, and didn't feel the love (thought it was just ok - because I was at that point just coming out of a major niche phase), but things completely changed as the months went on. For some reason I placed this one next to my bed (I have a bedtime ritual of testing perfumes) and it stayed there. I tried it again several times in the following months and slowly fell in love. Each time I spray this I think it's more and more beautiful - not just beautiful, but perfect. It's an EDT, but wears like an EDP. This is a fragrance that requires multiple wearings and maybe several chances.. I wasn't that excited originally, but now am looking for backup bottles because this is one I would be obsessively seeking if it were ever discontinued.",02/18/19 23:34,najgirl
Envy Me Gucci,"Sweet, pretty, peony with some sparkling fruitiness. My now-husband bought this for me circa 2006 and it brings back happy memories.

Envy Me Gucci,"My first Gucci fragrance, a small vial was included in a recent purchase. At first I was quite excited to try this famous house frag, but that excitement evaporated quickly - unlike the perfume! It does have staying power, I'll give it that much.
Envy me is sweet and fruity, there's a strong note of peach or nectarine. Sadly, I don't get any litchi, which I happen to love to eat.
There's nothing really wrong with Envy me, but there's nothing really special about it either. It seems like I've smelled frags like this before, but didn't bother to purchase the bottle.
This is the problem with many modern frags, especially the sweet/sugary/fruity ones - they're a bit thin, a little predictable and almost interchangeable. There's a cheapness to frags that depend on fruits and sugars. How many fruit notes can be incorporated before the frag becomes a fruit salad?
I'm probably too fond of classic fragrances to fully appreciate the modern scents, but I doubt that many of the modern fruit scents will stand the test of time to become classics.
Envy me will be a nice addition to a sample box, someone else will surely appreciate this frag.",09/02/18 11:40,Phantomias

Envy Me Gucci,"I was a teen around 2005 and practically begged my mom to buy me this one from the local perfume shop. It smell véry fruity, but with a bit of kick from the pepper, so it doesn't come across as overly sugary, and it dries down to a rose/musk on my skin. It evokes low-rise bootcut jeans, small purses, shimmery eyeshadows and an overload of mid-OO's pink in my mind :-) I think most people boght it for the logo on the bottle, which was a big thing back then.",05/15/18 05:11,katrienlejeune
Envy Me Gucci,"Just got it and since it was discontinued I thought I'd grab it, first spray was pretty impressive, some sort of musky, flowery with a tobacco note. Then later it started not working for me. Smelled pretty awful, synthetic, heavy unpleasant something like unwashed clothes or such. I don't know why it would smell so bad and cheap like from oriflame or whatever maybe was the expired discontinued batch who knows. Really disappointed.",05/03/18 05:35,variationss
Envy Me Gucci,"for me this is very lichi - and I love it as a drastic change from my normal oriental taste (YSL opium / Elie Saab Intense EDP). When I cannot take them in summer, this sort of flowery citric grapefruity and lichee thing works really well.

In summer I stay away from the oriental and goes back to the basics :)

Enjoy",04/07/18 01:30,yankihan
Envy Me Gucci,"What can I say. Gucci Envy Me is another guilty pleasure of mine,. It is totally basic, for the 20-25 demographic, and maybe that is why. I love peonies, pepper and pomegranates, which is why I'm drawn to this. If this scent was a human, it would have been the popular girl circa 2004. Think Mean Girls, but not as mean. Definitely unabashedly flirty, without being too sugary or over the top.",04/03/18 09:55,Scentses

Envy Me Gucci,"Review below is mine, fragrantica has played up on me lately..

I bought this from Europe while I was on holiday back in July/August.
I didn't use it, up until I came back home. To be honest, this didn't do anything in summer/spring for me absolutely nothinggg.
The notes looked lovely, but I couldn't pick out anything. I started thinking it was generic/cheap smelling. So I put it amongst my other perfumes. Not touched for quiet a while.
Tonight I was trying on a few perfumes because I have an engagement coming up.
I thought (give it ago) and to my surprise guess whatttt? It finally worked!!! Like I was freaking out lol. This smells a little medicinal but it's fruity GOODNESS!
Very chic type & girly❤️
In all that being said, I sprayed it on at 8PM it's now 12AM & I can still smell it.
I guess perfumes that don't work on me during the day, work on me at nights.
It's lovely.
My new night time fruity favourite. I'll be spraying away because I have a full bottle & not many fruity fragrances work on me at nights except for Sofia Vergara!",02/19/18 05:23,Selena

Envy Me Gucci,"On first spritz I immediately thought fresh, juicy, fruity floral fragrance- nothing spectacular, but nothing bad, just pleasant. However, there is something very artificial and synthetic about the drydown in this fragrance. It smells of a child's expensive doll, you know the ones that are made out of a rubbery plastic type material so that the skin looks and feels somewhat like real skin. This is what the drydown is like, with hints of mango and rose in the background. I honestly detect no other notes except from mango and rose in this scent and do not understand why all the other notes were thrown in as they are undetectable to the nose. I wouldn't buy this, smelling of a synthetic plastic rubber doll is not what I am looking for in a fragrance. This was a miss for me personally. there is a reason why it is cheaper than the other Gucci's, this is just not in the same league.

Sillage is very poor, your skin will simply smell like a rubbery plastic doll.",11/20/17 19:57,polkadot27
Envy Me Gucci,"Girly, SPRING-ly feminine type of scent. Fits perfectly for those who love Peony and Rose. Its not cloying but I'd rather use this sparingly, as the humid hot weather can render this watery thin and will have very poor longevity. I was expecting more since this seems to be the baby sister of the original Envy. You could do better than this Gucci!

More suited to cool weather, a 3.5 out of a 5",10/01/17 03:53,Fragrantnatic
Envy Me Gucci,"Pretty but boring. Looks and smells like something you can buy at Avon for 1/10 of the price.

Envy Me Gucci,"Envy Me is very pretty, flirty, fun and easy to wear. The litchi, peony and rose are most prominent yet blend seamlessly so that none of them overpowers. Although this is a nice perfume, there's nothing that distinguishes it from the abundance of other rose/peony-based fruity florals...if you already own one of them, you don't need this one too.",07/29/17 09:43,Gemini12

Envy Me Gucci,"Fruity floral that is balanced and non linear, I can absolutely see why it got so popular.

One of the few representatves of this genre that I really like. Sweet fruits are grounded with some darker notes of seringa, sandalwood, ad musk while the whole composition is being freshened up with a shampoo-like floral notes.

Freshness and tackiness united to produce a sense of a feminine étalon, as madly as it sounds,it simply works.

It also reminds me of how a good beauty parlour smells.",03/06/17 22:24,PastelMoon
Envy Me Gucci,"I've been wanting to try on this perfume since I've been looking for a summer/spring fragrance and saw several people on the net suggesting this. They also say it draws compliments and I've been also on the lookout for such - so I was so excited when this bottle arrived.

I saw so many people here commenting that this fragrance is forgettable and not unique but I beg to disagree. I believe that yeah, it's somewhat reminiscent to a lotion I have sniffed before (still a good thing) - but that's it. The combination of the notes for me is great. They are nothing I have smelled before.

I love this. I've always been blind-buying perfumes (I know, not a good thing to do). And so far - this Gucci Envy Me is that top perfume that I did not regret getting.

All in all - I love that the scent is light: floral/fruity with a hint of masculinity and green notes. Ahhhh, I love sniffing it on my wrist. When the wind blows on me, I could smell other notes I cannot decipher. Haha. Soooo lovely. Contemplating on making this my signature perfume. Guess I have to look on other Gucci perfumes too.

Also, this is one perfume that has good sillage. I seldom have a bottle of perfume that I smell around me immediately. Most perfumes I got, has to be sprayed a lot before I could smell it on me but this one's soooo great - considering it's just an EDT!!!!

Bottomline: if you love fruity/floral scents that are NOT overly sweet, you should try this!

P.S.
I love the bottle! So chic and girly. Looks plasticky at first but it's sturdy.

What can I say? I do not hate anything about this perfume. 10/10 for me.

EDIT:
I am loving this perfume, really. Really. The pink pepper adds some oomph to it!! Plus, the drydown is superb! Creamy sort-of vanillic floral (if that's possible). Lovely!! Ugh, cannot get enough of sniffing on my wrists.",01/05/17 02:28,chere.017
Envy Me Gucci,"This is such an all-rounder crowd pleaser for spring, summer and the beach! On me it lasts all day and I get so many compliments from both men and women. This is not a complicated or sexy fragrance, but in terms of floral summer fragrances go, at least it's clean, classy and sassy!",11/02/16 13:45,Faverinsky
Envy Me Gucci,Peony.... Envy me...,10/12/16 12:34,fbutrau
Envy Me Gucci,"I like the opening composition of happy fruits. When the peony and litchi come in the scent softens and becomes creamy tropical. Base is musky with a hint of rose. It's a likable fragrance, but is there anything to envy a woman wearing it?",10/03/16 04:50,dyaver
Envy Me Gucci,"Smells like grease at the initial spray, it must be the tobacco. Very harsh & rough but it settled in about a minute. After that the litchi dominated with some peony, and something a bit musky... The more it developed on my skin the more note that i really love in perfumes come out, it is ROSE. Yes, it becomes more rossy after that. But not a straight away roses. It's smells more like fresh-sweet/fruity-woody/spicy-ROSES with really good warm feeling at the dry down. I don't get the juicy pineapple, pomegranate & the pink pepper that much, well maybe just a hint. It does smells a bit spicy from the pink pepper & tobacco. Jasmine, ermmm she is lost & left somewhere behind this time but i hope i can smell her a bit actually. Envy Me smells a bit masculine but settled to a very romantic & pretty sweet roses. In my opinion this is not a casual scent, it's more for a formal, work or any event & all year around kind of scent. Anytime, day or night, hot day or cold. It's versatile. But 1 thing i've noticed about Envy Me, been 2 weeks wearing it when i wore it outdoor under hi-temperature, the sweet-spicy smells of tobacco seems lauder than the fruits but at least i'm sweat a bit then the sweet-fruity-woody-roses will show themself. Litchi, she's really star of the show in cold day. But you can't get away from the roses & peony. Dare i say Envy Me smell quite similar to Versace Bright Crystal because both have the same fresh vibes. But obviously Bright Crystal is more to aquatic-fruity/citrusy-floral, while Envy Me is more to fresh-fruity-rossy with some spicy/woody twist in it. Let's just say, Envy Me is a darker/formal-elegant version of Bright Cristal. About the perfomance, it has very impressive longevity for an EdT. Lasts all day on me even after shower, still got some of it left on my skin. Projects moderately. 'Like' for Envy Me, not yet 'Love' it i think eventho i love rose perfumes. But this stuff is a must have. Wearable & likeable.",09/07/16 05:28,GGLiCious

Envy Me Gucci,"Wonderful smell, warm and soft. Opens fresh at the beginning due to the pineapple and becomes more and more rosy and smooth. It's romantic and tender and easy to wear all day. If you are looking for a fresh but warm rose scent, this is perfect and unique.",07/14/16 05:56,HillTop
Envy Me Gucci,It is a nice scent for hot summer days.,06/16/16 10:58,Betsywoolbright
Envy Me Gucci,"bouquet of nice flowers. That's what I smell. Delicate, pleasant, but I don't picture a mature woman wearing this. More for teens and youngsters. Moderate longetivity, and the sillage isn't that good.",05/30/16 20:36,Unqsgrtuku
Envy Me Gucci,the first spray is very heavy on apricot which I found it's quite similar to Incanto Heaven. The drydown is like every other floral-fruity category.,05/25/16 02:27,Toom_Snoopy
Envy Me Gucci,"I like it I smelled it one day when I was buying my favorite Gucci rush I asked to smell this perfume I liked it soft and pine-apply, someone complimented me the first I wore it, I love the exotic smell makes me feel like im on an island or going to get there somehow, I will just continue sniffing this n the meantime",04/19/16 13:18,melime87
Envy Me Gucci,"This is a very sexy scent, even the name is provocative. I smell the tobacco but its mostly fruity and fresh. It smells very young and modern. I have been wanting it for a while and although it was a blind buy i dont regret it. im actually happy to have this apart of my collection.",03/22/16 13:01,VioletNoir
Envy Me Gucci,"Don't know if I like it or not.
I used to wear it in highschool and I found it so cool.
Now I'm almost 30 and I don't know.
Thing is, I still find it cool and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to!

It's a somewhat annoying floral, with harsh green notes (they scratch in your throat) and tropical fruity notes. I cannot really smell any of the notes listed, it's like a multifruit juice: Taste somehow like fruit but one cannot say which actual fruits. And this smells somehow like flowers, but one cannot really detect any actual flower's smell.
But still, it smells cool and I think I'm going to buy it again.",03/17/16 14:52,lala-jaenner
Envy Me Gucci,"Fruity, floral, fresh. Somehow both young and dated at the same time, which is confusing. Like all fresh scents I have tried so far, I can only picture myself wearing this when going to the gym.",03/01/16 06:30,Madrona
Envy Me Gucci,"I usually really don't like fruity fragrances but this is quite fresh and pleasant. Quite subtle, I don't think I tested enough to get a good impression but I don't see this offending anyone. It is the tea, musk and pepper which really balances it out, this is almost aquatic, it's fresh like I said, it hasn't got any sickly fruit notes which usually turn me off. Very pleasant. Sillage and longevity is only moderate, I can imagine someone who has projection issues might need to apply this pretty frequently.",11/18/15 16:43,Jmalone84

Envy Me Gucci,why dont you better just describe the scent Georgia?? lol..,07/17/15 08:13,lulu169
Envy Me Gucci,"This is more fruity (sour and fresh kind of fruity not sticky sweet kind of fruity) than floral on me in the heat of tropical weather. No pepper at all. Have a strong tea scent if i sprays this on clothes.

Definitely make a cool light summer scent.

I hate the TV commerial. It doesn't make sense at all. The whole heavily mark up woman and a (half?) naked guy in an dark place with lots of leaf and a snake???? The TV commercial is so disconnected with the actual scent in this glass/pink patterned bottle, it is almost embarrassing to watch.",07/01/15 23:04,AnnaT
Envy Me Gucci,"I bought it from a shop which allowed testing and I had no idea why I bought this. This was the perfume I hated most among everything I ever owned. Cheap, fruity, way too sweet - there is no sophistication whatsoever to it. Could not bring myself to finish it.",04/30/15 04:04,mischievous1010
Envy Me Gucci,"Love this very much! Just perfect spring/summer scent!
Nothing 'cheap' in this fragrance!",04/22/15 05:29,cityangel

Envy Me Gucci,"The peony in this made me think of bright crystal. But they re not too similar to me. Bright crystal is much brighter (just as the name suggested :p) and more aquatic. While envy me is fruitier and somewhat less birght. It's as if envy me is bright crystal under a veil, with extra smoky fruits.",04/17/15 07:07,lilymama22
Envy Me Gucci,"Gucci Envy Me is one of those girl next door perfumes that's pretty, fun and flirty. Unfortunately, I also found it to be flat and forgettable.

On my skin, this is very synthetic. This scent is familiar to me, so I've definitely smelt it on others before. It's a little sweet, a little green, and also complex, clean and soapy. It reminds me of shampoo. The dry-down is a nondescript fruity-floral smell. In Envy Me's favour, it isn't too sweet, and I think it's unlikely to offend anyone.

All in all, it doesn't sing on my skin, so I don't really care for it. To each their own :) Sillage is soft; lasts for about 4-5 hours.",02/23/15 16:46,RosieRachel
Envy Me Gucci,My favorite scent as of now. It last 2 hours on my skin. But scent still smells on my blouse. Makes me feel nice.,02/14/15 23:55,zaixhi
Envy Me Gucci,"I got this once as present I couldnt believe my friend would associate this with me. At the time it didnt smell similar to anything and while it was a perfect teen scent I didnt know what to do with it. It was too girly fruity sweet it just wasnt me. I wore it all year round and finally emptied the 100ml bottle. Now I agree burberry smells similar which makes burberry generic, not gucci.
Even though I didnt appreciate this happy scent at the time as it didnt match my grumpy state of mind I am thankful I had it, it changes the way I look at that period of my life it somehow seems like happy times.
P.s. I've got this memory in my mind I had this before 2004 ....I am pretty sure it was before that as I had moved out in 2004..hm...",02/07/15 11:18,Plamka
Envy Me Gucci,"I agree with people who say this perfume 'smells cheap'. It does. I usually like flowery scents, but this one isn't that good for me. Maybe because that 'sharp' feel when I sniff it. The dry down isn't very nice either.",01/20/15 01:47,luceluca

Envy Me Gucci,"At first application the notes are kinda complex, like a synthetic smelling soap. But having high hopes for Gucci, I gave it another try, rub it off and after 15 minutes.. Hhmmmm.. the drydown develops nicely into a clean, floral scent with a hint of tea - WONDERFUL!
After a few more minutes, i've detected its resemblance with Burberry Brit Sheer which I also own. Very girly and cheerful! Good sillage but lacks longevity and uniqueness.",09/30/14 12:29,kattleia

I think it's not for me..",09/06/14 02:51,agnesabell
Envy Me Gucci,"This smells like drunk (on pina colada) sex in the Carribbean :) -smells like rich kids having an exotic carefree vacation -its yummy,exotic, melts on your skin and it goes to your head.
Its rare that a perfume smells so delish, like bubble gum and shampoo, but still has a bitter sort of base,that gives sofistication, and has such a sillage and longevity.(incredible for a EDT), it melts in my pores and becomes my own skin's smell.
I dont see this being the most appropriate ""business"" perfume as stated below, but I do see it projecting a happy bubbly mood and getting you through a hard day at work.. Its not suitable for a bride but it is for a sexy maid of honour, because its sooo playful and flirtatious...",08/29/14 06:46,crisjoy
Envy Me Gucci,"Sweet and fruity. No need to go in detail about the top, heart and base notes. Lasts long after a two or three sprays on the skin. Gives a sense of sophistication, class and sexiness. Gucci needs to bring this piece of heaven back.",08/08/14 19:10,jdawg

Envy Me Gucci,"This perfume is just a mish-mash of notes clashing with each other. I'm not sure which is worse...the thick smell of peach and pineapple or the cloying smell of jasmine and mango.

Envy Me Gucci,"Acizane düşüncem tam bir genç ve orta yaş hanım kokusu olduğudur. Genellikle parfümlerde kadın erkek ayrımı pek yapmam ama bu koku gerçekten bir erkek için fazla kadınsı. Kesinlikle gayet çiçeksi ve şekerli bir koku. Ancak itiraf etmeliyim ki bence sert veya biraz modası geçmiş diyebileceğimiz türdeki keskin baharatlı erkek parfümleriyle birlikte doğru oranlarda kullanınca garip bir şekilde eşsiz ve cinsiyetsiz bir parfüm yaratmanıza imkan veriyor. Tabi yine de biraz eli yüzü düzgün çekici bir erkek olmanız durumunda bu karışımı öneririm. Yoksa hiç bu önerimi dikkate almayın ve erkekseniz doğrudan uzak durun. Benim gibi parfüm ayırmayı sevmeyen biri bile ""aga nesin, necisin, bu nasıl koku? bilelim de ona göre davranalım.."" diye bir tepki verebilir. :D

Geleyim kokunun karakterinin nasıl olduğuna. Özetle başımdan geçen bir olayı anlatayım. Artık siz karar verin. Bu parfümü yanlışlıkla başka bir ürün alıyorum diye güzel kafayla kör alışla sipariş vermiştim. Elime geçince ise ""anaaa bu ne lan? ben bunu mu aldım?"" tepkisini verdim. Zaten şişesinin ebatları ve tipi itibariyle resmen acısını içimde hissettim. :) Çünkü şişesi gayet büyük ebatlarda, dar, uzun ve köşeli bir yapıda. ;)

""Parfümün kadını erkeği olmaz"" ilkemden hareketle üzerime sıktım. Off o ne güzel bir koku. Ağır kokuları seven biri olarak hafif bile sayabileceğim, şekerli, çiçekli bir yapıdaydı. Yalnız işin kötü tarafı bu parfümü sıktığımı unutarak yarım saat sonra arkadaşların çağrısıyla buluşmaya gittik. Ben dahil toplam 4 erkek arkadaş buluştuk ve otururken herkes durmadan burnunu çekerek bir şeylerin kokusunu almaya çalışıyordu. Parfüm tutkumu bile diğer tüm arkadaşlarım gibi buluştuğum arkadaşlardan biri sonunda dayanamayarak ""aga yaa bu koku senden mi geliyor, yan masadaki kızdan mı? Eğer senin parfümünse gözünü seveyim bu parfümü bir daha sıkma, bir hoş oldum. Allah muhafaza günaha sokarsın adamı"" dedi. Tabi ben de önce afalladım sonra da gülmeye başladık. Kısaca tecrübeyle sabittir ki bu koku kesinlikle erkekler üzerinde gayet çekici hatta tahrik edici etkiler yaratabiliyor. :)

40 yaş üzeri hanımlara çok genç işi kalabilir. Ama bakımlı ve minyon tipte bakımlı bir hanımsanız 45 yaşa bile uyabilir. Genç kızlar için de bence son derece uygun ama gözünüzü seveyim dozu kaçırmayın. Hem siz başınıza iş açarsınız hem de içeriğinin biraz şekerli olması yüzünden sıcak havalarda milleti bayıltma riskiniz yüksek.

Dozu ayarlanamazsa sıcak günlerde bayıltıcı ve itici olabilir. Çok soğuk havalarda da fazla çekingen bir hal alacak bir yapıya sahip.

Kalıcılık ise EDT olmasının hakkını vererek ılık havalarda yarım günü buluyor. Belki sıcak havalarda daha uzun süre etki gösterebilir. Yine de küçük dozlarda kullanılmasını ve şişe ebatları yüzünden yanınızda bir atomizer ile gün içinde tazelenmesinin daha güzel olacağını düşünüyorum.

EDIT 04/05/22: To my surprise, I think it smells ok now. 😄 It's definitely fresh smelling-a category I LOVE. I obtained my sister's old bottle. It had quite a bit left, so I'm testing it out every now and then to see if it's actually a ""like 🙂"" or an ""ok 😐.""

Envy Me Gucci,"I had this perfume for at least 4 years now.
At first I used it almost always and then I stopped because I wanted to preserve whatever was left for a while.
After all this time it didn't turn bad, so the % of alcohol isn't high!
It smells of : roses, roses, roses, pink pepper. Oh and I forgot roses!
Honestly I can't smell anything else.
It's a really light fragrance on me. After a while I can smell only the spiciness of pink pepper, which I learned is my most favorite and recurrent note.
I think it has a weak-moderate ( on skin up to 2h -3h) longevity, suits well with warm weather and should be used in daylight.
When sprayed on hair, lasts 12h +, even after working at gym. I swear!
Not a remarkable fragrance, probably a transitory one.
Today I finished it and maybe If I have a chance, I'll buy it again in the future. Who knows!

It really is a citrusy fresh perfume that has a sweet woody warm quality to it. It's very similar to Versace's Bright Crystal but with a bit more oomph!

Envy Me Gucci,"I tried this recently and grudgingly as I am still annoyed they have discontinued Gucci Envy.

Well I was secretly hoping it might be an Envy flanker with some similarities, but there are no similarities between this and Gucci Envy.

However, it's really lovely in its own way. I got a light floral that turned into a delightful clean laundry/luxury soap sort of scent that lingered for around 3 hours.

I don't think it will ever be a favourite of mine, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down if I got a bottle as a gift.",11/27/12 04:12,BettyNoir

Envy Me Gucci,"This is definitely my signature scent. My sister bought a bottle for herself and the first time she wore it, I just couldn't stop smelling and wonder what that heavenly smell came from.

The dry down is the very best, is a very light, creamy, sweet woodsy scent.

When you first spary it might come too strong for some people but after you let it air for a acouple of minutes, the smell is just wonderful.

I received tons of compliments from my co-workers the fisrt time I wore it, just a heavenly smell.",11/13/12 15:50,pertance

Envy Me Gucci,"Light fruity floral.

I would say that the leading notes in this fragrance are the peony note and the pineapple note.

Though, I like it more than Burberry Brit Sheer, I won't buy it again, because the scent's gone too quick, I never smell its base note scent ie. musk left on my skin.

It's just a plain floral scent and very flat one too. it doesn't have anything special, and at some point the scent is not pleasant at all. it's just like a soap or shampoo, you may like it's floral fragrance, but it's just not something you would buy in a bottle.

Those who doesn't like it I must say that not all perfumes that you think is good will work well on you as that depends on your body chemistry, you'll smell the real scent of a perfume if it jives on your body chem so it is really important that you have to test is first before you buy so there will be no regrets. This perfume works well on my body chemistry, this is something really feminine and free spirited perfume, delicate, not strong. I used to wear this at daytime. This is for those who wants to emphasize their femininity. I so love it... They definitely should ENVY me as it works perfectly well on my body.",02/24/12 17:06,Bridgette0519

Envy Me Gucci,"I really like this. This to my nose is essentially a rose scent. It's not sweet at all though as the pink packaging etc would suggest. It's got slight resemblance to Chloe for me (the new one with the bow on it hehe) the rose in both these perfumes is that clean crisp rose. Very nice!

The fruits in here are also quite crisp, even though there is peach which normally smells dry, fuzzy and heavy. The other notes in here keep this perfume light and airy.

I feel quite refreshed wearing it which I really like in a perfume. I'd give it a thumbs up!!",01/22/12 05:20,Ouch!

When I sprayed this one I loved it. I put it on and I told him this one is amazing. He said keep it. I was shocked and happy.

The date went well. I had another experience with this fragrance as well. I was at my job at the time. Myself and 3 other guys and one female were standing in a circle talking. The female (who was good looking) just stopped mid conversation and said one of you guys smell so good.

She went around the circle and got to me. She said yep it's you. I knew then that fragrances make a difference.

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"This is Gucci Guilty EDT with an ambery and chocolatey patchouli base.
I wouldn't call it totally generic, but it's been done before, it's sort of in the style of Paco Rabanne Black XS 2005 - it's a pretty good twist on the original DNA overall.
All year-round and every occasion (maybe not the dressiest, because it can come across as playful), has great longevity (I could clearly smell it after 7-8 hours) and the projection is moderate to heavy for about 2 hours.
Just like most discontinued fragrances, it's not worth the inflated price, but if you can find it for the original retail price or under, it might be worth a shot.",07/16/25 01:54,Shiron212
Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"Absolutely love this fragrance. I have a bias since this was one of the first fragrances on my journey as a fragrance hobbyist. It has sentimental value to me. But, Gucci Guilty Intense is fantastic regardless of my history with it.

It's indeed a step up from the original and more intense in scent and performance. I do find the original as being just ordinary, but this Intense ticks all the boxes for me. Love that lavender/citrus opening.

I equate this with Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme. I feel it serves a similar purpose: a great smelling, fresh, modern attention-grabbing scent that's hard to dislike for the wearer and everyone around. Unfortunately the mockingbirds will repeat the dogma that Gucci Guilty sucks because it's not Pour Homme 2003 or Pour Homme 2. I agree that those are masterpieces, but let's not hate a good fragrance over poor marketing decisions. If Guilty Intense were in an Armani Code bottle, or YSL Y flanker, people wouldn't shut up about it.

Seems like this has been discontinued. Must secure a backup before prices hit the $200+ mark. I'll always have some on hand to remember the earlier days. Love this stuff.",07/07/25 15:40,Eau De Treasure

Opens with a citrusy-lavendery smell.. After a while this citrusy-lavendery smell weakens but stays in the background and is taken over by a note that is spicy, very ambery and slightly floral.. I find the smell quite smart and manly.. Can be used for both formal and casual occasions..

Depending on the weather, the smell lasts between 5 and 6 hours on my skin.. Projection is confined to about a six-inch radius around my skin.. Can be worn all year round but my personal recommendation would be fall or winter nights...",11/15/24 03:18,"TheNameIsBond , JamesBond"

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"This is one of those fragrances in my collection that always seems to pull me back in every time I start to think about moving on from it. It has a knack of just doing everything you need in a fragrance good enough across the board.

To me, It has a pleasing scent profile, and no less than 8 hrs of longevity on my skin, I like it better than the original due to the fact that it is a much better performer. It's a good 3 season scent, and provides a nice 1-2 ft scent bubble for 1-2 hours. (2011 bottle)

It has a fresh but dense vibe that may not rock your world or garner many compliments, but it just smells nice. I have come to appreciate it more now 13 years later since it smells different compared to what's being released now.

It's not a must-have for every collection. But it is unique enough in my collection to keep its spot and get worn once or twice a month. As for occasions to wear, I primarily wear it in cooler weather months, and mostly for the office.",08/04/24 03:08,EbagAppez

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"There is a line where Guilty and its flankers went from Unremarkable to Unbelievable. By no coincidence it's also when they handed things over to Alberto Morillas.

This one is completely unremarkable to me, which it shares with original Pour Homme (2011), Black (2013), Diamond (2014), Eau (2015) and Platinum (2016). All but the first have no listed nose (or at least none that will be publically associated with them?) which seems to say they were created by a marketing committee that wanted an amalgam of certain notes and just kind of tossed them together and got these rather unremarkable scents.

Morillas delivered Absolute (2017), Oud (2018), Cologne (2019) and Love (2020). The first three are some of my favorite designers (full stop) and the fourth while not spectacular still makes much more of an impression than those Guilty variants that preceded Morillas' intervention.",04/14/21 10:33,cvaile

Compliments: 9/10 (for the first 2 hours)",12/22/20 12:04,andrewg
Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"Gucci Guilty Intense Men opens with a moderate projection of citrus, spicy, floral, woody and resinous notes. The opening is fresh, the notes are intense, sharp, and very pleasant. Almost all notes are noticeable as soon as the fragrance is applied, particularly the lemon, neroli, orange blossom, amber, and cedar. As the fragrance dries down, some of that initial citrusy sharpness subsides under the amber that develops adding a slightly sweet/powdery/projecting touch. Also, the fragrance loses intensity very quickly taking one step down from moderate to moderate-low. Once Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate to low, slightly sweet, resinous, lemony, white floral, spicy, and woody fragrance with green and soft lavender accords. The fragrance feels casual, delicate, dry, elegant, fresh, green, masculine, resinous, short-lived, sour, sweet, woody, zesty, and pleasant.

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"I'mma be straight up, this was one of the first ones I bought as I got into fragrances because I always thought it was cool as a kid walking into Sephora and seeing the prices for just some ""perfume"".

I have both this intense version and the original Gucci Guilty Pour Homme. I admit I am a fan of the scent. Its refreshing, light, and boosts my confidence. I don't know why. The citruses and lavender are blended well, this scent was created for mass-appeal, and that is where I do get where dislike/hate is directed towards this line. But I personally believe that no one is going to complain if you are wearing this. The bottle is really nice as well. I'd recommend this if you can buy it at a discounters for a good price.

Performance for the intense version is pretty good, I would say average. 4+ hours consistently on my skin while projection for at least an hour. Superior to the original GG, so I do prefer the intense version (But they do smell 90% similar). Won't change your life, but you'll smell good :)

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"Very pleasant fragrance. Soft,a bit sweet and elegant. Projects very well.
To me, it is almost unisex. Certainly not generic. It's really unique. One of the best male scents out there.
This is for a modern,a bit artsy young man.
Dominant notes are orange flower, amber (liquid and sweet, not powdery ) and lavender that adds a nice herbal touch. It's very well blended. I am positively impressed.

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"My respected friends with respectable olfactory sense laugh at me. They tell me, ""Guilty Intense is *intensely* Generic."" ""One step above massive mass appeal"", they chime. ""All it needs is to be layered with Ambroxin!"" they say.

Confession time. I consider myself a little bit of a nerd when it comes to fragrances. I like some weird ones, got a taste for leather and the boozey, and hate anything that screams teenager or early 20s. I am 30, but started in the fragrance game when I was 17, and my taste hasn't really changed.

Rewind back to 2011 - I was teaching at the time, and I wore Gucci Guilty Intense for the first day back after Summer. This female colleague entered the building behind me,

""Wow. You smell like a MAN!""

I'm not sure if it was that comment (as well as a few others), but I have this crazy belief that this scent used to be smokier. When I went through that bottle, I bought a second a few years later and thought I was sold a fake. A few weeks ago, I was missing that old smell after not having it for months, and naively thought it might give me that old smokey feeling like my first smaller bottle did (for the record, my last two were 100ml, the first was smaller, perhaps a 50) - it smelt similar to the previous, but a little better, no doubt due to it's age.

Still, when I spray this on my wrist paired with any other fragrance - Diors, Parfums De Marleys, etc, I still prefer it. Crazy, I suppose? In fact, at immediate first sniff I feel like it's not there, then it slowly enfulgs my nostrils in a way no other scent does, like it creeps into my brain slower. That sounds ridiculous, but it's true. It also faintly burns my nose, like a strong mint.

I love Neroli Portofino, but wouldn't wear it. Maybe it's the neroli that puts most people off about GG, but then neroli isn't a mass appeasing note. Maybe I have a tumor and it's making me smell something different. Maybe people are just hung up on Envy and the former greats. Good times they were, but Intense is still far from generic to me.

I was hesitant to say Guilty Intense was my favorite for years - can't help it though. I'm guilty of loving this damn scent.",10/12/19 02:46,asianprobation
Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"This is a strong fragrance, to me it has a good longevity, maybe my skin or PG goes well with it.

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"I find this to be a fairly bold scent, but not too strong. I wore it all summer and really enjoyed it. The blending is excellent. However, I found that, despite its initial strength, the projecting power of the scent fades quicker than expected. Fortunately, the remaining scent lasts many more hours. Be careful not to use too much; one spray is enough for me.",11/03/18 17:50,ironslinger
Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"This has been my favorite scent for my entire time dabbling in fragrances. Granted I only wear it during the fall or winter because it is a beast mode fragrance, but it's a fantastic scent.

I recently wore it for the first time in a couple of months because Fall has just begun and I was still blown away by the performance. I applied it at 11:30 am and I was still getting whiffs at 8:00 pm and the projection is fantastic as well.

I really enjoy the Gucci Guilty scent DNA because nothing else smells like it. Sure, it's a take on a modern day fresh scent for a younger man, but that's perfect because I am 20. What I love most about this scent is the ""dark"" / ""mysterious"" vibe that it has. It's a fresh scent, but I can only guess that the combination of lavender and amber give this a ""dark"" / ""mysterious"" vibe, and the ladies eat this stuff up.

Scent: 5/5 (great scent, unique)
Longevity: 4.5/5 (great longevity)
Sillage: 4/5 (very good projection)
Versatility: 3/5 (great for the fall or winter because it's strong)
Compliments: 4/5 (fresh with a dark vibe. the ladies love it)
Age Range: 18-35(ish)

Overall: 4.10/5.0

You cannot go wrong with this stuff. Be careful to not over apply this though because it is quite strong and lasts a long time. I recommend 2-3 sprays, with 4 sprays being the max. I apply 1 spray behind each ear and 1 spray either on the front of my neck or the back.",11/01/18 11:10,GreatestEver

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"I've only recently started to enjoy the Guilty line. I hated them all when I first tried them 5 or 6 years ago, but for some reason lately, there's something about these fragrances that I really find appealing. There's an awful lot of shade thrown at Gucci for this series, but I think it's largely undeserved.

The one thing I think they've done particularly well is in creating a discernable contrast between the flankers, while retaining the core Guilty DNA. I have both Intense and Eau. The former is fruity and light at the top, but gets deeper and darker very quickly. The drydown has a rich incense/sandalwood vibe to it. In contrast, Eau starts out with the same fruity fresh top notes, but stays light and atmospheric. Longevity for both is around 4-5 hours. Both are unmistakably Guilty, but are as different as day/night or summer/winter in terms of their depth and intensity. Does Guilty hold up in comparison to its predecessors Envy or Nobile? Maybe not, but it's delightful for what it is :)",06/12/17 20:19,foreignshores
Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"I'm guilty in enjoying this fragrance.

Is it the best fragrance I've ever smelled? No. Is it in my top 5? No. But it doesn't need to be. It smells pleasant, it's versatile and it gets me awesome compliments. A more refined version of the original and a people pleaser.

It has also dropped in price, and while it's still not super cheap, it still comes at an acceptable price. I guess this is my guilty pleasure as far as ""political correctness"" in fragrances goes. But hey, fragrances are subjective. So sample it and make up your own mind.

I'm only gonna try the gucci oud because it's hard to weaken and oud base unless the maker is just that cheap and willing to screw the consumer by any means.

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"I've absolutely fallen in love with this stuff. I can't get enough. I was sniffing paper at Ulta and initially thought this one's brother just stood out a bit from the others, so I thought, yep, if I was to choose I'd probably choose this one, but I wasn't buying, and really wasn't that impressed, I just thought Gucci Guilty was better than the other waft's I whiffed.

Then though, it stayed in the back of my mind. I started thinking I wanted another juice to add to my collection. I went to another store that has way more options and whiffed a bunch of stuff I saw get rave reviews. Then, I saw the Gucci Guilty and wondered how it would compare. Darned if it wasn't still better to me than even all these greatly reviewed scents. Then, I saw the Intense version. Had to compare the two.

Lo and behold, Intense was just a more potent stronger example of what I liked about the lesser strength brother. Still though, I had to repeatedly go back and forth between the strips to decide. Heavenly, I pulled the trigger on the Guilty Intense. It won the shoot out.

Now, I'm wearing it and loving every moment. This stuff is much better to me, than any reviewer has indicated. I have no idea why that is. Most stuff I tend to agree with the majority of reviewers, but I really think this stuff should be lauded over La Nuit, or any of the Chanel's, or Dior's. It's just a pleasure to smell on yourself.

Sadly, I drifted away from it as I loved to sample new fragrances. Few days ago I ordered a very small bottle to see if the love was still there. I discovered that it never left. The moment I smelled it again, no fragrance I owned meant anything. This is the scent for me. I smell it and it's just perfection to me.
I know that people say it smells generic and cheap but to me it's amazing! On me the projection is strong and the longevity is great! It really always depends on the person.

So I try the original and it has a very similar scent but with a more alcahol based smells, It comes off strong at first but is very subtle sticking close to the skin and lasts for around 4 hours. I really like the smell it smells sexy and a little bit dirty and rounded out with a fresh lemony dry down. This is def a aromatic citrus/musk scent that is non snythetic and lingers with a mysterious deepness that stops it from being too linear and common. I got a compliment from a girl at a hair salon while wearing this.

With Gucci, I feel i have to be harsh... I can't accept this product from them. It's passive, uninspired and very very bland. Nothing new, nothing groundbreaking or innovative... Even the bottle is bleh!

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"Okay so being thoroughly underwhelmed by the original I thought I'd better try this one and guilty black just to check I hadn't just dismissed the entire range off hand.
First of all this fragrance is pleasant, very pleasant indeed I love the lemony sherbet opening and subdued gentleness of this fragrance, I can see why it would be a good crowd pleaser as to me at least, it's the dictionary definition of 'inoffensive'.
It is VERY similar to Zegna Forte to me but lacking in one crucial area.... depth!
Forte has more of a Tonka/tobacco/honey thing and this takes it a level above Guilty intense but other than that massively similar. The drydown of the Gucci just gets lemony softer and more powdery and longevity is poor and projection is non existent really stays close...where as the Zegna has a much deeper more sensual dry down and is by no means a beast but lasts a little longer.
Basically if you like this fragrance and the original (which I do to an extent) but want something yet more 'intense' check out Zegna Forte.",01/25/14 09:53,Houdini4

Gucci guilty intense smells of a sweet flowering tree alongside with bursts of fresh citrus that eases the nose and then takes over with its intoxicating scent. Sillage and longevity are both amazing I sprayed this on my skin at seven in the morning and it was still going at it after the whole day I showered at ten so well over twelve hours even projection was still clouding away of course not as strong as when first sprayed but still for someone to smell you from twenty feet away after nine hours and drools over the fragrance, that is nothing to complain about. ;)",01/12/13 14:00,silvernose

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"I honestly did not enjoy the original Gucci Guilty pour Homme. I found it a little too sour and strong, at which point I warned my boyfriend to never buy a bottle of it for so long as we were together.

I approached this Intense flanker with an air of trepidation. My fingers were crossed behind my back, and my painkillers close by just in case. Thankfully this is a far better fragrance than the original. It's strong, but nowhere near as overwhelming as Gucci Guilty pour Homme.

It's a slightly more improved composition. The lemon and orange blossom accords are less sharp, and the lavender appears to be much smoother. Amber has also been added to this flanker, along with a masculine and spicy coriander note.

I hope this fragrance isn't a limited edition. I'll most likely scream if they discontinue this and keep the sharp, messy Guilty pour Homme on the shelves.

Don't let the 'intense' fool you, as it is not as bold or overpowering as you might expect it to be. The sillage is strong, however it won't knock you out. It's still a pleasant and wearable fragrance. It has my tick of approval.",11/10/12 20:28,missk

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"Oops, I put my previous review on the wrong perfume. I'll remove the other review. The male perfume I tested was the Intense version of Gucci Guilty. I thought it was the other Guilty, since it was so weak, but I read on the cardboard of the sample that it was the Intense version. So here goes the review that should have been here instead:

I'm a woman and I accidently got a sample of the male version, namely this one, Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme. Since I had the sample, I tried it. I put it on my chest, arms and behind my ears and was quite generous, since I felt it was very weak at first. It continued to be weak. Just 30 minutes or so after putting it on, I could hardly smell it. Then I was out with my sister for several hours and normally when moving around, you get whiffs of your perfume from time to time. I didn't get any. Later in the evening I asked my sister if she had smelled any perfume from me during this time. She said no. I even got her to put her nose at my neck, to smell the point where I had put the perfume. She said she could hardly smell it from me, even when she was that close. It was very weak. Too bad. I thought it would be stronger, since it's a mens perfume. That's the only bad part, the weak sillage and the longevity. Otherwise it's a good scent. Smells sweet and leather. It doesn't say it's leather in it, but all notes aren't listed. I can smell leather or something that smells like leather. I can't detect the lemon at all on my skin, nor the amber. I would like it if it was alot stronger and lasted longer. It wasn't Intense on my skin anyway.",09/26/12 04:16,kitten_steele

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"I am shocked at the hate for this fragrance in the previous reviews. Went shopping today to see what I might be in the mood for and ended up picking this fragrance up after an hourlong visit and many comparisons.

Thei scent is linear. It starts with lemon mixed with woods and a pronounced patchouli. Gradually, the lemon gives way to lavender accented with patchouli and other spices. It also becomes more of a woody spicy mix. Even so, the lemon remains in the background coloring the scent. The lavender also has a key role to play. Despite the predictable pattern, the particular mixture of the elements varies, sometimes even between sniffs, as each of the accords waxes and wanes. The dry down is, in my view, a rich, seductive mixture.

While others seem to have issues with longevity, on my skin it lasts forever. It has been 10 hours since I applied it at the store and, while it is a skin scent at this stage, it is still quite noticeably there. During its earlier stages, it projects well and smells woodsy and spicy.

I bought this one following head to head skin tests of the complete line of John Varvatos, which it crushed in terms of projection and longevity. The only negative, to me, for this scent is that it is very popular, and I prefer not to wear scents that others are wearing. My suspicion that this popularity is, in part, responsible for some of the hate on this fragrance.

Bottom line: If you are looking for an interesting woodsy and spicy scent, this one fits the bill nicely. Definitely worth a look.",03/30/12 22:32,misterjohn

So why bother launching a scent that really serves no purpose? Not sure of Gucci's thinking. Since they have some note worthy ones, why not re-promote those instead of relegating them to the dust pin of drug stores and street fairs?

Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Homme Gucci,"Re:K1's comment,

Why dont they just bring back Rush? Giving us Gucci by Gucci and Guilty were mistakes in my opinion.
Gucci by Gucci-sport was better than the first edition, but weak as.
Gucci by Gucci seemed to target simplicity among mediocre, masculine scents, but would do well to be a simple scent if marked down, which means, to get a good profit margin, they'd have to cheapen the formula and it'd be toilet spray. Guilty seemed to lack recognition of Hugo Boss, and results in a release and marketing campaign for something that turned out just like a Boss frag(i think it was Boss Soul). Its only at low cost and low expectations that either of these should be successful, so to not waste money on ad campaigns and getting their hopes up.

IMO, bring back Rush, stop advertising Gucci by Gucci, just p**s Guily off completely and spend a good deal of effort creating something different.",11/22/11 18:20,Mushroomfat

Patchouli is quite prominent while orange blossom is mild and not at all feminine. cedar is hardly there either unless I really dig into it. Not much similarities between this and original, though. (it's kinda like Prada Amber and Prada Amber Intense) So Gucci Guilty Intense may be just a warmer and denser/richer version of the original. Neither one is 100% successful, I think.

0-5 mins - Sticky, fruity smell with modern male twist. Projection good- approx 1.5 foot around. Ages 20-35.

5 mins - 3.5 hours - Modern twist goes and this becomes a nice sticky and fruity smell. Smells like a little orange, but this is not listed. Projects 1 foot around so does not fill the room. Very similar to Female Hugo Boss Intense or Female Georgio Armani Diamonds EDP, perhaps they project a little longer than this though.

3.5 hours - 8 hours. Drydown ok, a little spicy very now and then - smelt cumin but this is not listed. Rare whiff of projection, otherwise projection all gone

The initial phase reminds me of red currant mixed with plastic. The effect however is very sexy, modern and appealing.
Perfect clubbing scent.

A couple of weeks ago i finally got my hands on a small tester bottle of it. I really did not like it at first but it definitely grew on me. Even though it is a 2000s perfume i can smell the 70s-80s inspiration. I do get the hedonistic confident smell that you might have smelled on a lady of the night on the street after a long night of clubbing. Hairspray, cigarettes, latex and sketchy parties. Creamy patchouli peach. I wear it everyday no matter the occasion, i think only my mom likes it because all of my friends and classmates say it smells like propolis but i don’t care i love it and i think that is a big part of this perfume.",11/08/25 02:55,daringdarling

I prefer Petal Jus to this, just because it doesn’t distract from the stars of the show with needless spices: instead, Petal Jus uses lactonic notes to buoy the synthetic into a wonderball of chocolate (complete with its little plastic choking hazard hiding inside, of course). Rush has a similar strange character, the kind that leads people to ask “What are you wearing?” when you lean in to speak with them.

This is a passing but powerful impression in the top notes — peach, the green (almost minty) funk of coriander, and fuzzy patchouli dancing around an unmistakably oily putty note. The peach, coriander, and wispy patchouli remain as a shampoo-ish freesia appears, evoking a mango in pastel shades. From then on it’s shimmering, sweet, chalky jasmine and super-soft basenotes: musky vanilla, and soft-focus patchouli & vetiver. There is, yes, an overall impression of hairspray as well, something aerosolized or possibly carbonated. Yet, somehow the whole perfume gives an impression of softness; in its native club-context, perhaps it’s different, or perhaps the reformulating has de-fanged this weird wonder.

I returned to my bottle, slated for donation, after a positive experience with By Kilian Flower of Immortality which sent me reeling back to Gucci Rush, a superior powdery peach. And as disparate as these references may seem, I do also understand the comparisons to Narciso edp and Patchouli Tenation, though moreso the latter. But if you’ve had a fondness for any of these, give this raging red cassette a try, and you may also find it somewhat mismatched to its delightfully gauche packaging.",09/11/25 08:03,ingrid.superstar
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I just adore unique scents and this is one of them. It stands out without a question. Funny enough I didn’t like it at first for some reason. But when it was gone, I was surprised to miss it. Gave it another try a year later and fell in love. I believe this is one of those fragrances that need to mix well with your skin chemistry in order to work. My boyfriend loves it too and he has a very picky nose. It’s very erotic and playful, not an everyday fragrance in my opinion. It’s like a sugar rush without the sugar, hard to explain. Just like the uniqueness of the 90s is hard to explain.

You only smell it close to skin after a while, so this is perfect for date night .😏 I realized peach scents can be very seductive and sassy.

The only thing I don’t like, just like many others, is the packaging. Although it’s perfect for on the go, I wish it was a red glass bottle!",09/10/25 10:16,caronanny
Gucci Rush Gucci,"Her bare thighs stick to the warm leatherette.
All is plastic except the peaches piled high in the tuppaware bowl. They fill the air with their over ripe scent. Their bruised and discoloured undersides drip a note of decay in their nectar accord.
But wait, there IS something else that breathes. A drooping gardenia, covered in blackened, dying blooms manages to whimper its indolic prescence from a single, untainted white bud.
There are faint white lines on the scarlet, rectangular table before her. She rubs her gums reminiscently. Naughty. But that's not all. She raises her head like a dog to sniff the air. The faintest touch of patchouli, a hint of vetiver, a sweet memory of vanilla. No clue there whether it was boy or girl who left her clothes in such disarray.
The film credits running on the small, bulbous TV screen finish. There are clicks, then whirring as the video reaches the end and begins to rewind.
The sound has broken her reverie. She jumps to her feet, unsure whether she feels sated or cheap. It is time to shower and return to the elegance, substance and genius of her 20th century Guerlains.
At the door she pauses and smiles. She wouldn't have missed this for the world.",08/29/25 10:37,ElinorLavish
Gucci Rush Gucci,"Gucci Rush has such a unique peach note; it is creamy and lactonic, ripe and sweet, loud and proud. It is not the compote peach in heavy syrup with a metallic accord found in many vintage perfumes, nor is it the under ripe fresh peach in the more modern releases. It’s so unique.

The florals here are more abstract. I can’t pinpoint a specific one, maybe just the rose. The patchouly in the base is surprisingly not overpowering and has a weird but likable plastic undertone. It adds to the uniqueness of Rush.
The performance is very good.
Gucci Rush is definitely different (back then and even now), but it is still very wearable and likable. It stands out and can definitely pass as niche.",08/25/25 11:18,Tinabill

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Gucci, please do not discontinue! In a world where so many things look the same, sound the same, and even smell the same, where movies and songs feel generic, this one stands the test of time. It fits every moment and every era. And now, when most perfume houses are leaning toward oriental blends, this feels more perfect than ever. Even the design is iconic I don’t understand the hate for it. It’s called RUSH for a reason! It was meant to be light, bold, and easy to carry, and I think the cassette-style bottle matches the name.

About the scent, mschnabel666 put it perfectly: this IS a WEIRDO. I never liked it at first. Back in the early 2000s, whenever my friend wore it, I’d always ask what she possibly saw in it; it smelled masculine to my nose then. Now, in 2025, I saw it again in a store, sprayed it out of curiosity, and again I couldn’t decide if I really liked it. But the thing about this scent is that it sneaks up on you. You don’t even have to love it, yet somehow it grows on you until you realize you have to have it. I kept sniffing the back of my hand until I made up my mind - I had to make her mine! It reminds me of that scene in Perfume, the story of a murderer, where the perfumer unveils his masterpiece. He sprays the fragrance into the air above the crowd, and the entire audience is spellbound, overwhelmed, enchanted, collapsing under the spell of the scent. That’s exactly the kind of power this perfume has, it makes you surrender completely. I LOVE IT!",08/19/25 01:19,Thursu

Notes of peach, gardenia, freesia, rose, coriander, jasmine, vanilla, patchouli, vetiver …each one mixes to create a fragrance that feels like the ultimate it-girl energy. For me, this and Gucci Envy Me were the whole vibe during my college years. The memories this scent brings back? Pure magic.

the atomizer on mine is broken and it squirts in a single line which is a nightmare to use, but this thing smells like if an angel descended from heaven but was really pissed and b*tch-slapped you. it instantly changed my life. very strong and confident floral scent that doesn’t smell like a drugstore deodorant or squished grass. an offensive white floral in the best way - i love white florals and it is an honor to be offended by them lol.

if angel is the king of trashy y2k club fragrances, rush is the queen. (dont be put off by my word choices: i adore angel, as well as this fragrance). at its core its a pretty linear, fruity-floral scent, but the patchouli in the base is on full blast, which makes it unique in my opinion. the peach is what gives it that slightly plastic-y quality, but its not off putting at all. well-rounded and fun. wearing rush is, above all, a genuine mood lifter due to its playful nature.

21 years later and a curated collection of a range of perfumes, varying in scent and bottle designs, scents increasingly leaning towards the mor and more expensive and niche, bottles looking more and more exquisite and elite, I long for Rush. Why? I guess that is the exact reason for Rush's existence: to feel young, free, daring, different and unbothered.
I remember each time I went to the red plastic square bottle it was me approaching both a friend in crime and partner for life. It is looking at you with its read plasticky eye and you go "" hey you, shall we do it then? You and me"". It goes ""switch me on"".

Gucci Rush smells like peach candy. Peach with sugar. Smells exactly like Haribo Peaches.
When it dries down, you also get a hint of white florals.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Gucci Rush original formula (Scannon) - released in 1999, created under Tom Ford during his time at Gucci. It has been subject to several reformulations since but I do not own any reformulated version to compare with. This one is not for the faint-hearted. It's bold, it's fun, plasticky smelling, manufactured, it's an out and out synthetic fragrance. It doesn't even try to be anything else. Love it or hate it, the fragrance container and the juice are well matched, both being synthetic and plastic. The original fragrance contains decalactone and jasmelactone (synthetics used for peach and jasmine), along with aldehydes, to help re-create the fruits and florals and these give it that plastic smell. To me, Rush is a shining example of this being done the right way. It modernised Chypre and made this one of the best fragrances created within its decade. Rush is joyously trashy and fearlessly unapologetic. Its signature and distinctive character make it unique and unforgettable. Projection and sillage are nothing less than incredible.

If you didn't smell this perfume before, I advise that you can blind buy if you interest ""L'Interdit Eau de Parfum Givenchy"" but searching on perfume similar to it, but lighter. This perfume very suitable to sensitive nose people.

This fragrance suitable to wear it at night or during the day in all seasons, It lasts 4 hours on the leather and more hours time on clothes.

إذا لم تشم هذا العطر من قبل، أنصحك بشراؤه إذا كنتِ تستمتعين بروائح مشابهة لـ""جيفينشي ليندرتي إيدي بارفوم"" ولكن تبحثين عن عطر مشابه له ولكن أخف. هذا العطر مناسب جدًا للأشخاص الذين لديهم حساسية في الأنف.

هذا العطر مناسب لارتدائه في الليل أو أثناء النهار في جميع الفصول، يدوم لمدة 4 ساعات على الجلد وساعات أطول على الملابس.",10/10/24 01:56,Abeer Alatrash
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I acquired Gucci Rush in 2023 f/the Dufry at the Vienna (Austria ) Airport. No clue what formulation.

I hold massive scent associations.
My gentle, old, best friend Mr. Fred The Cat, was very sick when I had to leave the USA, so I’ve now a heart wrenching, wretch-ed, yet thankful reaction whenever I smell this.
I will never wear it again.

But that summer, I needed a soul boosting-pull up your big girl panties & boot straps fragrance to push me through a job that had to be done before I could go home. I was in absolute despair, & with sobs, I chose this.

I’ve heard polarizing reviews on it, my favorite being:
“The lady who boiled the rabbit in Fatal Attraction probably wore this”.
Well, I needed a bitchy scent to match my attitude & project me forward, so ya…perfect.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
This is intoxicating. Good or bad, it’s modern & it’s timeless.
It’s Andy Warhol. It’s Santana.

1st spray: Electrifying. Florals & spices. Then you’re sucker punched w/funky peach, (I hate peach) & indolic gardenia & like it or not, it captivates to the point of distraction. This helped me not concentrate on my overwhelming heart sick homesick emotions.

As it settles, a super weird plasticky Barbie doll head trail emerges that also smells of the strong jasmine “California Scents” brand car air freshener (it comes in a pop tab can), nachos & cilantro. Maize? Herbs? Idk, but think drunken 2 am taco runs in college that have loads of sensorial associations.
(Malibu Musk or Coty’s Exclamation were probably wearing you.)

It’s bold. The vanilla & smoky patchouli warm up the base & linger leaving a comfort you grasp if you appreciate incense or the smell of cigarettes at the beach. You can’t wear this if you’re afraid to stand out. All my fux were given so I wore it for the entire 2 months.

No fear.
I was with a team of people.
People complained.
People complimented.
Neither mattered.

It’s edgy, badass, disco-tech. It’s the Y2K suburban mom slumber party hostess who snuck Seagram’s wine coolers to power her through her duties of the night. We other moms understood because it would be our rotation next month. We knew she needed a little Rush in her world.

I made it home & so did my beloved cat.
Mr Fred is now at peace.
As am I.

Bless you, Gucci.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"I love this but its not strong enough for me.

I am a lover of truly big bombastic fragrances. Its the entire reason i collect vintage 80s to mid 90s scents. They are heavy hitters, they last AND project bigly ALL DAY, and are excellent value for those very reasons.

Rush is totally addicting and gorgeous… i dont find it nearly as crazy or unusual as others describe it. But it’s just a really gorgeous piece of perfumery.

However, finding a vintage bottle is like paying big bucks for a lottery ticket.

You need to look for “Scannon” on the box/bottle.
BUT…
The problem is that Scannon bottles span from 1999 to the mid 2000s and i really suspect the first reformulation happened within that time.

All i know is that the juice in my Scannon bottle isnt all that long lasting or projecting after the first 30 minutes.

Thats not good enough for me.

I wore it this weekend and my boyfriend said it was faint even after i massively over-sprayed (this was only two hours later).

My rollerball of Rasha by Al Rehab lasted all day, and had great projection. It was years ago when i owned it, but i finally ordered more (hope its still beastly!)

My suggestions to replace GUCCI RUSH:

Rasha was and hopefully still is the best dupe of Rush one could hope for. Its fantastic. I used to get tons of compliments on it.

Angel Nova is different but it does really remind me of Rush, its similarly unique, fruity, and has that same ELECTRIC ALIVENESS! that Rush does. Another compliment getter. Beastly.

Red Jeans by Versace also has that same “Aliveness” and if you overspray that sucker will last and project strongly all day.I actually find both the newer bottles and the vintages to project and last really well (when sprayed generously).
I like them both equally. The newer bottles are also fresher smelling.

All of the above are compliment getters, and they all remind me of each other.

For me, all the above satisfy the Rush shaped hole in my heart. And all of them also layer remarkably well with each other AND with Rush. I have been layering my vintage Scannon Rush with both Nova and Red Jeans, at different times, and they blend seamlessly.

But reformulated Rush does NOT fill the void for me, and Ive given up trying to find a bottle of the vintage.

Not worth the money or the effort.",09/08/24 13:08,herculano
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I got this in 1999 at a duty free. Loved it then, love it now. Since, I’ve accumulated a collection of about 125 perfumes. Recently purchased this again, for nostalgia’s sake. Albeit, slightly less of a beast, smells like I recalled. It smells like disco manic fuchsia sparkle candy. It reminds me of TF Black Orchid’s sweet little cousin who’s on gap year and is on a coke-fueled clubbing binge, in lucite platforms that smell of plastic, and drinking fruity cocktails.",09/05/24 18:22,BETHJANINEUNA
Gucci Rush Gucci,"When I properly wore it for the first time, I thought I was anosmic to it because it took me a few minutes to get accustomed to my new scent. I appreciate that it is very ""adjustable"" depending on the amount of sprays you use.

Two sprays give me a creamy, white floral, peachy, beautiful scent that is still decidedly feminine. It does smell like expensive hairspray at first but it is more accurate to say that the hairspray smells like this. Some fragrances have a certain unpleasant smell at first but when you let them sit on your skin and keep sniffing, you realise they are not as one-dimensional as you have imagined. ""Rush"" is a prime example for such perfume.

Three sprays give me a dusty, earthy, slightly dirty scent that is also a little spicy and creamy. I have no idea what most of the notes smell like on their own therefore I judge based on the description of the notes and my own sense of smell. I believe the ""dirty"" scent is the patchouli. The white flowers make it more palatable and less coarse while the coriander gives it a masculine edge. The peach and the rose are also there, adding juicy sweetness to the scent. The pyramid seems so bizarre at first but the notes compliment one another and work really well.

It is an extremely interesting perfume. It is very original and unique yet very comfortable to wear. It is well-balanced yet most of the notes stand out. None of them overpower the rest but they are clearly distinguishable. It can be a feminine scent but it can also be pretty unisex. Since my skin has its own ""scent"", it gives this fragrances a dark twist. I own some men's colognes that are less masculine than this. It is quite versatile.

I love everything about ""Rush"". The name, the package, the juice, the ad campaign. The entire team that worked on this product was really creative. They did a fabulous job. The bottle is surprisingly easy to use. It is compact and lightweight but does not feel cheap despite being made of plastic. I love the idea.

Tip: if you hold the bottle in front of a source of strong light (e.g. flashlight), you can see the amount of liquid you have left. The inside of the bottle looks identical to the ""Rush 2"" flanker which comes in a clear bottle.

One of my best blind buys! Long-lasting, stunning, different, high-quality. You only need 2-3 sprays on each arm and 3 sprays on your neck and it will easily last until you wash it off in the evening. You do NOT overspray this. It will become repulsive. It is potent.

It does NOT smell like plastic to me. I really do not get that.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"i had to take out a lil sample from a while ago. the plastic comparison has been made so many times. it has the exact type of hazy fresh out the factory plastic smell from a new barbie doll. especially in the opening.

the fact that this was very popular back in the days genuinely baffles me a bit lol... it smells clean and dirty feral at the same time. patchouli base + idolic white florals. bit camphor like. quite heavy on the patchouli. combined with a creamy sweet vanilla with a slap of coriander and a hint of cheap make upy rose? its a really odd one for my nose. experimental, avant-garde... reminds me a lot of a bjork music clip. tbh cant think of anything like it.

i genuinely like it but purely artistically. it is just so weird and interesting but it borders being extremely unpalatable for me. however im starting to nod some appreciation towards Michel Almairac. from what i've tried of him so far he seems to be a very creative parfumer that can create a unique abstract fragrance. most notably my favorite of his was dior farhenheit and that stuff straight up smells like gasoline and car leather, and i love it. so i can understand why people like this too.

however just like dior farhenheit it's one of those scents you cannot force people around you to like... and it'd be justified if they ask you to leave the premise lol. don't spray too much.",08/18/24 07:32,fragrantlyenhanced

But if you could compare the two, I think you'd totally agree with me that they nearly smell like two different frags. I'm going to try and hunt down a vintage bottle. What do I need to look for? I know it's going to be pricey. Help! I can find no info online answering this question and I know someone in here knows Lol!",07/30/24 02:18,Vanillastorm40
Gucci Rush Gucci,"Having never tried this fragrance before, upon spraying it on today I recognized the scent straight away as I remember smelling this on women many years ago. I was dying to try it, especially as I saw on here that it's listed as a night time scent. I really expected this to be quite sexy but to my nose, it is quite watery. Not in a watered down way, but light and somewhat watery smelling. This watery-ness could be coming from the peach and gardenia together (as opposed to being syrupy or juicy). The patchouli isn't heavy at all and doesn't throw out ""dirty hippy"" vibes. The vanilla is done well in this fragrance because it just sweetens up the composition a bit without making it cloying. To be completely honest, I was looking for Freak Me by Silk in this perfume but instead I got Thank You by Dido 🤭

This is a light (not deep, dark, or mysterious), feminine perfume which is pretty in its own right. I do have to give it credit for its longevity as I've been wearing it almost 12hrs and am still getting wafts of it just like when I first sprayed it on.",07/25/24 02:30,Kiwigoddess

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Woody peach and breezy, sugar-water-esque white florals. There's also a smooth, slightly dirty-mineral undertone to the whole thing, like dusty stone. The notes sound natural, but the vibe is plasticy, synthetic, and cool; a Y2K scent if ever there was one.

It's Strict Machine by Goldfrapp, and Can't Get You Out Of My Head by Kylie Minogue. It's color-tinted sunglasses with no frames, and a slick ponytail with glitter-gel side pieces.",07/09/24 13:35,ginandrice
Gucci Rush Gucci,"For a 2001 bottle of this juice:

I remember applying this at Sephora in high school (literally two sprays), walking into a coffee shop, and seeing a girl from my school working the register. She immediately says “ I CAN SMELL YOU FROM HERE” in the weirdest way possible.

I didn't realize how nuclear this is because one spray is enough to give me anosmia. The “new” formulation is like a stripped down Mitsouko with some Saran Wrap, but the old is a detonation of peach, plastic, earthy green, and insane sweetness. This rocks my socks off I have to say. It is, despite its sweetness, quite masculine due to the prominent Vetiver and patchouli. It’s a circus act with the balance of fruity plastic sweetness almost overtaking the earthy spicy counter-notes. Such a cool fragrance and VERY distinctive. You have to have a personality to pull this off.",07/04/24 20:41,soylaputa

I got this as y2k is all around me and a blast of the noughties, taking me back to my thirties would be fun, it’s not that fun but wait after 4 hours this is quite sensual.

The peachy opening is very brief; it's a sticky, slightly yucky peach, like you left one in the bottom of your bag and forgot about it for a week. Things get worse or better (depending on your taste) with the dry down, which I can only describe as plastic and candy wrappers that have been left to marinate in milk.

The thing I also dig about Rush is it's still unique after 25 years, and that's especially true now. Rush is not for the faint-hearted. It's a powerhouse, it's sweet, and definitely a gourmand fruitchouli, although it's not completely wrongly described as a Chypre Fruity. To my nose, it's quite sexy. While wearing it, I am transported back to simpler times and places, a smaller physique, heh, and getting into new genres of music. It's watching Charmed. It's being young and carefree.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"I’ve wanted to try this scent out for a very long time, but I couldn’t find any testers or samples. I finally lucked out and won a partial bottle in a giveaway. The first time I tried it, I got a burst of coriander similar to that in Tom Ford’s Cafe Rose before the white florals kicked in. Things didn’t work out so well the next few times I wore it, though. The patchouli and vetiver notes combined with the coriander to create a weird sour and musty accord that drowned out the peach and the white floral notes. I also kept getting a plastic note on and off throughout the day. Ultimately, I ended up with a headache. I tried wearing less the next time and I still got a headache. Choosing a different lotion didn’t make much of a difference either. As interesting as this scent is, it’s just not for me. Don’t let my bad experiences discourage you though; if you can somehow get a sample or tester and you’re in the mood for something bold, give it a try. It’s fairly long lasting and strong- perfect for those days you feel like standing out from the crowd.",04/28/24 10:53,Mona708

Gucci Rush Gucci,"I was sure I was not going to like this. Reading the very divisive reviews, along with comments mentioning “hairspray” “neon” “milk” “plastic” “fruitchouli”. My thoughts without smelling were like “what the f***?” But now that I have smelled it, yes. I get all of those comments. And for some this could be a nightmare to smell. But this is going to very quickly become a love, I can tell.

I was born 1992 so although I didn’t wear fragrances in the 90s, I was surrounded by them. I definitely recognize this scent profile, just like I did when I smelled a vintage bottle (haven’t smelled a current formulation) of Eden by Cacharel. And although these actually do have some similarities, I couldn’t bear Eden for more than an experiment. I wore it maybe 3 times before it found a new home. But this, I sprayed a few hours ago, and I want to spray it again! Addictive! I haven’t looked at the batch code for mine yet. And I did just receive it in the mail from the grey market a few hours ago, so I’m not judging its performance just yet. It doesn’t seem as strong as I was imagining from the comments, but I still am getting lovely whiffs so perhaps to people around me this would be stronger.

This is my first Gucci love, yeah I’m just gonna say I love it. I’ve only tried modern Gucci fragrances, besides the men’s version of Envy (reminds me too much of old school masculines - which I don’t like), and they all fell flat and generic to me. *One day I’ll find a way to try others released during Tom Ford’s reign.* This does not feel generic. It feels truly unique. And as a gay man, I now see why other gay men have loved wearing this. Aside from the substance reference lol. And fragrance knows no gender to me, you like what you like. Life is too short to try and live by others expectations. I also love the bottle. I’ve read through comments and many find it ugly. I find it charming. It reminds me of the red plastic boombox I had. Along with all the plastic I remember from being a kid. And I think it has a nice almost “retro mod/futuristic” look, if that makes sense. Btw, this gives me some kinda vibe that is similar to I think Chance by Chanel. Perhaps Chance (albeit spicier IMO) is the well behaved side of one’s personality, and maybe Rush is everything after dark. 😉

Update 10/15 - The more I wear this the more I realize it is not really me. I think it’s the gardenia. I do like having this in my collection and I would like to take a break from it and see if I like it on a winter’s night or something. I don’t hate it by any means, I just feel like an imposter or something. Could be that this feels young and sexy and sexy is just something I’ve never been so maybe it’s just not a match.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Vintage version starts off more blatantly fruity, along with more pungent coriander and some seriously overripe aldehydes (I'm testing a 24-year-old formula, mind - newer batches are brighter on the open). But in less than five minutes, Gucci Rush is down to business as usual. Hairspray, peach candy, plastic doll head, Grandma's dusting powder, Scotch tape, Impossible Gardenia™, brown sugar musk (think Narciso's white cube), vetiver, patchouli, [insert oakmoss synthetic here], a whiff of your older brother's cologne from down the hall, and milk. These flabbergasting accords somehow transmogrify into a humming, neon-like aura that's warm, sensual, sophisticated, nostalgic...and maddeningly, bafflingly addictive. Don't worry about reformulation - the current Rush is just as weird and wonderful (and strong!) as it's ever been, and after years of fearing its discontinuation, I think I can confidently say it's here to stay for a while.

A beautiful scent of white flowers, woody, with a hint of peach and enhanced by coriander which gives a spicy and punchy side to the whole. I really liked it and wore it in the past because, I make no secret of it, I love when the sillage is good !

Note that the coriander is well dosed because in certain perfumes, it bothers me terribly. Here, not at all.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"I applied it at 10 a.m. and was immediately overwhelmed by a blast of white floral--but not 80s white floral, because there was a hint of something synthetic and plasticy that dampened the assault and paradoxically added to the appeal. It was instantly recognizable as a late 90s, Millennial-Gen Z cusper. If I could situate Gucci Rush in a piece of media, it would be The Sweetest Thing, one of the most rotten films of the aughts (""You're too big to fit in here!"") and yet second only to Charlie's Angels in epitomizing the aesthetics of Y2K. Specially, the early clubs scenes, replete with asymmetrical crop tops, corsets, and bootcut pants riding low on impossibly flat stomachs accentuated with a belly chain. But I digress...the rose followed quickly on the heels of the gardenia and freesia and, by 1:00, the vanilla was enthusiastically announcing itself as well. Then, around 2:00, the fabled patchouli sprouted at last, completing the four-hour journey from floral to lactonic to chypre and announcing the final movement of a wonderfully discordant symphony. Who knew that a slow burn really could feel like such a rush?",02/28/24 08:56,Red Scharlach

I've never actually smelled coriander in perfume and I've definitely had perfumes with patchouli but I'm not able to discern which of the two I don't like in Rush. It has this peppery scent that makes it hard to love. When first sprayed it on I thought ""ok this is nice it's unique"" but then then that pepper like scent becomes stronger and stronger to me.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Gucci Rush is a beautiful combination of Peach,White florals, Patchouli and Vanilla with a waxy and plastic vibe. It's a bold, unique and sexy perfume which will leave a trail wherever you go and people are bound to turn their heads. Some may find it a bit synthetic & maybe even vintage, but that's what makes this perfume so exceptional than other perfumes. It's a fragrance you should wear when you want to go out for fun & get noticed. This reminds me of a carnival full of cotton candies, fruits, flowers and adventurous rides. The perfume was named after a stimulative dr*ug which was really widespread in America during 1980's. And maybe that's why the perfume smells so intoxicating, rebellious and enigmatic. It's not for the shy girl but perfect for the lady who wants to get noticed. Not a safe blind buy but if you don't mind something bold and a bit timeless then you can give this perfume a try.

🌸Gucci Rush is extremely long lasting on my skin. And it projects very nicely. In fact if you spray more than 7/8 sprays then it may fill the whole room announcing your arrival.

🌸 Perfect for parties and hangouts. You can wear this all year round but better avoiding it during hot sunny days. But it's ok for breezy summer evenings.

🌸The bottle is a nice addition to the vanity. Video Cassette shaped unique design and the bold red color makes it look really eye catching and interesting. It brings back memories of the 90's ❤️",02/02/24 12:38,TasniaTanisha

Gucci Rush Gucci,"My addiction. How have I skipped writing you a review?! It's a scent you don't forget and you can't compare it to anything else. Even after radically simplifying my shelf, I am so horrified at the thought of this being discontinued, I have a stacked supply. Even after all this time and reformulations, this is a perfume you can smell from the box even before you spray it for the first time. And boy, does it last.

Notes: think the top note as a smashed peach by vinyl high heel boots. The heart is a strong, in-your-face jasmine, touch of rose, all blended in milky vanilla. Then all of this carried by dark, daddy patchouli.

It's my ultimate ""I'm going out and I'm looking for trouble"" perfume. I wear it not when I want attention, but when I know I'm getting it. I sniff it when I need a mood lift. It's addictive. Powerful. Sexy. It's obvious and in your face and it doesn't fucking care. It's such a mood. I am so happy this is slept on by the younger generation (for now), as I know I won't smell myself on others among the Good Girls and Black Opiums. I've had men follow my scent trail at parties just to tell me it's the sexiest thing they've smelled. I feel like with the right marketing it could make a bomb comeback, because this is both nostalgic and futuristic in the same time. It cannot go out of fashion. It makes people go crazy, and I am proudly one of them. It will always have place on a rave in Berlin, on a sunrise walk at 6am in Rome, on a dress on the floor in a room you've never been in.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"I really wanted to like it, but sorry to say, this didn't agree with me at all. I tried to give it time but hours later, I still couldn't get on with it. Best way to describe how it smells to me is artificial fruit-scented disinfectant, if there ever was one, resting on a backdrop of a sweet sandalwood. Smells that seem discordant with each other rather than harmonious. Also didn't smell any patchouli in it, yet its description says it is there. Usually patchouli fragrances are hit and miss with me, but in this case, I didn't get any of that. Interesting that this was inspired by the use of poppers in clubs. When I was much younger, I have tried poppers in a club eh... I was quite out of it that night but I remember that I felt nauseous and sick suddenly and threw up on the club floor in front of people, so not a great memory 😅 Maybe that's why I didn't like it. This is a very Marmite fragrance so try it before you buy.",11/08/23 19:57,rachelv
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I love Gucci Rush! It's one of my favourites at the moment -- so unique and intriguing, yet very easy to like. I never smelt it when it first came out, but it doesn't smell like it came out in the late '90s; it was definitely ahead of its time.

For a fragrance featuring peach and white florals, it is very ballsy -- the patchouli and coriander give it a bite. I do get the ""electronics"" smell that some have described -- like wires that have been fried from a power surge or a remote control car that's been used constantly for a couple of hours, but in the most appealing way possible.

It's not delicate or pretty; it's bold and edgy. It reminds me of a woman who is feminine and classy but has masculine energy -- maybe skateboards on the weekends and has hidden tough tattoos.

I don't understand why it has such low ratings for spring and summer wear -- it's a warm fragrance, but it's not too sweet or suffocating. I've been wearing it in pretty warm weather and to the gym and have loved it. This could be a signature scent.

Performance is fantastic (I am a bit of an over sprayer -- 8 sprays mainly on clothes); after 8 hours, it wafts up to my nose if I start walking around. It lasts all day on clothes and 5ish hours on skin.",11/07/23 00:10,joeyj0jo

Gucci Rush Gucci,"[975] I have wanted to try Gucci Rush for a long time. An avant-garde composition that is the epitome of the futuristic Y2K aesthetic, its opaque red rectangular bottle was cutting edge - much like the scent housed within. It is also the polar opposite of the minimal L'Eau d'Isseys/CK Ones that summed up the 1990s - again, perhaps looking to the future. A bold fruitchouli with a heady white floral heart, it is an extroverted, polarising scent, made for nightclubbing. I found a tester (modern bottle obviously) in a pharmacy and I was surprised by how familiar it is - it resembles Cacharel Eden and perhaps others (but this is much better than Eden).

Rush opens with sweet, juicy peach followed closely by the creamy white floral accord that defines this scent. There is a camphorous green undertone to the opening that amps up the volume while remaining cohesive. Some peppery spice follows.

As it develops, jammy rose rears its head, joining the lush, sweet white florals. The modern chypre quality is unmistakable as the cloud of patchouli emerges, earthy and slightly muddy, making for a nice counterpoint to the bold floral sweetness. The vetiver complements it nicely, woody and dry. The peach persists, keeping things fruity throughout.

A liberal dose of vanilla adds sweetness to the base, alongside a slightly salty amber accord. It is smooth and creamy, complementing and prolonging the florals. The earthiness remains, underscoring the second act of Rush. It fades to a sweet vanilla skin scent punctuated by earthy patchouli until final fade. Sillage is strong and longevity is long-lasting. It is a feminine autumn/winter evening scent.

Intoxicating, lush and bold, Rush is also very well-composed and avoids being ""kitchen-sink-y"", which was what I expected. An edgy, brilliant time capsule that is still wearable today, Rush is to be worn with confidence. 4.5/5.",10/21/23 10:58,Enrium

Gucci Rush Gucci,"1999 Ethereal tragically cool peach chypre with white-florals by Michel Almairac...

Overall it's a gorgeous, ethereal, airy, cool peach chypre, that sucks you in with the intoxicating drydown. Being sucked in is perhaps the only thing this scent bears in common with the film of the same name, Rush (1991). The mood here is more in keeping with the tragic coolness of Baz Luhrmann's cinematic retelling of Romeo + Juliet (1996). I could imagine Juliet (played by Claire Danes) wearing this scent the night she first meets Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio), seeing him for the first time as a stranger through an aquarium. In this way, Gucci Rush is like a re-interpretation of the classic chypre genre, with a tragically cool flair popular to the late 90s.

The opening before the spray dries has some fresh, near-green & fruity tones. Once the spray dries and the sillage starts to open up, I get ethereal, cool, airy white-florals and soft peach, with an earthy patchouli underneath. In the drydown I get an earthy patchouli with dark, leathery, near-licorice-y tones. The longevity is there, but the sillage takes some time to wake-up. Batch code: 7129 (2017-05-09), but dark storage after first sprays helps with this. Overall, this scent does evoke the feeling of an ethereal, cool, lightheaded rush, and it's become a love for me. Enjoy!

Update 02/06/25: Sprayed this on this morning. First thing I notice is how leathery/suede-y the patchouli is. I'm surprised that leather or suede isn't a listed note. I find this more leathery with hints of licorice than the suede in Rihanna's Rogue, but there is a passing similarity. At first I don't notice any top notes, peach or gardenia (in keeping with my original test). But then they start to wake up and it turns the underlying leathery patchouli much more creamy with a hint of sweetness on a direct sniff. Just gorgeous.",09/22/23 12:03,suzanne_ronald

I'm not sure if gucci added more top notes over the years but I'd love to find a fragrance that starts off (as it did years ago) exactly like the current formulation ends.

This was a complete blind buy success , after watching some YouTube videos on how unique it was w its plastic fruit scent . I just had to try it out. I sprayed it on my arm before my workout .

I was hit with a strong plastic-peach scent a long with the gardenia and then i fought a whiff of something Spicy. On my skin, this spice kinda smelled like spicy chilli peppers which I thought was pretty cool since I love hot peppers lol but it was the coriander along with the patchouli which I think went well w the vanilla after the dry down . After a few hours even after set my workout, I still smelled the plastic peach with vanilla, vetiver and patchouli .

I love this scent , and will probably use it as a night time, going out fragrance . It’s definitely an attention getter , and the projection is prettty strong and makes its presence known. I don’t think I can wear this during the hot weather here in FL ( which is year round!) and will have to mainly use it when it’s gets below 60 or nighttime.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Synthetic smell, here it's purposeful.
Gucci Rush has a plastic smell, a perfumed plastic, the name comes from a category of drug called Poppers, also called Rush, that once inhaled, causes immediate reactions in those who use it, very common in the US in the 80s. It's a unique perfume, it has something psychedelic about it, an unearthly smell (this one should be called Alien). When I smell it I think of the movie Enter the Void and also Requiem for a Dream; neon lights, drugs, sex, ballads in the 2000s, LSD, things like that, as the name suggests.",06/29/23 17:24,ludicmilady
Gucci Rush Gucci,"My mother has been using this fragrance for years, and unfortunately it’s one that bugs me. Overall it’s a nice fragrance, but unfortunately there’s one note that is extremely penetrant. It’s the kind of note that gets in your nose and you can’t shake it, no matter what you do. My mum doesn’t overspray perfumes, so that’s not the issue, the note just enters your nose and latches into your mucus membranes and stays there for the rest of the day.

I’m not entirely sure which note bothers me so much, as I’ve always never truly ‘investigated’ the scent, or sprayed it on myself, due to disliking it. I don’t think it’s the patchouli, unless It’s a patch that smells fairly different to the patchouli in my own fragrances. It might be the vetiver, although I don’t get this type of sharpness from my own fragrances with vetiver either. Perhaps it’s a combination of vetiver, patchouli and coriander that doesn’t work for my nose, or perhaps I dislike synthetic patchouli, but do appreciate natural patchouli..

Long story short; this fragrance isn’t for everyone, so don’t buy it blind. It’s also absolutely not office safe as it has a very prominent note that some people strongly dislike and has a very strong silage. This is a note that people will smell the moment they enter the room.

Gucci Rush Gucci,"A true original. Unique. There aren't that many perfumes that are this recognizable and leave such a strong impression. And transport you back to the end of the 20th century, whoever was old enough to feel the armosphere at that time must appreciate this, if not because they like the smell (i find the audience pretty polarizing when it comes to this one, and I do understand it), then because of the vibe that it captured so perfectly. I recommend to anyone younger who wishes to get a feel of that late 90s/early 00s era to try and sniff this. It's a LOVE from me!",06/23/23 02:31,doya
Gucci Rush Gucci,"This...is...legendary.
There are certain perfumes that get you. They are intense, and real, and just special. This is one of those scents. It is truly unique and special. I don't know if they've messed with the formula or not, but for an EDT this is a BEAST.

I have a huge collection, and this is the only one I have a backup of. I love it that much. This and og The One are two of the most magnificent peach scents ever.",06/20/23 14:13,selinacat

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Despite the marketing and this red, plastic bottle this perfume never gave me the 90' feel, electronic era, VHS generation. It always smelled quite mysterious and peculiar. It might sound insane but if this came in a different bottle, if it was marketed differently...this is what i imagine Gucci Alchemist garden collection would smell like. Well, not the garden, but the interior of an alchemist cupboard or apothecary table. Very camphor like smell, medicinal gardenia and mint syrup, coriander seeds mixed with various other fragrant seeds that fell out of pouches. Thick and sweet cough syrup, aromatic wooden drawers made out of exotic wood. The interior mixes with wind from the outside from an open window, sweet and heavy just before the rain. I guess there is a garden outside, with flowers you can't identify. But still, the smell of garden is just from the open window and the earthy smell rises as the weather is turning. It's like a medicine from those vintage vials, left soaking in the grain of the wood and as the liquid evaporates thick syrup is formed. I was a child when this one was popular. I've never smelt it on others in a club or at a party, never met someone wearing it , never seen the commercial until I discovered fragrantica, so my impression is completely different. I understand the vibe this goes along with, but as those illusions of a dancer spinning I can simply switch it in my mind and create another story.",06/07/23 06:01,Petrichor134
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I have been using this perfume since 2008 or so. I have repurchased it multiple times and was always happy, even as of last year 2022. The scent has always been consistent, the sillage has always been strong and it has always been long lasting.

I recently (June 2023) repurchased it again from the official Gucci website, as my last bottle ran out, and unfortunately the scent has changed. The scent is no longer as powerful and the sillage is noticeable weaker.
I cannot help to be disappointed since this has been one of my “standard” perfumes for so many years and I used to receive many compliments even hours after application.

I will look for a new signature scent and most likely will not repurchase this again. Worth noting that the price was $105 on the Gucci website, the bottle I bought last year (2022) was $80 for reference.

Very sad and disappointed to say the least. I am hoping that with some time sitting around that the perfume might develop a bit, if so I will update this review.",06/01/23 11:16,Hellensmeller
Gucci Rush Gucci,"Powdery, synthetic, peach bubblegum ❤️ the patchouli and vanilla is more noticeable after awhile, it reminds me of Rogue by Rihanna but it smells less cheap.

Gucci Rush Gucci,I had this years ago when it came out and I loved it. I can’t believe it gets such low marks. There is no way Patchouli is that deep in this scent. I wore this all the time and I hate Patchouli. I don’t know why companies try to reissue originals that are not exactly the same. If a company wants to make a new fragrance they should… and call it something else. So frustrating. The same can be said for Miss Dior Cherie and J’adore.,05/05/23 18:57,Xenabea
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I am one of those oldies who remember when it was first released. I was in love with it. I don’t have it anymore, but some say it has been reissued, but it does not smell just like the original.

Gucci Rush is what is in its name – Rush. It is fast and furious, it is sharp, straight to the point, strong statement, like who is the boss. Powdery? Yes but strong. Might come across a bit synthetic as a result. But once it wears off, its aftertaste is milder and smells actually quite proper and expensive. Could surely be confused with some contemporary niche brand. Definitely a memorable scent, not your average Joe.

Great longevity and projection.",04/23/23 14:36,Kate_the_Iris
Gucci Rush Gucci,"The is is what Rachel’s red lipstick smells like in Blade Runner.
Starts off smelling like polly pocket shoes and scented erasers, dries down to smelling like when you try to cover up cigarette smell with body spray.
202X retrofuturism, a world where real fruits haven’t existed in a generation. Sweet in an incense way without leaning gourmandaise.
It’s fake and synthetic in the best way, and for me it smells the same way as blue raspberry, as in a replication of something that no longer exists or maybe never did.
Definitely polarizing and not for the faint of heart, but that’s what I love about it.
This was also my aunt’s signature scent when I was growing up and I blind bought it without realizing. So I love that the scent memory is passed down.",04/21/23 09:03,girlhaggard
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I have never smelled the OG Rush but this recent formulation is definitely weak.
It is a fresh pretty scent great for summer.
The mix of peach with freesia and gardenia very inviting.
I am not familiar with play-doh so I don't understand that smell reference and cannot comment on it.
It's rather linear on me though.
The scent gets a little bit deeper maybe coriander and vetiver show up but I don't get any other notes.
Disappears after 3 hrs, so longevity is not there. Projection moderate
Would I repurchase? No. It's not complex enough, but I'll finish this bottle.
I prefer Britney Spears Fantasy than this for my current summer rotation.",04/19/23 07:51,lady_ireth264
Gucci Rush Gucci,"The first time I smelled Gucci rush was in ‘99. Folding back the stuck together edge of a scratch and sniff fragrance add in Cosmo, my soul was wrapped in a cozy cashmere blanket with comfort. Reminiscent of Banana medicine, a creamy coconut, vanilla dessert and clouds of whipped cream. Intoxicating in the best way. I begged my mom for gucci rush for years. I finally got it for Christmas and savoured it till it was gone. I recently bought a bottle, the formula seems weaker and more plasticy, just not the same. It is strange to me that I never noticed peach until I read other reviews. Rush will always be a staple in my collection for anytime I need a whiff of nostalgia. A versatile scent, great in summer but to me smells best on a cold winter day.",04/09/23 09:32,Sweetthang

Gucci Rush Gucci,"I have a decant of the current formulation. To my nose this is Gucci’s own Accenti, stripped of everything that made it interesting and with the sugar dial turned all the way up. Sweet synthetic peach, some sort of flower (freesia?) if you squint, and not much else. The drydown is better, a touch of rose and patchouli… but still falling short for me. I fail to understand why this is classified as a chypre.
I struggle to find anything shocking, subversive, or sexy in Rush, but I’m happy others do. I’ve really enjoyed reading through the differing opinions on this fragrance. Diversity adds beauty to the tapestry of human life!",03/25/23 20:08,dismalharmony

Gucci Rush Gucci,"First impression on paper. I think i like the smell, it reminds me of something, but i dont know what. Maybe apple? It smells mysterious in a good way, like sour fruit. its very unique. I almost cant describe what i smell. Smell like reciving a hug, at the beach in the summer. Comforting and fresh. Instead of red, the bottle should have had a nude peach or orange color.
Update, still on paper. Smells like a sour fruit drink. I have not tried it on the skin yet.. I dont dare 😂 so far, this might be the worst parfume ever for me.",03/17/23 00:55,Spicadk
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I think Gucci Rush has been re-released? Sephora had it a few mos back, it’s on Gucci site, fragnet etc.

I vaguely remember it from the 90s but somehow I never owned it. So I had to try it (fragnet, 1oz) I guess I didn’t realize it’s an edt? It lasts prob +- an hr on my skin, but on my clothes… I sprayed it on my sleeve yesterday and can still faintly smell it 24 hrs later.

And it smells okay? I do like it, like it doesn’t smell bad, just not as earth shattering as I thought it would be, so a tad disappointed. Fruity, patchouli, plasticky, peach. Glad I tried it tho & at least can get an idea of what it was like… but do wish I could’ve smelled it back in the day as I’m sure the reform has not done it any favors.",03/16/23 20:29,ViciousVirgo

Since this didn’t come out until 1999, I’m trying to figure out what 80s perfume smelled like this. I think it might have been Revlon Trouble (An Invitation To Trouble), that was around 1988/89, and isn’t in the data base. But I had it, and think it may have smelled similar to this.",03/04/23 10:27,RB2002
Gucci Rush Gucci,"To my nose, the most prominent notes are patchouli, gardenia and vetiver. I do not notice so much the peach, instead I find the gardenia exquisite, modern and not at all dull. There is nothing dull or barbie like, except from the plastickness, which I adore! To each their own, but this is a perfume for bold, dynamic women, not girly bubble gum pinky little skirt. Dynamic women who wanna have fun. Yes, it is a fun perfume, but when fun is being taken seriously. Its sillage is extraordinary, everybody can smell me, when other supposedly loud perfumes are so light to my skin. Maybe skin chemistry? I love the opening, I adore the drydown. Yes, the opening may seem a little ""silly"", but the drydown is serious business of seduction, uniqueness and retromodern vibe. Maybe, the lovers of so-long-old hypnotic poison would love this, because of the plasticky effect. To my nose, it has nothing to do with Eden, it has similarities with Loulou, with less floral notes. Memorable, at least!",03/04/23 01:22,itsallaboutthescents

There is definitely a synthetic aspect, like hairspray, but it is enjoyable in a nostalgic way. The base is a powdered vanilla milk and some deeper, funkier patchouli and vetiver. It's unusual even today, but it isn't as sickening as other perfumes from the same era. I also love the feel of the cassette-shaped bottle.",01/04/23 19:14,tilapia_johnson
Gucci Rush Gucci,"I purchased it as a blind buy for myself this Christmas. Don't ask me how it's possible, but I didn't know what it smelt like. I have amassed a large perfume collection over the years, and yet I didn't have Gucci Rush in it nor did I have any idea what to expect. Because it's from 1999 I knew I would recognize the aroma from somewhere. So I was very excited about testing it. Upon spraying it I immediately saw friendly Loretta, the receptionist at my medical centre. I suddenly actually remembered asking her one day what she was wearing. I asked her because she was sitting there all blonde and cute looking surrounded by a cloud of something sweet, but not quite edible. Something that reminded me of vitamin chew tablets from my childhood- they were made to taste appetizing, yet somehow you knew it was medication, and not lollies. I also know I have also smelt it elsewhere, but I cannot pinpoint.
I am happy to have this perfume and I will wear it. It's fun and nostalgic for sure. The bottle I have is obviously a recent batch. It smells strong and lasts a long time.
The bottle is very cute and reminds me of a cassette. I like how it simply slides out of the box.
A similar perfume in feel and structure that I already have is Chinatown by Bond no.9. They are both fruity chypre perfumes. They are absolutely not the same but I do get a similar vibe. Luca Turing describes Chinatown as "" To my nose it smells like a corner of a small French grocery in summer, in the exact spot where the smell of floor wax meets that of ripe peaches.""

Gucci Rush Gucci,"Ohhh it smells like a techno rave! I love this!!! I've been experimenting with this perfume for a few years now. I rarely wear it because for me it requires a certain mood, a certain ambience. It's for sure a perfume to go out and attract attention! It definitely is a little bit in your-face type of scent, which leads me to the question OMG HOW IS THIS EDT??? This is Extrait d'extrait :D This is nuclear, I think they haven't reformulated this scent at all, because most of the stuff these days especially if it is edt stays for about 1h and that's it. This one... THIS IS JUST NOT WASHABLE.
My mother used to wear this perfume when it just came out, but she is an elegant lady, so I didn't have this illusion of Gucci Rush as a rave perfume, a perfume for a dancefloor or something like that. But when I bought it myself a few year ago It just straight up came out to me as this superior sexy perfume, a perfume that just goes so well with nightlife, with your fantasies, with everything that is a bit secretive but also not.
Rush is an amazing attention magnet, a very unique smell, I do get this plastic note also, but I love it! This is the note that incarnates the name of the perfume - this note gives me that rush. The rush of excitement, this buzzing feeling inside. I will not be shy and say this is just sexy sexy sexy perfume, a confidence-boosting elixir. It has something dirty in it something vulgar but in a very high-end way and I love it. I love how unapologetic this perfume is!
Please Gucci never discontinues this perfume!!! Never reformulate it! We all need this excitement in our lives! This super ecstatic sexy rush!
It definitely goes with the Gucci vibe when Tom Ford was a creative director and those sexy collections started to amaze people and those provocative ad campaigns were in Vogue magazines... That's the vibe!",12/21/22 06:34,nepria
Gucci Rush Gucci,"The batch code suggests that I have a product released in 2020. As many have mentioned, the fragrance opens with a plasticky peach smell and it reminded me of Cacherel's Eden but without the smell of wet fur and rotting fruit. The plastic smell matches the cassette-like structure in which the liquid is encased. Bright, cheerful, and quite spunky, the scent is really not for the fainthearted. Dries down to a hypnotic patchouli-vetiver-vanilla scent and disappears at about the 7h mark. Perhaps because this is a later formulation, the perfume projected and lasted a lot shorter than I'd anticipated.",12/18/22 03:18,villiruusut

This is quintessential Gucci style. Rich, sensual, effortless.
Perfect signature for the whole year and any occasion.

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"The initial spray is a not so pleasant vintage cologne. I thought I accidentally purchased the male version sample, but no. It has a unisex DNA, and aims to be elegant and poised, but it doesn't quite get there for me. The dry down is a bit better than the ""spicy musky Italian uncle with moustache smell"" opening. It is for classy and more mature wear, suitable for work environment. It doesn't give feminine, and it sort of gives me the same vibes as Pure Poison - a woman with masculine traits, bossy, and not to be played with.

But what I like about it is the freshness. I love to swim, and this gives me a similar sensation as when I just enter the pool section, both indoor and outdoor. There is something watery fresh in this with that resemblance, which is quite nice. Also evokes an expensive car smell, but not in a sophisticated way.

I would tolerate this on someone wearing it in my proximity, but not necessarily on me.",03/31/25 22:14,MetaMystic

However, all these notes in one bottle of juice don’t mesh well together for me. I don’t really care for how the fruity notes smell in this perfume. They don’t smell bad but there is definitely something off putting about the fruity notes of this fragrance. That being said, I can say that Gucci Guilty does have a very unique and original smell. I can’t name one scent it reminds me of. It does perform well on the skin and is better suited for summer and autumn.",01/22/25 21:03,StormChaserrr
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Lilac & Peach Odyssey...

I only have a tester of this from before the reformulation. Opens with a fruity burst of mandarin & pink pepper supported by mult-faceted bergamot, that deepens into the lilac & peach heart. This all rests on an amber-floral support base rounded out by patchouli, white-musk and vanilla. This is really well blended and it's difficult to pick out the additional notes in the heart, but the Gucci DNA is definitely present. It's just so well done that I can understand why it has so many fans.

Contrast to Sotoor Seen Rasasi:
This is a dupe of Gucci by Gucci but there are similarities with dewy, sweet florals and the Gucci DNA. Sotoor Seen gets a lot sweeter in the drydown with honey, although it has a similarly slow unfolding. Both have excellent performance, but Sotoor Seen has beast mode once it gets going and can work up to a cloying sweetness if oversprayed.

Overall: Beautifully blended classic lilac-peach scent with excellent performance. You can't go wrong if looking for a classic amber-fruity-floral. It's a love for me. If you manage to find a bottle, enjoy!",01/13/25 11:01,suzanne_ronald

I agree, it is a simple scent, and the peach and lilac notes aren't as strong as I would like them to be, but I find it best worn in the winter or spring, the summer not so much. I think the reason why I love this scent is because it introduced me to the value of smelling good and how receiving compliments about how good I smell truly means a lot to me.

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Weird after 2 yrs of owning this & thinking it was too masculine smelling. I just sprayed original gucci on one hand & guilty gucci on the other. Then Mariah carey m on my upper arm (which smells alot like euphoria but I liked Mariah better.)
So comparing all of these.. The regular gucci is more tissue smelling, maybe like a nice feminine teacher would wear this. But she has a slight hint of coffee breath. The sour smelling breath when someone gets too close & you have to turn your head. She's kinda pretty but you'd probably think she was prettier without a Sourish coffee breath
Guitly gucci- this one...smells better to me. But.
I just had my bf smell each one & he liked the regular gucci better cause he said it was softer.
Which is weird it seems like guys would like a stronger smell & girls like softer but I get where hes coming from, its like laying on Your mom & feeling comforted. But i still like the guilty smell better.. its stronger & more bold & doesn't have a tissue kleenex drydown smell to it. we got on the topic that its weird how men like softer scents & women like more masculine. If the opposite was true then why aren't men wearing feminine scents to draw in women. & women wear masculine to draw in men. I suppose that is why.. Personally I love gourmand scents so if my fella wore sweet stuff I'd be pretty turned on.
But still this one smells better & bolder, than gucci. Maybe thats why its gold. Shaped like a gold bar. Cause it smells like gold. its weird cause for 2 yrs i never smelled the la nuit type of smell until i just put it on again. Its actually pretty good. I was overwhelmed that I couldn't figure out how to describe this but yes it does have that generic typical gold amberish cashmere smell to it. I think of going into a department store during xmas & spraying it on & thats the scent you keep smelling for an hr afterwards. this one is on the verge of a mariah carey m/ calvin klien euphoria (which these 2 smell very similar to me) but sweeter... mariah has a marshmallow scent to it but also a black licorice hint to it which I love cause one of my favorite smells is Halloween night from solstice scents so comparing all 3 of these im starting to like Mariah careys best especially after 1/2hr & its also cheaper.
Guilty on the other hand is discontinued..so it verges on the more expensive side of designer if you want to smell bolder then this gucci guilty is better.
It smells more like if you mixed regular gucci w ""the only one"" purfume. Or lancome la nuit smell? Im not smelling the peach smell everyone is saying it has in it. So its sweeter than the lighter powdery somewhat sour tissue paper smell of regular gucci. My bf prefers the regular. & im starting to smell the Mariah carey m (purple bottle) that I sprayed on my upper arm & guilty is kinda smelling like that & euphoria by Calvin klien a few yrs ago I compared mariah M to euphoria & I thought they smelled identical so I gave euphoria to my friend. So..out of all the 400 purfumes I have guilty smells mainly like euphoria possibly lancome lan uit but less creamy",02/04/24 21:59,lagavulinx

If you’re looking for a flexible scent, one that inoffensive enough to wear at work and fun enough to wear after hour; this is for you. It gives a clean, unbothered but smells good vibes for working environment but still cool enough for a night out.

I don't get any fruits or vanilla. I think this is a great scent that can be worn both in the office and on a date, so it's very versatile. I prefer the EDT to the EDP, the parfum tends to smell really strong and spicy, almost like black licorice, which I'm not a huge fan of. EDT still has that licorice quality, but only on initial spray. I usually only spray this once when I use it, but I can smell it all day, so I would say it's pretty long-lasting.

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"This is a tough one. I don't dislike it, but I'm thrown off.

It opens super aromatically, which actually made me balk a little. Not in a bad way, but it actually has a masculine tone with the brisk nature of lilac, pepper and whatever citruses are here. Yet...as it fades a bit and settles into the heart, it becomes more obviously floral in nature. Still, the lilac is more femme, but it contends with the pepper...I think this is easily unisex (who cares, wear what you want anyway).

It becomes soapy in the dry down. I can't even discern what's going on at all, but it's a malange of stuff and smells like a 70s soapy, aromatic, kitchen sink blend of things. I really don't dislike it though, but I'm mystified by this packaging and marketing. Not in a million years would I have guessed it would smell like this!

So anyway, it's not bad, but it isn't at all sensual, golden or anything close. It smells like light powdery greens and purple. This might be the most incongruous scent&bottle combo I've ever experienced.

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I initially added this during the summer months and it was just a ""like"" for me. In fall, I'm re-evaluating and rotating in some fragrances specifically for fall vibes. Because I lean so hard into Bergamot and citrus notes, it's harder for me to find heavier, fall-like scents I like on my body. I also HATE vanilla and dislike most powdery and ozonic notes on my skin as they dry down.

This is one of only a couple of scents with vanilla that will remain in my likes. The patchouli, musk, and amber balance it so it just gives the scent body and not ""hi! We're in a bakery!"" vanilla flavor. And the powdery note others mention is not prominent on my skin, particularly in this cooler weather. I get that pink pepper blast to start which I LOVE, btw, but it settles down in under 30 minutes. The floral trail is perfectly balanced by the black currant, and the dry-down doesn't veer too fruity or too floral. I'm in love.

I'm still testing longevity with the bottle I purchased from someone who pre-sprayed about half their bottle on EBay, so I'll be interested to see. This just might become a fall staple for me. If it has staying powder, it might go into the ""love"" category!",10/25/22 12:10,EBetharama

Got it as a gift for my Birthday from my then Boyfriend and this was Sometime in 2018 when I knew absolutely nothing about Perfume Notes or what Niche in perfumery even was lmao. But I Absolutely adore this fragrance. I wore it to every special occasions then. Date nights, club, parties, the park, to church and weddings lol but even at that, I used it sparingly too. Two to four spritz and I was Good to go. I can say that the projection of this is moderate but the performance is amazing. Even when I go nose blind to this, people around me could still smell my fragrance so the sillage is amazing. I absolutely love the dry down of this.

La fragancia tiene un comienzo muy fuerte, intenso, amaderado, para luego a la media hora bajar a algo mas dulce y simil al talco. En mi piel sólo duró 4 hs. Por alguna razón me recordó al ""Givenchy-Ange ou demon edp"" (el original que salió en 2006). Nada más que ese me duraba todo el día en la piel y este no.",07/13/22 08:55,Marychase
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I have to laugh at the reviews where people said this smells like diapers. Because honestly, they aren’t entirely wrong! Lol! But I truly do love this frag. It does kind of remind me of baby wipes. And I don’t mind that at all. Those smells like baby wipes, baby powder, Johnson’s & Johnson’s baby magic, they’re all great scents to me! But I think Guilty is more complex than just a baby wipe smell. You have the florals and the ambery vibes. The musky vanilla. I think this scent really shines in cold weather. But maybe that’s because it’s the only time I wore it- my boyfriend (now husband) bought this for me as a birthday gift I think in 2011 or 2012. And I blew through it and ran out of it all by around march or April. So I didn’t get to experience it much in spring or summer. I truly do love this scent. I’d say it’s one of the first scents that I’ve ever used, to me, that felt “sexy”. I haven’t smelled a ton of perfumes in my life but I don’t think I’ve ever smelled anything quite like this! It feels really unique in my opinion.

But I will say this: this scent has been reformulated and I have not smelled the new formulation. The OG formulation that I had, it really did have great longevity. Only a couple sprays and it was very strong. In fact, when I wore this in college, I was freshly showered, hair washed, and sprayed 2 spritzes of guilty. I walked into a room on campus where you can hang out and study, and was dismayed that two college boys across the room kept saying things like “oh my God what’s that horrible old lady smell“ “Jesus it’s so strong”. So yeah, despite their comments I still adore this scent, but yeah definitely not for everyone lol. But I can at least confirm that it has great sillage and longevity!",07/05/22 23:24,chelseet

It gives off a clean, feminine, luxurious vibe which is great for a day at work or in places where you just want to smell good without making a statement of your presence.

I received it in a swap and I am only getting a full wear for the first time today. Of the ones in my collection this reminds me a lot of My Name with it's sweetness and prominent lilac note.

I have been changing diapers daily for nearly 7 years but thankfully I am not reminded of diapers! Also, peach is a note I sometimes struggle with, it's not cloying and screetchy in Guilty though. I think it's easy to wear and quite lovely, something I will probably reach for when I want something non-offensive and likeable.",02/17/22 01:38,zind
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I was reading a magazine and caught a whiff of something incredible. It was a test strip for Gucci Guilty. I got tons of patchouli, incense, and jasmine from the test strip. I was loving it, excited to find something that smelled like my bath routine-- Neutrogena rain bath, a layer of nag champa lotion, followed with jasmine body oil and a dab of Matchabelli Skin Musk (oil). Most perfumes I own are more vintage in their profiles so I was pumped to find a perfume that wouldn't be redundant AND hit some great notes for me.

Unfortunately my bottle doesn't seem to replicate the same accords. It's nice, I get the incense and jasmine in the opening. Then it turns into basically a VERY light musk/skin scent within 2 hours. Usually a scent will linger on my clothes around the neckline--NADA. I might finish my bottle but it will probably take a long time--there are better scents out there and my Mugler Alien EDP definitely outranks and outperforms this when I want Jasmine and warm woods. The best part of this is the bottle, which reminds me of a shiny gold Boccioni sculpture. Very Italian. Doesn't match the juice inside.

I see this going for big prices so I'm glad I spent more like $40 usd for my 1.7oz rather than the 92 DOLLARS??!! I'm seeing this go for now??!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FOR $92.

Edit: another user mentioned there's not an EDP. Mine is the EDT. Facade fell off the bottle so now I can't even enjoy that until I glue it back on 😅",01/28/22 17:05,swedishmilk15

But each time i tried to wear it it just never worked for me :( Its soooo very interesting though, every girl whose smelled this on me adored it. They say it smells expensive, it smells like a boss, it smells luxurious. But yet LITERALLY every man whose smelled this on me said it smells like a baby/baby wipes. And i personally had the same impression when i first smelled it too. I think its the abundance of lilac in this perfume that really reads as a baby lotion/baby wipe/ baby product and i just cant shake that. Its such a shame because it opens with a pleasant floral fruity opening with the peach and black current, and it drys down to a really lovely spicy vanilla on me which i really do love. But the haunting of that Lilac literally lingers for the entirety of this perfumes life on my skin and i just cant feel confident knowing i smell like a baby. Overall i will say its a pleasant perfume and i understand why people love it, but i will always remember this one as the “baby smelling” perfume for me :(

The fragrance opens with mandarin and bergamont and slowly dries down to delicious jasmine and amber notes that I love. It's not really sweet, not too floral, just sexy and rich.

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"This is arguably my favourite scent - Favourite scent for a particular mood or occasion.
Realistically, I don't believe this scent is for everyone however.
What is this scent made for in my opinion? Summer. A bottle chilling out in your apartment on your bed, as you gaze into the sunset sipping a Moscato wine, thinking about what outfit you're going to pull together for a night out on the town by the waterfront. It's a certain lifestyle that this scent goes with and perhaps is made for - And it doesn't make sense outside of that lifestyle.
Clubbing scent, yes, but luxe lifestyle more so.
I would spray this all over me, and my clothes - And it is just a signature scent for those who love Gucci and the beach. :)

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I got this as a gift. I must admit I was reluctant to put this on reading the name. I expected something super punchy in your face, full of patchouli and dirt, sweat etc. So I went online to read the notes. The notes made me feel a bit more assured that this won’t be the case but I was still nervous to try this on because of the pink pepper. I was sure I’d get a headache or that I’ll want to immediately scrub this off when I tried it on my skin…but…wait a minute…

This actually smells nice and … light? airy??.. I remember my first thought was “ Guilty? How exactly?!” I needed a bit of time to make sense of it, to put it in a category but I just couldn’t…
See that’s the case with it.
You can’t define it. It’s not sweet or floral centered, it’s not sexy in an obvious way, not super musky and clean, not sophisticated in a serious way. It’s not “old” or “young”… it’s just…balanced. And most of all…It’s free.
It doesn’t care about your perception of it. It doesn’t want to be put under a certain label.

Most perfumes bring a memory or a loved in mind when I smell them but this one smelled like a fictional character… This smelled like what I imagine Carrie Bradshaw would smell like in the first few seasons of SATC. She’s walking down the streets of Manhattan with the wind blowing through her hair. She’s chic and clean and sexy but doesn’t care to fit your perfect image. She’s smoking and on her way for some cocktails. She’s single or in between an affair. She doesn’t care. She’s empowered and working for herself. She’s not sure of what the future holds but she’s certain of one thing…it won’t be boring.

If I could, I’d bath myself in this scent because the EDT is light enough for all seasons and my skin just sucks this up SO so quickly. I’ll reapply generously though just to feel this way again. This won’t be a signature, I know, it’s just a love affair… I know it won’t last, but I’ll remember this for a long time after we part ways. That’s what makes this “guilty”.",06/08/21 05:36,lillysswann

One with too much hairspray that you can also smell a mile away. No offense to anyone who loves this scent by the way. Perfumes do manifest differently on everyone's skin, but this is the vibe that I got from it. And that stiletto did not fit sadly.

I get nothing smelling this, i just get gucci guilty",04/19/21 03:55,Rawantica
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I love this fragrance and it smells really nice on me, but I have purchased the EDT in a new 2021 bottle that looks like the 2019 EDP bottle and it is sad how little it lasts, even on clothes. It just disappears completely after an hour if at that. I've tried the EDP version and while it does have great projection and longevity it's borderline headache inducing for me and the scent itself is more potent. I prefer the softness of the EDT, if only it lasted longer.",04/05/21 16:32,madamfleur
Gucci Guilty Gucci,Don’t like the opening - smells like cheap perfume but the dry down is nice and has peppery notes which I find unique. But the staying power just wasn’t there.,03/29/21 05:47,Madnanavej
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"On me, it's a slightly spicy lilac baby powder. It's inoffensive and nice but not really a statement. Would be nice for the office.",03/25/21 06:18,writekatewrite
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I HATE the soapy opening ! I simply hate it!

Sometimes I put it on and when I get past the opening , I'm like ... Ooh nice! Other times like today, it's just irritating ! I don't get patchouli at all. That would be the salvation for this perfume. I get soap. Musk. Yuck.",03/24/21 09:32,Not_a_perfume_junkie
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I can see where people are getting the soap vibes from. It does have a soapy quality once it's dried down. I'll start by saying it's not my favorite but it's not terrible. Initially I get a sweet, peppery peach. But I also get a sort of juicy, waxiness that lingers throughout that reminds me a bit of MMM Lipstick On but far less sweet and cloying than Lipstick On. I said this about Gucci Guilty Black, and although my sentiments about the two fragrances are different (because they definitely are) - I'm wondering if this sort of sweet waxiness is characteristic of the Guilty line. No mistake, it's certainly not a bad quality, but it's there. The spicy sharp pepper note stays throughout as well, making itself more known as the fragrance dries down and helps cut through some of the initial sweet fruitiness. All of the base notes really come out after the sweet peach fades down but the amber and musk take up much of the attention. I get hints of the lilac, jasmine, and geranium but they blend into an indistinct generic ""floral"" note. Overall I find this to be an inoffensive but unremarkable fragrance.",03/20/21 19:28,Phemia
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"It took me a long time to like this scent. Now i find her very pretty, but a lot of people around me don't like her. It's not a safe blind buy. Ideal for winter and fall. When I wear it I feel ""boss"", but I never guet compliments on this one. Dominant notes are powdery lilac, peach, and pepper. Its smell way better on the skin, its sweeter.
10/10 for the bottle.
6.5/10 for the scent
6/10 for performance",03/17/21 13:12,stefani valini
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Other reviewers have said that Gucci Guilty is wrongly named and that 'Innocent' would be far more apt but I disagree. This would be the perfect scent to wear if one were having an affair or otherwise up to no good: it's pleasant but not at all distinctive; undetectable as it doesn't hang around for too long. It's safe, pleasant, pretty and anonymous. The ideal perfume for anyone undertaking clandestine activities.",03/01/21 03:07,Sesquialtera
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Floral patchouli primarily, but the pepper and peach do add a very nice depth. Mostly warm, but the geranium always feel like such a cool stone flower to me so there is a nice contrast. I think the geranium and something else, possibly the musk are giving it a little soapy feel, not a bad thing on it's own.

The black currant must be from the berry and not the leaf/bud because the ""green"" parts of black currant always turn to cat pee on me and this did not, though I'll admit I never quite found the berry either, I just know there was no cat pee.

This feels like a nighttime party scent, the sort of thing wafting around in the background of a James Bond casino scene, maybe.",02/20/21 09:32,IndiePenScent
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I too smell soap in this. A matter of fact has a distinct Dove bar soap smell. Not only that it made me feel nauseated all day long. Other then that I did like it, and my hubby LOVED it.",02/19/21 21:19,DeeDeeRay1025
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I got a sample and it's my first time smelling this. Or is it?? My first impression was, oh yeah...I recognize this right away. I've smelled it in the department store air while out shopping. The first note I'm getting is the lilac, and it's a lovely lovely lilac. The patchouli and jasmine join in a few moments later and now it's giving me Coco Mademoselle vibes. But the patchouli isn't making my nose itch as much as the patchouli in Coco Mademoiselle. This strikes me as a ""fancy"" perfume to wear when you're feeling sexy and confident, when you want to get noticed, for a date or a night out, or an important work meeting or conference when you want your confidence to shine. Very feminine.

NOT discontinued to the best of my knowledge!",02/09/21 06:50,fragrances-fanatic
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I've come back to this very late in the day.. I think it's discontinued now? I tried it when it first came out, but at the time just thought meh. It didn't interest me but I'm revisiting the past generally at the moment as I really don't want to live in the present. It could be found in pretty much every perfume shop everywhere n I decided I would get it for the bottle mostly, before it disappears into the perfume shop in the sky. It's bright lilac, peach n berries over patch, the powder is almost off radar. It feels different to most of the rest of my collection to me but I'm not sure what's setting it apart.. it seems amiable so far..",02/06/21 15:12,Siv7Stars
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I smelled this on paper in the store and I loved it. It smelled like an evil lady. However after spraying it on myself at home, it smells so different. The best way to describe it is like a deodorant that has been worn for a whole day that a slight armpit smell is present.",01/29/21 04:25,eloquent
Gucci Guilty Gucci,I love this perfume. I get a nice juicy peach opening which dries down to such a lovely scent on me. I find this is an easy fragrance for me to reach for when I want something a little sexier and warmer for the cooler months. I think it’s worth getting a sample of!,01/15/21 02:48,Juora16
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"For Gucci, I don’t think it’s that strong or long lasting atall. Not really worth the money. Kinda gives me Michael Kors sexy amber vibes. It is a nice smelling perfume don’t get me wrong, it’s just not strong enough smelling for me. (Gives me a headache too!!) classy tones, good and suitable for job interview style",01/07/21 19:34,alisha-gabrielle
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"This was my first perfume ever that I absolutely loved for many reasons. I’d say my first real signature scent. I do get compliments wearing this. Has great sillage and lasts a long time on my skin. Another that I would also wear for nights out and I’d still be able to smell on myself the morning after lol.. definitely a fun, sexy vibe to it. I think this was my first perfume that didn’t give me headaches as well. It’s warm, mature and spicy. Lots of good memories from my 20s with this one.",12/31/20 22:28,Torika
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"It's fine. I got this from Scentbox and it just smells like a generic department store perfume on me. It has a musky green smell that I like, but probably not enough to buy at full price. My initial test spritz on my wrist radiated through my whole arm. I don't know for longevity right now since I haven't had the chance to wear it out but I can imagine it would be pretty good because of how initially intense it is.",12/31/20 10:36,caitlinm
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I got this for Christmas. This is on my to try before buying list since it’s recommended by Kathleen lights. Patchouli has never been easy on me, it always gives me a strong headache. I tried to like this but just on the first use alone it gave me a terrible headache.

It’s nice sans the patchouli 😔
Anyone wants to buy it on a lower price?",12/30/20 07:32,GingerP
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"This is for the EDT. It starts off sharp like Lady Million of Paco Rabbane, must be the common patchouli amber combo and also Rihanna's Reb'l Fleur has that same sharp opening that im not a fan of and it has patchouli amber as well. Thank God it calms down quickly and then I get a light powdery and peppery floral sweetness that's very elegant and not too mature not too juvenile. Idk why but its powderiness reminds me of makeup and lipsticks. Id go for this perfume if i were to be out in the open and not in a room, only cuz out in the air it smells so much better to me. Its drydown is very peachy and lilac to my nose, this is why it kiiiinda reminded me of Reb'l Fleur's drydown (has peach too), but theyre totally different compositions, they have the same base notes tho and I think theyre in the same family of youthful mysterious fruity florals with a touch of purple in them (lilac and black currant in Gucci, plum and violet in Reb'l Fleur). I ended up liking Gucci Guilty and like I said I can appreciate its beauty out in the clean air, winter or summer. I wore it in 25 degree weather while snowing and i loved it.",12/24/20 18:37,sassa7
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"For some reason, I always seem to get compliments when I'm wearing Guilty. It's a very feminine and powdery scent, perfect for all occasions whether you're out on the hunt looking for a new boo or if you're just going to work. It's quite inoffensive and I'm a big fan of the dry down. On me, the patchouli stands out as does the lilac. The only downside is that it's not the most long-lasting fragrance (3-4 hours) but a beautiful scent nonetheless.",12/24/20 09:00,IvyofPoison
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I bought this one when it was fairly new. I loved it and I do remember recognizing it on others, so I can say it is definitely a unique and recognizable scent. Maybe for those that like loud perfumes and they were expecting something totally different from the Guilty name, this one was a bit disappointing.
For me it smells like a very feminine modern floral scent. I smell lilac mixed with jasmine with slight spiciness. The dry down surprises with a little sweetness - vanilla.
I like it in winter, or colder weather. I like lighter scents, so it works for me.
Oh, I should add I like the bottle. My kids (boys) think it is the coolest one that I have :).
The sprayer is not the best.
When I finish this one, I may try a flanker of GG.",12/23/20 18:16,R0x0lana
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I got this from my boyfriend as a gift and I love it!!! It's a soft spicy that smells little bit soapy in my nose (probably because of patchouli) with a hint of warm orange in dry down. It smells elegant, laidback, feminine, and perfect for night out. Too bad it doesn't last long in my skin.",12/05/20 19:21,Annisanurfitr
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"This perfume smells like a hot model who is smoking a cigarette after having bathroom sex in a Miami club after downing expensive booze. It literally smells like a party and made me feel like a bad party girl in my 20s. I’m not a party girl, nor am I in my 20s, so I gave it to my cousin who is.",11/22/20 17:56,MiaKarmelle
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I like how this has the faint powdery start before the fruity and floral notes come in. I also like that it's not just overwhelmingly sweet like some of the newer perfumes are. It's a good scent for pretty much any occasion; as long as you don't bathe in it, you can wear it pretty much whenever you want. I wish it lasted a bit longer, though.",11/20/20 11:44,Mona708
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"this scent has always been my ""secret weapon."" more of a fall, winter, night time scent especially when going out for the night with friends or a date. I've always gotten comments on it and even one from a friend who hated the smell of it from the bottle but then loved it on my skin later on. it's feminine but not too much (which fits me very well) and it makes me feel confident and sexy... so much so that I love to spray some on myself as I'm getting ready. it can be VERY intense though so don't overdue it with the spritzes, keep it light and mysterious and I assure you it will draw people in.",11/16/20 15:42,maybe: hendrix
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"This is a special scent, for me it has the DNA of Gucci Bamboo and Gucci Rush mixture added some sweetness to it. It is great for daytime busy day running around and enjoying the colours of autumn 🍂 Playful and energetic, long lasting as well, great value for price. I would also add to the review if anybody is looking to gift a perfume this one would impress anybody as it’s very easy going.",10/31/20 13:47,Naomie
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"A truly incomparable scent. I love that it’s called guilty, sounds sexy, yet still classy and mischievous. It contains pink pepper, which gives it that little bit (but not too much) spice. A really pretty, classy looking bottle too.",10/09/20 06:10,Cataddicted
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"On me this perfume is so faint. And the light scent that I can actually smell has faded away in a couple of hours. But what I have noticed is that the opening for at least 10 minutes is a light licorice scent, like anise. After searching through the hundreds of reviews on here, I finally saw one other person who mentioned the licorice! So I’m not the only one! :) Then I noticed some people saying it reminded them of diapers, and as I smelled it again, I got it! Yes a baby powder scent. Probably the lilac. It’s quite a pretty, ordinary scent and as I mentioned VERY light and faint. (Today was my third time testing it and I even sprayed more than usual.) I agree with other reviewers that the name does not fit this perfume. It’s not guilty, it’s the most innocent thing I’ve ever smelled :) I mean, it is lovely even though I can barely smell it, so I’ll finish out my sample but I won’t purchase a larger size.",10/02/20 12:08,TammyRoxanne
Gucci Guilty Gucci,I'm wearing this perfume now after finishing Chanel Chance. Nice flower scent. Very feminine and confident at the same time. Good longevity and moderate silage. Perfect for office work fragrance!,10/01/20 03:20,Amelia1809
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Fruity in the beginning, then softened down to the spicy lilac. This is lovely, but fades way too much...no sillage whatsoever. This would be the perfect office fragrance, inoffensive and fresh, but not big or noticeable for a date night (as I was hoping). This is a clean, polite floral.",09/26/20 06:42,poolsoflaughter
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"~ I am the minority here , I spritzed a few minutes ago { about 5 } and it is already gone "" poof "" on me . My skin just ate this up literally with no afterthought . Ha ~ she is there , only when I place my wrist up my nose and inhale deeply , truly .The Lilac is the only hint of a note I get the most of , which I do like a lot as a main floral note . She would have been better on me as EDP instead of EDT. I only have a few EDT's because I did not look before purchase , I don't wear them well , I may have one or two that wear more like an EDP though which is always a gem to find . Most times vanilla is super strong on me , sometimes sickeningly so and is all I can smell . I got a hint of something , it could be the vanilla but I'm not sure , but if any other note is present besides the Lilac I can't really tell on me . Layering would be a waste of juice regardless of how she would wear , it just kills me that at the cost of GG ,I'd have to resort to layering , and no way of knowing if I'd get any benefit of layering unless I use a cheap scent . So after today's ordeal I'll place in my "" does not work for me bin "" which I'm proud to say only has about 4 in total . Hmm , I just realized two of those are Gucci , this one and Gucci Oud ~ and two Swiss Arabian ~ Unless I got a fake or a watered down bottle , GG has ghosted me ~///= ^ } ~ Boo",09/24/20 18:30,divakitty24
Gucci Guilty Gucci,I have always loved this fragrance. It smells expensive and lasts a long time on me unlike most perfumes. I find it perfect to wear to a nice restaurant or bar on an evening out. I think this perfume is very good value for money and I have received lots of compliments from both men and women.,09/19/20 01:32,Lyndseymarie

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"A powdery floral with some spice. This is classy, but also sexy without being too in your face. This would be a great nighttime going out scent for someone who prefers more lightweight perfumes and is not into the super heavy, loud, sweet orientals (like CH Good Girl, for example). The bottle is stunning, too!",07/23/20 07:45,Imalthia
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"I'm not getting the baby note people are talking about. What I do smell is a very well-blended fragrance. I don't know how big the ad campaign for this scent was, because it smells to me like a pile of fashion magazines (in the best possible way). The drydown is such a creamy vanilla, and the top notes are floral and peachy, in an unobnoxious way. I find it sexy. Maybe not ""Guilty"" sexy, but sexy in a grown woman way.",06/24/20 23:18,Neckromancer

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Saw this few months ago at the Macy's and decided to try on. Ended up purchasing the bottle, even though there's nothing ""guilty"" about this fragrance. As many already have mentioned, it's clean, fresh, very nice scent. I don't detect anything even slightly spicy... Nothing special to write home about, just a beautiful fragrance in a beautiful bottle. Downside of the bottle - it gets tarnished where you keep touching it. Pain in the neck if you have OCD to keep polishing it after every use :)",05/06/20 05:25,CrazyRussianChick
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Amazing!!!!
This perfume is elegant and sophisticated, definitely for a more mature women I feel (20-35). I'm not gonna lie though as others have stated they smell a clean fresh diaper... I get that 100%! Went and smelt a fresh Pampers newborn diaper and its spot on it has that fresh powdery smell. Although I still love it, its calming and warm and welcoming. Definitely one of my favs!",05/01/20 22:19,Mickey764

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"This is a floral, slightly peppery scent. I like that it is sophisticated but still sweet. I generally wear it on club nights. Its pretty long-lasting and I've received compliments on it. To me, its a pretty basic scent and I probably would not repurchase. But, it is very nostalgic and it reminds me of a few good, long nights out. Overall, it is very pleasant, but I'm after more interesting scents these days.",04/26/20 19:36,JaimeLaParfum

Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Smells clean, expensive and soapy.

The bottle and packaging are very nice and classy, but I wouldn't expect anything less from Gucci.

I just got through a bottle, and it was never something I raved about or reached for very often. It would be a very safe blind buy and gift. I agree with previous reviewers that said it smelled like expensive skin care. On my own mother, it smelled like some fancy hotel soap. Pleasant and feminine, but nothing that made us go ""wow.""

Personally, I wouldn't re-purchase. (I was gifted a bottle.) I think it's nice and easy-going, but it's nothing ground-breaking or sexy.",04/18/20 07:45,Jasmindee
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"A stronger character perfume of Lanvin Eclat d'Arpege. Do you know soft spring flowers? Do you know the heavy purple branches of lilies emitting that lovely scent of honey and wild wind? Gucci Guilty is an alluring, youthful fruity floral oriental elixir. If it was a fabric, it definitely would be grey silk, a grey silky dress - likely to become a new classic. Guilty? Not so much. No crimes commited, unless the crime is too many bees on a single lily tree. Or a forgotten peach.",04/16/20 07:16,bel.gravia
Gucci Guilty Gucci,"Wow, this is soft, clean, creamy, sweet, it smells like luxurious expensive moisturizer. It’s a peaches and cream delicate, clean, soft lilac. It’s quite musky and bordering on safe. Oh, heck it is safe. But it’s also tender and gentle like a sweet little baby. This is a great shower clean scent when you just want to smell nice. This has the cleanest patchouli I’ve ever smelled. It’s almost nonexistent. This is one of the least perfumy scents ever. It smells like a perfume lotion to me in a creamy laconic way. It has a nice warm amber and some vanilla. About an hour in the florals come out of this some more the lilac ramps up a little bit and it’s a little bit powdery. It’s got a little bit fruit but it’s very mild and quiet with a tiny bit of pink pepper.",03/26/20 20:01,Rosemary14
