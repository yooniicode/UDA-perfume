Emblem Absolu Montblanc,Smells like an apple juice I think it’s the pear and the smell is beautiful on skin honestly but projection and longevity is awful.,11/13/25 03:22,Dagim.zs

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"I LOVE this one! Scored it for a bargain $15 on an incorrect ticket at a chemist. Big win for me! It was also a blind buy that I don't regret at all. I gifted it to my partner and I adore it on him, I also find im reaching for it often myself as I'm really digging that creaminess with the cardamom. I've got it on today, layered with Roberto Cavalli's Uomo- adding to the honey & lavender vibe, with a little more moss as well. I might have gone in with a spritz of Cacharel's Yes I am, to add a little more warmth & sweetness with the raspberry and ginger, and another top up on that cardamom.
I like things a little more intense sometimes, dont mind me 🤣",01/20/25 14:20,Sheena Dee

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"#877 in my ""Tour de Fragrance""

I'm not getting Boss Bottled from this. It's not around any more except from the eBay scalpers, but this smells a lot like Jaguar ""Prestige"" EDT and performs like it. Coach for Men, Calvin Klein ""Obsession Night"" EDTs also come to mind. I know there's a Middle Eastern scent on my shelves that also smells like this, Armaf ""All You Need is Love"" which also smells nice for about two hours tops. Fruity, sweet, but not excessively so. A little green from patchouli, vetiver and moss. But really unimpressive performance. I was hoping for better, but it's typical of Mont Blanc EDPs to perform like an EDT. Nice bottle and sprayer. Good for date wear, but if you wear it to the office you'd definitely respray at lunch. Completely inoffensive, likeable and priced reasonably at the right discounters.",09/20/24 08:23,JusttheFactsMan
Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"First Pass - Sweet. Fruity. Subdued. Hint of sourness. This reminds me of Lacoste French Panache. Or rather I should say French Panache reminds me of Emblem Absolu, since this fragrance came out 2 years earlier

1 Hour Later - A faint trace of spice. Still very sweet

2 Hours Later - Delicate and soft, some wisps of woody earthiness. The sour note I smelled at the top is still hanging around, barely, almost musty now. The sweetness continues to accrue. Too sweet to feel masculine now

Looking at the build pear makes perfect sense for a mild, fruit sweetness. Surprised to see Mandarin Orange, I don't get citrus at all...

Cardamom or Pink Pepper could have given the spice. No surprise to see honey, it's very sweet

I don't know what the culprit could be for the sour/musty note, but I find it reminiscent of damp cardboard. It is slight, almost not there, but just enough that I find it distracting

Overall - Lacoste French Panache is similar to this scent. I love that cologne, and although I discovered it first, it's hard to imagine Lacoste's designer wasn't taking notes from Mont Blanc

While I like French Panache better, it almost certainly couldn't exist without Emblem Absolu. It's not nearly as sweet, nor does it have the sour/musty note that I find distracting here

Regardless, there's something magical with how both of them handle the lavender & patchouli that I find exceptional

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"I got this from a secondhand seller today, so it's possible something is amiss, but this thing smells like oud, and only oud to me and Im not exactly fond of it. That being said, I was harsh in my rating and I am singlehandedly responsible for bringing this fragrance down from a 4.00 to a 3.99. I matched the batch code up and it's legit so I don't know what's going on. I just don't think what's in my bottle is good.",11/25/22 15:13,Italian_ro

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,I LOVE this fragrance and this whole emblem line. This one completes my collection of Mont Blanc legend and emblems. This one is my favorite of the Emblem line. Sweet fruit. I reminds me of being an orchard with some vetiver base notes. My wife loves it too and she is very picky about what I wear. I would recommend all the legend and emblem line if you like this type of fragrance. I blind bought this to complete the collection and was not disappointed.,09/23/22 14:40,robertandsheilaburke
Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"Rich and manly spices in an underlying sweet pear note. Tested in store alongside the silver Intense bottle. This (gold) one was richer. It's great for the office and stays with you all day. I did feel a slight headache from the synthetic ingredients at the 20 min mark, but the dry down was really nice! Pear is a great note and is quite rare for a men's fragrance, so credit to Mont Blanc for this one!",10/18/21 13:50,Fendy1

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"I got this one today to add to my other two(the original and the intense!) in the Emblem line. For me this one is the better of the three. The Silage is good but it's the stronger smelling of them all. I like this very much and I will be using it for a signature scent for awhile. Having a big collection can give you a headache in choosing what to wear on a given day. However, this one is an easy goto because it's pleasant enough for all occasions. 8 out of 10 all the way for me for a really easy to please scent that will also get you compliments!!",07/31/21 03:29,johnjubal1958
Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"Opens with a close resemblance to Boss Bottled Intense but adds some funky fruity notes. Top notes do seem a little busy and confused.
Heart notes closer to the original DNA.
Emblem Absolu does mutate from Emblem EDT and Intense DNA. Goes off in an oriental gourmand skanky direction.

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"This does remind me of Boss Bottled Intense, but only in the spicy notes. This lacks the apple and is more subtle in the sweet aspects. I find this performs poorly off my skin and fades out within a couple hours, it does project ok during that time. All in all I would not buy again, and while I do like the fragrance it is nothing I would reach for regularly, I can't recommend it at all and bought this due to some reviews on YouTube indicating it as a hidden gem, its not.",12/11/20 17:01,Great99

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"I don't understand why everyone is giving all the hate to this one, especially when it comes to longevity? I am using it as my signature sent right now and I am loving it. I picked it up from a Burlington in a gift set for $40 and I think I got a steal. It's right up there with the longer lasting sents I wear such as Sauvage EDP, YSL Y EDP, Ultra Male and others like that. It doesn't smell like any that I wear though I don't have Boss Bottled. However I did recently purchase a 150ml D&G The One EDP and this has so much better performance than it does, although they smell nothing alike either. Performance is great for me, but sillage is a bit soft. I definitely say go for it if you can get it for a decent price such as I did.



Edit: Now much later in my fragrance collecting journey I bought and quickly sold Boss Bottled Intense and found that this is VERY close to it. But for me this is just better all around. Better smelling, a little cheaper, a little sweeter which I prefer, and MUCH longer lasting!!! So this is the one I decided to keep in the collection.",12/21/19 05:48,Djchildress
Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"i love the dry down notes, but not the fruity notes in the opening..

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"Got a gift set with a 100ml bottle, shower gel and little travel atomizer for $20.45 incl. taxes as a boxing week sale. Not too impressed. Kinda get a Davidoff 'Brilliant Game' vibe, or even a Michel Germain Tattoo vibe...def not anything by JPG, VSL. A soft, mild office scent that certainly isn't exciting, or worth more than what I paid. Guess it is sorta like Boss Bottled, which never owned, but always wanted to get someday. I'd say this is more synthetic though, so cheaper ingredients are probably used. It's nothing new...kinda had higher hopes, thinking i'd notice the honey more...also like Dunhill Custom and Baldessarini Ambre.",12/28/18 15:55,lespritz.1
Emblem Absolu Montblanc,Very similar to Boss Bottled with a little more masculine to it. Very professional office scent. Enjoyed wearing it today. Great longevity (6+ hours detectable) and sillage the same.,11/20/18 20:25,Cazz04

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"Very fruity opening. It's synthetic but still very pleasant.

Yes, it does smell similar or at least remind me of Boss Bottled but it's still it's own fragrance. Unfortunately, projection and longevity is not the best.

Emblem Absolu Montblanc,This one surprised me. Due to the gold color I was expecting another 1 million flanker...but in reality Emblem Absolu is flanker of Boss Bottled. Im dissapointed.,02/07/18 13:48,Cid1204
Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"I’d given up slightly on Mont Blanc and especially these emblem flankers but I thought I’d give this one a wear as the other two had left me cold. I have to say this scent isn’t bad at all. The fruity open is slightly confused and has me thinking of all those 1 million rip off that came out after it’s success, chucking a load of sweet notes at an Amber, vanilla warm base and see what sticks. Emblem absolu is actually much more like Boss bottled though in that sense because when settled is more focused, delivering a pear note and true enough cardamom. The base to me is more sweet and ambery than vetiver but definitely some woods in there because it’s not overly sweet but definitely an oriental. I found the performance okay and this caught me in a good mood. I don’t dislike that pear note but it somehow puts me off fragrances giving them an inherent cheapness...maybe that’s just me. Despite this I’d wear it as it reminds me of a few good scents.",11/22/17 18:16,Houdini4
Emblem Absolu Montblanc,"Miletto is correct.

It's too soft with low sillage.

A big disappointment since I had such high hopes. Maybe in the heat it will perk up a bit.

And NO, it does NOT smell anything like Ultra Male, Ultra Male to me is many times better than this!

Legend Montblanc,"I bought this fragrance, as well as the EdP version, because of its alleged similarities to AF's Fierce.
There are some similarities, but no... it's not Fierce. Fierce has a different expression, a different character of its own, fresher, lighter, more striking, more individual.
This Legend by Montblanc and the EdP version are also excellent, however, there are some notes that stand out and give it a more “formal,” more aromatic, more “fougere” tone. The tonka bean stands out quite a bit.
I recommend either of these fragrances, though.
Fierce has a special place in the collection, always associated with fantastic memories from the beginning of the millennium.",10/21/25 03:17,Guapo
Legend Montblanc,"Perfect example of a dumb reach. It smells like fresh shaving cream and apples/dried fruits. The dried fruit note is surprisingly very realistic. I also pick up pineapple with the rind still on it. The pineapple rind and sandalwood notes mingle so well together. Has great performance with high marks in both sillage and longevity. Incredibly affordable on discounter websites, DO NOT buy this at retail price. I recently picked up a 100ml for $34 which is a fantastic value.

The only thing I find off-putting is that Legend opens with a blast of alcohol. That alcohol quickly subsides into a smooth, great smelling fruity fougere. Is it unique? Not really, but that doesn't make it any less great. This deserves a higher rating in my humble opinion.

(spray deodorant is a 14yr freshman while legend is a 18 year old senior) it isn't bad but overall very meh. projection is good but doesn't last to long. it's the type of scent most Millennials would think of if you said cologne. it's very reminiscent of a European uncle who oversprays his cheap drug store cologne (but slighty better and not headache inducing) but at the same time reminds me of a high school lockerroom after gym where the guys are spraying entry level frags and spray deo (with the Bo because to me when I put my nose to it there is a slight vinegar smell, but the vinegar doesn't project). overall outdated and for young guys 4/10, but for guys maybe 30 or so a decent 5.5/10 for going to the store or casual shopping!

Legend Montblanc,"I blind bought this looking for a fruit-centered fragrance. Now I didn't expect a gourmand fruit, I expected a fruit forward aromatic fougere. What I got was a skinscent.

Disappointed.
Synthetic, vague, weak. Sits so close to the skin you can barely fucking smell it. There's an ambivalent notion of fruitiness here. It's muted and sits behind a kind of Dr Frankenstein's test-tube lavender? These notes are supposed to be ""Pineapple & ""Red apple"". I have to believe it, but there's no way I would have guessed it without looking at the ""cheat sheet"". This is fucking BS. I know what pineapple & red apple smells like. I'm sure everybody does. Even cheap, synthetic smelling shampoos usually get their notes right. So why is it so hard for Montblanc?

It's not a bad smelling fragrance. What drives me mad is the mediocricy of it.

Poor projection. Poor longevity.

Legend Montblanc,"Nose Note #635

I have a 50ml of Al Rehab For Men and the two are very similar, except this is indeed a little fruity, but don't expect it to be like a fruit bowl. This is first and foremost an aromatic lavender fragrance that has a 90s vibe. It's kind of soapy, clean smelling, but not modern. And you may have previously smelled this DNA in Axe Apollo and some other Axe, which are in some places more popular than MB Legend or Fierce.

Hard to describe exactly what it smells like. You have to be familiar with the note of lavender. To my nose it has mild to little sweetness. The fruity aspect is very fuzzy to me. The scent is very memorable.

Legend Montblanc,"""Life is good, but it can be better"" Maxwell Lord.
This is a great scent, fruity... vanilla... perfect for year round wear to freshen up for any occasion. But it's extremely average. Would people buy a $70-$100 clone of a decade & a half old fragrance such as Versace Eros? No. So why does Mont Blanc do it. Well Mont Blanc undeniably has good quality fragrances. So why don't they use that to their advantage. Their most popular scents are clones. Their most underrated ones are the more ""original"" ones, still clinging onto the similar counterparts DNA. Hopefully soon I can get Presence and speak more about this. But until then, Go ahead and get this if you want a decent daily, might come off as a bit outdated but nothing drastic.

Legend Montblanc,"This fragrance is a mystery for me.
When I was younger, I had this same exact perfume, and it smelled okay, kind of deodorant-ish, but it was usable, and it lasted for a reasonable amount of time on my skin.
I recently found a closed bottle of Montblanc Legend at my dad's house, stored perfectly, and it has little to no smell and the longevity is null. To test if it wasn't just out of date, I went to a perfume shop, to test it out. The results were the same. Little to no smell and bad longevity.
Safe to say, once, or even if this bottle ends, I will not buy Montblanc Legend again.

Legend Montblanc,"I bought this on a lark because it was cheap and I was bored. I had never tried it, but the reviews and YouTubers always led me to believe this was a boring, cheap frag of low distinction. Man, I have to say I love it. The sweet fruitiness mixed with the lavender is very addictive. I have around 50ish frags, including several Amouage’s and Xerjoff’s and I find myself reaching for this nearly every day,(spring.)
It appears I am a sucker for fruity/aromatic frags as this combo appears in nearly all of my favs.",05/20/25 06:10,Wmar6673@gmail.com
Legend Montblanc,"Excellent. Really good, safe fragrance. There is nothing revolutionary here whatsoever. Sort of reminds me of Coach for men. Longevity and sillage are moderate at best. This is not a beast mode projector by any means. I get quite a lot of the top notes, and it doesn't seem to be overly sweet as others have remarked. Smells like a very classic barbershop type of fougere, which are among my favorites. This is a very standard gentleman's fragrance that would work in many different settings. I'm curious about the EDP version now. If you're looking for something ""niche"" and ""different"", this ain't it.",05/18/25 12:35,WhiteJr81
Legend Montblanc,"It's objectively good in my opinion when you consider important variables.

Not a love since it's nothing crazy out of the ordinary, but you might love it, and others might too. Explorer and Legend are pretty cost effective ones to try in my opinion.

I like original legend more than legend spirit, which I also have, which is also nice.

Performance is not too impressive. I still like it though.",05/10/25 19:38,TSmell

Legend Montblanc,"Legend is a very pleasant scent that I like but don't love. It has a traditional fresh barbershop appeal that's entirely likeable but also a bit generic smelling. It's a clean scent that's marked mostly by a bright floral and fruity - but not overly sweet - accord once it dries down. It has pretty average longevity and only moderate projection, so it's a safe office scent. It's also very versatile for pretty much any season or occasion and it's a safe blind buy. This is one of those colognes I'm happy to have though I never really get excited about wearing it.",04/21/25 09:09,doggymcnuggets
Legend Montblanc,"Really nice scent that doesn’t last on my skin. Almost zero projection and a skin scent from the beginning. My bottle is authentic. This can help you smell nice and subtle… emphasis on subtle! It isn’t as “fruity” as I expected it to be based on what I had read from others. Fresh apple, lavender & woods. Very aromatic. Nice, clean, wear anywhere scent. Signature scent worthy, just lacks performance which makes it a tough go for me. Bottle is nice quality. Atomizer on mine is below average.

Legend Montblanc,"Ok, here goes. I am very feminine so never mind the men's label on this as I had only wanted to go back in time and smell the headshop like scent of an Abercrombie and Fitch Store. Instead of buying Fierce though, I had bought Montblanc Legend after being told that it was somehow an even better version of Abercrombie's Fierce. I had to heavily respray as I could not distinguish any of the notes. I was almost in denial that so many reviewers could be so wrong, plus the A.I. review online confirming that Fierce is what they had sprayed in the stores to lure in their customers. I was thinking how bad can it be as I love lavender and sandalwood? I do not mind a good spicy bergamot, and it was only $28 with my coupons and discounts. So, mostly this was to satisfy my curiosity. I'm sure it is genuine. The bottle is lovely. I was actually excited to receive this. I was praying as I was spraying that it would evoke old memories at the mall. I was even planning to spray this on a towel in my laundry and then go in there to see what the waft was like. I tried it on my skin where I only get a sharp sweet opening that is mostly meh bergamot that's more like a dank lime bathroom cleaner if I had to guess. There's no lavender detected at all and there's no lemon verbena (I am a gardener who knows and a frag head). Heaven only knows what those strange middle notes are. I wait for the dry down, still praying of course, come on Sandalwood / Vanilla, where are y'all, but there is nothing! Next, we do the outdoor wind test. I let the breeze backwash the scent, but alas, all that comes to me is that barbershop bergamot citrus. There was no haunting sexy patchouli sandalwood scent at all as I remember. What to do with this bottle of nothing. I'll let this sit in the world of bad fragrances and try to forget wasting my money.",04/17/25 12:05,heliotrope317
Legend Montblanc,"I didn't need this, but the 45usd price tag for 100ml bottle on my local discounter was VERY convincing, so I bought it. No regrets, I mean no it is not very mind-blowing and I surely prefer the EDP version but this is a very clean, zesty-citrusy and fruity sweet fragrance. Drydown is mossy but not overly so) and vanillic. Not too synthetic at all, it is very enjoyable. Versatile 4 season, easy to rock and easy to wear. As I said, I'd like that discount on EDP version more, but this will suffice.",04/11/25 10:36,divineintervation1994

my wife loves this one, I have 300+ fragrances and the only one that she likes more than this is greenley, which I think is very similar to this but everything is green, green apple, petitgrain instead of lavender, etc.

Legend Montblanc,"This is scent 6 on my journey of the generic miniatures. An xmas gift set.

I have Legend Red which I will retry soon after letting it sit a while. This has me curious to try it again.

This is a nice scent. It's sweet. not overly woody or spicy and certainly clean. To me it functions much as swiss army does. Just a clean scent for everyday anytime use....like the swiss army knife that does everything, Legend black ticks all the boxes. Day night warm cold nude dressed ...all good .

Legend red gets a bit spicier and woodier as Im familiar with it. I expected a same quality in this but in the end I would prefer this to Legend red at this moment. They say red is the best of the flankers. I had white which I gave away to my nephews at xmas. I founf the white to be too gym/ speed stick from my youth / everybody flavored.

Would I buy this? no. Is it a good scent? Yes.

A good blind buy in my opinion. You can't go wrong with this because it's on the softer gentler side of masculinity. It's well behaved clean shaven nice guy scented. In the 7 I would rate this among the top 3 scents.",02/05/25 05:39,My13ScentsWorth

No-nonsense men wear this fragrance only, please. Perfect for a Leo man.
Mother bought this for her highschool (the bully type) son when I worked at this store; I wanted to warn them both but though boyyyyy! Wear that when you grow into a full-grown man!
Feel bad for the highschool boys in the locker-room choking on this scent since he probs sprayed himself down with it like it was some type of axe body spray!

A little goes a long way: just enough to smell it on a man if you're lucky to get close enough to him. One spray will do, perfect if used sparingly. Husband was *born* to wear this fragrance.
The serious protector type will rock this stuff without a sweat (unlike this sweaty locker room boys lmao!).

Legend Montblanc,"Sharp aromatic and fresh.

Opens fresh, has a sharp spiky mint note, it's very aromatic.
It's a little sour, has juniper notes and starts to get a bit chalky and mineral after 1hr.
Remains stable.
Retains the minty-aromatic aromas and has a breezy/airy quality at times.
Smells a little ""blue.""
Dries down balsamic with peppery coniferous notes of amber and vetiver.
(I didn't find it very fruity, notes above make it appear more interesting than it is.)

Has a traditional masculine feel. Good all year, fine for the office and better in the day. Suits most ages (did put me in mind of BDC at times.)

Performance is good. Decent projection and lasts as a skin scent 8hrs.

It's a recognisable scent that has been interpreted many times over the years, espcially in the 80's and 90's. Probably would grow on me with regular application though.",01/26/25 07:33,Fortyfree

Legend is: a bit more classy/formal/sophisticated. Could be better night fragrance, could be date night fragrance. It can be also elegant formal scent - wear it with suit.
Fierce is a lot more universal IMO, except, i think Fierce won't be as good formal/suit fragrance as Legend because Legend feels a bit more mature (like +5-10 years). Afterall - try both and buy the one you like the best.",11/18/24 13:59,sanchopanza
Legend Montblanc,"Legend EDT is a classic – I don't care what anyone says. It's funny how you go through different phases...... Legend EDT was one of my first buys when I got into fragrances, and I thought it was fantastic. Over time I sort of outgrew it, and began to find it rather adolescent... for a while I thought the EDP was better... but lately I'm back to really appreciating the merits of this EDT.

It's a great DNA – sweet (but not too much), and just enough complexity to make it incredibly versatile. Totally works as a gym scent, yet has some classy sophistication to it as well. It's not overpowering, so it's great for work, and the scent stays pleasing from opening to dry-down. It's inexpensive, so you can spray it on liberally without concern. It's just good all the way around. Plus at this point, it has that classic element to it, as an old-school DNA stretching back over 20 years to A&F Fierce.

So yeah.... I'm back to spraying this on from time to time, and enjoying it. (When I'm in the right mood for that adolescent pineapple note....)",11/18/24 08:27,bartca89

Legend Montblanc,"Barely a cheapie. Price is far off with what you're given.

As mentioned by someone else initial opening has a bit of a rubbing alcohol vibe but when it calms down it becomes quite likeable. Not really a pineapple in the opening more like citrus cologne with a heavy dose of synthetic lavender. None of the notes are stand out notes. It all comes together becoming a clean synthetic apple'd shaving cream accord with lots of coumarin and ambroxan giving structure. Very strong sandalwood base.

It's what it is, can see why it's likeable but the composition is clearly of a much more cheaper price than sold at of 50/60 even at discounters. Can't see why anyone would pick this over everything out there in it's price bracket. Even some things of similar price points or cheaper will get you more bang for your buck.

For reference. You can get all of the encre noire's for barely a quarter of the price. There some other examples that'd give you just objectively a better expression of perfumery than this.",10/31/24 14:09,fragrantlyenhanced

Legend Montblanc,"No offense to anyone on here as I dig the fragrance community and really enjoy all that entails this hobby but if youre looking at buying this fragrance don't be deterred the hardcore fragheads, hobbyists, collectors, and niche snobs. There is a reason its still among the bestselling mens fragrances in the US to this day! They took fierce and made it James Bond in a bottle. Darker, more brooding, more grown up and sophisticated yet kept the youthful, sexy, mass appeal. Its just fruity-sweet enough, just citrusy-fresh spicy enough, just florally-interesting enough, and just woody-earthy enough to make for a modern masculine classic. This fragrance somehow morphs to fit any attire and occasion you throw at it from joggers and a hoodie and Walmart to a tux at a wedding and it totally works. I personally prefer it to the other ultra versatile ""Blue fragrance"" competitors such as Coach for men and Ralphs club (Although nice frags) which I find are a bit more generic as this one has a bit more personality (""And personality goes along way""-Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction).

Ok performance is lackluster, but La Nuit De L'homme costs nearly 3x as much and lasts 2 hours so for the price,overspray in the morning and refresh every 2-4 hours or so and youll smell awesome all day long! Or get the EDP which is a superior scent with better performance but to me, is missing that ""IT"" factor. Maybe from the missing dried fruits, coumarin, rose, tonka, sandalwood thing this has going on.

I have gotten countless compliments since my first bottle in 2013 ranging from ""Wow what is that?"", ""Damn, you smell fine!"", ""You smell like a man!"" to ""You smell sexy AF!!"". Women at work and even in stores, in their early 20s compliment me even to this day! Even my adult daughter never fails to tell me I smell good when I hug her wearing this and she has smelled a hundred frags on me and rarely compliments me on the others.
Youre gonna like the way you smell, others will likely like the way you smell and its pretty much fact at this point that women, generally speaking, LOOOOVE the way this smells! Wear it any where you wanna smell like a modern, put together, sophisticated man!

The 30-minute performance of Fierce's current batch is truly sad. Percival is a slightly more mature version of this DNA with musk and amber added. It's also an unnecessarily expensive cologne compared to what it offers. Of all these, I prefer the sweet vibe of the Legend. Because this DNA reminds me of youth and fun.

You take some, spread it on your hand and it just smells nice for like an hour.
However, after a few hours, the fruity aspect of this fragrance starts to rise a little more, making it more tolerable for me.
Overall, a decent fragrance. I have smelled some cheap fragrances before but this is going to be the first time I will be saying this, you are getting what you are paying for.

Legend Montblanc,"I really like it. Fierce's DNA is something that doesn't fit anybody nowadays. However, if it fits you, you'll most likely wear this fragrance for every ocassion, because is versatile and seductive. I most add that girls love this scent profile if used correctly.

This is a good dupe of Fierce, so it's still a good option to wear in 2024, even considering that it was release a long time ago. It's youthful and playful, but at the same time, it's serious and interesting.

Performance is good on my skin, though I know in most people won't be the case. In general, I don't know why, but Mont Blanc fragrances tend to have a good longevity on me haha.

Try it out! I think this is a ""boom or bust"" type of fragance in today's world.",07/18/24 20:17,LuisC009

Legend Montblanc,"Went thru an entire 30ml bottle trying to understand this fragrance, but i cannot. I havent smelled AF Fierce, but I truly hope it doesnt smell like this. There a peppery top note that is ruined by a moldy damp base. Honest to God, all I smell from this cologne is WET DOG, and I cannot believe that this scent replicates Fierce. It smells unbelievably generic and boring, absolutely disappointment. 3/10",07/04/24 21:41,Vederax
Legend Montblanc,"opens off with a blast of sour pine apple and citruses but this combo only lasts for around 3 minutes on my skin( maybe because my bottle is 10 years old the top notes are weak now) then it transitions into a mix of lavender + oak moss + Geranium + sweet red apple. this combination is a winner and reminds me of classic Aromatic Fougere barbershop fragrances with some added sweetness from the red apple. this one gets the most positive reaction from the 100+ fragrances that i have tested and i can safely say that as a man, this fragrance is all you ever need to smell good. the projection moderate the first few hours and lasts around 8 hours on my skin so don't expect monster performance out of this.
i see people complain about it being synthetic, but most fragrances are made of 80 to 100% synthetics BUT the point is, the way the perfumer blends the synthetics is the key to the fragrance not smelling synthetic on the nose and here the blend is masterful. everything is subtle and is there for you to smell just like 200+ dollars fragrances. nothing is too much, no screetchy ness and everything is smooth as butter unlike some fragrances that will destroy your sense of smell and braincells with overdosing synthetics to achieve room filling performance like ysl libre le parfum, pdm cassili, lattafa khamrah and similar room filler synthetic bombs.

Legend Montblanc,"One of my favorites by Mont Blanc. A sweet, fruity, aromatic fragrance that is very pleasant and nice.

The opening is very fruity, sweet and almost fresh in a way. In the dry down, it still maintains its fruitiness and sweetness.

Longevity and projection wise, it's pretty good. I get around 6-7 hours with a soft to medium projection. This fragrance leans masculine but a bit unisex because of all the fruits and sweetness. This is just my opinion though. This is also a safe office environment fragrance. I recommend this for the spring and summer.

Lastly, is it a safe blind buy. Well, that depends. If you like fruity, sweet fragrances, this is for you. But if you seem to hate sweet, it's not for you. 8.5/10, solid fragrance by Mont Blanc.",06/25/24 23:55,EmilZakaryan924
Legend Montblanc,"Love this DNA, First time I ever smelled this DNA was Zara 421 Sport (which obviously discontinued as many Zara fragrance line) and I was instantly hooked and thought it really has this masculine sophisticated and the athlete vibe scent. Then I got to smell Fierce A&F back in 2014 and found out this one has the same DNA. Ladies also really love this scent. Ofc the original one is A&F Fierce and unfortunately Legend Mont Blanc is closer to the newer reformulated version of Fierce which is less Spicy and dense.But nonetheless, This is one of my signature scent since I was 16 so I will forever have this DNA in my collection.",06/17/24 01:53,jvrai17
Legend Montblanc,"Reminds me of my first semester of Freshman year of college, as I was wearing this often back then. Very fruity smell, but somehow still quite masculine. It could just be my skin chemistry, but this is a performance beast on me. It lasts forever. It projects pretty far. If I get any on my clothes it is hard to get out.

I really enjoy it; after all, I tend to enjoy synthetic & sweet scents. It's still an occasional go-to for something like a date or event, where I'd like to smell attractive yet uncontroversial. Nobody will take issue with you wearing this... Unless you overspray it.",06/12/24 18:00,lgswofford

Legend Montblanc,"What a boring generic scent. This smells so outdated and generic to me, just another floral freshie. Unsophisticated and far too common to my nose, at some point they all just smell the same. It's a real shame as I love real lavender and light florals on their own, but in men's fragrances they just seem so overused and underwhelming when they are the star of the show. The longevity and sillage both seem weak on this one. I see some comparisons are being made to PDM Percival, I haven't smelled that one yet, but I am hard-pressed to think PDM would release something so boring and linear, cheap clones of PDM fragrances always seem to miss the mark by a mile while only being crude approximations of the original (I suppose that's just a side rant).

The best compliments I can give this fragrance:

-inoffensive
-cheap
-definitely a very office safe scent
-could be a relaxing scent for some

There's absolutely nothing remarkable about this one, which may actually be a selling point for some people. I don't think enthusiasts and hobbyists will enjoy this one at all except maybe as a room spray or something to use casually after a shower (although there are so many other things I'd personally reach for before this). Great fragrance if you want to smell like a 55 year old accountant in the background of a mortgage agency.

Legend Montblanc,"This is one of the early game changers, or at least Fierce was. While it is dated in profile, it is not an old man type scent, it continues to be very youthful even today. A sharp shower gel type scent, not offensive and an easy year round dumb reach. Very basic by my own standards, but often appreciated by others when worn. I find this one linear from start to end, and very synthetic, there is no natural note that I pick up on. I do find the performance quite decent, even a little loud. Glad to have this, but rarely wear it.",05/12/24 14:15,Great99

Legend Montblanc,"Years ago, I would’ve written this off as a “generic men’s cologne” scent alongside the likes of Bleu de Chanel and Montblanc Explorer; fuzzy, dark, clean, and typically-masculine are adjectives that come to mind, yet I’ve come to appreciate these facets nowadays.

Legend EDT rightly gets compared very often to Abercrombie and Fitch’s “Fierce” (a fragrance I cherish immensely), yet its nuances of dense lavender and dark, restrained fruitiness contrast with Fierce’s sharp and bright citrus/pine laid atop a dense-yet-clean musk. Legend presents a smooth, melancholic tone not found in the very uplifting Fierce.

“A hazier, fruitier Fierce” would describe this very well. The fruits are hard to decipher, but seeing “red apple” and “dried fruits” in the note breakdown sounds right. Only now that I’ve nearly finished my 1 oz bottle do I finally detect the woody pineapple poking through, realizing it was a large contributor to the hard-to-place fruity accords from the very beginning.

The scent is linear, with only the initial zingy, alcoholic and somewhat-harsh opening settling down into a subdued and muted form rather swiftly, lasting into the drydown. It doesn’t have room-clearing strength, but it performs strongly for a couple hours with 3 sprays then fades into a more personal scent. However, I feel that the initial wall of scent makes me partially-noseblind to some of its later projection. Your results may vary.

Overshadowed by other fragrances in my collection, I won’t be rebuying this, but if it means anything to you, this fragrance ascended from being a last-resort stashed away in my glovebox to being a daily wear for a couple of months during Spring.",05/05/24 14:29,TipTopNotes

Legend Montblanc,"Montblanc Legend is a fragrance that pleasantly surprised me with its inoffensive yet appealing clean scent. If I discovered this scent earlier, and if it were not for Parfums de Marly Percival existing now, I would have considered buying and wearing Montblanc Legend for sure.

However, we have Percival now, which comes as an EDP and not only boasts incredible longevity, but also exudes a more exciting aroma, spicing things up. Percival is the modern final boss of this fragrance DNA and comes at a reasonable price point (performance and quality considered), unlike Creed Aventus, for which Montblanc Explorer is a great alternative.

I briefly thought about buying Legend for times when I didn't want to use up my Percival bottle, but I realized that's a bit silly. After all, we should just wear the best scent we want, when we want. If you are on a budget though, get this one.",04/12/24 11:38,Vorpal
Legend Montblanc,"This fragrance is in my hall of fame list. It is a classy masculine evening fragrance. I am not a big fan of strong leather, woods or patchouli so this hit all the marks for me. All the accords are bold and wrapped in a lavender bubble. On the top you get the lavender with a touch of bergamot and a hint of lemon verbena. At times I would get pineapple when it starts to dry . But it's so faint and for a short time . In the middle you get the dried fruits rose and geranium. The rose will linger until the fragrance fades away. But it's so mixed with the lavender that you know the rose is there but you don't get very much of it . The apple you don't get until it's fully dried down and everything is settled. Maybe an hour later . The oakmoss comes out very little as well. The sandalwood isn't very strong at all . It add just enough wood to carry everything and not disrupt much of what's going on. Same for the tonka , it's the warm sugar dusting over the top. Everything just works so well while being kept classy by the lavender. While it is more of a formal fragrance it can be dressed down a little. But it's definitely an evening date night type of fragrance.
Performance, for being an edt it has pretty strong performance. On clothing I have smelled it the next day. On skin I have smelled it 8 to 9 hours later. Projection , with 4 sprays you'll get a solid 2 to 3 hours.
The first hour you'll get a good 5 feet of projection. You can get a bottle for $30-$35 so it's very affordable.

Legend Montblanc,"Classic freshie from the last decade that you can’t go wrong with.

Fresh fruity citrus lavender with some powdery cool yet warm slight woody nuances I think it’s perfect for every season and any time of the day.

This is like the 2010s classy Tumblr boy B&W answer to the tumblr girl of that era considering it came back then.

The geranium tho is very smooth in this acts like a nice binder for the top and the middle.

Wish it performed better I got 4-5 hours longevity with 1.4 ft of projection with 5-6 sprays back then but then every improved +1 due to macération for a very long time but yea can’t go wrong w this despite many flankers and clones out or even better alternatives.

Legend Montblanc,"Great scent for the price. I picked this up hoping for a scent with the same DNA as fierce and Mohogany Teakwood from b&bw. This hits the nail on the head. 85% of the scent is that woody, musky, sweet, seductive scent that you would get in fierce. The other 15% is a very crisp refreshing apple making this a fresher take on fierce. the “fruitiness” that everyone speaks of on here isn’t the tropical pineapple or mango, rather it is a clean fresh apple.

Legend Montblanc,"I've decided I really enjoy the Fierce DNA in general and have looked into several of its copycats. It's an any-time-of-day, any-time-of-year kind of scent which I tend to favor, and it isn't overly sweet.

Legend, while more fruity and sweet than its predecessor, definitely shares that classic vibe with its signature aromatic-musky-woody theme.

I don't think the longevity of Fierce is any better than Legend, but I haven't given them a side-by-side test yet.

If I had to choose between the two on scent alone, I'd stick with Fierce as it's less sweet, but when you factor in price (Legend is usually less than half as much as Fierce on discounters), Legend becomes much more appealing.

It's definitely not an exact copy, but if you're looking for something in the Fierce genre and want to save a few bucks, or if you think Fierce would smell better with a little sweetness, I'd say Legend is a worthy substitute.",02/16/24 17:52,FragranceAnon

There is a big reason why this is so hyped up and has been for so long...most people LOVE the DNA of Fierce and when Mont Blanc Legend made this I would not be surprised if the perfumer was sitting there with a bottle of Fierce trying to match it just enough to get 90s kids excited.

It's synthetic sure and it probably costs next to nothing to produce because it's synthetic, that means it's also fairly affordable at discounters for your average Joe who wants to cover up BO and get the occasional compliment.

Legend Montblanc,"Mont Blanc Legend, an aromatic fougere with fruity sweetness, accompanies you effortlessly throughout the year, transitioning from crisp spring mornings to cozy fall nights. It's a fragrant tale of contrasts, uniting strength with tenderness, tradition with modernity. The weighty bottle, adorned in black and metallic hues, draws inspiration from the renowned Meisterstück pen. Minimalistic and opulent, its design mirrors the essence of the fragrance within.

From skin to paper, Mont Blanc Legend transforms—a clean, formal scent. It's not avant-garde, rather universally embraced in any context. Lavender and pineapple lead the symphony, followed by red apple and dried fruits. As the fragrance unfurls, tonka bean and sandalwood form its warm, lasting core. Imagine a world where layers of fresh citrus, sweet fruitiness, and a comforting heart intertwine. It's a versatile companion that adapts seamlessly to every scenario.

For those reminiscent of Abercrombie & Fitch's Fierce, Mont Blanc Legend beckons with familiarity and holds the promise of approval. I recall wearing it in a quaint Milanese linen shop years ago—the Italian ladies couldn't help but inquire about the captivating trail. Thus, the mystique of Mont Blanc's magnetism continues to flourish.",10/25/23 04:16,AquaRegia
Legend Montblanc,"Montblanc Legend is a fruitier take on Fierce. Ironically I got this after loving Legend Eau de Parfum and Explorer from the house of Montblanc. Legend lives up to it, but I kind of wish I got it before Legend EDP.

Montblanc Legend has a fruity lavender open. There is some bergamot and a slight lemon verbena to it but the star is pineapple. It isn't Aventus level, but it is close. The mid is not that off from another Fierce clone that I want to say came out the same year, Playboy New York. You do not get the fantasy note of vinyl here but rather the apple note along with some dried fruits and I want to say pineapple is one of these. The base is woody and tonka. That said Legend EDP is far more woody.

Legend has pretty good performance. It is at least on par with the current Fierce batches. You get some more reigned in projection but the length is where it is on par with Fierce. You get 6/7 hours EASY. Mind you, that is better than most Fierce clones like Playboy New York Police Legend(ary Scent) and the countless Bath & Body Works Men releases that are clones which are slighter both in projection and performance.

I happen to think Montblanc Legend is nearly year round. It maybe too much for summer days but you can wear it for summer nights. I wouldn't wear Legend for clubs but nearly any other occasion will work.

Montblanc Legend I would love more if I didn't get the Legend EDP flanker first. For this reason I rate it a 7.8 out of 10. It is a rather straightforward Fierce clone but it does what Fierce does which most clones cannot capture the feel for reals.",10/12/23 18:37,mkpunk
Legend Montblanc,"Skakhund, because it smells quite nice (has u say...), projects very well, has a great longevity and has a great value for money, that´s why.

Oh, also, I´ve used well over 400ml of this...",10/03/23 02:20,dmd63
Legend Montblanc,"Bought this because I saw folks said it resembles Fierce and didn;t feel like spending a fortune for a gym fragrance
Was a blind buy and I've got to say I have mixed feelings about it.
On one hand it smells clean, with a hint of bright citrus smoky office dirtiness but not as deep as in Sauvage. Good for probably a 40 year old corporate man who is highly active and in shape. The citrus is the sharpest note in my opinion, followed by a little muddy aquatic note and some faint smoke. I'd say I like more than Channel Blue which I never understood the hype around. Quite similar to it.
On the other hand it also gives me a little bit of generic 1990's Saturday market in eastern Europe 5 euro/bottle kind of vibe. Still haven't made up my mind about it but I dont regret buying it. Longevity and projection are quite good, unlike people report here. Stayed on my arm for 8 hours, even mixed with a little bit of sweat. Great value for money",10/02/23 18:03,zigor_sendoa

This is a gorgeous scent, stays and projects very well, for hours and hours.

Legend Montblanc,"This is a classic along with other fierce like perfumes.

Personally for me it's too sweet and cloying and at the same time performance and Longevity and subpar. All I get are very sweet fruits, especially red apple and it's just too much for me. However it's popularity and positive reactions from both men and women prove to me that the general population loves this smell. Not for me and I cannot recommend it as too sweet and generic but it gets the compliments left and right so objectively i guess it's a staple, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I wonder if we will consider it retro at some point, so far it leans into ""getting a bit out of style"" IMHO, but again people still enjoy it. Also EDP version is tad better but I would divert from this DNA overall.",08/25/23 22:29,GoldenState

Legend Montblanc,"I will never hate on a fragrances performance if you can overspray it and make it last longer, I only criticize performance and longevity when you overspray it like 50 times and the stuff still disappears immediately. This is one of those scents you could pour a whole bottle over yourself and nobody would smell anything about 30 minutes.

In terms of smell, yes it's the best of the trio it smells better than fierce and percival...but it's the weakest in performance

People who say fierce has bad longevity, I never had that issue with fierce I get great performance from fierce and percival.

Fierce is still the best for it's price value out of the trio it does last a lot longer than mont blanc legend.

I own all 3 and honestly percival smells the worst of the 3, but percival has better performance than all 3. But when I say better performance it's not like really that much better than fierce if fierce lasts 6-8 hours on clothes than percival last 6.5-8.5 hours like barely much better in performance.",08/06/23 01:46,Dumbplings
Legend Montblanc,"Horrible performance on the recent batches. Scent wise, this one is good, will kick in that nostalgia, but after having your nose exposed to all the other scents profiles out there over the years, this may come off as cheap synthetic and generic, in a way. Good mass pleasing formula though, there's a good reason why it was so popular when it first came out, I assume it performed way better back then. However, In this family of similar smelling scents, A&F Fierce has issues with longevity too, the only one that stands out is Percival by PdM which seems to have a bit more character and lasts decently well compared to the other two mentioned.

Legend Montblanc,"#128 in my ""Tour de Fragrance"" of 250 scents in 250 days. Gotta say I love the Legend freshie DNA, it's just lacks endurance. I tried the EDP version first and wasn't shocked to find the EDT is actually more potent. I think we've all seen that more and more often where ""EDP"" and ""Parfum"" don't mean what they're supposed to mean at all. Anyone can misapply those labels without consequence and they clearly do. The opening of this scent is boffo for sure. But the dry down is very sedate. I get no fruit whatever. The powdery lavender is initially very strong and fresh, but that also tones down quickly. You'll smell like you just bathed with some high-quality soap, like fresh bed linen at the Four Seasons, maybe having dusted with some floral bath powder, which happens to be the way one of my girlfriends prefer I smell, so this one's a keeper for me, but not something I'll reach for first as it's a pretty run of the mill men's fragrance. But you at least get what you pay for with this bargain priced scent. Everyone will react to it positively, if they notice it, so it's safe for office wear. Buy the large bottle, because like many freshies in this price range if you are wearing it to the office, take it with you and plan to respray every few hours.",06/14/23 07:28,JusttheFactsMan

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"The bottle is so ugly I had to decant into an empty bottle. I personally feel that the bottle isn’t a good representation of the scent. While the bottle looks like it’s straight out of Dune or from some other Sci-Fi/Fantasy, the scent smells classy and sophisticated. I would say that out of all the perfumes in my collection, this is my top choice for a classy, everyday perfume that still radiates warmth. It’s not too loud or flashy, and can be dressed up or kept casual.

First and foremost this is a spicy perfume. But not an “autumn spices” type of way. The pepper jumps out at me the most. I also get a slight rose note in the opening. As this wears the rose becomes distant in the background and I get a lot of warm woods, still backed by the pepper.

This is a lovely perfume. I know it’s marketed towards women but I (a woman) would LOVE to smell this on a man. I can confidently say this is unisex, slightly feminine leaning. But smelling this on a man would be such a nice change from all the colognes that seem to smell the same these days…",10/16/25 03:37,Decode
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"One of my favourite types of fragrances is the woody feminine ones some people find unisex. This was released in 2002 and so was I. The bottle is cool and edgy, quite modern looking. It reminds me of the ""Aqva"" line by Bvlgari but this one is flattened at the end which allows it to be stored upright. It is also quite compact and lightweight.

""Présence d'une femme"" is a perfect blend of juicy, woody, fresh and floral. The fragrance manages to be woody and feminine at the same time. I would not say it leans masculine in the way ""Stash"" by SJP does. The wood here is creamy, powdery and warm. The mandarine orange is juicy and the pepper is subtle. There is a hint of orchid in the background. It is quite refreshing for such a woody, warm fragrance.

It is pretty strong in the beginning and lasts about 6 hours with one touch-up. I recommend spraying this on your shirt because the scents sticks to fabric for much longer. I can also smell it on my hair for a long time. However, the ridiculously low price compensates for the average longevity. I am blown away by how good this stuff is. A budget friendly masterpiece. I see it reminds some people of ""Reveal"" by CK and I guess it makes sense although they are pretty different. To me, this is more like a cousin of ""Euphoria"".",06/13/25 09:29,FragranceLover00

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"Unique. Along with Yohji Yamamoto pour femme, now discontinued unfortunately, this is one of my favourite perfumes. More than twenty years ago I met a woman who used to wear this fragrance. Back then there were no Baccarats, no Tom Fords (not so many at least) and there was no niche frenzy. At least not in my country. So her perfumes were magie noir, shalimar and some other classics and the extremly popular ralph lauren for woman. But she seemed annoyed with the classics even though she was in her late 50's. So one day she started wearing this one. I've waited about 12 years to buy it. First because my lack of finances and then because i was buying ""new"" perfumes or classics I've always wished to buy. In my opinion this is a masterpiece. Sharp, clean and exquisite this perfume smells like you would expect a smart woman to smell. It has a certain professional vibe. Professional as in someone who knows exactly what she is doing, capable, who acts from a place of power. This fragrance lacks romanticism, warmth, coziness and the velvety notes of nowdays perfumes. It's almost masculine, in a way. I like it because it has no sweet, overpowering notes and not the slightest gourmand note. Sharp, peppery, cold in the beginning.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"Soft Woody-Floral BRAZILIAN ROSEWOOD with Pepper, Mandarin & Orchid...

In the first few minutes before the spray dries, I can feel the rosewood notes with their rich floral and slightly spicy tones. Once the spray dries and the sillage starts to open up, I get the mandarin & pepper, but the rosewood notes are already swelling through. As it transitions to the heart some soft floral tones emerge with orchid and cyclamen, but the florals, including vanilla-flower, are here more as part of the rosewood accord. In the base there's a trio of woods (rosewood, mahogany & sandalwood) accented by patchouli & soft vanilla-flower. Overall I get a rosewood scent, with all of the other notes serving to enhance and support different facets of rosewood with it's powdery, rosy, velvety, rich-floral, spicy-sweet,creamy-soapy & woody tones. There's also a nostalgic quality for me, that's hard to pinpoint - but more in a down-to-earth way than a vintage perfumery way. This has been a signature scent of mine off and on, since it first came out, and I've been through more than one bottle. Initially this struck me as feminine, however after reading reviews I can see how this may read masculine to some as it has some touches usually reserved for men's cologne. In truth, it's unisex, but regardless anyone could wear it. This isn't a dupe of anything, but it has reminders for me of other rosewood prominent scents like Dune Dior, Rosewood Banana Republic & Midnight Fleur Nest.

Contrast to Rosewood Banana Republic:
These are different, but there are similarities with a forward rosewood. Presence d'une Femme leans spicier, sweeter & more complex. Roughly equivalent performance, or slightly better for Presence d'une Femme.

Overall: gorgeous, unisex Brazilian Rosewood scent profile with average or slightly above average performance. This is the perfect scent to wear for going home, if only in your mind. It's a longtime love for me. Enjoy!",05/25/23 13:46,suzanne_ronald

The top note starting up with a fresh chamomile tea but some leather underneath the base note. Is fresh, aromatic and relax.
I can get some patchouli but not a strong patchouli. No sandalwood or woody note detected by my nose.
I believe the orchid play the biggest roles here and the rest notes claim such as patchouli, wood note, pepper, mandarin notes, minor supporting the orchid.

For a EDT, the projectivity is super great value for it price. the longevity is great for it value.

This is my first and only Montblanc fragrance and if I was the kind of person who liked fragrances that smell like Shampoo, like a tumble dryer sheet and clean. Then I'd be over the moon with this. But im not.

This fragrance is very misleading and I thought that I was going to get something ambery, woody, warm spices, autumnal and good for the cold weather, but I did not.

Those accents don't exist in the construction of this fragrance, despite the note listing but what I do get is a very, synthetic, longlasting, ambroxan bomb 💣.

I have to admit that I was so shocked and disappointed 😞 when I tested the fragrance and I can't see where, when or why, ill ever wear this fragrance. Its boring, insipid and generic and if this is what the brand puts out, then its definitely overrated, which is a shame.

I really should give top marks for the bottle though..It reminds me of the Nivea bottle; but this one is more like a UFO, and its huge and awkward to hold in your hand.",12/26/22 12:27,amanda-m-lewis

This could easily be worn to the office, but there is something alluring about this fragrance that would make it perfect for sensuous, intimate nights.

It is now Spring in the Southern Hemisphere and I think that has made all the difference. So I would definitely say it works better in Spring and Autumn, but am yet to see how it performs in Summer.

The opening is a blast of Mandarin and pepper. As it dries down I get a delicate floral aromatic scent and finally, it settles down on a woody vanilla base that my skin seems to love.

People are very occupied by the masculine or feminine aspect of it. Do not! This is simply an amazing scent, round, well constructed, unique, elegant and not for the faint-hearted. I picture a strong and confident person wearing this fragrance.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I think this one is unique, special. Although nobody says it and in his notes it does not appear, it smells like tea to me. A tea with mild spices, somewhat woody, with a hint of citrus and a few drops of vanilla. I see that many think that it leans to the masculine side, but for me it's more in the middle, inclined to the feminine side. I didn't like it the first time I smelled it but since I already had it (it was a blind buy) I gave it more opportunities ... and I fell for it. Now every time I use it I really do enjoy it. It's long lasting and has moderate sillage. It's my SOTD, and 8 hours after having applied it (generously) I still can clearly perceive it. And I find it very versatile, suitable for use all year round, day or night (except maybe in the hottest days of summer).
I really love it and can't believe how affordable it was. As soon as I finish it, if it's still available I will buy it again, for sure.",10/15/21 14:59,Mmartinez67
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I was going down memory lane and was looking for the 1999 fragrance by Adrienne Vittadini or something similar - and this is definitely it! It leans unisex but is still quite feminine. It has a noticable presence yet remains polite, making it suitable for the workplace and formal occasions. Slightly synthetic opening, however that fades within seconds and develops into an aromatic semi-sweet woody vibe.

For me, the performance is 4-6 hours and has a very pleasant dry down. I would consider this a mature scent, ages 25+",08/24/21 06:26,Aromantra
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I've owned this scent since Christmas; it's about time I admit this blind buy was not a success. I love scents with vanilla/woodsy notes, not overly sweet and with floral notes. Based on the notes, I had assumed it would be right up my alley. Not so much...This thirty-something cannot pull off this powdery business-scent.

The scent itself is lovely. The vanilla and woodsy notes really are warm and soft, the pepper makes for a spicy little twist. I get wafts every now and then. It's present, not screaming for attention. I think it's the patchouli that makes it masculine/aloof. The warmness never gets cozy. It's a business woman all the way. She does not immediately stand out, but she demands a second look. And, you have to admire how well put-together she is.
Unfortunately, she's not me.

She is up for swaps for anyone in the Netherlands, if you can handle her.",05/11/21 05:40,Tina10A
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I’ve been wearing Présence d'une for the past 5 hours and it’s still going, so very good performance. Indeed, Présence leans slightly masculine (and I’m a female who has always enjoyed masculine scents). This is for anyone to enjoy,....a good one to check out.

Identifying specific notes in this composition—beyond the obvious pepper and wood notes—is difficult for me. Maybe there’s vanilla here, but it’s with a light hand. Initially I thought I loved Présence (and I did for the first hour) then Présence either developed or my nose grew tired of it. If I had to pinpoint the reason, I’m guessing too much iso e super, or another synthetic used, which is also why this thing is a performance monster of a perfume.

In any case, I’m convinced this is a good, intriguing scent though I’m not compelled to run out and buy it—even though I almost did just that—as it’s going for a steal on fragrencenet.

I’m glad I waited to sample first.",05/01/21 15:06,Bubbles1964
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I first fell in love with this frag in 2002 just watching the bottle: a round shaped silver base, the transparent round glass…it reminded me of a pebble, and it was really pleasant to keep in your hand.
superb design, innovative, classic and sophisticated.
That’s what I though about the scent when first spritzed it: sophisticated.
An elegant, but decided woman that is classic yet sensual, mysterious and irresistible.

This perfume is never overpowering, it opens with a fresh scent that blends with tangerine. Then it reveals a modern floral bouquet, and I find the dry down irresistible: powdery, a little oriental, sexy and very very delicate and clean. Stays on all day. Enrobes you with sensuality. A delicate vanilla patchouli with a balsamic woodiness.

Some reviewers in other blogs have written about pineapples notes – I have used 3 bottles of this fabulous fragrance without noticing any pineapple note.
Then I went to check the actual pyramid (see below) and it turns out that only the leaves of pineapples were used, not the fruit.. :o)

I always receive many compliments when wearing that.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"This was a blind buy for me in my hunt for my next signature fragrance. I tend to like the warmer fragrances, and Burberry Women was my go to for years. After that was Tonka by Reminiscence. This one starts with a powerful and ""In your face"" opening and then dries down to a sweet, warm, and skin close scent. Overall a good pick just buying based on the notes and the reviews. I wish this was a bit stronger on the base, as that is my favorite part of this fragrance. But it's not a big deal to reapply since the opening is very brief and quickly dries down to the part I love the most.
The opening is a very strong, but pleasant and brief, Orange peel and pepper (more orange than pepper). Kinda like peeling an orange and the oils the peel leaves behind on your fingers. As it's drying a soft floral scent which is neither too sweet nor too feminine. Base is very nice mahogany and a soft, sweet, and warm vanilla scent. Not an offensive fragrance, in my opinion, and the base could actually afford to be stronger. This one sits close to the skin for me once it dries and I find myself re-applying once around mid-day. Could definitely be used as unisex, but as I am a very big fan of ""masculine"" scents, I'm keeping this for myself!",10/30/19 09:15,slynnzeef
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"Woody, slightly masculine and still feminine enough. I smell rosy woods with a hint of orange and sharp pepper. There's warm vanilla too and I can smell sandalwood.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I can see why some ladies find this a touch masculine. I'm wearing it in warm conditions and it really comes into its own.

It's a ""I mean business"" scent but I'm also feminine.
The wood notes are the unisex element but the sweet orange, orchid and vanilla remind you that I'm a lady.

I wasn't sure about the pepper note but I find it much better in the warm atmosphere. It keeps it bright.
Not bad longevity and sillage for an edt either.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I really love some male fragrances from Mont Blanc, moreover I sometimes love my husband's perfumes so much i get myself thinking ""I wish they did a female version of this"". usually that's not what happens, the female versions are completely different and relate close to nothing to the their male counterparts. So I bought a sample of this and then I felt like they did, in this perfume, the magic I have been waiting for: turned a male perfume slightly to the female side.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"So wonderful on my skin. I feel sexy, compelling, and powerful when I wear this.

Its almost masculine. Its what I would want to wear when competing with the boy's club in CEO business meetings. It would help me show my dominance in a setting where I could use any advantage that I could get.

In that same respect, I would wear it to divorce proceedings with lawyers present. It would scream no nonsense and take no prisoners but without being crazy loud.",03/14/18 17:33,Floffles
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"The opening was strong and sharp orange/black pepper combo. So spicy that I actually had to check the name of the perfume on my sample to make sure I really have a female version. It seemed totally masculine, so my attention was catched immediately.

The drydown milds the scent into sweet (but not sickly) vanilla, underlined with woodsy notes and a little sign of florals.

It smells clean/fresh, slisghtly sweeter, white, but with some spiciness to it. In my opinion perfect for spring for everyday every night use. Could be unisex. Safe for office work.

I noticed some people said here it's not feminime. To me it is. As I believe there are also women who like to stand out of the crowd and who know how to wear something that is far from girly.",01/14/18 07:35,Midnight Lady
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"Another lesson learned: Blind buys are great fun with a good deal and good research, but don’t blind buy a perfume you liked as a kid, because your tastes have probably changed. This reminds me of the smell of Abercrombie and Fitch pumped out into the hallways of the mall when I was wearing flared jeans and baby doll tops. It definitely runs to the masculine side of things, but in the cheap teenager first cologne way. I’m not sure I will ever find a way to wear this because it smells so dated. Maybe I’ll keep it a few decades until that type of fragrance becomes a classic, hahaha.

EDIT: okay, in fairness, I owe this perfume a bit of an apology. It was unseasonably warm today and I spritzed a bit on my arm and the fragrance is not nearly so harsh and masculine as it was before. I will keep it in rotation as the weather warms up and hope that maybe it just needs the warm seasons to really come alive.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"On me it is completely different from Dune, dry and short lasting without any sweetness.Dune is one of my favorite scents, and on my skin it is sweet (90s sweet, very different from nowadays), comfortable, sophisticated, dreamy and cozy. My mother and I loved Dune (and this is quite difficult to happen, since we have opposite tastes in perfumes) and almost fought over a bottle of it. A beloved, comfort perfume, a classic.
As per Presence it was a huge disappointment, no sweetness,a strange clash of notes without any unifying direction, lasted for 2 hours with light sillage, the worst perfume by Michel Almairac on my skin.",08/20/17 11:34,socorrosouza
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"""Presence d'un femme"" is a little aromatic, a little spicy, firmly woody, tenderly flowery, sweet-like vanilla and skin-like patchouli.

The perfume opens with very apparent mandarine, but it is not sharp, or zesty, or bitter. Mandarin joined with pepper has a mild aromatic-spicy effect similar to the smell of ""dried arancini"" (Mediterranean organic sweets made of orange skin sun-dried in sugar, which taste aromatic and peppery).

Nor orchid, or cyclamen are expressively flowery - flowers tame the top concoction, preventing top to become piercing, and bringing peppered mandarine back from spicy to mildly aromatic, before the other big concoction enters the stage: woods and vanilla.

I really can't smell all three woody notes (rosewood, mahogany and sandalwood) - it is just rounded, firm woody complex on me. And then again - it is instantly followed by vanilla, making it rounder and milder. The vanilla-woods combo in base presents powdery-dusty effect, mildly sweet and freshened by remains of peppery-aromatic top. Sometimes I get almond/nutty-like vibe (I guess that's woody-vanilla expression) in this stage of development.
And there is patchouli... I am very sensitive and somehow particular to patchouli iterations (they can thrill me and they can disgust me, I still don't get the pattern, except that this in some cases related to the warm weather). Patchouli is very discrete here - I sense it in the base only as some ""warm-skin"" presence, but far from anything skanky or noticable enough to provoke reaction.

There is, in fact, some dissonant ""maleish"" accord present, partly in the peppery-citrus opening, and mostly in woody-vanilla dry down, which works as a subtle contrast to the natural sweetnes of flowers and vanilla. But, it is not dominant at all, and it likes to play ""hide and seek"". It is like you put on a lovers yesterday's shirt with the remains of his perfume, but you are wearing your own very feminine perfume, and it is dominant. I find that interesting and slightly tempting but, above all, not overwhelming.
I really don't get this ""totally masculine"" feedbacks on Presence - in my opinion, this slightly masculine accord is the thing that keeps this fragrance away from beeing just another clichè perfume created for oriental-woody-vanilla lovers.

Finally, about that ""masculinity""-issue that flooded the reviews below, let's put it this way: the man that I sleep with - wearing Presence d'un femme?
Well... No.
Nope. Can't imagine that. No way. Sorry.
Except - if I leave it on him.
As my presence.

Overall, Presence isn't the best ever, or earth moving fragrance - BUT - it is far from dull, stereotypical or ""unproblematic"" scents. Also, it is very pleasant and unintrusive, and for daily rotation it has quite enough qualities to be taken into account for FB, or at least for serious testing.

It lasted all day and I was outdoors most of the time. It never was overwhelming or suffocating. I kept smelling myself because it was such a beautiful smell.

Orchid, vanilla - no idea, my nose couldn't locate them. Longevity - sorry, poor, it stays on my wrist 30 mins max, I believe this is because it's and EDT. Sillage - nonexistent.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"First of all, i have to say that i got this fragrance from a friend, my female boss, because although it's a nice fragrance, the prices here in Brazil are OVER THE TOP, so wouldn't be worth it.

Anyway, the review:

The main accords of this scent, as described above are woody, balsamic, sweet, powdery, fresh spicy and patchouli. Not for me. I would describe this, in order of importance as Woody, Fresh Spicy and Powdery.

I don't get the balsamic side, or even the patchouli (as i'm used to in other scents).

Presence D'Une Femme is a wonderful simplistic scent. Sexy and classy without making any effort. Whenever i use it, i feel powerful without trying, like, paraphrasing Beyoncé, ""i woke up like this"".

Downside (at least on my skin) is the poor longevity and projection.

Office friendly, safe for dates and gifts.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"Ahhh... tha' Paradox of Presence... a Presence revealed thru an androgynous tapestry of spicy/warm fragrance notes. So many folks getting hung on whether it's masculine or feminine/male or female/blahblah... just getover your sweetself & enjoy tha' ride. Lotta curves w/ this ride, presenting a playful drydown that travels from good2better w/ excellent sillage/longevity. But one needs 2 respect one's unique individual chemistry... one of the cool traits of an excellent juice is its capacity for smelling different on different folks. Masculine, or feminine?... Yes! For it is a classique of both animals, & on some will be masculine w/ a feminine touch, & on some, feminine w/ a masculine touch. That's a goodthing... we're actually created tha' same way... & yet...UNIQUE, ladies & gentlemen. But a deeper & more interesting paradox emerges... this one is Strong&Subtle. The wonderful scents of orchid, manderin, pepper, sandalwood, vanilla, patchouli, & the others, display suble fairness of 'presence', without knockin' you down, like commercial scents these days. For instance, when you cook, you don't want the ingredient 2 stand out, like, man... that's CURRY... you want it 2 blend into a design that cues you into, hmmm, nice taste, smooth flavour. Scents should do tha' same. I don't care 2 hear, ""isn't that vanilla?"" Perish tha' thought, though many of today's lackluster/losers are like that. You just want it 2 subtlely intice, the different notes, in harmony w/ each other. And remember, you DON'T want folks 2 SMELL you , before they SEE you; w/ a keeper juice, it should be a 'less is more' dynamic, if it has decent sillage/longevity.

Then I realized that, yes, probably she was right...but then I would be biased. So I surrendered myself to my first impression and ordered it and now I enjoy this smell!

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"I can see why some will say this has a masculine twist. I also think that this can be worn by men very well. It's a soft, sweet oriental fragrance, I cannot tell the notes apart on this one, everything is blended very nicely. On my skin none of the notes dominates over the other.
On me it is not really woody, it's also not floral, but it's also not very vanilla... however it is a lovely, gentle, soft & sweet mixture of notes creating a feeling of sensuality.

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"After first spray i thought i mixed my samples - it was totally masculine. On me it's balmy, extremely woody and strong patchouli. After 30 min. i got some tiny cloud of sweetness. It's nice, mysterious but not really my taste.",06/07/13 10:23,anna.glowacka
Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"This is utterly gorgeous.

I went to a local perfume shop and asked for something woody, spicy--nothing gourmand or little girl sweet, nothing with white florals. She didn't even need to think a moment, and pulled out Présence d'une femme. Wow, it was perfect, exactly what I've been looking for.

My skin *loves* woody and spicy, and this really works for me. It's elegant and yes, a little masculine, but still shades into the feminine. I see it's classed as Oriental Vanilla, but it doesn't work that way for me--it's woody aromatic.

For me, it's warm, sexy, alive, just barely sweet (which I like) and not overpoweringly strong (though I don't go overboard with it). This might possibly be my favorite perfume. I'd wear it every day, but I like switching around a bit too much. Still, I pull it into rotation very often. Today is a day for it.

If you like something that's not candy-sweet or vanilla-heavy, give this a try. I definitely recommend sampling before buying, because I think it's a scent you either love or hate. Me, I love it.",04/29/13 10:33,pierson

Présence d'une femme Montblanc,"So interesting to me that many comments here describe this scent as masculine or unisex!
I get the complete opposite response when I wear it.
And on me, it turns heads, strangers stop me in the street to compliment my scent (men and women) , men approach me closely to whisper how lovely and feminine i smell. My loved ones have been nuts about it.

A gay male friend of mine with a good nose and impeccable taste, described it as ""the scent of simply clean, warm, feminine skin"".

I adore it, it's the only fragrance I'm comfortable with any time of the day no matter what the situation or mood, that's just ME.
And I'm a bit oversensitive to perfume especially early in the morning.

Heartbroken that it seems entirely unavailable since a long time, and would be so gratefull for ANY tip on where I can find it now!

I suspect it's been taken out of production, the last time I got a bottle, my friend found it at the airport in Mexico and had people running between shops and storages to dig up a single bottle.
That's true friendship :)",01/23/13 20:34,Ms.Q.

The opening notes were gorgeous! I love the mandarin orange-pepper combo! It was very uplifting and fresh. The heart phase was less inspiring but still pleasant. I absolutely love orchid, but I felt the cyclamen detracted a little from the beauty of the mandarin/pepper/orchid blend.

I don't know what went wrong when I hit the base notes. I usually love all the notes listed, but the fragrance became extremely masculine on me...even to the point of inducing a headache. I kept smelling ""cologne"". I am even surprised I had this experience, because many of my fragrances have a masculine edge to them, but this one was too much for me.

Funny thing about this one: All I got from it was warm woods and a little pepper but when I asked my husband about it he said : ""Hm, I don't know, it's a little too much vanilla for my taste."" How weird is that?

It's a great scent, surprisingly well executed and definitely something I'd consider purchasing. It has definite unisex qualities to it and the only REAL criticism I have is in regards to its name, which, in my opinion, is misleading.

It's a straight-forward, bold, ""balls-y"" fragrance that does not exude much femininity, but rather captivates the essence of a strong (-willed) woman.

Okay so part of me just wanted to shit all over this fragrance but i can't, this stuff has this kind of charm about it that makes it difficult to hate, it's cute like a kitten dispite being allergic. With that said ignore the massive note breakdown and just think ""raspberry dryer sheet"" because thats entirely what you get from this fragrance. It's something you spray on before bed after a shower or maybe after the gym. The truth is every man needs a fragrance like this in their collection, in my case i found better options and sold this one but it has it's place and thrives in it.

Individuel Montblanc,Three word review: Classic. Clean. Raspberry.,11/04/25 08:09,BlazingAlex
Individuel Montblanc,"This is such a good performer for the price point. No joke, this juice should definitely be rated as eternal. The reviews about this one being a ""raspberry dryer sheet"" type of scent is dead on. I don't get any of the top or heart notes that are listed beside the synthetic lavender which adds to the ""dryer sheet"" type of scent. Then there's nothing but a few of the base notes that are dominant throughout its entire lifespan. So its quite linear with its raspberry, vanilla, dark chocolate, sandalwood base notes. I enjoy wearing this scent during cooler weather for the office. Its perfect for this season and situation. You only need 2-4 sprays for this to come off as sophisticated and subtle as already mentioned below. Anymore than this will come off as ""cheap cologne"" and overbearing. This is definitely one to be discovered. Its not a must own for a collection but if you come across it at discounters, its worth a blind-buy if you are okay with what you are getting into. Its a solid fall/winter frag for the work place. Please don't wear this on a date, there are better quality options you can go with and the woman you are with deserves better lol.",10/27/25 12:34,BigDukes4Ya

Individuel Montblanc,"Individuel has to be one of the most popular fragrance community scents of all time, and a perfume I got for the second time in 2025. What can I say except that for all of your fragrance enthusiasts who have been in this never-ending game for a long time, Individuel is a distant cousin of Joop! Homme, and a fragrance from which Creed’s Original Santal took heavy inspiration.

TOP NOTES
Upon the first spray and a couple of minutes until the top notes start to fade away, I get this delightful mix of lavender, juniper berries, spice, and a touch of pineapple. In my experience, the opening is relatively fresh and clean, but not plain – the fruit and spice give it an energising character.

HEART NOTES
After 5-10 minutes, the scent transitions to the heart (middle) phase. Here, the pineapple and big spice notes start to fade, leaving behind a blend of herbal and floral tones. Lavender stays the most prominent note, and we are introduced to orange blossom similar to the one found in the famous Nikos Sculpture. Compared to the top, the heart is cleaner and simpler. It’s almost like the fragrance “cools off” into a soapy lavender/vanilla laundry scent.

BASE NOTES
For me, the combination of raspberry, vanilla, and top-notch implementation of sandalwood really comes forward, giving a creamy, woody warmth along with fruity and comforting touches. The dry-down (base) has a warm, soft, and subtly sweet quality. It feels like a comfortable sweater or flannel shirt in scent form.

OVERALL
There is always a place in your perfume collection for a versatile, budget-friendly men’s scent that will surprise you with its pleasant character. It’s not a high-end niche masterpiece, but it doesn’t try to be. Instead, it delivers a warm, sweet-woody scent with a touch of fruity freshness. Highly recommended!

Individuel Montblanc,"I've found that my favorite fragrances are often a concoction of notes that don't seem like they should work together but do. Together they create a masterpiece.

This is one of those. It's synthetically sparkling yet has some smoother raspberry and chocolate notes. Then the vetiver sneaks in unexpectedly... It's amazing.

It's similar to CDG 2 for me, in that the frag feels both traditional and futuristic. Incredibly nostalgic, both in smell and because it's from 2003.

Individuel Montblanc,"Montblanc Individuel, with its exquisite blend of scents, is a fantastic choice for office wear fragrance, offering a perfect balance of sophistication and subtlety that is bound to leave a lasting impression. This scent has the potential to garner you numerous compliments due to its unique and appealing aroma, which is neither too bold nor too understated, creating an ideal presence in a professional environment. However, it's important to note that while Montblanc Individuel exudes a delightful subtlety, the oak moss note, which is a prominent feature in its composition, can be a little overwhelming for some, occasionally overshadowing the more delicate components of the fragrance. Despite this, it remains a popular option for those seeking to convey elegance and refined taste in their daily office interactions. 😎",10/13/25 13:17,Manu_kato

Individuel Montblanc,"As others have stated, you get a very delicate body of slightly synthetic fabric softener with that fruity, powdery and fresh accord - but that's not a bad thing! I actually find it to work in it's favour and it surprised me with how enjoyable the mellow fruity aroma is for an older fragrance.

I'd even say that the raspberry in this fragrance holds up incredibly well in this era of syrupy fruit-salad gourmands, and isn't nearly an offensive or cloying berry smell. Granted, it doesn't have the longevity or performance of a modern gourmand (and I wish they did an EDP just so I could smell it for longer) but it does have an moderate performance for an EDT that's a jack-of-all-trades and costs only £25 for 75ml!

Individuel is timeless, you may be able to discern it as an early-ish Y2K style of cologne due to it's strangeness when compared to the shower-gels, the spice-bombs, the gourmands - but it stands on its own as something reliable and suitable for most occasions; it's laid back, maybe a little playful, comforting and definitely an easy dumb reach.

In the line-up of Montblanc fragrances that all bark in different tones, this is an ole reliable that sings and is something every collector should have in their collection, just purely for it's versatility and value.",09/19/25 04:37,slimgrimothy

Individuel Montblanc,"IMHO, this is NOT a Joop clone, nor is it even in the Joop ballpark. This is a synthetic, but lovely, sandalwood wrapped in fruity, clean freshness and so much more!! The raspberry, pineapple and juniper really pop for me, but there’s a lot more going on as it dries down.

For the price, you’re getting an easy reach, fresh sweet scent that smells better and better with time.",09/09/25 08:51,FragrantHawk31
Individuel Montblanc,"Some say this gives similar vibes to Joop Home, but I have to disagree. Although I found this fragrance at my local Ross for $25, it smells identical to Creed Original Santal. It's not bad at all. However, with this fragrance, you should use no more than 3-4 sprays. Anything more than that could give bad vibes to some because the metallic smell could be off-putting. Overall, I love it, and it provides fresh linen with raspberry notes. It's really lovely.",09/07/25 22:12,mapena81
Individuel Montblanc,This is so good in the right dose. If u spray too much of this u Will literally choke yourself out driving to work and come off the road or if u make it to work u will piss everyone off. There’s a couple of notes in this that can make this potentially sickening/cloying. Two sprays and u smell a delightful fresh fruity subtle aroma that lasts all day.,09/05/25 05:24,Spicenza
Individuel Montblanc,"This was the first ever fragrance I bought.
Very sophisticated, fresh, clean scent. A literal definition of an office/work scent, in my opinion. I love this fragrance as it smells great if you like clean scents and seems expensive when it's quite cheap (AUD 60 for 75ml). I wear this all the time, just on casual days or when I have work.
Projects really well, but too many sprays, and it's quite headache-inducing. Longevity is decent. The atomiser is good.
Only downside, the bottle is a bit annoying as it's so wide, but that's just me being picky lol.
Definitely worth the money as it's cheap and effective for an everyday wear fragrance.",08/18/25 03:19,faikxi
Individuel Montblanc,Joop clone..poor longevity,08/16/25 02:34,Driveout02
Individuel Montblanc,"Wow, Really good bargain for this quality.. Synthetic in a good way, classy soap feel, decent performance, easy to wear. Not special, but it is a nice one 👍🏼

Luckily it fits with My Skin Chemistry",08/15/25 13:58,Scent_Juliette
Individuel Montblanc,"If you don't like joop please do not get this, because it is joop. opens up a little softer than it imo, smelling more to the side of rasasi daarej because im getting less of the syrupy notes. then after drying down it literally goes into 100% joop, like almost indistinguishable. So that leaves me to say, why would you buy this for more when joop exists. If you like this scent profile buy that instead. Honestly I think i'm liking this a little bit better for some reason but still not my type of scent. Also who TF said this smells like rasasi hawas? Are you out of your mind!!",08/10/25 14:40,Thesnowman00
Individuel Montblanc,I'm beginning to feel like mint notes just don't agree with my skin. I've tried several different scents now with mint (Davidoff Cool Water and Tommy) and they dry down to an odd sweat-like smell to me. The opening was great. Definitely a good budget option if the mint note is fine for your skin.,08/04/25 14:41,brumfieldsd
Individuel Montblanc,"A very safe, and nice fragrance. I think this fragrance is very versatile, and safe for basically any occasion. It smells like fresh and clean raspberry high quality detergent. It smells like what you want your nice freshly washed clothes to smell like. 5-7 sprays is probably good, because its not the strongest, but you could get away with 3 if you don't want to be noticed too much.",08/03/25 23:49,JoBaBoBa
Individuel Montblanc,"A pretty weird hot-pitch of ingredients - pineapple, raspberry, chocolate, woods, herbs etc…. It’s pretty rough at the opening but settles down just about ok. It ends up a bit nondescript. Not terrible but not that interesting or nice either.",08/02/25 11:43,Nose no limits
Individuel Montblanc,"I have been curious about this fragrance for a long time but not enough to buy it. I recently noticed that it is dirt cheap on discounters, so I pulled the trigger.

My concern from looking at the ""main accords"" on this page, was that the sweet and fruity aspects would be too much and end up being off-putting, and although I enjoy several Montblanc frags, I'm not usually impressed with them enough to put them in my ""love"" category, so I thought this one might be another ""meh.""

Thankfully, that wasn't the case at all. This is a really great fragrance, and I think it should be brought up as ""one of the greatest office fragraces"" just as much as something like Prada's L'homme.

To me, it's like fresh linens that were dried with one of those good-smelling dryer sheets with a light dusting of rasberry over the top. Nothing harsh or out of place, and I don't get a ""synthetic"" vibe from it. It's not a strong performer in the projection department (not every fragrance needs to be) but longevity is good.

Absolutely worth the cash you'll pay for it and then some.",08/02/25 07:42,FragranceAnon
Individuel Montblanc,Love at first smell. It’s a nice fabric softener smell and has this absolutely beautiful raspberry note that makes it sweet and flirty. It is kinda synthetic but it almost smells better that way in this case! It isn’t very common and actually pretty unique and you can use it for any occasion and it’s only $25!! at least for the 50ml I bought at Ross definitely recommend and pretty safe blind buy in my opinion,07/24/25 20:15,Dylansmells
Individuel Montblanc,"@korngoldo nope, get your info right, Original Santal is the knockoff.",07/22/25 13:38,Go4buck
Individuel Montblanc,"A nice sweet, fruity, fresh , clean and powdery scent. Super safe and good for many occasions. You get the nice minty freshness and a spicy fresh feel with some floral powderyness all along a woody soft base with a sweet fruity touch. A really nice scent that doesn’t smell cheap despite is attractive price tag. Performance is as expected but all around a solid deal.",07/21/25 21:23,xPikez
Individuel Montblanc,"Supposedly a knockoff of Original Santal, quite nice, probably with some artificiality in it. However, it is a fresh, masculine, woody scent, more intense than La Nuit de L’Homme, but belonging to the same family – chemically prominent, decent.",07/18/25 11:54,korngoldo
Individuel Montblanc,"Personally I love it, good blind buy",07/17/25 08:16,Shiba9614
Individuel Montblanc,I used to wear it for work back in millennium and i do remember I purchased it few times. i think new batch is very weak.,06/24/25 03:49,dxb77
Individuel Montblanc,"Montblanc Individuel opens with a sharp hit of mint — almost like chewing on berry ice gum. It’s cool, sweet, and slightly playful with raspberry and lavender adding a fruity, aromatic touch. As it dries down, creamy sandalwood and vanilla come forward, giving it a soft, smooth base with hints of chocolate and spice.

This is absolutely a synthetic-smelling fragrance, but in a way that feels clean, modern, and approachable. While it may not be the most traditionally masculine scent, its slight femininity actually invites compliments. It’s a refreshing break from the usual bold men’s fragrances and offers a unique, easy-to-wear profile.",06/23/25 13:29,Apollo2113
Individuel Montblanc,"I was introduced to this by Jeremy Fragrance and I'm so glad, because it's great. I have never understood why it isn't more popular given its price tag, but I think it's one of the best fragrances for the money on the market.",06/19/25 18:52,Slava29
Individuel Montblanc,"After mowing through 2 full bottles of this stuff within the last year, with a 3rd one on the way, I can safely say that this is my favorite scent. I love it. It checks all of the boxes:

-It's unique, yet comforting. Raspberry, pineapple, dark chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla notes make an appearance, yet none are overpowering.
-It works very well with my skin chemistry regardless of season.
-It's somehow fresh without going the usual citrus/aquatic route. I seriously dig the synthetic fresh linen smell in the opening.
-The longevity is perfect - about 7 to 8 hours. It lasts most of a workday but doesn't get into obnoxious territory.
-Speaking of work... this is a fragrance that won't get you sent to HR. I find it impossible to overspray.
-The price is right. $20-25 for a full bottle? Ok, there you go.
-High compliment factor. My wife loves it. Friends have randomly told me I smell good. I've even gotten 3 or 4 compliments from total strangers - something that has never happened before.
-For what it's worth, even the bottle design is awesome. Solid atomizer, too.

And as far as the Joop comparisons go... this ain't Joop. I'm not a Joop hater, but that's like comparing Sunny D to actual orange juice. Yeah, they have a couple similarities, but once you get past the superficials, you'll see it's not even close.

In conclusion, my only complaint about Individuel is that it doesn't come in a larger bottle. I would buy a Gatorade cooler full of this stuff if Montblanc sold it as such.",06/19/25 18:41,basicbarofsoap

Individuel Montblanc,"I have amassed quite a wardrobe of fragrances, but I always find myself coming back to Montblanc Individuel. It’s consistently a great compliment-getter and feels uniquely well-rounded. I haven't tried Creed Original Santal yet, but I can absolutely see why it's often said that Creed took inspiration from Individuel.

When I first wore it, I didn’t immediately notice the chocolate note—but once it was pointed out, I couldn’t un-smell it. Initially, I was struck more by a spicy lavender accord, blended with what I can best describe as a fire-roasted pineapple nuance. It's an intriguing and unexpected combination that keeps it interesting.

That said, it can be overwhelming on an active summer day, not just because of the scent profile but also due to its impressive longevity and projection. In an air-conditioned office, it's manageable, but for more active or outdoor professions, it might come across as too forward or intrusive.

Still, I find Individuel to be classy, casual, distinctive, and a definite attention-getter. It stands out without trying too hard, striking a balance between being unique and approachable. It’s one of those rare fragrances that feels equally at home on a laid-back day or dressed up for an evening out.",05/24/25 13:32,NotesofBLang
Individuel Montblanc,"Just not good enough. It Can be maybe if you don't overspray this like maybe 3 maximum,but just not my type. For me even not too safe as everyone say it. I like Montblanc house but this I would Never rebuy.",05/16/25 19:59,Zarko247
Individuel Montblanc,Best office fragrance as you can get.,05/09/25 06:31,SergioGabbana
Individuel Montblanc,"One of best out-the-shower scents there is. Even though it's a bit of a powdery and slightly dry scent, it smells so clean. It feels luxe.
Although I will say, overspraying this scent will make it smell cheap since it's on the sweet side. It's quite strong so you don't need a lot.

That said, it's one of the best value fragrances on the market currently, even with Afnan and Lattafa churning out cheapies like there's no tomorrow.",05/04/25 14:04,hvnscnt
Individuel Montblanc,"I feel so blessed to test this.
Beautiful, soft, fresh-sweet, maturely fruity.
Nothing too far away quality-wise from scents like Azzaro Visit and CH Chic.
Yes, Joop Homme's mature half-brother.
Yes, Creed Original Santal ripped this off.
While the copy is more expensive and does smell a touch better-blended, I support this more. The difference in price is ridiculous too.",05/02/25 05:01,Swashbuckler9x

Individuel Montblanc,Such a beautiful summer fragrances. I usually don’t like summer type scents but this one is just a beauty. It was one of my first ever fragrances I bought in a haul and after 80 or so fragrances later this is still top 5 summer scents in my collections. It’s not super unique but the scent for some reason is just beautiful. It’s alittle synthetic when you first spray but let this baby dry down 5-10 mins later you get this beautiful fresh/fruity scent. It reminds me just a tad bit of hawas but in my opinion I love this more then hawas. It’s a beauty!,04/24/25 19:58,HooperG

Individuel Montblanc,"Rasberry chocolate vanilla mix, backed up by musk, gives an very clean smelling fragrance Im suprised these notes haven't been blended more by other fragrance houses. Those notes blend well together. This is very good. It is extremely light, and can easily be overshadowed by the environmental smells you encounter in everyday life, this can make you feel that it doesnt last long, but it is still working. If you spend alot of time in doors, in office spaces, or cool places, you will be able to smell Individual for a long time. I sprayed it on at 9am its now 330pm and i still smell it.I drive a cab, I'm in and out of the car all day. Whenever im in the car, im reminded of how good this smells.",04/03/25 12:20,Robcal08
Individuel Montblanc,"Incredible stuff. Truly. Proves that you really don't need to spend much to obtain wearable, versatile, noticeable fragrances that still maintain their dignity and compliment factor even in close-quarters.

Smells great, performs well, and is very inexpensive without smelling cheap.

A quality standout nowadays in the era of vanilla/vanilla/vanilla note breakdowns. But this still works well today.

And despite my experience with Original Santal, I find this one suits my personality (and bank account) better, as it is a little bit less polished than the Creed. I like the rougher edges.

Both are very good fragrances. Thank you Pierre Bourdon.",04/02/25 09:34,Felixthreeone

What fragrances produced without synthetic ingredients, people? Even the expensive niche perfumes use synthetic molecules and oils in their production.

Individuel Montblanc,"This was a blind buy for $20 and it was only borderline worth-it at best. The initial scent is so minty that I feel like I'm wearing cologne made by Wrigley's or Trident. But after it dries down, it smells exactly like Bounce dryer sheets. That isn't a compliment, as Bounce isn't offensive but neither is it interesting at all. This one is interesting for a while because it's not linear in the least and goes from minty to funky to Bounce. I will give it credit for decent longevity, as I can smell the Bounce for hours and hours, like it or not. I will probably reach for it once in a blue moon just to see if my opinion changes, but this one is my least favorite of several Montblanc fragrances I have.",02/13/25 13:29,doggymcnuggets
Individuel Montblanc,"After being traumatised by F***kin JOOP In the 90s I expected to hate this! Heard the controversy about Bourdin/Creed/explorer saga and took a punt.

I have found my signature. I got JOOP on the first whiff, thought I’d wasted my pennies (and it IS pennies cheap) then it began to dry down.
I’m no expert and it may be nostalgia but Individuel smells PERFECTLY balanced. Bit fruity, woody, clean, powdery then YES clean laundry!!! I absolutely love this fragrance.
I smelled Creed OS to satisfy my curiosity I would rather buy 10 bottles of this over 1 OS.

Individuel Montblanc,"The combination of notes in this fragrance has a public bathroom funk to it... It's very off putting when you get a whiff of it and has even made me feel sick to my stomach at times.

The weird thing is, it's not bad when you first spray it on, kinda refreshing and then that raspberry kicks in. The mid just has a gross kinda smell to my nose, and then it goes onto be a perfectly fine lingering raspberry in the dry-down...

Individuel Montblanc,"Just found this at Ross for $20 and blind bought it. I'm so glad that I purchased this and even though this came out in 2003, it smells modern and high quality to me. The ingredients are well blended and the main vibes I get from this fragrance is a powdery, freshly pressed linen sheets smell with a raspberry sweetness. Basically what other people have said already countless times.

I agree with others that this smell is most suited for the spring time, however I do believe this can be an all year fragrance. You can wear this anytime for any occasion, but I am very excited to use this as a school / work fragrance as I think the fresh, clean, powdery smell is great for professional settings yet the raspberry, vanilla, and chocolate undertones give it a playful feel.

If you can find this at a discounter, do not sleep on this! This is one of the best discounter fragrances I've found at a brick and mortar store!",12/17/24 20:26,salcedosauce

Individuel Montblanc,"I'm gonna write this to help people blind buy this because most likely a lot of people would have to.

This is closer to Original Santal than Joop is. However I thought Joop and Individuel are closer to each other than Original Santal and Individuel are to each other. So this is what I thought at first Original Santal------- Individuel---Joop but it may also be closer to Original Santal than it is to Joop. So it might be more like this Original Santal---Individuel------Joop. Because after the very sweet and Joop like opening Individuel turns into a much fresher and also more complex scent which is less like Joop. I don't think it smells synthetic. To me things like L'eau D'Issey and Cool Water are synthetic not this. I would say that Original Santal smells unusually natural, that's all, it's a 300 euro fragrance. Expect D & G grade quality. Slightly less but I suppose it doesn't have longevity issues that'd & g does. And among these 3, this one is the one that evolves more and is less linear. I wish I could smell the raspberry and chocolate more. This is definitely the rarest of the bunch.

Original SantaI came out after but lets say its Individuel on steroids. If you like the scent profile I would recommend Original Santal over this if you can afford it. I think Individuel is a bit dated & lacks the nuances we see in newer designer releases. For the everyday guy just looking to smell good I still think you can grab this for the cheap and be cool with it. it's simple, fresh and comforting as well as pretty linear---and sometimes I think that's ok.

Individuel Montblanc,"This is probably one of the most complicated fragrances I own. It's very hard to tie down the notes.
It smells different on skin than it does on paper. I like the way it smells coming off my skin better than when it's on paper.

I picked this up at Burlington Coat Factory yesterday for $20.00 after regrettably passing up on it a year ago.
Well worth the price. Go get it. If you don't like it you can gift it to someone who will enjoy wearing it.",08/24/24 08:26,coachkeith

Individuel Montblanc,"Original Santal came two years after this one, and both were created by Pierre Bourdon.

I'm wearing Original Santal today, but I have Individuel on my right hand, and Original Santal on my left. They do smell VERY similar, but Indiividuel is a little bit lighter, a bit airy where Original Santal is a bit more herbaceous, deeper, and more resinous. To me, they are both good fragrances.

Individuel Montblanc,"This smells like masculine scented dryer sheets . It is definitely synthetic and really just a clean scent. It is a perfect office scent . I don't want to say it's a boring fragrance but it's doesn't lean in any way that gives it that bang. My biggest issue is that it does have a slight odd note that throws it off. I think it's the juniper and patchouli. It does get better the longer it's on., but that odd smell is part of the base. This can be worn just about whenever , super versatile. While not exact in anyway this reminds me of Prada L'Homme and bad boy Parfum . This starts slightly fruity and sweet with the powder and lavender notes grounding a lot of the brighter notes . It has the fruity sweet dryer sheets smell that turns into an aromatic dryer sheet smell with the hint of raspberry. Performance isn't bad. I have been applying 6-7 sprays , projecting for a good 3 hours. It stays on the skin for a good 6 hours before it almost fades away . The bottle is pretty nice and sleek with an ok atomizer. I have worn this 4 times already and chances are I won't wear this again. The weirdness killed it for me to wear as a fragrance. I really tried to like it. But I have no problem using this as a quick room spray .

Individuel Montblanc,"I wore this one today as my office choice. Even after all if these years, it is still one of my top office safe choices for fall, winter, and early spring. It's not for everyone, but you can't go wrong with the sweet dryer sheet smell when playing it safe at the office.

For the price it's also a really good value due to it being a solid 8 hour performer, and a a modest sillage trail and projection for about an hour.",04/17/24 18:09,EbagAppez

Individuel Montblanc,"I actually liked the opening of this fragrance.
But the drydown smells very synthetic sweet that I couldn't stand it",04/12/24 23:13,herbertjuergen
Individuel Montblanc,"This is my dumb reach for fall, thought it would be also great during winter and early spring as well. It would be too cloying for the summer.
It's highly synthetic yet smells beautiful. Sharp frozen raspberries, or cold, breezy raspberry drier sheet - if I had to describe it, and dries down as a powdery smell. It pops up every now and then and surprises you when you catch a whiff hours after applying it. That's the phase I love the most. It's very easy to overspray, but only two-three sprays max is enough, more than that and you might get a headache. I own around 6 bottles of this and always looking for more in case this gets discontinued.

In terms of audience, I think it's good for any age group. Suited up or dressed down casual. Night out in the town, fancy dressed up dinner, weddings..all good. INCREDIBLY versatile. I would suggest going easy on the sprayer and not judging the cologne based on the synthetic, headache-inducing rubbing alcohol type of opening. Wait until the smell develops. On skin it's great, on clothes it lingers for days.
Based on the reviews here it seems like this is a polarizing scent..you either love it or hate it..so try first I guess.
This was a blind buy for me, but was totally worth it. This and Mont Black Starwalker..instant like.

Individuel Montblanc,"Spraying top notes: I sense it intensively aromatic with fresh spicy, warm scents of lavender and cardamon. I also identify a slight citric smell - bergamot and citric notes. As time passed by, it became predominantly fruity and fresh transitioning to spicy notes.

At the heart, it became overwhelmingly floral and clean. Yet so, noticeable fruity/berry fragrances. I couldn't identify any trace of woody notes. Maybe slightly, indistinguishable from floral and fruity scents. At best I do not have the sensitivity to feel them.

In conclusion, I hold that Montblanc Individuel is a very discrete, low-profile and intimate fragrance (low sillage). It is wearable in the spring and fall day-light seasons, considering how fruity and floral it is. It fits perfectly at work, given its intimacy and freshness. However, it is a very particular fragrance, which means that you might like it or hate it (I like it, my wife don't).",04/06/24 03:00,Tfceccherini

Individuel Montblanc,"Blind bought since it was cheap, and I would say that this is not really a safe blind buy. The first time I wore this, I absolutely hated it. All I could smell is dryer sheet, because it does in fact smell like a straight up dryer sheet fresh out the box. It's not necessarily a bad smell, since it's essentially a clean laundry smell, but not really attractive to my tastes, as it was overly powdery and fresh linen smell. Maybe even a bit like fabreeze? If you want to make sure everyone knows that your shirt is clean because you just pulled it out of the dryer, this is the stuff for you.

Once I tried it a couple more times, I was able to look past the dryer sheet smell and pick up some of the other notes, although I think there are waaaay too many notes given and it's really a pretty simple scent. On the dry down, you definitely get the sweeter raspberry smell as well as some vanilla and chocolate. A slight hint of amber and musk (very slight) gives it some masculinity. There are some florals there, mainly I would say lavender lending to the laundry smell, and maybe some sandalwood, but I wouldn't call this a woody fragrance by any means. Performance is decent, but not anything to write home about. Once again, not a safe blind buy in my opinion, as the powdery linen smell is not for everyone, but I do think this is a good one for if you want a generic, non-citrus, fresh fragrance for the daytime or maybe bedtime.

Personally, I would give it probably an honest, right down the middle 5/10, as I could take it or leave it. It's not great, but it's not necessarily bad. I won't be buying another bottle because it's not really to my tastes, but it is kind of a unique smell amongst freshies, since it lacks the citrus and aquatic notes that are so common. If smelling like a dryer sheet placed on top of a slice of raspberry cheesecake sounds interesting to you, maybe pick it up to try since it is cheap and intriguing.",03/20/24 10:21,cynogriffin
Individuel Montblanc,"Pretty decent fragrance for 20 quid
Opening notes arnt very impressive and are overly complex but this fragrance stands out in the drydown where you get a really nice smell of sweet vanilla, raspberry (vaguely) and dark chocolate. Not overly boastful or impressive, more subtle. It's great for a blind buy at such a cheap price but the price comes through with it's weaker longevity and silliage, pretty good for a beginner but again not up there in fragrances. I would however still very much recommend this as it's cheap, smells good, and has a nice bottle with a satisfying (heavy) lid. 6/10 the kinda thing you wear as a basic everyday one",03/16/24 18:30,dan_non

A few times I have caught a bitter smell possibly from the dark chocolate but unfortunately it's extremely subtle. The vanilla and amber works lovely in the dry down adding a slightly smooth warming touch. I am getting Joop Homme in soon and I will compare these two although I have smelt Joop Homme before and it was way sweeter possibly from the honey note.

Individuel Montblanc,"This fragrance has grown on me a lot as it was one of the first-ever full bottles I own and at first, I thought it was too cloying, however, this has grown on me. I used to get a bunch of different smells and I felt mixed about owning it, but now I get this raspberry detergent smell that kind of smells like you are walking down the laundry product aisle and there's one that smells pretty dang fruity. It is not bad by any means, but it's not something I would wear always which is why I've leaned more to wear this at the gym versus out during class or work.

Individuel Montblanc,"Can't decide how I feel about this one. I think on my skin the notes kind of blend together into that bounce dryer sheet smell rather than having a separate ""dryer sheet accord"" (lol), because when I sniff it looking for the raspberry/vanilla/chocolate/etc the notes are definitely there, but when I just happen to catch a whiff of it while I'm out just pure dryer sheet. Smelling like that definitely isn't a bad thing (I don't think anyone minds smelling clean) but it's not really what I was looking for. Blind buy but only out $20 so nbd.

This feels like a go-to for any kind of formal occasion. It reminds me that aside from wearing scents that are sweet and attractive, we also need to be prepared for formal occasions where opinions of older men matter, and impressions on older women also matter.

It's beautiful. I may use this a lot more when I'm in my later 20's, attending meetings with managers and staff in suits. On top of this, it is well-priced for its mature scent and I feel like your money is being spent on luxury for a modest amount.

Individuel Montblanc,"I just love Montblanc Individuel. I have hyperfocus with Raspberry things so I couldn't pass on this. I usually spray a touch or two on the cap so I can smell it before I apply it on my skin. The opening is a metallic kind of sweetness, in a fresh, juicy way of sweetness. I think that might be the pineapple note. After about 15 minutes on my skin, it turns into a fruity and chocolatey scent, I think that the raspberry, vanilla and chocolate notes comes up at this point, this is my favorite point in every single perfume I've tried on my skin. It doesn't turn into a more interesting thing after that, but I think that my raspberry hyperfocus makes me feel that this is my favorite scent of all times! I can wear it for every ocassion, from a casual day hanging out with friends, to a more formal event. Overall, it smells like clean clothes, so it makes this perfume a perfect choice for my signature scent 🥰",12/20/23 09:16,MiiiL33
Individuel Montblanc,"A really great clean fragrance. Normally clean fragrances are associated with ""blues"" which feature citruses of some kind, but not Individuel. This one takes a different approach and nails it. The raspberry note is the key player here, however its blended with other notes in such a way that it smells like washed, clean clothes?
The people who are saying it smells synthetic are not wrong, but remember you're paying around $20 for this. Its totally worth it to add to your collection for a dumb reach fragrance. Works almost year round and gets the job done.",12/14/23 22:46,Junaid666
Individuel Montblanc,"• I was hoping for a red/raspberry alternative to the standard ""blue freshie"".

• It's more of a straight up laundry-detergent scent, ruined by unnecessary cinnamon.

• Meh. Not offensive, not exciting, just ""a smell"".",12/11/23 10:59,SmoothieOperator
Individuel Montblanc,"Tested for a month:

I have two perspectives on Individuel. First, I think for a $15 - $24 price tag, it's great and smells better than most people around you throughout the day. Especially when most men in the US only wear a fragrance for special occasions. It lasts a full work day even with heavy perspiration.

The second perspective is, ""how much are you willing to pay to smell good for yourself?"" I think everyone should wear fragrances for themselves, not others. If you want a good smelling fragrance, buy one you love, not cause it's inexpensive.

Anyway, the scent opens with old school sharpness like white peppery mint notes if that makes sense. But the middle and dry down are sweet. Take joop homme tone down with a hint of vanilla and light powdery musk in the back. It leaves a noticeable scent trail in office settings and if you're trying to be discovered this could work in highly active or professional settings. You'll know if it's for you after your first full wear. I would recommend you definitely try it.

1 Hour Later - This is still a very clean scent. It is powdery, but not on the order of Burberry Touch. Less like a clean diaper and more like a flushable cleaning wipe

Powdery scents for men confuse me because they are so feminine. This one attempts to counteract that by amping up the citrus

Individuel Montblanc,"Montblanc Individuel is an interesting fragrance. It opens with a pleasant burst of fruity and slightly sweet notes, which is inviting and subtle. As it settles, it unveils a mix of florals and spices, giving it a bit more complexity.
The scent is versatile and can suit various occasions, making it a solid choice for everyday wear. However, I found that the longevity was moderate, not exceptionally long-lasting. The bottle design is classic and understated, which aligns with the overall vibe of the fragrance.

Individuel Montblanc,"I was curious with this relatively affordable Montblanc variant. Might as well give it a try today.
Opening is fruity and floral. I wouldn't say that this is a male perfume. Smells fresh on the first 5mins but it goes to more floral after. The lavander scent is strong. It's bordering more for women.... mature women. I remember the scent when I was young when aunts and grandmas were kissing me. You smell the plethora of powder, lipstick, makeup, perfume, etc. That's the smell of the drydown. Violet and powdery. I was surprised with the absence of the iris lipsticky note.
I can't wear this the whole day. I like Montblanc's Legend Spirit and Explorer but I have to pass on this. Good thing I just had a sample.",09/18/23 15:43,nirvblakr

Then about oh honestly 2-3 months ago I put it in and was like ""whoa what is this synthetic bomb?!"" but it was tolerable...
Then oh I tried it again a week and a half ago. It smelled just AWFUL. I have since have away the backups. I still have a og bottle I'm my collection but I honestly think I'll let it go as well. It went from me rocking it to it being 😫

Individuel Montblanc,"A fruity, fresh and slightly sweet fragrance. This is the kind of fragrance you can wear when you want something that doesn’t draw too much attention but it is still noticeable and pleasant. It has a high similarity to the smell of fresh clean linens, but in a better way, so it’s the kind of fragrance that will give you a clean vibe without trying too hard, perfect for the office or a very casual reunion. The note of raspberry is the most prominent, then the lavender, at least to my nose. Great versatility but I would avoid it when the weather is too hot. I get 10-12 hours duration on my skin, and 24+ hours on clothes, with good projection on the first 1-2 hours. I recommend it if you are looking for an affordable soap-like fragrance to get you feeling clean, versatile enough but perhaps not so much for very hot weather.

Individuel Montblanc,"This is an odd fragrance. First sprays I couldn't smell it on me at all, very slight ""Clean sheets"" kind of smell when burying my nose on the skin, but SO said it's ""good"". I was kind of disappointed thinking I got a dud and performance was awful. Gave it a few more ""warning"" sprays in the air and let it sit for a night.

It matured and showed it's colours in full brightness just overnight. It's a very clean smelling, fresh laundry like smell, with strong raspberry note. A clean-sweet combo of two. ""Clean fresh laundry"" note, which I award to Lavender, starts slightly chemically, like a laundry detergent, but not as bad as some people described. It settles down fast to powdery clean smell. Equally strong is the Raspberry note - those two are the main notes here. It's potent but inoffensive. Smooth powderiness of White Florals ties it all together, making for a pleasant smelling, inoffensive but good-performing fragrance. Sinking my nose into skin I get a hint of Vanilla, and a bit of Mint, but none of the other listed notes.

I definitely get the Joop! resemblance - it smells like a less potent and cloyingly sweet, but more fresh, mature, and office friendly version of it. Performance is similarly strong - it projects ""average"" for a couple of hours, and the sits close to skin for the rest of the day. Even after shower I can clearly smell it on my skin - it has some staying power!

Like the aforementioned Joop!, this does smell a bit out of fashion, but is a good fragrance overall. Definitely an easy and flexible wear. I'd pick it over Joop! as well. 50/50 for a blind buy - I'd lean towards safe but if you're unsure about if you like sweet fragrances, probably should sample it first.

Also love the tin bottle - saves so much space!",07/16/23 13:34,razorsedge

Individuel Montblanc,@SenslessReviews What a story. Quite entertaining!,06/17/23 20:51,Sweetboy05
Individuel Montblanc,"First impressions. I have no problem with funky smells and I'm quite fond of animalic musks and all sorts of intrigues, but this one initially almost made me gag. The reason for it seems to be an overdose of a certain laundry musk. It's a clean musk, but comes with an overbearingly mineral chlorine note that smells like something straight from a chemist's lab. Underneath that, a cloyingly sweet, yet strangely flat pineapple smell. I get no raspberry, but there is some mint. It's vaguely similar to other Montblanc fragrances with the Aventus/Fierce-inspired pineapple theme. But this one is a scrubber for me, and I'm getting a mild headache now. It baffles me how this could be perceived as a dumb reach freshie. And no, it's not similar to Joop! Homme.

-----

Later impressions. It seems to be a fragrance that needs some acclimatization. After my nose got used to the chlorine note, it actually appears kind of wearable. It's still probably a fragrance that's not meant to be smelled up close. The sillage is mineralic musky clean and fruity, seems to work in the current summer heat at least. But up close, I still get an impression of a cleaning agent with bleach that's covering up a bluntly sour and weirdly sweet note... Not exactly vomit, but for some reason, this was the first association. It's probably a passing association anyway, but I stand by my claim that this is not a blind buy safe fragrance by today's standards or a good idea for a gift. There are much safer options for conveying this kind of intense freshness. But at least I'm beginning to get the idea behind this fragrance.",06/14/23 15:02,kaurg

Lady Emblem Elixir Montblanc,"I was really surprised with how much I liked this - I don’t usually like very “floral” or “woody” fragrances at all. Lady Emblem Elixir on me opens with a lovely fruity freshness, the lychee and mandarin is delicious. Then it drys down to a lovely softly sweet rose with a touch of vanilla, it’s really gorgeous. I can’t stop sniffing my wrist. I don’t get any woodiness or powder at all. I don’t know about projection but longevity on my skin was 2-3 hours.

***Update***Bought myself a bottle and I love it. The rose is fruity and gentle, the lychee is more a floral lychee than the synthetic blast in scents like La Nuit Tresor, and the dry down is a lovely soapy rose and vanilla. There is a bit of an alcohol blast at the beginning, especially if you spray it super close on to skin/clothing, better to give it a little room of a couple of inches.",06/23/19 19:43,NessS

It's suitable for all seasons and I find that it lasts longer on my skin that most of my other Montblanc colognes. Funny, I bought the original Individuel after loving this one first and I don't like it at all. The two have very little in common with the original having a weird off-putting minty and synthetic smell to me.

Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"It’s hard to take this site seriously when all the information about this fragrance – release date, perfumer, note pyramid – is completely wrong. In fact, the notes are just copy/pasted from the original Individuel.

What are we even doing here? How is this listing up for this long with no corrections made?",01/04/25 00:12,leroystanks
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"This is like ""Raucousdaucus"" says below: the notes here are wrong, they're probably right but incomplete in wiki. To my own knowledge and perception I'd describe this as:

Top: Pineapple, Bergamot, Cardamom, Coriander
Mid: Clary Sage (strong!), Lavender, Orange Blossom, clear woods (ISO-E)
Base: Ambroxan (overdose!), Sandalwood, Musk, Moss

It is easy to wear, performs average, it's an all-season creamy-soapy modern masculine fougere. It reminds me of Drakkar Noir intense, but sweeter and fruitier and way less mossy. The presentation is like the OG Individuel, if you have that one, you will want to get this just to place it alongside on your shelf.

Then again, the biggest issue is, where's the tonic, Dude? Nothing lactonic, fizzy, nor any juniper here. The herbal undertone that dominates the mid is the sweetish transparent clary sage, not anything strong and manly like spruce, fir, pine. The moss here is barely noticeable. The whole formula feels soapy, tamed, diluted, restrained, obedient, workplace compliant, but the Ambrocenide amount here can be offensive to the nostrils. This could be the perfume for a nice foot powdered deodorant. The base lasts forever on clothes.

I dig the comparisons to Chrome, they're both transparent and light enough, but this has no citrus top/mid neither any relation to D&G K as no spices are really present here, only mild herbal undertones. It strongly reminds me of the herbal dryness of Cretan mountain tea. A nice to have and not at all overpriced product for any occasion really.",10/15/24 15:01,sapeur1999

Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"Smells like your grandpa
Aptly named. Sweet berries and lots of greenery but not in a masculine sense like Polo green. This is very soft and very old school. I can't think of any particular occasion this would be good for except maybe for a casual walk-out in the spring and summer. Heavy on the juniper berries. Definitely suited for 40+ guys, maybe 35 if you're daring.
Hard to come by, only recommended for collectors and Mont Blanc fans.",01/20/24 03:58,Junaid666

Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"Saw this in Home Bargains for £22, checked Fragrantica and thought it was worth a try. Wow, it's even better that I expected. Lovely fresh, green fragrance. I even bought a second bottle.",12/13/23 05:00,brechfastryder
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"First Pass - I viscerally dislike this. I recognize the scent but it eludes my grasp. Everything is muddled together, it's musty and spoiled somehow... I can't put my finger on it.

1 Hour Later - It hit me like a ton of bricks. This is unmistakably lime, but rancid lime. The lime that has been on the shelf or in the fridge too long and the green skin is blotchy tan and yellow. This is exactly what that smells like

24 hours later, I finally get the tonic, or the juniper. Not freshly opened tonic water, this is soured, oxidized tonic water that has sat on the bar overnight (garnished with an old lime wedge)

I do not like this at all. But I have to admit, now that I've identified the smell, it's kind of like a car crash. It's a mess, but it's so interesting I'm lured back

Generally I find bottles superfluous. A poor bottle or a cheap cap detract from the joy of application, but I have yet to find an elegant bottle capable of uplifting a malodorous concoction

That said, this vessel is beautiful. Emerald green, thin, cat-eye oval body, collared with a shiny metal epaulet and topped with a heavy, rounded metal cap

It's a shame I didn't like the scent. I was looking forward to seeing this bottle on the shelf

***Scents, like tastes, are subjective. Wear what you like***",11/02/23 18:29,coonhound
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"Superb fragrance. The presentation, like all Montblanc fragrances is great and the bottle is to die for, easily the best on my shelf, It's heavy and the green makes it look like it contains Kryptonite, the upper part and the lid are metal. I'd use it as a hip flask if I could!!

The fragrance is very green and the opening is a little underwhelming, but after an hour or so the fragrance starts to open up. I definitely get the Geranium and the there's a damp mossy accord there also, its got great sillage and you know its leaving a trail. It's cheap, at £22 for 75ml you can use it liberally, and you need to for performance. It's an uncomplicated and very clean green fragrance with good presence. This is one where the bottle really matches the scent. I can only imagine its been given the Individual moniker because it shares the same bottle, but that's the only similarity. There poles apart in DNA, the original Individual was very sweet to my mind and a tad unisex, nothing like Individual Tonic. It should have been given its own name really, because it totally deserves it.

What's odd is I notice this fragrance dates from 2018, but its the first time I've seen it in any shops, and it seems to be everywhere now? I'll certainly stock up on it at this price, personally I think its the best and most original Montblanc aftershave I've ever used.",10/12/23 09:40,MaxRenn
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"First of all, I don't detect at least half of the notes listed here, so either it's MASTERFULLY blended for a budget fragrance or someone is lying, lol.

In any case, this is a very pleasant aromatic freshie. It harkens back to the early 2000s a bit with a heavy juniper berry note in the opening and a glut of synthetic florals and fruits backing it up. I do agree with the comparisons to D&G K although this one is less dense and to me, actually smells more pleasing. I would say it's a great substitute for the D&G for that reason, especially if you can get it from a rack store. I won't be running out to pick it up as it's just not very interesting to me, but I think it'd be a great entry-level fragrance for just about any age range. Spring and fall recommended, I don't think it'd work very well in the high heat.",09/16/23 12:19,Vapor Trail
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"There is an unpleasant note in this fragrance that reminds me of pickles. Laundry with an undertone of nasty soft smelling dill pickle.

The original individuel is MUCH better in every way including scent profile, longevity and projection. Skip this one and go for the og.",09/06/23 19:49,Jqwalls
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"Peoples expectations of a flanker often blur their ratings. A known fact. We all have seen plenty of examples.

Unfortunately most of us, me included, trust too much on Fragrantica ratings.

Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"Saltychipdust,

I have to disagree with you on the original not being a beastmode fragrance.
The one I bought in 2013 for sure was beast mode.
For years this used to be my cold weather fragrance for the longer working days out of the office.

Part of my 2014 review:
Last week went travelling for work. Sprayed at 7.45h. Drove close to 500 km. Came home at 21.30
Took off my shirt to take a shower 15 minutes later, and The fragrance was still on my arms.14 hours later!!
I had my wife checked it and she said ""yes, very nice"".
Next morning got up and still could smell the fragrance on the shirt I slept in. Amazing.

I have finished my first bottle years ago. I have the feeling my 2e bottle which I bought 4 years ago, is indeed weaker. But haven't used it often enough to be certain.",08/07/23 04:04,Louismanuel
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"Imho reason for many dislikes is that MB launched this juice in this bottle and name. This fragrance deserve its own name not a flanker.
This is actually very good, ignore the snobs.
If you want a freshie that is not boring this is that.

Fresh with a twist of green, longevity around 4 hours on me, good for the price 7/10 easily",08/07/23 03:44,4trl0ver
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"I was reading previous reviews and I agree this has a mess of an opening. However, to me it develops into a twice removed cousin of Gentle Fluidity Silver, maybe it’s the juniper berry? This isn’t a beast mode scent but neither was the OG Individual. I do think this should have been its own fragrance as the two aren’t close.",05/26/23 03:57,Saltychipdust
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"So the one and only reason this gets dumped on is because Big Bro OG Individuel is a legendary masterpiece and this tonic flanker is not. Had the same juice been in a new line bottle this would get way better reviews.

Personally, I like it quite a bit. The first 30 seconds are a mess, then it's green for about 15 minutes but a soft mossy rain type green, after that the ambroxan shows up to make it blue-green an has some heft and sweetness. A very modern green, with moderate performance at a great price in my case $30.

A very mass appealing ambroxan green dumb reach all occasion men's fragrance. Should be able to garner compliments no problem. All things considered this is about an 8/10 for a cheapie in my book...but OG Individuel is a10/10 all day, every day, 24/7/365",03/15/23 08:14,Bfish88
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"This perfume reminds me of PURPLE LABEL by Ralph Lauren. There I said it. Is it a clone? Of course not! But in my perception the Oakmoss dominates it's dry down very strong just like Purple Lable. The Mint, The Rosemary and the Pineapple to me are the main stars of the opening to this amusingly strange perfume. Is VERY VERY VERY GREEN and herbal. Takes a little time to get used to it..... Do I LOVE IT?? No .... But I don't hate it either. I do like it and I can wear this to any outdoorsy occassion anytime. The sad part is it's projection and longevity.... JUST LIKE ALL MONTBLANC FRAGS. I was hoping (since its an INDIVIDUEL FLANKER) that would last as the OG does but I was dissappointed. Solution??? Spray on Clothes and 12 to 14 times.",01/16/23 17:57,EvangLiber
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"Although I don’t love this I do quite enjoy it when I’m wanting an easy to wear,green soapy fragrance !

The opening to this is actually very good as it’s very Dewey green,minty,semi-sweet, and even a bit watery without being aquatic !! Tonic doesn’t develop a ton but as time goes on that minty,watery freshness dies down and it becomes more dry while retaining that green,soapy freshness ! In the drydown I smell a lot of ISO E super mixed with green soapy freshness ! This is very reminiscent of an Irish Spring body wash I smelled recently.

(Scents that to my nose it’s similar to are Azzaro Chrome,Swiss Army Classic, and Aromatic Touch by Rochas)

I enjoy soapy scents so I do enjoy this but it’s a casual soapy and not on the same level as Prada style scents

Performance is average as it lasts 5-6 hours with good projection for an hour but then dies down quickly and you’re left with just a scent bubble that only people close you will smell. For that reason it’s good for work if you let it die down after an hour as that first hour it’s pretty strong

Overall rating -7 out of 10 ! I like this scent profile so I do enjoy it but it’s not my favorite soapy smell",12/02/22 13:42,Ryanmmas26
Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"This fragrance has been unfairly dismissed by some YouTube reviewers - who should know better :) - as being generic and generally 'meh' and pleasant at best. I disagree. I think it's quite a sophisticated versatile uplifting scent with good quality if slightly synthetic ingredients that result in excellent performance, longevity (7 hours +) and sillage - at least in autumn which is when I've tried it. However I would be comfortable wearing it in any season and I suspect it would perform just as well. It's fresh and fruity with an interesting green herbal backdrop where for me the pineapple, rosemary and moss stand out. I find it characterful (certainly not generic) and definitely masculine, and would suit any age but in my view leans towards the more mature (say 30+). Works extremely well as a casual daytime fragrance, although it can work just as well in the office and smart attire. Gorgeous packaging, and a special love for that striking emerald green bottle!

This is a surprising blind-buy win for me as I'm used to Montblanc fragrances being beautifully packaged and interesting but lacking performance - which this one certainly doesn't. Full marks for being fresh without resorting to aquatic/watery/blue notes. To my best knowledge, I've never smelt the OG Individuel to compare it with, but taken at face value, this new edition is very good and I'm certainly not disappointed.

Recommended, and I've already secured my back-up bottle.",10/16/22 03:25,iconoclast

Individuel Tonic Montblanc,"So, being a fan of the original Individuel, seeing it as the Joop! Homme for the more refined man, I have been waiting to get my hands on this for a while since it first popped up, unannounced. It is still currently unavailable in the UK from UK suppliers however is available on FragranceX as of the date of this review.

Onto the fragrance, it's not got much of the Individuel DNA, its pleasant enough, but I would struggle to distinctively pick this up on someone like I would the original. Its got similar performance to the original in both longevity and sillage. The only link I find it has to the original is that almost dusty freshness mixed with fruit, the original was raspberry where as this has pineapple, which is less of the fruity kind and more of the exterior woody pine and leaves of the pineapple. All in all, its worth having at the price you can probably get it for in the states. But the £40 I paid for it? No, not worth it.",04/04/22 14:18,Baccarat Racquets

Legend Intense Montblanc,"This is absolutely my style. Literally MB Legend but with the volume turned up, particularly the sweet note which I really like in Legend EdT. That red apple note is similar to Coral Fantasy only more fresh less powdery. Or imagine the sharp green and citrus in Fierce replaced with red apple and you get Legend Intense. The musk of this DNA comes through shortly after the opening and it blends with the sweetness well making it extremely casual and wearable while adding a youthful character.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Just an amazing fragrance. A real pity they discontinued it, but that's just what they do with good products, apparently. One of the absolute best men's fragrances of all time, hands down, and not an overstatement. It has been extremely downplayed and gatekept. The scent is best summed up, to me, as a cross between A&F Fierce Intense (another discontinued banger that I urge everyone to buy while you can) and JPG Scandal Absolu. It has that airy, fresh, slightly marine vibe in the air like Fierce (not just the vibe, it does smell very similar), but its sweetness is distinctly similar to Scandal Absolu with a tiny hint of watermelon Jolly Rancher lol. What an incredibly unique and brilliant composition that works so beautifully. Seems to perform pretty dang good by all accounts, too. My skin is pretty dry and I go nose deaf to a lot of things easily, but it is still pretty durable by my standards. This is also an incredibly versatile fragrance for a sweeter scent, for sure. It really is all occasions. If you are a money tree, then don't even think about not buying this if you can find it. I don't even want to say what I payed for 5 bottles. I haven't tried the other Legends (besides Spirit which I do not like particularly), but hopefully the EDP is a worthy alternative to this, because I'm not sure I can advise paying over 150-160usd for a bottle of this unless you love Fierce DNA and are a man of extremely few fragrances and just must have the best. This is one of the best, and ludicrously underrated on here score wise at 4.25. Should be 4.55+. Unfortunately, it would be very hard to sample, but at least if you take the leap to buy it for that cheap, you can resell it for more at least. To be completely honest, I personally prefer Fierce Intense (which I usually layer with normal Fierce) just because I am not the world's biggest fan of the sweeter scents on myself. I like to stay on the slightly fresher side as far as what I wear, and Fierce Intense maintains more of the Fierce DNA throughout and performs well. It is slightly sweet, but not on the fruity side the way Legend Intense is. That's just a personal preference, though. The base of Legend Intense really starts to smell exactly like Scandal Absolu to me, though, in the dry down, which I also love (but a little fruitier, as Ihave said). So awful to see things like this go away, but if anyone knows something that is a dead ringer to this, shoot me a dm.",12/12/24 18:08,ALakota

I also have the regular Legend perfume and I must say it is the same, but richer or darker. I can smell the strenght of the apple and oakmoss (do they use regulated oakmoss or synthetic?) Cardamom plays here very well and supported by tonka bean for that sweet drydown. Projection power is the same with original legend, it can range more than an arms lenght in projection, and it can fill up the scent in an airconditioned room. Staying power is around 6 hours and can stay longer in a much cooler environment.

In my place where it is hot and humid, it crazily projects like it won't quit. I can even smell it wearing a face mask. That's how powerful it is.

Yes I bought it thinking it would be an exact clone performance wise.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"My initial impression on the first wearing is good...but not great. Before I get into it, my 3.4oz bottle was bought second hand, almost full, but without the cap. There's a slight chance it has changed inside the bottle, although I don't think it's old enough for that. Now that that's out of the way:

The review below mine describes the scent well, however, I disagree that this is essential. This feels like the perfumer tried to connect the original Legend to Creed Aventus (not exactly, but in the ballpark). While the original definitely smells just like A&F Fierce, Intense smells much less similar, only slightly so. Imagine a toned down Fierce (basically, the modern formula) with added depth of fruits. This one sits close to the skin, unlike original Legend and Fierce. Reviewers here are raving about compliments, but you would also get similar compliments wearing original Legend. If you're looking for a smoother version of a Fierce clone (which isn't as loud as silver cap Fierce), then Legend Intense would be suitable. But, I don't see this being worth the high prices of a discontinued scent. You'd be better off with a niche frag from PDM or Jo Malone, for example, if you're willing to spend over $100 on this. It goes without saying that Explorer is really solid, comparable to this, and closer to Aventus. There's a reason why Legend, Legend Spirit and Individuel are still around and several other MB scents were discontinued: sales. Legend Intense is a good one, but not too much more than that. I'll update this review if I'm moved by more wearings and inspiration.

Update: After wearing it more, it's the same simple verdict: a richer, less-loud version of Fierce, with a hint of Aventus.",09/28/20 00:51,Eau De Treasure
Legend Intense Montblanc,"It's what its name suggests: a sweeter, denser, stronger version of the original. One of my all-time favorites. I get compliments almost every time I wear it, especially out at night. Great projection and longevity on me. I often say that any man looking to strip down his collection to sure-fire winners could get by with this, Aventus, GIT, Azzaro Pour Homme, Rive Gauche, and Bleu de Chanel Parfum. They meet all of my needs. Everything else in my collection is just for fun and variety.

I wish that Mont Blanc had not decided to discontinue this gem. I suppose they're banking on building out the Explorer line. If the original is any indication, they have a long way to go to make that decision worthwhile.",08/03/20 18:46,Salute1
Legend Intense Montblanc,"A less refined version of Fierce believe it or not. It's not intense by any means and it smells only marginally better than the regular Legend. Department store tonka-amber sweetness over a bed of some ''modern woods''. I don't get any fruit accords in here and frankly I'm surprised somehow pineapple and red apple are listed as the main notes according to others. It smells alright just as a normal ''cologne'' would. Nothing remotely interesting here.

Sits fairly close to the skin and lasts a couple hours. Honestly there are much better options out there. This could be an okay scent for a starter, but unless you're really a fan of the Fierce DNA, this is a pass. And do yourself a favor and don't fall for any outrageous asking prices since it's been discontinued.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"When I smell this I think of a suit, some tall buildings in the middle of New York, the world working. Elegant, classy, fresh and citrus, whiffs of sharpness.

The bottle, metallic, represents what you get. If a Jaguar (the car) could choose a smell, it'd be this one.

Longevity is perfect, around 8 hours, and 3 projecting very good. Too bad this is discontinued, although you can still get it if you look it up.

I love this, and it's my go to along with Oud Wood for elegant occasions.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"TOTAL SURPRISED.

The only reason I bought this was because I heard it had been discontinued and will no longer be available, and also it being similar to Legend but revamped. I was not expecting what I received. Tonight is my first night wearing it after ordering for $40 off eBay. I owned the original Legend for a few months before I ended up selling it, but this one has the Original beat by a long shot. The opening and dry down are amazing! I sprayed it prlly 5 hours ago and I am still getting sting whiffs of it. Great scent, not going to lie.

I give it a solid 8 out of 10. The Price, scent, and longevity are what makes this a keeper in my book.

Legend Intense Montblanc,This is very similar to the original Legend. The difference with this one is the apple note is ramped up and it's a much sweeter fragrance than Legend in my opinion. If Legend was too sweet for you then this might not be for you. For me I really enjoy Intense and it's very noticeable when you're wearing it. I am not sure why this is discontinued. This was a pretty good seller I would say and many people were fans of this. This is good for parties and nights out where as the original Legend is good for dates and all around.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Storytime: the day this fragrance arrived in the mail, I sprayed it on myself and wore it to work that night. Within 15 minutes of being at work one of my female coworkers passed by and suddenly stopped dead in her tracks, turned around and said, ""Somebody's wearing some DAMN good cologne in here!"". Once she found out it was me she wouldn't stop telling me how delicious I smelled.
And I got several other compliments throughout the night!

This delightful masterpiece very closely resembles the original Legend, but it's hella sexier due to the higher concentration of sweetness. The fruity notes are dominantly more prominent in this version and they make the scent feel almost edible... Further adding to the desirablility of the individual who chooses to wear this.

I wouldn't consider this an ""Intense"" version, but more of a ""Juicier"" adaptation. It smells slightly more casual than that of the original Legend, but it's so versatile that you could wear this in almost any circumstance. But despite its sweet and casual atmosphere, it is very refined and dignified; not messy and immaturely composed.

This scent projects a fun and outgoing confidence. Definitely not an introvert kind of smell. This is worn by the guy who is prepared to get noticed by the ladies and is ready for it. The man who carries this smell with him into the room knows that he's the attractive one and isn't afraid to answer for it.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"This is a simple but effective scent for all years round. I don't care about mass appealing as many women I encountered do like this. Its longevity and sillage are excellent. Most perfume does not work well on my skins but this one got 14 hours longevity mark easily with the beast mode for the first 3 hours before became a close aura on skin since 4th hour until the 14th hour. It became skin scent afterward.

Scent : 9.5 / 10 - Simple but compliment getter

Versatility: 10 / 10 - You can use this in almost occasion. Works well in all seasons both day and night.

Longevity: 10 / 10 - Based on my skin and chemistry

Sillage: 10 / 10 - Based on my skin and chemistry

Compliment Getter: 9 / 10 - Most women do like this regardless their ages.

Value for a price: 10 / 10 - I have seen many comments said this one is overpriced or too expensive for the scent they offer. I do partly agree that it could be cheaper. However, since the value it provided do justify the price itself then I think it's worth pretty much.

Overall: 9.8 / 10 - This might be the best compliment getter I ever got. It has a higher rating from girls around me over Creed Aventus or Chanel Bleu. It has the same performance in compliments getter similar to Chanel Allure Eau Extreme.",01/06/19 02:13,long.bi

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Though my tastes in fragrances have evolved to more daring, less mass-appealing niche frags since I’ve started a couple of years ago, i still got to have this one in my collection and wear it regularly.
It’s a very good “dumb” reach... yes, the apple/pineapple notes are a bit too synthetic. But it could be worse and headache-inducing (hello, Dior Sauvage), but the overall smell AND the performance is fantastic!
It reminds me a bit of Bond n 9 Scent Of Peace for him at times. Not that they smell the same, but they’re family. It might a bit too youthful and not really complex to the trained nose, but it does the job : it smells good, it lasts, it projects and has sillage... for the price I think is a very good product. And the ladies love it lol... not that I wear them to impress the opposite sex, but I get random compliments every now and then (this might be in my top 5 most complimented fragrances). The sweetness of the fruity-vanillic fragrance is really loved by the women around me, mrs Moonchild especially :)
Compared to other pineapple scents, it’s not as good or quality as Aventus, it is the same ballpark as Scent Of peace for him (just lacking the more upscale quality... but it could as well be a flanker) and IMHO it is better than Sauvage in any category.
If you don’t like sweet fragrances à la One Million or Invictus, you might avoid it., if you do, this belongs in your wardrobe.
Scent 8/10 - not the most sophisticated, a bit too sweet to some, you can not like it, but you can’t say it’s a bad perfume. Juvenile at times? Yes. Bad smelling? No.
Longevity 8/10 - no powerhouse, but close enough. Last 8+ hours on me. And far from being a skin scent.
Projection 9/10 - it builts a fragrance bubble around you. It can be smelled up to 3-4h 4-5 feet away. Fills up a room within the first hour.
Sillage 9/10 - nice scent trail for 2 to 3 hours. A head turner.

Overall 8,5/10. BUT I’m afraid there are bad news ... I haven’t seen Legend Intense recently in our local Sephoras and the like for the past couple of weeks.. is it being discontinued? Reformulated? Who knows.

Edit : I’ve just read some reviews complaining about the performance... that’s weird to me. Maybe a reformulation? Or confusion with the original Legend? It’s is actually one of my best performing designer scents!",09/21/18 03:55,Moonchild1985
Legend Intense Montblanc,"When I first started my frag collection this would have been wow, I must have it, it's so so good. And it is good but... it is simple and ordinary. it falls into that category of mediocre frags that smells extremely nice but there are better ones that smell similar but do the better job. It is why I never got it. It has this beautiful fruity vibe that is youthful more than anything. Like the best ever quality axe for high scooler, even for a young man in college who is relaxed and calm, doesn't jump out, doesn't drink, isn't cocky but not nerd either. just a simple guy who works hard and is always fun to be around.

If you are a person like this... this frag hits the nail on the head for you. very casual, doesn't require any specific dress code. You can rock it in white shirt or t shirt and jeans. You will smell good. Net exceptionally good but very good and others will notice it.

It is perfect for those transitioning from body sprays or starting their fragrance collection. Not so expensive but very very nice smell that no one will dislike but no one will be madly in love with it either.",09/18/18 13:13,simpa256
Legend Intense Montblanc,"For me, a quinessential all seasons any time of day dumb reach, along with Coach for Men and Armani Acqua Di Gio Profumo. Far and away better than the original. Not sure if I got a bad batch, but I couldn't really pick up on the fruits in the original, only spices and alcohol. This one though, ooooh buddy.

Intense is a cardamom bomb up top, with the pineapple and jasmine giving it a spicy floral accord. After about an hour or so, it dries down to a warm apple with wisps of cardamom and a powdery amber. I get very little woods until it dries down completely (2 hour mark) and then the cedar really shines through. Lasts for about 6 hours after that as it gradually becomes a skin scent. Reminds me kind of like Rocky Mountain He Wood by DeSquared at the base but less peppery.

If you love cardamom and spicy woody frags, you will really dig it like I do. I can see why some say it reminds them of soap or shampoo, but the cardamom and woods really pulls this together.

Good potency, decent projection, longevity, and sillage. Would recommend as a beginner fragrance for men who fancy scents that aren't too generic.",09/18/18 12:50,sharpnickelz
Legend Intense Montblanc,"I wore this again today as it was finally much cooler weather where I live (around 20 Celsius).

Sprayed on the creases inside of elbows, and on my neck & chest. I got around 8 or 9 hours longevity (sniffing arms now and it's pretty much gone), it was a much closer scent for the last few hours. I think spraying under the shirt on chest is good as the scent stays on my clothes longer than skin. Still very decent performance imo and a fantastic scent.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"I've owned this for a few months, gave it a first proper wearing today since the brutal heatwave has subsided here in France. I have been wearing the fantastic Legend Spirit on some warmer days this summer too.

Intense is closer to the original of which I have a sample than to Spirit for sure, all three of them are superb. I'm still undecided on Legend Night though but what an excellent fragrance line this is so far, real top quality from Montblanc including the fantastic bottles!

For me the red apple note really stands out here and although I'm not usually the biggest fan of apple notes (perhaps sometimes with cinnamon in a seasonal frag though) I really like it here, it's perfectly blended with the other notes to create something special in my opinion, it definitely seems a reworking of Legend rather than the exact same scent intensified.

Of the three Legend frags I have this is the sweetest, most fruity and least 'fresh' but it is not cloying or heavy, performance is above average without being beast mode, decent longevity too. This is a versatile scent that could easily be signature scent worthy. This stuff oozes quality that would make many far more expensive fragrance houses blush.",08/14/18 10:46,TrephineArtist
Legend Intense Montblanc,"I like this on its own and have received many compliments on the scent when I've worn it outside and indoors. It does have a sporty/fruity vibe until the dry-down. I recently purchased BBW Teakwood shower gel and body cream for men over the weekend and noticed someone mention on here that the two scents were similar, I hadn't even thought about it. So this morning I decided to combine use all three and MAAAAAAAAAN was that a good idea!!!! The base of teakwood balances the fruity notes in the cologne and it blends very nice. With about 2 baby sprays on my body after the shower gel and cream, the projection is phenomenal.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"So I’ve really liked this fragrance for a while now and had a sample a few years back but just recently got this for Christmas and am really happy it’s finally in my collection !

I really like this scent but for some reason I can’t quite say I love this and rank it among some of my favorites. It’s still damn good though !

This has a very pleasant opening that is a very smooth,slightly sweet opening that contains a very nice apple note and also a nice pineapple note as well. Once this dries down the sweetness subsided and this scent becomes more smooth but also a little more spicy but nothing even remotely off putting. The smoothness this contains I could swear there’s Suede in this but I don’t see this in the note breakdown.

In a nutshell this a super pleasant smell that’s suitable all year long and for pretty much any occasion. And yes this is similar to Fierce ! I would say this a less synthetic,less aggressive and more grown up version of Fierce and even get that comparison to Platinum Egoist as well ! Also in my opinion out of all the Fierce smell alikes this is my favorite with Playboy New York being a very close 2nd.

Performance on this is above average ! It lasts 5-8 hours and projects well for 30 minutes but then leaves a nice scent bubble around you for the duration of the scent life. This also leaves nice Sillage.

Compliments for this are great ! I only wore this for a full wearing today but a client complimented me and also my gf complimented me as well as soon as she got in the door. ( and she yelled at me for wearing Dark Rebel and Dylan Blue the day before so this was a nice change) so I see this being a very good compliment getter :)

Overall rating— 8 out of 10 ! This could be someone’s signature if you only wanted to use 1 cologne and I like this as it’s pleasant but to my nose it’s not much more. But man, this stuff smells so good the compliments you will receive will make it worth it !!!

Sidenote: I Love the apple note and drydown in this fragrance !!!",12/29/17 13:39,Ryanmmas26
Legend Intense Montblanc,"I wore Chanel Egoiste Platinum for 10 years before they reformulated it. It was so versatile; I wore it to work, to dates, to events, to bars...you name it and I all I ever received were compliments after compliments.

When I stumbled upon Montblanc Legend I was ecstatic, but only to find out later that while it smelled really similar to Platinum Egoiste, the projection paled in comparison. The reviews on here scared me away from exchanging Legend to Legend Intense because Legend Intense sounded like it was too fruity and often compared to Axe body spray. Oh how they were wrong!

This is in fact, just a much stronger version of the original. The oakmoss, lavender, pineapple and silver/metallic notes are still there but now it actually stays present for 6 or more hours and projects well!

So if you’re trying to decide which version to get, there’s no question Intense is far superior and actually smells more similar to Platinum Egoiste, only better now!",12/14/17 19:21,Knows2Nose

Legend Intense Montblanc,"I am enjoying Mont Blanc Legend Intense today, for the first time. From the first moment I loved it but was also struck by a familiarity I couldn't quite place. Then it came to me and at the risk of huge disapproval at the suggestion...does anyone else feel this has more than a passing resemblance to David Beckham's The Essence?

I know, I know.....say what? But really I think the two are similar. MBLI has a spice mix that puts it firmly Autumn/Winter whereas the fresher spicing in DBTE is more Spring/Summer (mild Autumn, at a push).

What do you guys think?",11/29/17 12:33,NiceNiffs
Legend Intense Montblanc,"Very safe and versatile fragrance.

Not special but Masculine and pleasant (also complement getter)

For summer, winter, Casual or formal.

No lavender or barbershop feeling/cleannes like the orignal legend (although it has exactly the same vibe) yet, it has plenty of fruits for freshness while it is very thick juice with a heavy dose of tonka, amber and a touch of cardamom to keep it serious.

Projection is above average But not great while longevity is very solid.

Super cheap online.",11/28/17 12:19,Tazahr
Legend Intense Montblanc,"MONTBLANC LEGEND:

Delicious (I love the pineapple vibe in this). Very well blended. Good performance. Versatile (for all seasons). Possibly not as mature as others (very pleasing but others are more serious / classy).

It reminds me a lot of Bentley Azure (Legend being slightly stronger perhaps).

Highly recommended.

MONTBLANC LEGEND INTENSE:

Many designer houses launch ""Intense"" versions of some of their creations but what they actually do is changing some ingredients and therefore reformulating the original, what results not in an ""Intense"" version but in a DIFFERENT fragrance which should be actually relabled with a different name or at least as a different flanker, but NOT naming it as ""Xxxxxxx Intense"" because it's NOT ""Xxxxxxx"" any more.

In this case, however, what I get here is EXACTLY an Intense version of the original Legend and, in my opinion, a MUCH BETTER flanker. It's just that, a fuller / denser / more intense Legend.

This fragrance is gorgeous! Exquisite! Believe me!",11/02/17 05:42,mauriciolacruz
Legend Intense Montblanc,"Tiny bit synthetic up top in the pineapple/apple notes. A deep, well-projecting scent that is very reminiscent of A&F Fierce. Sweet, woody, dense. Slightly youthful (likely an association due to the Fierce similarity).

I get 5-7 hours on my skin with maybe 2 hours of decent projection.

This gets complimented a lot. Women like Fierce. They like this. End of story.

Good for college and younger (under 30) men. Could be a bit childish for older guys due to the Fierce/A&F connotation.

A 7.0/10 for me. Worth seeking out if you're younger and want something super similar to Fierce but just different enough and under $35.",10/10/17 07:32,maxpowerboston

Legend Intense Montblanc,"My gf was looking for a father's day gift for her dad, so I offered her my bottle of Legend since I don't use it often, and he previously mentioned that he enjoyed the smell.

The funny thing is, that once he sprayed it on in front of her, it reawakened her affinity for the scent and she immediately ordered me to repurchase it. LoL. Darn.

As a compromise, we stopped by at Sephora and I said that I would let her choose her favourite men's frag out of everything they had, and that I would pick it up that day. Secretly, I was just trying to avoid buying Legend again. But can you guess what she chose??? Yeah. Legend Intense. Ugh.

Tom Ford, Hermes, Atelier, Dior, and she chose a Legend flanker. Ok. Well, just to have an objective opinion, I sprayed a test strip with Legend Intense, and another with the 2011 formulation of La Nuit - a stunner to be sure - and politely approached an SA at Sephora with the question, ""On a guy, would you prefer this one, or this one?""

A moment later, she replies - this one. Legend Intense. Hmmmmm. Ok. I thanked her for her opinion and walked over to the other side of the store and asked a slightly more attractive SA. This one, or this one? The answer came even faster - this one. Legend Intense.

At that moment, I think my eyebrows disappeared into my hairline because she gave me a quizzical look. On the outside, I was aware of myself smiling and giggling, but on the inside I was melting. Devastated. Three girls had just destroyed my self-righteous illusion.

But WHY Legend Intense?, I asked. The response - it's fresher and less spicy. She also asked me if it was Legend. I told her it was Legend Intense and she smiled. Yeah. Apparently EVERY girl in the store knows about Legend and loves it. Ahhhh, to be YOUNG again...

So that's it. I can't argue with the results. I came up with a cunning plan to get rid of my bottle of Legend, and ended up buying its much sweeter brother. True, I've grown to appreciate the scent a little more over the past few months, but I still wouldn't take it over something like Ultra Male or even Lacoste Style in Play - both fruity and both enjoyable.

Whatever. Women love it, and so it has a place in my collection. A dumb reach if nothing else. And in this case, I'll quote CoachRob619 - ""Depending on what the ladies say, determines what I spray."" Peace.",06/18/17 15:07,MrHonest

Legend Intense Montblanc,"As this fragrance came out about four years ago, it raises the question; is it too early for montblanc to have reformulated it?
The reason I ask is simple. I have sampled legend intense on several occasions, and had planned to purchase a bottle at some point.
This spring I had decided to go ahead and add it to my (small) collection.

Well to my surprise, upon trying the tester one last time before taking the plunge, I found it smells nothing like I remember!
Thinking the tester might be 'off' I checked the tester at another store with the same result.

While I have no idea what happened since I originally tried this, there is no way this is the same as before. The formulation in these testers has absolutely no presence and lasts about ten minutes. I wish I was kidding, but I'm not.
Not only that but the fragrance I remembered as a striking, well blended masculine scent smells more like (how should I describe it?) 7up....?
What happened?

I'm hoping both testers were old or defective, but for now

If you have worn YSL Perfume Intense or Bvlgari PH Soir, this belongs to that category of strong performance. Very nice smell which is so invigorating. It is definitely best during colder months.
This is another fruity and floral combo explosion perfume. Pineapple, jasmine, cardamom etc. notes are identifiable. I love the opening note which smells so fresh and so natural. A great buy and one can never get disappointed.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"So after buying a small sample of MB Ledgend and really enjoying that scent, I figured I would blind buy the ""intense"" version to see how that goes.

These 2 smell really, really, really close. I can barely pick out the difference between the 2, and I'm writing this as I have sprayed each one my wrists to smell the difference, and 1 hour has passed. Intense is a tad bit stronger, but not enough of a difference to have someone buy both of theses bottles. If you already have The original Legend, I would pass on buying the intense version. But if you are torn between these 2 bottles and don't know which one to get, grab the Intese version.

If you enjoy the original Legend scent, but just wish you can squeeze out maybe 2 more hours of longevity from it....that's where the Intense version comes in.

The smell - super syrupy sweet, yet slightly fresh. Almost candy-like. I can see this being a well rounded frag suitable for all seasons and all occasions. However I would lean forwards more of a date night scent or going out at night scent, mostly due to its very sweet and playful in nature.",01/23/17 20:09,Bkkorn
Legend Intense Montblanc,"Listed after the category of ""blind buy"" there should be, perhaps, the ""wife buy."" Except that the risks inherent in the additional category are multiplied and, how shall I say it, intensely nuanced.

I had sampled this fragrance numerous times yet there I stood at the shelf, staring at it once again. ""It has a pineapple and red apple scent to it that I'm not that craz...."" ""That sounds great,"" she said, taking a box of it to the counter.

Now, to be fair: it's an act of unselfish love, isn't it?. I mean, her buying it for me, not only my occassionally wearing it.

In any case, the anecdote speaks to the heart of my review: 1) powerful high notes of pineapple and red apple. Powerful. 2) Wonderful projection on those notes. They last, often even through the commute. 3) Women seem to love this frgrance. As in, absolutely. So, compliments, even after the commute.

That's about it though, for me. If I wasn't clear on this point before (and apparently, I never have been), I'm not crazy about the pineapple/red apple opening.

The notes that follow are great but for whatever reason, on me, they dont project at all and barely last. So, that makes them merely ""good,"" in my book.

I generally like sweet and I typically love a strong scent. The combination here, however, doesnt work for me. It may very well be the case that this ""Intense"" never stood a chance with me as compared to the original Legend.

My wife's interest in my fragrance purchases has since developed into her own. She has become far more familiar with, and expert at, fragrance s in general, her own and mine. She would never dream, now, of buying me a fragrance I hadnt fully tested yet, would she? Of course she would, and does.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Word.

So eventhough I mentioned (like everyone) that this smells exactly like Apollo, I finally decided to grow a pair and get myself a sample ANYWAY, just so I could make a more objective assessment of this frag.

After all, my gf convinced me to get a bottle of Legend despite my initial objections, and that worked out alright. PS - I still don't care too much for the smell, but people seem to like me more when I wear it, so TS.

To preface this, I finally got rid of all my Axe Deo sprays last year to cut down on aerosols, but I DID manage to hang onto one - my favourite. Can you guess which one? Yeah.

So here we go - off the top it's sweet, fruity and creamy. Pineapple - unmistakable. (Phony) apple - yep. Tonka - yes sir. Pleasant - yes. Creamy stuff.
And then what's left of the alcohol disappears and we start to get sweeter and sweeter...and sweeter...

And then after about an hour, that sweetness hits a crescendo, only to hang on for the duration of the scent. And for me, that's the deal-breaker. It's just too sickeningly sweet. Maybe it's the synthetic-ness of the sweetness, I don't know, but to me, it's nauseating. Dan (MyMickers) was right on. I could only wear this twice before it made me feel...well...dizzy.

A side-by-side with the original Legend CLEARLY reveals Legend to be the ""hollow"" predecessor of Legend Intense. The base is still there in ""Intense"", but the sweetness and (rich) fruitiness is cranked up to 11. And THAT's why I prefer the original. It's tamer, it's lamer, but it makes me less sick. And since I'm the one who gets to smells ME most often, I'll pass on this one.

So there you have it - believe the reviews - it's really a denser, richer, and sweeter version of Apollo (which is a pleasant enough frag) but it's just way too... And BTW, 5/5 women I asked about Legend Intense also prefer the original Legend. Heck, it's cheaper too.

Plus, it smells vaguely similar to Playboy New York, which is not only much cheaper but also lasts quite a bit longer. Maybe the Playboy fragrance is worth picking up if you like this smell and you don't mind it not smelling exactly the same as Legend Intense, even if it definitely has similarities.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"This is very good indeed. A classy scent that's very fruity and pretty sweet - the pineapple, red apple and tonka are in your face. I find it to be quite linear and both projection and longevity could be better which is surprising really given its ""intense"" moniker, lasting perhaps 3 to 4 hours on me despite heavy spraying. What I love about it though is its versatility. There are very few places or occasions where it would be out of place. It's suitable for year-round use, and also makes for an especially good and uplifting work fragrance. Good for going out too, with its moderate touch of sensuality that women in particular seem to love. I've always felt most comfortable wearing it with a red or pink shirt, although it would go with almost any shade of attire and I think the gun metal bottle gives this away. What a bottle & lid by the way (!) heavy, classy, understated. Overall, we're on to a winner here (despite its mildly disappointing performance). Highly recommended.",09/05/16 15:22,iconoclast

Well, this fragrance gives you that wow-type of impression. It is like a more aquatic Liz Claiborne Curve, and like a less complex but more deep, A&F Fierce. It smells like someone is making Candy Apples in an Abercrombie and Fitch store. The only caveat is, I go heavy on the trigger, because of longevity issues. Other than that, I really enjoy the class and confidence, of this scent.",05/24/16 13:28,MyCoh_JayRo

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Special and sensual fragrance!
Pineapple overtones, middle aromatic and slightly sweet oriental mossy base ...
Very complex products and ingredients are brilliant!
For me, the atmosphere is similar to the Jil Sander Man (black cube) and lack of smokiness ....
So another great creation which is my favorite and I love!
Although not among the cheap goods, but very high quality and worth it!

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Montblanc Legend Intense Review:

This fragrance opens up with a very pleasant pineapple note. It then leads into a mid that's dominated by a spicy red apple smell. This is all held together by a soft tonka bean note in the base. Despite the fact that the notes are completely different, this does smell very similar to Fierce by Abercrombie & Fitch. So much so that if you own one, you probably wouldn't care to own the other. I personally like the way this one achieves it smell a little bit better. It's a sweeter, less in your face take on the Fierce scent we all know.

This is a pretty well-rounded and inoffensive scent that doesn't really seem all that ""Intense"" to me. This works much better as a casual fragrance that you can wear without having to give it much thought. That's not a negative. After all, there are probably times when all of us want something a bit lighter to wear. It's just something you should know going in. I think this one will appeal mostly to those of you in your 20's, who are looking for a versatile and easy to like fragrance.

If you're looking for an upgrade from the Fierce smell, I would definitely check out Platinum Egoiste by Chanel. It achieves the masculine smell these fragrances go for, but it accomplishes it with a much classier approach. Still, Legend Intense is a solid fragrance that I'm happy to have in my collection.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"I love a good summer fragrance, and I have a number of them. I am fond of all of bulgari aqua fragrances, aqua di gio will always be in my arsenal (no matter how dated or played out many feel it is), and I absolutely love both bleu de chanel fragrances.
I passed on mont blanc legend because I felt platinum egoiste did the same thing but better. Fast forward to this summer, I was at the mall, saw the legend intense flanker, and sprayed some on expecting a strong, wintery fragrance that would be ill- suited for the heat.
I was totally wrong. Intense is absolutely sweetened up, but I was expecting it to be tonka bean, not a fruity pineapple/apple combination. The sweetened top notes give this a luxurious feel combined with the legend backbone and longevity is superb. Wearing this makes me feel classy,and is a perfect summer scent for someone who wants something more than citrus, florals and musk. So incredibly versatile this can be worn with a suit, a polo, at the beach, at a club, on a date, you name it.
I'll leave you with this: Four hours after putting legend intense on, I got my hair cut. When I went to pay, a group of four women of various ages stopped what they were doing to smell me and ask me what I was wearing, the one girl asking where exactly where whe could purchase it for her boyfriend. I do not wear fragrances for women's attention (happily married) but when a room full of women stop traffic to compliment you, you've got something special on your hands.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Effectively, original legend with sweetened tonka added - a pretty standard formula for 'intense' style flankers these days, but it actually works pretty well. The sweetness makes the fruit notes jump out more, although I don't really get a distinct pineapple note (and never did with the original), and gives it stronger performance. That said, it also changes the nature of this from the original. While it is quite close, this doesn't have the same airy feel which is what I like about the original. This moves in the direction of an oriental to me, and therefore fits another niche. All that said, I feel like owning one makes the other redundant - go figure.",05/06/15 23:14,grug

Legend Intense Montblanc,"I figured I'd add my thoughts of ""Legend Intense"" more as a warning for people. I'm guessing many of you found your way to this fragrance because of its similarities to ""A&F Fierce"". As many have said, yes, ""Legend"" does strongly resemble ""Fierce"", but I believe at a significant cost.

This fragrance is MUCH more synthetic smelling than ""Fierce"", or at least A&F's current offering of it. The synthetic smell isn't only found in the opening, but throughout the entire life of the fragrance.

My favorite aspect of ""Fierce"" is the dry-down. I like to smell it at close range on a shirt or on my hand. It is absolutely fantastic. But with ""Legend Intense"", it definitely isn't the same.

I've noticed fragrances that project louder typically have more of a synthetic aspect to them. Maybe this is why it is so prevalent with ""Legend Intense"". I can easily tell that in regards to projection, ""Legend Intense"" will outperform ""Fierce"". I'm also guessing that someone who smells ""Legend"" from a distance won't receive much of the synthetic aspects, and also believe it is ""Fierce"".

Just bear in mind; I still think on scent alone ""Fierce"" beats out ""Legend"" by a mile. It just has a higher quality vibe, and is much more sexy. However, I've also gained a lower tolerance for synthetics as I've expanded my collection.

I bought this as a cheaper, better performing version of ""Fierce"". Unfortunately, it only gets halfway there. The scent is inferior, but the projection is better.",03/17/15 23:25,Epley_MPLS
Legend Intense Montblanc,"Finally made a blind buy on MBLI and for me, this is probably the best over-all fragrance in my collection. The pineapple top notes are wonderful and remind me of Aventus, just not as smoky. In the dry down the other notes above come into play.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"A lot of similarities to the Fierce, Legend 'OG, Skulls and Roses scent, but to my nose, top of the batch. There was always something air freshnery about Fierce which burned my insides and my eyes. This to me is a great fragrance which has become my go to for everything since xmas. It was between this, the original and skulls and roses. For projection, skulls took it over by a long shot, but possibly for chemical and synthetic reasons. I don't necessarily want to smell myself all day, I like wearing a scent that I have to try and identify 3 hours later.
With one spray of this on the lower chest and upper back, I am good all day.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"i'm going to disagree with review below in regards to the statement ""absolutely not for young people, better for elegant situations and for 30 and older.""

This scent is very versatile. It is the perfect scent for any situation IMO. Young guns can wear this and compared to AF's Fierce, Legend Intense would fit the older crowd better. Legend Intense is very similar to Fierce but more refined. I feel as though it's cost to quality ratio is better than Fierce. I get stellar projection and longevity. The price is nice as well on sites like fragrancenet.com. No doubt, some people will assume you're wearing Fierce but anyone who knows the scent will tell you Legend Intense is better. I know Fierce very well as I was in high school when AF launched Fierce and EVERYONE had a bottle. I can't name anyone I know personally who didn't have a bottle then. We'd go to dances or parties & it'd be a Fierce induced smog haze engulfing the room. Do yourself a favor and get the frag one cut above.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"Playfulness and masculinity. Not only has this fragrance managed to balance the two, it does both exceptionally well while many others have failed to strike the right balance. Its ephemeral opening exudes a very fresh and playful tonka/apple/pineapple trio. The dry down introduces a strong sense of masculinity with the smell of an ashy fire. This is not the fire pit kids at camp would throw styrofoam cups into smell. Think of yourself sitting in front of a fireplace with a relative smoking a cherry cigar next to you. The drydown, as great as it is, does not project very far, and sadly becomes a skin scent after 2-4 hours.

So how does this compare to the original Legend? This one is certainly more pronounced, but not really any better of a performer. The smell is not the same IMO. This one takes some time to get used to if you've used Legend for a long time. Despite that, this is the better smelling one because it's more dynamic, more pronounced, and well blended. If the opening lasted longer, I'd give the smell a 9.5/10.

I am pleased to say I was able to find a new tester for about $20 on eBay. That is an absolute steal, and I'm sure there are others on there in the same ballpark. This thing could cost $75 and it would still be worth it.

Legend Intense Montblanc,"I've personally never smelled AF, but the first thing my female coworker said when I walked in to the office this morning was ""Abercrombie?"".

This thing is powerful for the first half hour, but subsides into the sweet/woody tones. I'm sitting in a meeting right now and enjoying the sweet smell. The woody smell is very apparent when smelling the skin directly.

The whole duality does make sense, powerful yet understated. I'd feel happy wearing this, but would rather go for something that is immediately unique and not confused with a more generic smell.",12/19/14 13:46,panamamaverick

So the next day, I went out and bought it, and I immediately thought ""this is the best decision I've ever made."" I've been wearing it for a little over a week, and it draws compliments from anyone and everyone, but especially women. It's sweet, yet rugged, gentle, but in your face.

Yeah, I get the A&F vibe but I think Mont Blanc improved upon that base by a country mile. This is smooth and sweet in a non offensive way. I honestly like this more than I thought I would after seeing it compared to Fierce.

The pineapple rules this and I think that's one of the key factors that sets it apart from Fierce and makes it it's own thing. I may get back on with an update on longevity but for now I know the projection is safe on my skin, YMMV. It isn't a beast like Fierce by any means, IMO, but you may want to give it a test drive before you take my bias on it.

The disappointment came later, as I quickly learned that it does not last long on many people.

Sillage and longevity are both good for me which is a must for anything that I add to my collection but I am just not excited about the scent itself. My favorite part is the opening which is a nice blase of pineapple. However, this dies down much too fast and it softens into more of a lavender vibe very similar to it's predecessor MB Legend which is weird because lavender is not even listed on the notes here (perhaps inaccurately?). I wish the pineapple would persist longer. That surely would tip this to my ""want"" list. All in all not a bad fragrance though.",04/14/14 16:50,Raidersteveo

Legend Intense Montblanc,"I sampled this at the mall with sprays onto a card (not onto my skin). I was also contemplating buying Chanel Platinum Egoiste. There is definitely a resemblance to Platinum Egoiste in some of the notes. I also smell a resemblance to Curve for Men. However, there is a third scent that I also get from this. It is an intense artifically fresh smell exactly like the smell of carpet deodorizing powder,... the kind that you sprinkle on the rug and then vacuum back up.

I don't dislike the scent and it does smell fresh and potent. I decided to buy the Chanel, since it seemed far more airy and natural. But, I will consider Mont Blanc Legend Intense again for a future buy. I just don't know if I could stomach smelling the intense carpet deodorizer aspect over long periods of time.

At the shop however I sprayed Legend and Legend Intese one on each wrist and continued shopping for other things for about 2 hours. Legend is already a great scent but Legend intese just developed to a so much rounder, smoother and more sophisticated scent. Yet it is fuity and can be worn in summer as well. Office and/or casual: no problem! So I ended up buying Intense and I am happy with it. Two sprays last easily 10+ hours on my skin and project for about 4~6 hours.

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"This smells like the dry down of Bentley for Men Intense, but with a little better quality, this is not a dig at the Bentley, it is still fantastic, rather it's what I get from this fragrance. I do like it, it's formal occasion fall and winter, day or night, but it's not sensual or romantic, just classy. The woods that you get in the Bentley are accentuated with some earthy patchouli, with a tiny hint of that chocolate that we associate with Patchouli, but just a hint of it. There is no intense vanilla, but just enough to create that particular patchouli sweetness that comes in the dry down. The majority is woods, a combination of cedar, vetiver, and sandalwood, the latter being the backbone of the woody accord.

They say we wear the scent for it's dry down, and true to that expression the dry down is the nicer part of this fragrance. Wear it before you leave the house, and it will be at its best when you get to your destination.

Longevity is great, and when it dries down, it will not overpower anyone, unless you go heavy on the trigger. Again, it's good, but not the best patchouli out there. My favorite is still Patchouli Leaves from Montale followed by Psychedelic from Jovoy.

One last thing, I can only imagine this one worn with a tweed brown jacket, herringbone preferably, but that's me.

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"Montblanc Patchouli Ink is a refined, woody-herbal fragrance with a natural, slightly earthy character. It opens fresh and green, avoiding the typical citrus-woody route. The patchouli is clean and well-blended, giving it a grounded, professional feel.

It reminds me of Bentley for Men Absolute, though Patchouli Ink is more transparent and less resinous. Both share that dry, woody elegance, but Montblanc’s take is more subtle and office-friendly.

Verdict:
A distinctive, well-composed scent that stands apart without being loud. Worth a try if you enjoy understated elegance.
I would not repurchase as Bentley is preferred from my end.

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"Where did Fragrantica find that bergamot is a top note in this? Their website makes no mention of bergamot and I don't smell it at all. Patchouli, vanilla and white musk are all that's mentioned.

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"Warm & smokey vanilla/patchouli with a splash of ink. Far less challenging than I anticipated, given the name. If you were looking at this specifically for the ""ink"" note, I'd keep looking. That being said, it's very pleasant.

Definitely agree with the comparison to Le Labo's Patchouli 24. This has a very similar feel, but far easier to wear. It's more subtle & refined.",05/18/25 02:12,Lauren_Trouble

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"I get a very smokey gaiac wood/incensey note on the opening. This note eventually dies down in an hour, but I think it combines badly with the sour aspects of the patchouli and bergamot. Takes the focus away from the patch-vanilla combo, not the execution I was hoping for but interesting none the less.

The whole line is done amazing for designer fragrances, I like how natural materials, or at least a super close approximation, are combined with synthetics. Will definitely return to this.",01/28/25 07:56,egor
Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"What a turn around. The unpleasant notes faded after a time and I am left with an Oud for greatness, BR540, patchouli conglomeration. Not too shabby. Plays it a little close to the skin but all in all 👍

I do not like this at all. Spice and patchouli ok sounds good. But the ink. It is like a wet woolen blanket tossed over the whole composition smothering an otherwise middling at best fragrance. There is a metallic edge to this. Reminds me of Quinton Bisch’s work, which I also don’t like. There is also a sour note. Was the scent profile determined by a bunch of chimpanzees throwing darts at posted notes? Because that is what it smells like.",01/21/25 11:19,Tuberculosis Oxcart

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"Patchouli Ink | Montblanc

It’s very simple and easy to describe. A straightforward composition, yet well-executed, with an artistic and exotic appeal.

There are no significant developments; just a subtle change in the intensity of the notes over time.

At first, the ink note is intense, presenting an absolutely dark tone, slightly metallic with a leathery, plastic-like texture. This ink note blends with dried fruits (apricots, peaches, dates...), creating an aged fruity accord reminiscent of dehydrated fruits. In the background, there’s a creamy, chocolaty patchouli—a bittersweet chocolate with low sweetness borrowed from vanilla.

In my experience, the ink note is the protagonist, standing out from the beginning and lasting throughout the fragrance, though it gradually loses intensity as hours pass. The chocolaty aspect of the patchouli becomes more prominent as the ink note fades, but they always remain intertwined and in perfect harmony.

In summary:
A dark leathery ink scent covered by the creamy, chocolaty smoothness of patchouli.

The ink note has a dark/black tone but isn’t sweet, resinous, or balsamic. It’s of high quality and unlike anything I’ve encountered. The patchouli has creamy, buttery characteristics that closely resemble bitter chocolate with almost no sweetness.

I haven’t smelled Tuxedo for comparison purposes.

""I created an architectural fragrance built around a short formula. A unique signature written with iconic patchouli and a rare olfactory accord: ink.""
– Fabrice Pellegrin, perfumer

Exotic, mysterious, linear, photorealistic, and of exceptional quality.

Longevity: Long-lasting
Projection: Intimate

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"From my first impressions on this scent, it was definitely my favorite in the collection and an instant love. I remember trying le labo's patchouli but can't comprehend the comparison because I remember not liking it as much as a patchouli scent. Definitely needs a revisit.

Not sure if the note breakdown is accurate but I definitely smell a lot more going on. A very pleasant and alluring patchouli scent and priced reasonably considering the scent's unique traits and being a 120 ml bottle. It's a really solid scent considering the brand's uninspiring releases over the past years. This should be the direction taken by every other designer brand out there.",12/27/24 04:33,mihuco1217

I recommend this for people of all genders who’d like a super wearable vanilla patchouli that also happens to be a great people-pleaser if that at all matters. You can’t overspray, and get plenty on your clothes if you’d like for it to linger around all day. Suggest a re-spray after 6 hours.

This scent has me considering buying a worthy Mont Blanc pen. This scent is appropriate when closing deals. After you throw on the business suit, and put on your shiniest hard bottoms, grab that Mont Blanc pen to seal the deal and spray on Patchouli Ink to complete the vibe.

Patchouli Ink Montblanc,"Ink, patchouli and a hint of vanilla. I can definitely see the resemblance to the Tuxedo scent profile, but the ink dominates and takes it to a different direction - sharp and slightly metallic, turning woody in the late dry-down. Despite, or maybe because of, the ink it feels drier.

Projection is quite poor unfortunately. I used around 10 sprays this morning, and after being hugged I was told that the fragrance I'm wearing is quite faint, so I would say Patchouli Ink is intimate. Let's see in a few months. It isn't unique but still is worth trying. Not blind-buy worthy.

Legend Blue Montblanc,Impossible for me to dislike this. I’m a huge sucker for blue fragrances. Maybe I’m turning into an old fart but I just can’t get behind modern men’s fragrances having so many sweet accords. Maybe it’s because you can only use scents like those on a date night? And then you have fragrances like legend blue. A scent that I want to say is a “standard” of daytime activity colognes. Woody with some herbal notes thrown in. That “shower gel” smell. Can’t go wrong. Can wear it day and night summer or winter. Longevity of this juice leaves some to be desired but it smells great.,09/05/25 04:35,Poopundertones

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Percvial and Legend Blue are in the same DNA family. You can't deny that Percival is more complex and smells a tad bit higher quality BUT I honestly enjoy Legend Blue more. The opening is a lot more fresh and shower gel like (in a good way) and Percival is much more mature and old school. Drydown is a tie for me with LBs cedar and ambroxan taking center stage vs Percival retaining more notes overall. But Percival just has those fougere notes (florals and fir?) that are a bit too dated and very slightly off-putting to my nose.

Biggest dealbreaker is the price. You can buy ~5 bottles of Legend Blue or 1 bottle of Percival. I don't mind paying a premium ($200 is usually my ceiling on what I'd comfortably pay) but for that price, I guess would have preferred PDM take the DNA somewhere more modern and exciting.

I know some people want something much more unique, or niche, and I get that - I do too sometimes.

This is a very good idea for a blind buy in my opinion since it has some very enjoyable notes that are usually liked by many. At the starting notes I smelled a lot of wood, ambroxan, and some floral notes. This doesn't max out on the ambroxan too much, unlike Dior Sauvage.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Montblanc Legend Blue does little to stand out. It gets lost in the endless sea of blue fragrances flooding the market. It's not offensive or poorly made—just unoriginal and redundant. And yes, I’m channeling some frustration here, because for a fragrance released in 2024, it feels like a missed opportunity to push the genre forward.

The scent opens with an aromatic, synthetic lavender-fresh top note that quickly fades into a familiar woody-powdery base. You could use that exact description for at least twenty other blue fragrances. There’s no risk here, no edge, no personality—just a calculated, safe play designed to appeal to the widest common denominator.

If this is your first blue fragrance, then sure—enjoy it. It’s clean, versatile, and inoffensive. But if you’ve owned or even just sampled other mainstream blues, Legend Blue feels like a frustratingly unnecessary addition. Not bad, just... irrelevant.",05/27/25 18:18,NotesofBLang

As soon as I sprayed Azzaro Sport I instantly got reminded of Legend Blue. THATS IT, THATS THE ONE! This is 85%-90% the same as Azzaro Sport. They’re both great fragrances but I think Legend Blue might last an hour or two longer because it’s an EDP. Either way, you can’t go wrong with both. The major difference between the two I’d say is the mint note in Blue makes it smell more fresh aquatic. Whereas in Sport it smells more aromatic and citrusy.

As far as some people saying that it has a citrus-ness, uh no. There is zero citrus smell to this and that isn't a bad thing.

Legend Blue Montblanc,I got the lavender notes and the mint at first. Both gave way to cedar and sandalwood within 30 minutes. The base of moss and ambroxan was clean. Solid fragrance and more masculine than some other blue labels I’ve tried recently. I would have liked the top notes to stick around longer. 7/10.,04/20/25 15:41,SamplerMick

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Some of the nonsense of fragcomm leaves me so confused I get a little frustrated. What makes you think montblanc is cloning a middle eastern cheapie out of all things and not the scent profile the cheapie is duplicating (that COMES from the same place as montblanc)? I support making scent profiles affordable but there’s an over-abundance of pride from the “this is 1 to 1” folk. There’s a strange vibe of snobbery and it’s almost like there’s a sense of pride in not being able to tell the difference between things and/or caring about nuance.

That all being said, this is a very solid release from montblanc. They’re known for being a solid house and this is no exception. I’m typically quick to dismiss that ambroxan bomb mall smell, and while this does have that going for it, I find it tastefully executed. Certainly blue, but that mint pushes the freshness up a notch and gives it a little more interest. For those like myself that get that nose burn from typical designers, this is worth a try because the mint helps round that aspect out a bit. That being said, you can probably smell it just using your imagination. What you read is what you get: a fresh minty blue that doesn’t stray too far beyond. Nor do I think it should. Their consistency and uniformity in both presentation and quality should be appreciated.",04/04/25 13:47,EosKaiAstraea

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Take the original Legend DNA, mix it with that of Burberry Men from 1995, add a sprawling base of ambroxan, and this is what you get. I'd also liken it to an updated Aqua Quorum, with that big lavender note and slightly inky smell.

This fragrance is going to get dumped on for being ""generic"" and I can certainly see where that criticism would come from. Truthfully, though, it's very well-executed and IMO the best the Legend line has to offer. Let's face it: you aren't getting a Montblanc fragrance for niche-like originality or photorealism. You're looking for something that smells good and doesn't break the bank, and that's where Legend Blue succeeds. It really does smell like you're fresh out of the shower, it lasts for 7-8 hours, and it's probably going to fall into a very affordable price range on the gray market in the next year or so. What's not to like about that?

I will say that if you're overly sensitive to ambroxan, you'll want to steer clear. I've never smelled it this strongly in a fragrance before. Otherwise, I can wholeheartedly endorse Legend Blue as a versatile, everyday, ""shower gel"" style fragrance...at least if you're not sick of the ""blue"" trend yet!",02/24/25 14:02,Vapor Trail

Performance is weird, quality is kind of poor, this is just a huge pass for me--there's nothing interesting going on here.

Please stop listening to ""influencers"". Montblanc is amateurish cheap perfumery that isn't even worth the marked down prices they go for at discounters. There's a reason they go for so cheap almost immediately after release--because no one's buying them. I am so done with this brand.

Legend Blue Montblanc,Minty woody ambroxan. So addictive! Would be good for an office scent or running errands in the day time. Great after a haircut or workout too.,12/27/24 19:25,ultramale
Legend Blue Montblanc,"SUMMARY: 9/10
Fresh shower gel opening with addictive clean, woody dry down. Stellar all day performance.

RAMBLING THOUGHTS:
When I am wearing Legend Blue, and hours in to its dry down I get another whiff of its addictive clean/woody dry down, there is part of me that wants to give this my first 10/10... but I have to acknowledge that this isn't an overly original scent, nor is it particularly complex or deep. But for what it is, and at the price point it usually goes for, this is a truly amazing fragrance with possibly the most addictive dry down of the designers in my collection.

The well balanced lavender and mint in the opening do give this a soapy, sporty, shower gel profile in the opening, but it is the dry down where this fragrance really starts to shine. And this isn't a case of ""just power through the bad opening"" because the opening is pleasant, clean, and refreshing... it is just that the dry down is so, so much better.

An addictive Aambroxan powered dry down, mixed with smooth woods and a subtle sweet mustiness from the moss. This really is one of those addictive dry downs where you will find yourself taking every opportunity to ""go in for a sniff""... except you don't really need to because the performance on this is stellar.

Projection is moderate once it settles, but you (and anyone who gets in close to you) will be smelling this all day. If you put it on your clothes you will be smelling it the next day too. It will maintain decent sillage too in the hot weather or if you are particularly active.

This fragrance does lack the fruity sweetness that is present in other entries in the Legend line and in so many blue fragrances, but in my mind that is a positive. The only sweetness in this fragrance comes from the mint in the opening, which is subtle and well balanced by the opening, and it settles down fairly fast. So if you are after a clean, blue fragrance without the over the top sweetness, Legend Blue is a great choice.",12/27/24 05:08,AussieBooshie
Legend Blue Montblanc,Very soapy and clean. And very strong! Punches you in the face during the opening. It's a keeper but definitely outside my top 10.,12/16/24 16:41,Morm13
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Legend Blue is an aromatic, herbal and woody fragrance.

Its opening is sweet-fruity like the smell of pineapple combined with spicy tones of mint, while in the background it accompanies the note of lavender throughout the development of the fragrance. From its application it reminded me of Boss Bottled Unlimited and I see that I am not the only one who has noticed it, since its resemblance is notable. The aroma remains sweet and fresh all the time without many aromatic changes.

This version of Legend could be used during spring, summer and autumn, since it is a fragrance with an aroma that is versatile and at least for me it projects joy and optimism, something that I also perceive in Boss Unlimited. The aroma is youthful to mature in style, to be used in casual situations, outings with friends, to the movies, school, etc.

Its longevity for a ""fresh"" style fragrance has been good on me a little over 8 hrs. with a sillage that is not at all intimate compared to others in the Legend line.

I liked the aroma and I'm sure more people will like it too, although it's nothing new, it's almost a safe blind buy and if you don't like it you can give it as a gift.",12/13/24 09:32,caifan

Especially when cheap ME clones like Maahir Legacy, with their inferior ingredients and blending, get a higher score of around 4.23. Not to mention the two PDM fragrances Legend Blue is compared to the most, which also have scores around 4.23. How is it possible that this, which is a better blend than Maahir Legacy and a nice mix of Percival with elements of Sedley, gets a score that’s not even comparable?

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Like others, I grabbed this for $42 bucks online. At retail, no way but for the low this is a no brainer great smelling fragrance.

Spirit, Legend EDT and the oh so meh Legend Red. Legend Bue is great stuff. It's not a truly new scent but at the low price it's great. 8/10.",12/07/24 11:29,Rtiggs
Legend Blue Montblanc,"This comes across as a mass produced, functional sporty fragrance. The epitome of a “masculine sporty fragrance” Almost like if axe made a cologne for their childhood demographic that grew up. This scent takes me back to the junior high gym locker room putting on cheap deodorant before / after gym class.

Because of that association, there’s definitely a nostalgia factor that is the main driver for why I actually like this fragrance. I wouldn’t say that it’s a high quality fragrance or that it smells luxurious. It may be the slightest bit sickly. But the nostalgia factor was enough to purchase it. Could be a good one to spray before and after working out, or to get a little junior high school nostalgia.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Hands down the best in the Legend line. If you can snag it for $45 or less, its a good buy. I paid $42 in November of 2024 and its worth that price even though it reminds me of other designer fragrances, even some cheapies. Yes its somewhat similar to Percival for a couple minutes with a minty lime twist. Not as strong as percival nor is it on the same level of quality but Mont Blanc gave it a shot like they always do. Decent opening and then not much left. Enjoyable and useful in the spring and summer. The warmer the temperature the more refreshing and effective it is. This one is perfect for a hot day in/around the pool or summer cookouts.",11/15/24 19:03,Award winning Perfumer
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Now that time has passed (I smelled this at its first release but didn't buy), I was correct in waiting till it hit discounter stores online. They now sell 3.2oz bottles for around $40...so naturally I picked up 3 bottles for the same price as if you were to buy 1 at a full retail store like Macy's.

Spending time with this, I can tell you there's some interesting facets in this. I for sure pick up lavender, but it's not a floral lavender...but more of a camphor type lavindin that's a bit more herbal weedy rather than floral. It's not off putting, but it's a bit more dry which seems to work well in this. There's also a touch of white floral in the background like cyclamen or muguet to clean it up. I'm also surprisingly picking up in some slight warm gourmand spicy in this such as either cardamom or nutmeg. Subtle ..but it's giving it a spicy warmth. The dry down is very woody (dry amber wood) matched with some mossy tones and fluffy clean musk...which instantly gives it back to its original Legend DNA roots.

The mint in this isn't a green leafy herbal mint, but more of a cooling sensation like breathing in winter air, without smelling like actual mint.

This is probably the best dumb reach frag I've smelled in the past decade. It just works for any time and season.",11/12/24 19:37,Bkkorn

Legend Blue Montblanc,"This is my first experience with a blue colored fresh scent as I'm relatively new to wearing fragrances. It's fresh and smells great.

The description says it's a ""woody aromatic"" but as a newbie, I wouldn't of considered it woody. I would have just said, fresh, clean, and nice.

After looking at the notes I can now smell how that sandalwood and cedar are a strong, masculine base for the pleasant mix of lavender and mint. I suppose that is what woody aromatic means?

I'm picturing a fresh haircut, military/police uniform, kind of a safe and authoritative vibe to it. If you were a blue collar worker, going in and out of other people's homes, I think would be an excellent choice.

I may pick this one up as a summer time day fragrance because to me, it's so fresh, clean, cold/refreshing, and something everyone will like. I really enjoy the shape and style of the bottle as well; it's just bold and matches the scent so well.",10/20/24 17:55,Deesea66
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Out of the Legend collection, I started with Legend EdP which I like very much. Next was Legend Spirit, which didn't do much for me. Didn't know what to expect with Legend Blue but was pleasantly surprised. It's a really nice addition to the Legend Collection. Smooth and clean masculine fragrance.The mint freshens it up but it's subtle, not overpowering. If you don't care for strong mints, or worry about it smelling like toothpaste, you have nothing to fear with Legend Blue. Woody notes are well blended and smooth, not sharp. Also strikes me as very versatile - you can pretty much wear this anytime of the year, day or night.

To give you an idea on what it smells like, I did a little experiment by comparing it to Legend EDP and Dylan Blue. Legend EDP has stronger woody notes which are subdued and smoother in Legend Blue. In direct comparison, Dylan Blue is sweeter and more floral while Legend Blue is not as sweet and more fruity than floral.

Projection was moderate for me but longevity was quite good - got about 7 hours out of it. Overall, very nice. I'm picking this one up. Prices are reasonable at discounters.",10/17/24 15:33,Smirky

Legend Blue Montblanc,"This is beautiful!

We're tired of ""blue"" fragrances. So when I saw (Legend ""Blue"") I was underwhelmed. Especially since the last colored Legend (Red) was very forgettable.

But Legend Blue is beautiful.

It's a clean lavender scent with an upbeat lemon note, and nice fresh spiciness.

Clean, fresh, energetic, slightly soapy, citrusy, and mild fresh spices.

While really good, it is not very creative, to be honest. It smells a lot like Herrera for Men. It's 80% Herrera + 20% OG Legend. It also does remind me of Chanel Egoiste Platinum although it doesn't smell exactly like it. Similar profile only.

Casual, neutral weather wear.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"There are bits of Percival in this, but it’s much closer to Burberry Men. To me, it’s Burberry Men before they reformulated it to death. Which is great, because it’s one of my all time faves & I’ve even searched for a niche version of it that actually lasts. Obviously Montblanc isn’t niche, but Legend Blue fits the bill for me. The performance is about 6-8 hours, but that’s still better than Burberry Men is now. Pretty happy with this for that reason alone.",09/07/24 22:29,jsn

Legend Blue Montblanc,This does indeed remind me of PDM Percival. It is so good. I used to be a bit anti towards the “blue” frags but they have been super enjoyable to me lately. Especially this DNA which reminds me of BDC and Missoni PH.,08/31/24 14:55,Mr. Cellophane
Legend Blue Montblanc,"...Alright.
I love mont blanc, but... This is just more of a generic/body wash nondescript sporty blue freshie than anything I've ever smelt.
Is that the point? The blue to beat all blues?

Don't get me wrong it doesn't smell bad quality or scratchy at all. It's just... Realiably plain. Maybe there's a comfort in that, somehow. Nobody's gonna love this on you, nobody's gonna dislike it. It's a regular fit white t shirt in a bottle.",08/29/24 13:47,Swashbuckler9x

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Personal take with the first spray I’m taken back to the scent of men’s speed stick antiperspirant I can’t remember which one I used to buy but this smells so much like it and I’m totally cool with it I love that scent.
Edit. Current first proper full wearing. Just short of 6 hours and I can’t pick it up if I’m looking for it although I get a gentle whiff of it from time to time. Amazing simple men’s scent just wish longevity and projection was a little bit more. But I still really enjoy this one.",07/22/24 14:52,Pinkmeat
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Smells fine, much like another 2024 release (Polo 67) it's ok. Nothing completely new scent wise. Longevity is ok for a freshie. Performance is ho hum though this (at least on me) projects a bit better than the Polo 67. Not saying much though, as that one goes intimate exceptionally fast.

I do prefer this one out of the two. Woody, green, ambroxan.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"I wanted this to be a 5/5 so bad, but it's a 4/5. On first spray it smells amazing. Think PDM Percival meets Sedley. However as it continues to dry down the similarities to Percival just go away and it turns into a minty version of Legend EDP... which is not bad! It's got that mossy Legend EDP drydown. But what would have made it great is if the opening was able to carry through.
The dry down *on skin* is mossy ambroxan unlike Percival which goes in a clearwood fir amberwood direction.
Do not trust the paper strip! The dry down is much less complex on skin vs more complex on paper strip!
All in all 4/5 fragrance that would be a very good pick up for an everyday at $50/100ml. Nearly convinced me to sell my bottle of Percival!",07/09/24 19:35,PK_thundr

Legend Blue Montblanc,"10 REASONS WHY THE RATINGS OF MLB ""KEEP GOING UP"" (BUT THE REVIEWS HERE DON'T REFLECT IT):

The ratings on Montblanc Legend Blue in just over a month after its U.S. release have gone from 3.80 out of 5 to 4.00 out of 5. The movement of essentially 20 basis points is BEYOND remarkable in such a short time! And MLB's ratings should continue moving up. WHY?.....

1. 85%-90% of YouTube fragrance reviewers give SOLID marks to MLB. (Not reflective of the reviews here).
2. This fragrance is said by YouTube fragrance reviewers to rather easily grow on you--So personal ratings will actually get revised UPWARD over time.
3. MLB is designed MAINLY for those 26 and UP (more mature), not 18 to 25. The group 18 to 25 essentially has little interest in Parfum De Marley's Percival (not their thing), nor similar MLB....This group doesn't even ""realize"" MLB is NOT designed for them--They just think it's a sub-par fragrance and review it here accordingly.....downvoting otherwise positive reviews.
4. Most older members don't have time for reviews---just wearing, evaluating and VOTING on fragrances.
5. Who wouldn't want to smell similar to Percival? MLB--smelling similar to Percival-- is an easy to like, easy to wear, perfect everyday scent. For 20% of the price of Percival--when MLB is presently selling @ online discounters for $62/100ml.??
6. It's said that the vast majority of fragrance buyers ""make up their minds"" on a fragrance based on smelling the initial seconds of the open. (This fragrance gets better and better-- AFTER THAT). See a ""problem"" with some of the reviewer comments here?
7. The ""well informed"" reviewers here listen to various online fragrance reviewers to discover what the real deal is on a fragrance before commenting (ie. They don't just talk out their *ss).
8. Remember the old saying, ""The difference between THE MASSES and THEM ASSES is only different by a space""? (Some ""reviewers"" here need to stop being lazy sheep--and actually ""fully"" evaluate a fragrance before ""reviewing"" it. In this forum not doing so is considered disinformation--with no place for it in a ""fragrance community"". (ie. we're here to gain knowledge, not B.S.).
9. The lower the price goes on MLB, the higher the ratings will go (perceived value). The price will eventually go to $29/100ml. when it's all said and done. (ie. Montblanc's historical pricing trend).
10. The higher the ratings go on this fragrance, the more users will question their view of MLB, potentially re-rating it upwards--as again, this fragrance grows on you: So ultimately the wearers of MLB are actually more effective in ""positively"" changing voter ratings than reviewers are.",07/03/24 20:26,StevieBoy
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Another positive review for Montblanc Legend from me. I had been looking forward to trying this since I saw the ad months ago. It's fresh it's minty it has that cool refreshing characteristic to it. Off the top you get the spearmint with just enough lavender over it. The mint is pretty strong . Then the ambroxan and miss slowly creep up. The woods are very soft . You can smell them but they don't over power. The majority of this fragrance is spearmint ambroxan and Moss with in a light lavender bubble. It almost smells like a spearmint sugar free gum with a super light woody essence to it. It kind of reminds me of Boss bottled u limited without the florals with a sprinkle of MB explorer ultra blue. I love it. It's very fresh . Draw back, the performance is not good. After about 2 hours it's a pretty light scent . But it's still worth it to me . Definitely going to get the big bottle.",07/02/24 14:26,WildCalifornia

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Sometimes a lot of the comments here are Generic this and generic that. Lets be honest, what is there to do out there? All these houses are pumping so many fragrances out there to the point that flankers have flankers and more flankers. Sometimes between houses, they just add more vanilla or more apple notes. And if it isn't ""niche"" forget it. Having said that, The Legend line has always been a nice approachable line of fragrances for the majority of the people. This new Legend Blue release is no different. It smells similar to Percival at a 1/4 of the price. The quality is good. More importantly, it smells great. Any age group will enjoy this. This could easily become the Swiss Army or a small collection of Fragrances.",06/24/24 05:00,Simbathedoodle
Legend Blue Montblanc,"It smells almost exactly like Burberry Men. The only difference is that it pivots slightly more blue in the late drydown. It's a fun throwback with average performance.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"I tried this again, it's actually really nice, very smooth, not harsh at all. I do really like it even if it's nothing revolutionary.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"This is solid stuff. Yes, ok...it's a bit generic and does have shower gel vibes but the legend line always has.

This is about as close as you'll get to Percival for the price and I actually think it has decent performance and projection. Can pretty much constantly smell it on myself for the first 3-4 hours of wearing.

Also, right at the end of the dry down it smells a little bit like aventus....which won't appeal to everyone but it definitely isn't a bad thing.

Strong release from MB, an easy go too for almost any time of year or situation.",06/16/24 02:58,biff2
Legend Blue Montblanc,"I will start off by saying I’m not a fan of the Fierce/Legend DNA but this is BEAUTIFUL!!! This is like a hybrid of Percival & Sedley at a fraction of the price. It’s obviously not as refined as PDM , but this is probably top 5 best summer release of ‘24 , and will probably be crowned as the best in the Legend line. It’s a refreshing minty/citrus open , then settles into a more refined version of its OG DNA. I think it’s a 9/10 , I don’t give perfect 10s to many frags.",06/12/24 22:13,xavi617
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Montblanc Legend Blue--
REVIEW:

I'm a regular reviewer with 30 years in men's fragrance, and take pride in painstakingly writing detailed reviews to accurately report on a fragrance for YOU. Sounds weird, but that's WHY I do it. That said, it's frustrating that this fragrance has seemed to be so ""manipulated"" negatively, when it is indeed a SOLID men's fragrance! The following are my takes on MLB--in no specific order: For MOST men about 26 and older (ie. mature, masculine, fresh and relaxed-upscale smelling). Moderate overall performance. Best suited for spring, summer and early fall. Possessing a very attractive and vibrant open of airy ambroxan combined with refreshingly smooth lavender and mint, MLB dries down clean and fresh to a light blue aromatic fragrance reasonably reminiscent of Parfums de Marly's Percival at its core.....BUT WITH a subtle, masculine, nearly barbershop-style edge (ie. being notably smooth, semi-sweet, fresh spicy, sandalwoody, creamy-powdery, musky, with a touch of moss). Not ground-breaking, yet QUITE appealing! It draws from vibes of multiple different relatively well-known fragrances and is dead center in the wheelhouse of Montblanc's ability to master the ""inspired by"" modern composition. This fragrance MUST be given a ""full-wearing"" and worn all the way through to FULLY appreciate it. Also, word on the streets--ie. social media, etc.--is that it ""positively"" grows on you over time to where you will desire to wear it regularly, if not daily (ie. decant/sample worthy), while I just HUGE loved it from my first wearing at Macys. MLB has a wonderful open, transitional mid- and an amazing drydown! So you will more than appreciate it as a fresh, attractive, easy, everyday, change-of-pace, masculine, warm-weather wear. I personally expect the ""Perfume (scent) Rating"" of MLB to ultimately end up @ about 4.20/5 (first released in Feb. 2024 @3.68!), once the legitimate word on this fragrance completely gets out---and as the online price eventually settles at Montblanc's more typical range of about $35/100ml.....with ppl discovering this truly enjoyable composition, its easy wear versatility, and the notable value for the money. Do yourself a nice BIG favor and fully try it out!",06/10/24 19:49,StevieBoy

Legend Blue Montblanc,"This is wonderful. Percival at less than half the price. The similarities are obvious and immediate. Granted, there are subtle differences, but they're barely noticeable. I'm a fan of the OG Mont Blanc Legend, and I love Percival as well. But after finishing my first bottle, I haven't been willing to fork out the money for a new one. This little gym couldn't have been released at a better time. It's a 100% safe blind buy. This one's an absolute slam dunk in my opinion",05/31/24 12:53,foreignshores
Legend Blue Montblanc,"My first impressions
Legend Blue first impressions...
So I tested this on tester card first then my wrist, first it opens a little like YSL MYSLF with a burst of sweet citruses maybe blended with fruity florals, as Legend Blue dries down one starts to get more of that Legend DNA, but it's more modern, like how Percival is to A&F Fierce, so you have Ambroxan as your base, and in this it seems to be a strong ambroxan. As the sweet citruses fade away you'll start to smell the mint, it's not a herbal/spicy mint, but more like a mint you might find in a spearmint gum, it's a little sweet, but it gives the fragrance a refreshing cleaness.
This mixed with the Percival style middle and base could give that Sedley vibe so I can see why some may say that, but for me it's far closer to Percival but not a clone of that either as it has it's own character, it is blended to be smoother which I think is the Sandlewood as that does come across, also the base comes across deeper and bluer than Percival, almost has that BDC blue vibe in the base. Performance was also great off of my wrist, far better than the other two of the same Legend line.
Verdict: I will be purchasing a full bottle of this soon, so that really says it all.

[Edit] Update
I think my first impressions nailed this fragrance, but owning a bottle has made me love it even more. Phenomenal! I got two compliments from strangers during my first two full wearings and a few more from family and friends over the past three weeks. It just works—easily my favorite Montblanc fragrance and, in my opinion, the best of the Legend line so far.

Overall score: 8.5 / 10 , gorgeous opening and an equally good dry down, super versatile, an absolute Blue banger!",05/30/24 15:45,ThatBlindbuyGuy
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Legend Blue smells amazing and personally reminds me of a designer PdM Sedley of sorts. Checks many of the same boxes and shares virtually every note aside from Moss.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Smelled at Macy's, but I didn't buy it for 2 reasons.

1- It's smells like every cash grab you can think of. Semi sweet, aromatic, puffy ambrox, etc etc. It's all there....just like everyone else's. I've smelled this type a hundred times already in the past 5-6 years by other designers.

2- In 6 months, these will all be on the discount online stores for $40-45 for the big 100ml. Why pay over $100 when Mont Blanc is known for going strait to discounters within months of launch.

Does it smell great? You bet it does. But it's been done to death already....so just wait a few months and get it for 1/2 the price.",05/21/24 15:23,Bkkorn
Legend Blue Montblanc,"If you want Parfums de Marley’s Percival on a budget with some minty freshness on top, then look no further than this release right here. This is a proven scent profile that just continues to work and I can see this one being a solid workhorse for many people. Whereas the original Legend EDT and the EDP lean towards A&F Fierce, this one really does favor Percival with the heavy dose of lavender and I swear it has a similar mandarin orange note. The ingredients and blending may not be like PDM, but the vibe is absolutely here and for the discounted price it’s pretty good! My only gripe would be performance as I sprayed this several times on my hand and it became a skin scent after about an hour. That’s about par for the course with Montblanc though, so just spray away, and i gotta say the transparent blue bottle is pretty cool. Overall a good release!",05/17/24 20:47,jbozz

Legend Blue Montblanc,"I think Mont Blanc did a good job here. I can see the similarities with Platinum Egoiste and Burberry Men, which in my book is not a bad thing. You get a very fresh minty lavender in the opening that stays quite linear and is present throughout the scent's life. A nice fresh aromatic fragrance (somewhat in the barbershop genre) for spring and hot summer days ahaid! Performance seems good, but i'll add my findings on this later.. I think i might have found my spring/summer office scent for 2024!",04/03/24 00:37,lodingo
Legend Blue Montblanc,"Update.
I wore it all day yesterday.
It starts out really nice, fresh, blue and only the slightest whisper of mint.
It does progress into some lavender/aromatics and very slightly reminded me of the dry down of Platinum Egoiste (the bit I like the least of PE).
However, after an hour or so it dried down to a really bland, generic, and eventually irritating musky fuzziness.
Hard pass and very disappointing.
I don’t want it on my skin again so will probably pour it down the sink and clean out my travel vial for something else.

Legend Blue Montblanc,"Tried today for the first time, my immediate thought was 'I've smelled this before.' Well it's frankly quite nicely done however it doesn't wow me. There are surely some fruity notes not listed, perhaps a sweet orange/mandarin as well as some vetiver. It comes across as in a similar style to L'Homme Rochas (blue bottle) or Dolce & Gabbana K, maybe even Cool Water Intense but less heavy on the amber, there is possibly a touch of the original Mb Legend too. On first impressions I prefer this to the red flanker but Legend Spirit remains the best in the line to me.

Update 30/03/24; the later drydown definitely has similarities with the original Legend DNA (EDT, Intense & EDP). Earlier it does seem to give a nod to recent 'blue' fragrances. A like rather than a love for me but it's decent for sure.",03/24/24 14:25,Dark Owl

Legend Blue Montblanc,"It's a fairly generic fougere fragrance, along the lines of Tommy and Platinum Egoiste in the opening and mid, then starts drying down more towards blues like Legend OG and Percival with average performance.

The Cinnamon, Cardamom, and Sandalwood play prominent roles, then the Amber comes in. Sure, the 'Western Oud' smell is there, but it more of an instrument within the symphony. Overall, this is well balanced and last 8+ hours. I'd say cooler weather makes it more vibrant of a wear.

I want the perfumer who created this to never create a perfume again like this. This is horrible. I promise you, test it yourself and try it out, you will be disappointed. Hellhole of a oud scent. So baddd.... 0/10. Or wait, no... -100/10. I wish you could give 0 stars. This is straight up bullshit. I wouldn't gatekeep fragrances.",09/24/25 12:13,Carter001
Star Oud Montblanc,"I'm honestly shocked how ""barnyard"" this is for a designer oud, the opening is in a similar vein to Oud 27 by Le Labo. This opens with a harsh blast of barnyard oud & spice, but over time softens to a soft sandalwood & cardamom",09/04/25 04:43,Lauren_Trouble

Star Oud Montblanc,This has alot of similarity to electimuss capa. This is less powerful with a sharp medicine style resiness feel where capa is darker and a little bit more smokey if you can pick this up for a good price I'd jump on it straight away this is excellent. this is not a fragrance for the sweet mass appeal designer boys. you have to have a love for high end niche.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"@JackieBabs I am so glad I read your review, because I detect a lot of rose that is not listed in the Perfume Pyramid. In fact the whole Perfume Pyramid confused me, then I realised that it must have been made in error. If you read further up in the body, there is a description of the notes which is quite different to the Pyramid, and describes how I am actually detecting the notes. To me, this fragrance is deliciously soapy. It was always on my desk during the Pandemic and my working from home stint. It is comforting and uplifting.",05/14/25 13:54,Mammuchan

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Even before the first spray I could smell this sweet and unobtrusive rose note floating through (which is so strange that it’s not in the notes). This opens with a tart-sweet freshly cut rose, beautiful and bright with a little touch of sharpness. This dies down pretty quickly in to clean fruity floral almost giving a very shampoo vibe which makes this such an easy breezy fragrance to wear. Then as it settles in after about 30mins it’s like it becomes a little more complex and ‘grown up’, almost like it starts as a 16 year old in the opening and settles in to its early 30’s by the dry down. I’m really enjoying how it sort of settles in to the skin on me in a way that makes it really comfortable as an everyday wear. Very different from the sometimes bombastic niche fragrances that can often make you feel like they are wearing you.
It’s girly, office friendly and I’m interested to see how this fares in receiving compliments.",02/03/23 02:13,JackieBabs

I have always detested too floral fragrances and was surprised wen I blind bought it because I did like it (I got the rose right away and I didn't read any reviews) but this one has enough sweetness in it for me to like it...and for the $19.99 price I feel it was worth it.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Got my second bottle !
Elegance in a bottle .. sophisticated, sexy and yet girly and flirty..
At the opening i definitely get the grapefruit, the opening is boozy. at the drydown I get wood and musk with a touch of sweetness, very delicate, non headachy sweetness..

This perfume brings a lot of memories for me.. first kiss, first love, end of high school...
It was the only perfume i owned before i got into the perfume world.

It’s a great perfume for eveningnight time as it has that boozy neuance,
And it’s especially good the colder days in my opinion.

HUGE problem with this perfume is that the lasting power is so weak! After an hour I can’t smell the perfume on me anymore.. on days i wear this perfume, i have to carry it with me and reapply often 😤",11/30/21 11:42,vrinsun
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Opens quite fruity but sour, I’m definitely getting the red grapefruit vibes. There is some jasmine, and as it dries the fruit fades, it’s stays floral with a bit of musk. Sweet and feminine but the sour side of sweet, no sugar here. The pepper is light I wouldn’t call this peppery if you’ve smelled peppery frags. It’s fresh, a soft floral, with musk in the dry down. Not too woody, and not leaning amber.
It’s a great price. I blind bought it, and in hindsight wish I’d gone for the elixir, which looks more like the amber frags I usually go for.
I’ll probably layer it on top of some patch/vanilla frags to give it more depth.
As it is it’s a fresh soft floral day scent. Would be fine in the heat of summer.

Edit: Have a read through the earlier reviews if you are interested in the power of suggestion… it appears the notes listed were incorrect at first, and so many people describe this as jammy, berry, very rosey etc, all of which it is definitely not!",11/17/21 06:11,*loves_shoes*
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Lovely! Both soft and strong all at once. At first sniff you really get the pink pepper and sake with maybe a hint of pink grapefruit. It’s both citrusy and light yet a little rich. On dry down you mostly smell musk, jasmine, amber, and some remnants of sake plus rose- even though I don’t see rose on the notes here. It’s the scent I think a professional woman would wear if she didn’t want to offend anyone- it has that classy complexity yet is gentle in a way. I think it’s somewhere in between modern and classic. With some oak moss, civet, or vetyver it would be more classic or 80s. If it was sweeter or had more citrus it might be more modern. Good value. Lovely bottle. Lasting power is good.",09/23/21 01:00,holly_eva

Lady Emblem Montblanc,For me it is the perfect spring/summer fragrance. It is not too sweet like my other perfumes so I was very surprised that I enjoyed this scent. Not a blind buy as I smelled it once in the store before ordering it. On my skin it is very long lasting.,12/31/20 01:09,Natalia91
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"I was so intrigued by the marmalade note and expected this to be a jammy goodness feat roses. Found it at nearby department store, try it on paper, can't stop sniffing it. It's rose! It's a nice rose! Happily ordered my bottle.

The package came and I sprayed it on me. I waited for the sweeter notes to show up but I got none. This manifested itself as a very tame rose then BAM! pink grapefruit.

It's unmistakably pink grapefruit. My family always kept a can of pink grapefruit candies when I was younger. This exactly smells like that, accompanied with a good dose of dewy roses. Tart, sour, no marmalade.

This does smell very safe and inoffensive. Office/campus friendly and sits very well with those who dislike loud perfumes. Not a hate but still kinda disappointed. Where's my marmalade, Montblanc? :(

Quick update: I layered it with a jammy, sticky, turkish delight-ish kind of rose solinote from an indie brand (currently not in Fragrantica's database). Now I got EXACTLY what I had in mind on Fragrantica's scent pyramid. Pretty sure there's a lot of jammy rose solinotes out there (mine's pretty cheap) that will definitely do the work.",07/03/20 06:44,laviolamagique
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"My husband likes this. For some reason it smells very 90s to me. This fragrance opens with a youthful burst of orange and feminine florals. It is great for the summer and makes for an optimistic and refreshing start to the day. The patchouli is more prominent in the drydown, lending a stronger and rounded base. Orange and patchouli are the most detectable notes, with a biting spice from a dose of black pepper that adds further freshness. The scent is encapsulated by a very oriental rose. The texture is a combination of powdery sandalwood and bursts of zesty fruit.

Altogether, it has a very happy, extroverted and easy-going, girl about the town character.",03/20/20 14:27,Advaitaforever
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"I adore the raspberry, it's my favorite note. People eyeroll me; but...it has a ""ketone"" scent, and it's tart and distinct. Nothing is quite like it. Other fruits can be very similar, but raspberry is unique. I think it's underrated, and it's something I can pretty much bet on always working for my personal chemistry. That along with a ghost note of rose renders this a raspberry&rose fragrance.

In this, I wish the performance was a little better. I'm always good with a raz&rose accord though, it never hurts, and never gets old. There isn't much patchouli in here, or sandalwood. It's FREE of the common vanillic drydown, but instead stays tangy, comfortably sweet and zesty. My only gripe is that it doesn't stay long enough. It's a skin scent, so on one hand it's nice, but it won't be a contender around other people and their frags, and will be strong armed in crowds.

This is actually more of a summer fragrance, and I find it refreshing despite it not being a classic ""freshie"". The rose isn't too heavy, but rather it's gardeny and pretty.

Mid-June is when the raspberries begin to grow, and I'll probably save this until then in honor of them. I only have a large decant so far, but at this awesome price point, that could change.",02/29/20 18:45,ShadowsofLight

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"@Vanilla panda

Yes, that is exactly how I experience the fragrance, which I purchased directly from Montblanc. I love Notino, but they have ceased their US operations..
I was disappointed at first, for the same reasons that you stated, but I loved the bottle and had already sprayed it so I figured it would become part of my collection though I probably wouldn't wear it. My box/bottle happens to sit in a spot where I can easily access it so I have randomly chosen to spray a few times, for fun.. The packaging somehow stands out - even though it's just a plain pink square shaped box.. And I have to say the fragrance has started to grow on me. I still don't love it, but am staring to appreciate it - it will be a ""once in a while"" perfume for me, something I spray at home when I feel like I need something different. It's nice, not what I was expecting, but something I can learn to enjoy during the right moment.",02/12/19 23:24,najgirl
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"No sweet notes to my nose or on my skin! I don't mind it though- it starts fresh and sour, almost sharp. I'd say I smell grapefruit and not some marmalade. The rose is really out there the entire time. I'm usually not a rose girl and I happen to dislike almost anything that smells of roses, but Lady Emblem is a big exception. I love this fragrance for spring. The longevity is moderate and the scent stays close to my skin.

Edit
I have been wearing this for some time now since it is spring where I live and the warmth brings this fragrance to life. I have received multiple compliments and honestly, I feel beautiful wearing it. However, this is one that I would respray and the shape of the bottle doesn't make it easy to carry around. Despite the design being pretty, its inconvenient shape is the only con I could give Lady Emblem.",02/03/19 22:26,drawingmaniac35
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"No marmalade, no sweet and tangy gourmand fruitiness.

Very sour rose, very peppery juice, whenever sprayed on paper strip or on my skin.
Dry down on my arm is just weird, a bit moldy and musty.

Not sure what happened here, any Fragranticians there experiencing something similar?

I (blind) bought my new bottle online from Notino France, a reliable and reputable merchant.
For the moment, I'll let the juice 'mature' and try again later.


EDIT
According to Montblanc official website, Lady Emblem notes vastly differ from Fragrantica's!
Fellow Fragrantician willfullmiscond already made us aware of that discrepancy hereunder - thank you ;)

Top note: Sake notes - Pink pepper - Pink grapefruit
Heart note: Jasmine - Rose Essential™ - Pomegranate
Base note: Sandalwood - Amber notes - Musk crystals

These notes seem to match my perception of the frag, that is to say, very very sour and peppery. I'll return it finally.

Most of perfume websites (BaseNotes, Perfumo.net etc.) or resellers (Notino, Amazon...) list exactly the same notes as Fragrantica's: raspberry, marmalade and so on.
This makes me question about their common info source - apart from the fact that many websites will copy and paste descriptions from others!

Interestingly, many reviewers smell those gourmand jammy notes, while they don't seem to get any of that sake, grapefruit etc. as provided by Montblanc website.

Moreover, there's no info to be found suggesting any (dramatic) reformulations ever occurred.

Still scratching my head over it.

Feel free to email me via Fragrantica platform your thoughts on it guys!",01/09/19 14:45,Vanilla panda
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"This is a soft, dewy rose scent with a touch of sour berries and a whiff of musk, sometimes a faint smell of wood comes through, but the next moment it is gone again. The sweetness of Lady Emblem is not the sticky/cloying type, and the persistent sour note in the background strikes a fair balance. It is a light, calm, and unobstrusive fragrance, suitable for everyday occasions or the office.

Unfortunately the performance of Lady Emblem does not match its price, longevity is below average with a rather moderate projection -- you may get some more lasting power when applying on cloths. Furthermore the sour accord can turn quite unpleasant in warm and humid weather, so I preferably wear it when temperatures drop outside. If you like light fruity scents or rose, this mighty be for you, else it is a pretty costly unadventurous fragrance -- nice to have, but nothing you really need.",11/18/18 01:39,intesmas

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"This scent, on me, reminds me of walking through the heirloom roses at our beach house as a child. I am a lover of roses! This actually smells like roses to me, not some imitation. It isn't white or green at all to me. The Patchouli, Sandalwood and Rosewood seem to last for quite some time, as does the rose. The middle notes are, in my opinion and for my chemistry, balanced perfectly so as to not get that powdery rose scent that so many describe as 'old lady' smell. The fruit keeps it fresh and adds a little brightness- like a sweet breeze blowing through that beach house rose garden. Perfect sillage and great longevity.

Sweet and sour, which makes it different from the majority of rose+raspberry DNA fragrances currently in the market, but not enough to make it outstanding. On me, doesn't develop over time, which is a major letdown.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Hey y'all
Doing another review as it's a different season

Yes... well, I don't get the rose notes. I suppose the fruit part could be in the same vein as what Chloe does..

Pleasant perfume yes, but I find it doesn't last so long and at least I don't think it appears to have much sillage.

First off I get fresh, crisp fruit - not a fruity tootie- it must be wood that tempers it...
then the fresh goes and I have the fruit perfumey scent left.

This is a test after s shower in the evening, so I may just wear it tomorrow to do a day test.

I love the bottle, it glistens like the light shimmering over a stream.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"socorrosouza - I couldn't agree more with your comments on reviewing a perfume! Everyone's chemistry and nose is different and adding the caveat ""on my skin"" is definitely recommended, esp. for negative reviews.
For me I have often changed my mind on perfumes and never totally write anything off until I have at least tried it in all seasons and at different times of the day.
Personally I find Lady Emblem to be very different to Roses de Chloe, which it has been compared to many times here. I own and love them both but wear them for different moods and in different weather.
On my skin, Lady Emblem seems to emphasize the jammy rose, tart raspberry and creamy rosewood. The other notes are definitely there but are more of a support. The patchouli is very well behaved and settles in with the smooth creaminess. I would find this too sweet if it were not for the tart sourness of the raspberry and the balancing effect of the woods, patchouli and musk. I also have to be careful not to apply too much as it does tend to be a bit nauseating for me (esp. in hot weather), lightly does it and it is a wonderful well behaved scent to my nose.
This is also not a perfume I can simply apply without thought, my chemistry seems to change and the weather definitely plays a role so some days I can't wear it and others I can't do without it. There are a few perfumes in my collection that I have this love/hate relationship with. Weird isn't it?
On the topic of silage, I have had a colleague compliment me on my perfume in our pause area 3 or 4 hours after applying Lady Emblem! It is generally still noticeable to me for at least 8 hours and if I put my nose to my skin about 12 or more. I think I am probably very lucky with both the silage and longevity.
Thank you everyone for your reviews! Happy perfuming!",09/13/17 00:25,MindyMe
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Cassandra, Lady emblem is very different from Chloe on my nose, it is a much sweeter and more citric scent brought by the marmalade , there is something bittersweet brought by the raspberry and a greener. rose. Chloe on my skin is a musky rose, delightful, but more mature, LE is more a playful rose. But if you don't like rose scented perfumes please don't buy or sample them, rather than pontificating about them (more like denigrating the scents). Nobody should be coerced into loving rose or any other sort of scents, but should not badmouth them as if being the final authority , the know it all of fragrances. If you should criticize harshly any perfume at least include the caveat on MY skin.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"I was wandering in Rhodes, Greece. The bottle enticed me, well I am a magpie to a perfume bottle! It smells fantastic! It is deliciously sweet, you want to instantly keep sniffing, addictively and nuzzle into any clothing or material it has been caught on . I adore it. I cannot wait to own it. It is a perfect sweet scent to wear in hot climates. It smelt fantastic as we walked along the port harbour and of course whilst watching the sunset in Acropolis! The sea breeze wafted this under the noses of many Handsome Greek beings Oooh la la! The attention was accepted. Pleasantly surprised.",06/17/16 13:16,ismellsogood
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"I thought I would end up liking this one more than I did. It's almost a bit nauseous to me, like a non-existent pink pepper peeking through the composition. I guess it is the type of rose used. I don't find it overly sweet, but it doesn't stand out to me either. I think I would find it gorgeous layered over a pure liquorice type of scent, let's see if I ever get around to trying that.",04/15/16 05:10,Madrona

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"This is one of the most delicate rose perfumes I've ever smelt. Smells like fresh pink roses mixed with a touch of love and romance and sensual red berries. It's definitely fruity, but very stylish and feminine, not in a childish way. It's not overly sweet, at least to my nose it smells somehow sour like fresh cut grasses. I also smell something like pine apple that I have no idea where it comes from, but whatever it is, it is delicious.
It stays pretty good on my skin and even though I'm not a fan of these polygonal bottles, the bottle is extra ordinary. All in all, highly recommended for classy young women.",02/19/16 12:02,tommy_girl

Lady Emblem Montblanc,These are my first Montblanc perfumes.I havent found others of that brand appealing to me before. But I've fallen in love in Lady Emblem from the very first whiff. For me the scent resebles Roses de Chloe which I love and wear the most often but somehow it reminds me also of Givenchy Ange ou Demon Le Secret. Seems hardly possible to make those two simillar to one fragrance but yet for me Lady Emblem combines it! LOVE IT!,11/12/15 06:45,agarobka
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"I tried this only on paper, but I really want to try it on my skin.
The bottle is beautiful and original with a nice shade of pink.
I also like the advertising somehow. I appreciate that Mont Blanc always present classy women with a casual yet classy attitude for their perfumes. Not pushing too far the trite phoney sex card.
anyway their perfumes can be sexy in an attractive elegant way, always very tamed, subtly inciting more than aggresively flashing the ""prey"".
This Lady Emblem is a little bit of a simplistic perfume for my tastes but I like it.
Immediately upon first spraying on a paper I thought: ""OMG! My Cartier So Pretty re-loaded!"" but no, it wasn't. The initial rosey blast gave me a wrong impression. This Lady Emblem is much softer and thinner, more jammy and fruity with a vague hint of peach.
Unfortunately woods here could not make the miracle. Lady Emblem seems trapped in the fruit basket trying to emerge. Anyway I wouldn't say it smells exactly like the plasticky fruity baskets around. At least, here fruits are not cloying. I will try it on my skin and see what happen.",10/27/15 15:47,Mellyhelly
Lady Emblem Montblanc,I do really adore this. On paper it's very jammy but today I tested it on my skin and it's so much like YSL Baby Doll with just a touch of jam on top. Not sure if I'll buy it since I've had baby doll a few times.,10/25/15 19:38,rhaineclayton
Lady Emblem Montblanc,"I love this smell so much! It reminds me so much of summer nights in Paris and all the amazing feelings and memories there.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Mostly a rose scent with some fruits. Kind of fresh in my opinion. I don't think I am too crazy about it. I find it more suitable for spring than for autumn, it would have been better to release it then.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"So this is what Montblanc writes up? A girly yet sloppy handwriting of a perfume in pink ink(i'll stop with the pen references now). I'm disappointed in this perfume. First spray is pure synthetic Herbal Essence hairspray of sour raspberry accord. I do smell plenty of musk and a bit of sad sandalwood. For a split moment I can smell red roses, big lush red roses and then it's gone. Overall, through the whole course till the very end, is sweet&sour raspberries.

Lady Emblem Montblanc,"Finally we have a decent and beautiful womens release from Montblanc. The advertising copy says Lady Emblem is light but complicated, and that's the rare case when I agree with advertising words.

Montblanc Lady Emblem is a rosy fragrance with a lipstick type of rose (similar to Paul Smith Rose and Roses de Chloe). Here this rose accord is enriched by a modern gourmanish undertone, and this frutchouli makes the scent multidimensional. What I like is that Lady Emblem doesn't have acute angles: a well balanced and tender creation both for 15-year-old lady and for woman in 40's.",08/17/15 07:57,antonpan

Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"The juniper is pronounced in this one from the collection. On first smell it reminds me of a Moscow Mule witg the boozy efferescence like gin. Then once the perfumer's alcohol dries down the creamier sandalwood starts to creep in the back. Powdery accord was not my first guess, but that aroma of drinking a COLD Mule from the copper mug definitely paints the theme of cold and mountainous; a glacier. I think this is the first fragrance I connected the scent to the name.",10/06/25 18:26,OsoGringo
Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"Like a mix of Chanel Sycomore and Santal 33 in the best way possible!

And I say that because I’m not a fan of S33’s roughness or ‘pickle smell.’

This doesn’t have any of that. It’s so smooth it’s akin to the guaiac wood in L'Envol de Cartier or borderline the sandalwood in Bois des Iles!

The final mix is something Aesop would make. For a Montblanc and for $77 for freaking 125ML!! This is impressive quality and value.

And no, this is waaaay closer to Sycomore than EN A L'Extreme. Much creamier and more wearable than the latter.",09/26/25 14:05,omar77w
Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"This line is incredible, and thank god the majority of YouTube reviewers are not getting of whiff of them which keeps the online prices attainable. Most likely they're not getting free bottles from Montblanc LOL. I wrote an earlier review of this one, and since then I pulled the trigger and bought a full bottle. I have three of the four.

The only drawback of this entire collection isn't really a drawback, but rather an inconvenience to my own lifestyle, and that is the size of these bottles. They come in a size larger than what the TSA would allow in a carryon bag, and since I travel for business a significant amount this is a bummer to me. However, as I said, it's not a real drawback, but I have to decant, and be denied the pleasure of using these amazing looking flacons which are very high quality.",09/17/25 01:22,Nosey_Sniffington
Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"I sampled it today, one spray on the wrist, five hours ago and still going. This starts with an amazing sparkling vetiver, then dries down to a very creamy sandalwood. The quality of this fragrance is outstanding. I can tell the sandalwood is not one note, it does have Javanol but it has something else that is creating this very nice creamy effect. There is absolutely nothing off putting about it, the vetiver is lovely, and the sandalwood, albeit quiet, still nicer than what you find with overly expensive, overly hyped fragrances like Satal 33. I am going to buy a full bottle. BTW I have Meisterstuck, and Patchouli Ink. This will be the third.",09/16/25 18:00,Nosey_Sniffington
Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"From the very first spritz, Vetiver Glacier opens with a robust and captivating vetiver note. It’s reminiscent of a wet, smoky, and earthy vetiver, for anyone familiar with Encre Noir. This strong opening is a delight for vetiver enthusiasts and makes it suitable for everyday office wear.

After about five minutes, some light fruity notes emerge, but don't expect any overt sweetness. Instead, there's a refreshing quality from the juniper notes that adds an interesting layer to the fragrance. As it develops, around the one-hour mark, a creamy sandalwood joins the mix, creating a masculine, classic, woody drydown.

In terms of performance, the scent projects well during the initial hour, especially with the powerful vetiver notes. Following this, the sandalwood base gets closer to the skin but continues to last up to seven hours on me.

Overall, Vetiver Glacier is an excellent choice for daily wear, suitable for any season and particularly great for office environments. If you’re a fan of the vetiver in Encre Noir, I highly recommend giving this fragrance a try.",09/15/25 09:02,Grimmace525

Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"Shame that this magnificent composition does not maintain the smell of its opening, effusive, vigorous and very very cold, vetive glacier has very well put its name and Nathalie Lorson made a very good composition, although as all the perfumer are repeated many times and fall in places and common ""accords"" in his works.
After that opening marked by the juniper note that binds to the freshest of the vetiver with a slight touch of ginger, radically changes to a earthy vetiver with nuances 'a la Encre Noire' But it does not become so dark and although it flirts with green part it does not lead to a ""Vetiver de Guerlain"", And it is precisely that background of sweet and creamy sandalwood that ends giving the identity of this fragrance, that if it had a better performance would have been incredible but stays in a good composition with a fairly lazy duration especially for its price.
I think bottles were missing something to become worthy of a high range, despite being made of a very heavy glass.
Montblanc remains to us as most of the time with their fragrances although some smell very well.",06/30/25 00:06,Abry_81

Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"Yea no. Take tom ford's grey vetiver, remove everything opulent and citrus, add the FAINTEST sandalwood (it's not even there...) and call it vetiver glacial. This stuff is alarmingly disappointing. It's simply dusty ass vetiver. As someone that finds plenty to love in fragrance, this has nothing to spend money on. Anyone really buying a scent that has MAYBE 2 perceived notes, and spending like, 200$ a bottle on it, are INSANE. even BR540 and Le male elixir have more creative notes then this. Alarmingly bad from Lorson. Easy skip for anyone that like unique scents, or isn't 85 years old.",04/03/25 19:18,Imortelle Yo Mama
Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"I'm hoping my 15 ml travel sizes are fakes. Lmfao if not, this stuff is trash. Pure vetiver. Pass. I don't want to hear ""well I love vetiver!""

Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"I've sampled this twice, I love vetiver but I don't like this, I find it too ""flat"" with only the earthy, sharp aspects of vetiver present. It seems to lack any of the natural grassy, fresh or smoky tones I like on vetiver scents. I'd take Malizia Uomo over this.",03/09/25 10:12,non.operational
Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"Yea, this one is particularly nice. I’ve been on the hunt for a reasonably priced, modern summer sandalwood and this ticks all the boxes. I lived with the sample for a week and enjoyed it the more I wore it. I get lemon gelato and sharp vetiver in the top with a nice creamy (non-dill) sandalwood in the base. To me, the sandalwood takes center stage, and the support from the citrus and vetiver make for a very complete blend. For some reason, fresh masculine sandalwood fragrances are hard to come by. In that regard, I think this is in a league of its own. While it is different/unique, by no means is this a challenging wear. I highly recommend sampling this as sandalwood works differently on everyone’s skin depending on your chemistry. This will be in my fresh sandalwood rotation along with LV Lovers and Santal Du Pacifique.",02/12/25 19:06,Prfikt

Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"Vetiver Glacier by Montblanc is an earthy, woody and aromatic fragrance.

From the opening you smell the note that gives its name to the fragrance, vetiver. A very realistic, earthy, herbal and dry vetiver, which in this case is not even accompanied by citrus fruits as is traditional in fragrances based on this note. After a few minutes the aroma is enriched with sandalwood, giving it a sensual, very rich sensation and then it no longer shows any changes in its olfactory development.

Vetiver Glacier is an elegant fragrance, more for daytime use than nighttime use, it could be used in any season of the year, and it is a very good option for office work.

As for its longevity, for me it was a disappointment as it lasted between 5 and 6 hours at most, and I say it's a shame because I really liked the aroma a lot. The sillage was also very close to the skin.

When I tried it I felt that it was a fragrance that I would like to buy, so I will try it again to give it another chance, but if the performance is the same again I will discard it.",11/11/24 19:43,caifan

Vetiver Glacier Montblanc,"SAMPLE: 2ML
This was quite underwhelming. More Sandlewood than Vetiver for starters. Zero Juniper. Just kind of..blah. I had high hopes with Natalie Lorsen but she missed the mark on this one.
Up close, right up on the skin it's OK but in the air it falls apart. What really solidified my thoughts was when I got into my girlfriends car and she gave me a weird look and said ""is that you?, that smells like that? Your wearing something new aren't you?..oh my god it stinks! You smell like the rocks from a dirty fish tank or the inside of a crab or something, that's disgusting ! ""
The dramatic complaints and gag noises went on for about an hour until thankfully we got outdoors. Now, I can't unsmell the fish tank rocks and yes, that's quite accurate.
I would definitely recommend sampling first. I wore a sample of Extreme Leather last night and that much better, but I'll save that for the review of EL.
Projection is available for the profile. Longevity is pretty good, I still smell it, albeit faint, 8 hours later. Overall I'd give this low 6 out of 10.",09/23/24 17:37,IsseyFumes33

It has that ‘luxury hand wash’ vibe, I also smell some of the original D&G the one in there too. Nice mass appeal, I think a woman could pull this off too.
I only used a small sample spray they had and it seems to give me the impression it will last on the skin.",05/15/24 10:02,Hadley

Legend Red Montblanc,"I've had this about a year now and have worn it once. I bought it to round out a Givenchy order and my buddy was wearing it and I thought I was a nice scent....but I digress.

It's just a LIKE for me. I mean there are things in it I like but the turn off is the agressive MascuWoods. I think the citrus notes got me. I like Orange scents like Boss in Motion.

I think it reminded me of a scent I wore when I went into management called POLICE UOMO...that's what comes to mind as I wear it. My wife had bought it for me as a work scent. I actually stopped wearing it because it reminded me of work.

For example this morning my wife remarked...Oh You smell like a Mister (roughly translated from french)...In which she really meant Manscent Perfumes she doesn't go for. We spoke about it in the car and she further went on to describe it as a drakkar noir, azzaro type of man perfume.

So There are good and not so good elements in this one. The not so good are the agressive woods. The really good are the top notes of blood orange and grapefruit. They totally get clobbered by the woods until they bleed ...hence Legend RED.

When I sprayed it on I got a plastic scotch tape scent from when I was a kid. The wood takes up too much space and provides a spiceness that I really would like to be lighter. This would have been a better scent with a lighter pine needle or fresh cut grass note to freshen it up.

But it is what it is. It's an ok scent I will force myself to wear. Maturing might help as the bottle empties ...who knows.",10/28/25 04:42,My13ScentsWorth
Legend Red Montblanc,"As should be expected for fragrances in the Montblanc Legend line, this is very pleasant, unisex, mass appealing, but not in any way groundbreaking. Fresh, aromatic, youthful, versatile. A good first fragrance, but there are probably dozens of things from A&F, Azzaro Chrome, Nautica, etc. that will be very close to this. Mostly aromachemicals, done well, but the cedar won't smell like a sauna or a pencil, the grapefruit doesn't smell like an actual grapefruit, and the sage/cardamom note is sweetened to resemble a candy apple.

If you are a fragrance collector, if you love unique and challenging scents, this isn't going to be your thing. But if you are just starting out, or are in high school or college and just need something that will work for most seasons or occasions, and like getting the occasional compliment, this will work for you nicely.",10/27/25 08:48,sniffer 65

I had stumbled upon a nice layering by dumb luck with Legend Red, I had forgotten that I sprayed it on my arm to test it out (it's been sitting on my shelf barely sprayed for 3 years) and I was going through my samples from Nordstrom and Sephora that I've amassed over the years and cane across Ebene Fume. I sprayed the Ebene Fume over the Legend Red that I applied about five minutes previously. It's amazing. It wouldn't have to be Ebene Fume, and it wouldn't have to be Legend Red, but the sharp citrus and shower gel that you could get from many options and the incense and woods you can get from many options works together.",10/19/25 17:10,RoBoT

Legend Red Montblanc,"My girlfriend picked this one out for me.To me it's a fresh woody fragrance, with a litte spice — pleasant, not intrusive and probably suitable for most occasions and seasons because of that. Perhaps a bit too conform for the youngest audience, I'd say late twenties+. The notes smell pretty well balanced to me. I find it shines in humid and cold spring/summer, probably in the fall as well. For sure a pretty safe ""blind buy/dumb reach"", as a lot of people have already said. I won't be buying this again though, because it's an EDP and even after generous sprays in all the usual places, this apparently evaporates on my skin in about three hours. In the afternoon there's barely any, or no evidence at all I put anything on in the norning. Might just be my skin for sure, but I would recommend testing it on your own to make sure it lasts at least a bit longer than it does on mine before buying it.",06/08/25 14:11,a1913
Legend Red Montblanc,"Has a touch of the original Legend in the opening but this is a fruitier more youthful fragrance. I detect something like cinnamon in the mid but don't be fooled into thinking this is a spicy or dark woody scent - it's pretty easy going and bright.

This is one of those easy reach fragrances - if you are in the market for a simple daily wearer then maybe worth a look. If you have a bunch of fragrances and looking for something a bit different this probably isn't the type of scent for you.

You may like it, because perfume is very individual. The longevity is very weak, as it is for projection. The opening could have been better, but is OK. And opening is the only thing that is OK with this one. Compare cents to drops, it is not worth the money. The positive with this one is that you can use it year around.

For example, it's way better than the uncle pleaser Legend Blue that's being hyped for some reason. It's fresh, aromatic, and memorable. It's not basic, as so many uncles here say. It has the easy-wearing vibe of a basic fragrance, but it's so much better than that. You can wear it year-round, so it's very versatile, and it's a very safe blind reach unlike many other Montblanc fragrances (Explorer, I'm looking at you).

Longevity isn't very good, though, at least on my skin, but nothing has good longevity on my skin, tbh. Still, don't expect ""beast mode"" out of this one. It just smells good.",04/19/25 15:08,BGTitan
Legend Red Montblanc,"Really nice scent it isnt mind blowing but it smells good and safe to blind buy sillage is moderate, it lasts 7 hours on my clothes minimum its more masculine leaning cant hate on it

Legend Red Montblanc,"Legend Red is a very likeable cologne. If you get it at a reasonably low price, it's a very safe blind buy and a great dumb reach. Many reviewers describe it as generic, but I actually think it has some personality & more than your average ""red"" marketed scent. The opening is very citrusy with an emphasis on the orange, but it has a potent peppery scent that makes it unique. The dry down is a warm woody accord that's fresh enough to be worn year round in whatever season or temperature. It has decent longevity of maybe 6 hours but not much projection. Feel free to spray generously. If this one lasted and projected better I'd really love it, but even with pretty average performance I still like it a lot and find myself incorporating it often when I want a traditional fresh masculine vibe.",03/26/25 08:32,doggymcnuggets
Legend Red Montblanc,"I forgot I had a sample of this fragrance. It's a basic safe fragrance, a more on the generic side. Citric, a little woody, masculine, clean and elegant, I don't think people can hate it, but also there is not much about it.",03/01/25 16:04,Leonnchu
Legend Red Montblanc,Doesn't last a bit underwhelming tbh but 50 ml for 21 quid ok for the office,02/28/25 04:02,Rogerant
Legend Red Montblanc,"Smells like old spice deodorant as a high-quality, modest cologne. Even as a spicy cologne, it's not intoxicating at all and overspraying won't be an issue if you aren't stuck in an office all day. Not a compliment getter, but a good winter cheapie",02/24/25 22:35,Dowtiss
Legend Red Montblanc,"I’ve been wearing this one a lot lately and I really like it. I’ve seen people on here say it’s too basic or generic but EVERY fragrance collection should have a fragrance like this. This is a perfect “dumb reach fragrance” in my opinion. Citrus notes present as spicy and fresh and the cedar woods as they dry down are very fresh and crisp keeping in line with the overall nature of this fragrance. I got this as a gift and will be restocking on this one for sure👍🏼

Legend Red Montblanc,"One of my first colognes, I loved it at the time but now it's very meh to me because I've smelled colognes since then that have rocked my socks off and this one just doesn't.

If you know mahogany teakwood the very popular candle from a very big brand, it smells like that with grapefruit and blood orange on top. It has that COLOGNE smell, if you know what I mean which I'm not a huge fan of anymore. Kind of will remind you of grandpa about to leave for work , maybe thats just me.

Not bad definitely not bad but ... meh.

Legend Red Montblanc,"I think this stuff is actually fairly good, other than the only moderate longevity. The citruses at the top are fresh and bight; bold and sweet blood orange accentuated by the mahogany and cedar, which are both alive throughout the lifespan of the scent. The tonka gives everything a bit of a powdery base as it dries. The dry down is pure woods with just a hint of sweetness left from the top notes. Projection is moderate for about an hour, maybe two. I'd say at the price discounters offer it for, it's a decent buy. It's versatile, but leans fresh, so better in the warmer weather.",02/15/25 20:54,redcrabcake
Legend Red Montblanc,"This fragrance feels pretty generic. I was gifted it, but it smells just okay. I tend to prefer more distinct scents, but this one has so many notes that it becomes overwhelming and hard to pinpoint. To me, it’s just a mediocre fragrance. I mostly spray it around my room or let my brother use it.",02/11/25 03:36,C4L
Legend Red Montblanc,"This is a pretty safe fragrance. It's primarily just clean woods and laundry musk. You can detect something freshly aromatic as it dries down, and it feels very corporate. I would like some more depth here....more spices and/or various woods. It's kind of flat.

I could see this working well in athletic environments if you don't overspray, it's decidedly clean. Of course, nothing is inoffensive entirely (someone out there is bound to get annoyed...that's just how people are lately), but since the woods are quite light, I think you could wear it to the gym or in the height of summer.

In fact, despite the red packaging and the heavy cedar profile, I think this would actually be better in hot weather. Maybe it would develop into something more interesting?

I tend to really like Montblanc things for Men, but this one is underwhelming.",02/08/25 15:48,ShadowsofLight
Legend Red Montblanc,"Safe blood orange and cedarwood mix. Much more artificial than other MB perfumes and the worst version of legend in my opinion. Go with other perfumes if you do not have a fetish for blood orange.

Legend Red Montblanc,"Legend Red in 2025: On my list of scents I sold.

Simply put, this is a cedar citrus scent with mediocre longevity. The blood orange note is nice and provides that spice to the citrus notes, however I feel there are much better alternatives out there.

I literally just blind bought this despite reading the reviews prior. What would i say , everyone here were right! Why i still bought it?
A.the price (36 bucks for 3.3oz6
B. It is relatively new
C. It’s an E.D.P
And now for the smell …. Red warm fresh and very inoffensive. Sadly for an E.D.P the performance is very weak , subtle projection and longevity . For something that came out in 2023 it smells nothing new, you get the blood orange on the opening and when it dries down it’s almost similar to the og Legend… just meh .. I’ll use it as gym/work smell for the wintertime due to the warm freshness and being quite inoffensive :)",12/26/24 10:18,TheVman
Legend Red Montblanc,"The longevity of this cologne has improved since I first bought it. Initially, I noticed it lasted about 5 to 6 hours, but now I am getting more than 8 hours of wear with good projection.

Legend Red Montblanc,"I got this as a gift from a friend. I liked what he smelled like so he got me a bottle.

It's masculine. Its spicy with a dry wood note like oak maybe...I'm not getting the cedar. Its got sweet top notes I assume are the blood orange. Its a citrus sweet without being acidic. It's associated with being at work for me since my friend uses it.

it's better than the white one that just smells like an after gym musky spicy generic mess. That same spice is in legend red and I think that's the tipping point for me. It's an old school spice / musk that isn't my thing.

It's not fresh on me . It's a bit of a woody musky orange that comes off a bit too Mister Man for me. I like fragrances either darker or sweeter. For me this borders "" Meh""...",10/31/24 05:12,My13ScentsWorth

Projection is very, very minimal being really a skin scent as soon as I applied it. There is no trace of it left on my skin within 2 hours. Considering the price it's passable. Might be good for keeping in your gym bag when you need to freshen up for a bit. I wouldn't buy it again, just because of the performance. Scent is probably 7/10.

This is a very good smelling fragrance but it's just such a mix of other things that it lacks a wow factor. I just grabbed it for $29 full box presentation which is where this should be and not the full retail $115. If you need a versatile fragrance that smells good, is all season and for any dress up or down situation you can't go wrong with this one. Total blind buy worthy and covers all of the bases.

Legend Red Montblanc,"This is a solid buy! I got 100 ml for $30 off of discounters and I couldn't be happier for that price. Retail has currently got this priced at $115 before tax. You could wear this anywhere at almost any time of the year. To me, it's best suited for the summer. It has a pleasant sweet woodiness that won't offend anyone. Average sillage and longevity.

I don't get the comparisons with K EDT or K EDP whatsoever. Sometimes I wonder if people actually smell similarities or see similar notes on fragrantica and make comparisons off of that. They both have blood orange at the top with juniper berries, clay sage, & cedar. I'm wearing both side by side and I can't say they smell similar. Both concentrations of K have something a little bit harsh in them which I can understand why many people wouldn't like them. K EDT almost has a wet paint smell to me. This one is smooth and pleasant all the way through.

It blends with my body chemistry to just smell like my musk, but if my musk were delicious and incredible. I know this is a weird thing to say but some men have a pleasant, but slightly vaginal body odor. After a few hours this smelled exactly like that.

Got this as a sample sprayette. This is a citrus freshie, heavy on the blood orange and grapefruit, short on the potency like every Mont Blanc. It's supposedly an EDP, but potency, and scent profile is similar to $25 Tommy Bahama colognes: Maritime, Maritime Deep Blue, Maritime Triumph, Maritime Voyage, St. Kitts.

Nothing groundbreaking as you expect from Montblanc fragrances. It reminds me of a combination of Legend edt and K edt. The longevity was surprisingly long-lasting on my skin. Don't recommend if you own k edt or k edp. I own k edp, and it feels like a redundant purchase, but the dry-down is different enough to make me want to keep it.

I have too many fragrances ranging from $10-$400 and this makes me as excited to spray as any of them. And the excellent price makes the mediocre performance less of an issue as I just overspray it. 9/10 only because of performance which isn’t horrible just not as strong as I wish it was.

En frío se va a desvanecer muy rápido. Cómo fragancia firma para el día a día es una cuestión de gusto personal diría yo aunque si iría muy bien. Botella preciosa.

Legend Red Montblanc,"Opens spicy and aromatic with a cinnamon aroma.

It's quite fresh, also has some green notes.

It becomes ""peppery"", the notes are ""spiky.""

Smells like a forest. Notes of vetiver, pine/juniper. Then a citrus note and another fainter aroma that resembles peppermint.

It becomes herbaceous and sour, the vetiver lingers as does juniper. The drydown then becomes a faint woody skin-scent.

Performance is ok. Not a huge projector but lasts as a skin scent a good while. I could get whiffs of it quite a few hours after application.

Would suit a man 25+.

Fairly versatile. Would work well in most tempratures, but not something to wear for a date. More of an all-round daytime scent.

I have a piece of mahogany furniture. I smelled it and can only smell pledge. This doesn't smell like pledge. I will use this as a day scent but not for occasions where I'm trying to get noticed.

Legend Red Montblanc,"Take your generic citrus fragrance that you may all know and love, and add a little spice to it. That is Montblanc Legend Red summed up.

It must come from that grapefruit note, but I very much enjoy this. I have learned that I like clary sage in fragrances as well, it's herbal and fresh, Montblanc Legend Red will have you smelling fresh and clean, inoffensive, safe.

Unfortunately, this may fall in the redundant section in your collection :/
I cannot seem to find really long lasting fresh fragrances, it can be frustrating.

Legend Red is blind-buy safe, clean, nice and simple. I will wear this often at home or for errands, but it may fall through the cracks.

Legend Red Montblanc,"What a pleasant surprise!

Honestly, I have *very* low expectations for Montblanc perfumes as they usually (with the exception of Starwalker, which I adore) make perfumes for 'mature' people, and I am not a fan of mature scents or scents that smell like 200-year molded furniture in Cambridge, England.

I was initially quite wary about blind buying any Montblanc perfumes due to the reason aforementioned, and to top it off, I had a rather bad experience with the overhyped Legend Spirit (the white bottle) so naturally my expectations were as low as they could be for this one.

But... I am also a victim of good designs and flashy bottles, and boy did they nail it with Legend Red. It's so bright Ferrari red that I could hardly resist, plus, I was able to get one at a pretty decent price from Montblanc official online shop in Thailand, so I gave it a go. At least I wouldn't regret the bottle, if nothing else, and the notes looked appealing enough for me, so...

The perfume came. I opened the beautiful red box to uncover a gorgeous red bottle (I don't have any bright red bottle fragrances in my collection, you see) and gave it a try.

It exceeded my expectations. I know that my bar set for it was very low so almost anything would exceed my expectations, but it did so in such a way that I wouldn't mind wearing it every now and then, and this alone is saying a lot.

The woody strangely overpowers the citrus here, but I can definitely smell the citrus underneath. It's not a heavy scent, thankfully, and thus I wouldn't classify it as 'mature' (again, thankfully). Perhaps this is why many below complained about its 'poor performance' whilst I don't mind at all. Yes, there is that Legend Spirit DNA in here, too, but it's not as pungent and it just smells... better. Normally I am against the idea of fragrances having genders but I would not recommend women to wear this one even though the bottle would surely attract all genders. It's quite clearly a man's fragrance, suitable for most daytime occasions in the spring and fall. I believe it would not trigger any unwarranted red flags or nausea unless you bathe in it. Longevity is moderate. Sillage is quite low, close to the skin, which I appreciate.

All in all, I am glad I got this one eventually. I was eyeing on it since it was released (though paradoxically with low expectations) as I was attracted to the bottle design and that bright red colour. To learn that the scent works for me is truly a blessing. Yes, some might say it smelt generic and nonesuch, but still, it exceeded my expectations remarkably.

Give it a try if you can. At least it's much more affordable than their pens, watches, and bags.",03/05/23 15:58,washudtoj
Legend Red Montblanc,"This is such a conflicting fragrance for me because I absolutely LOVE the scent profile. The sweetness, the spices, the woodiness, all of it is just so pleasant for me. To me this is perfect for all seasons except Summer (I live in a very hot climate so this could be different in a temperate climate.)

The downside is truly a big one, the performance. I find that I have bad skin chemistry and I generally don't get good performance on all my frags but this one is especially disappointing. The initial blood orange opening lasts about 15 mins and after like 2 hrs, on my skin, this is undetectable. This is not strong enough to make me go noseblind so I know it's not that. I wouldn't be so frustrated if I didn't like the scent so much.

Alas, I'd never get rid of it but it may end up being a frag I spray on a strip when I feel like smelling it and not really for wearing.",01/13/23 11:49,hoffmanvp
Legend Red Montblanc,A mulled spice version of Legend. It's a bit sweeter too. Kind of just reminds me of Polo Red or Old Spice deodorants. Legend is my favorite to smell on my boyfriend but Legend Red can be a good fall and winter variety to feel comfy and spicy. Just like Legend this is work and office safe and a good blind buy. Sillage is good; when my boyfriend is in the car with me I can smell the fragrance the whole time and if we go shopping the scent trails alongside him. Longevity is good also.,01/12/23 10:11,beta-ionone
Legend Red Montblanc,"Slightly sweeter. Slightly more citrus. Slightly lighter version of the original. Just like the rest of the line, they don't stray too far away from the original DNA. The opening is the best where you get that big hit of sweet citrus. Soon after it settles down into a lighter fruity, woody scent of the original. All in all this smells good. It shouldn't offend anyone. Performance is on par with the rest, around 5-6 hours. Could be worn year round. Seems best suited for cooler weather. This is one for anyone that just wants to smell good.",01/10/23 13:35,MikeRauch
Legend Red Montblanc,"I love the refreshing, zesty opening! There's a bitter edge and a warm, inviting background as it dries down. This scent is casual but interesting at the same time. I would recommend to wear this on a first date; it's unique but not too crazy!",12/24/22 15:13,AnitaHendricks
Legend Red Montblanc,"I have this one as a birthday gift, at first I was like meh/okay but, trying it for more days I started to give it a solid like. The opening it’s the highlight in this one, after that it’s just ok. It’s a good price, it’s an easy nice fragrance I would use daily or for any informal/casual occasion. The best season I would say it’s spring, daytime, but also fits summer and warm autumn days.",12/21/22 09:20,PerfumeAficionadoMTY
Legend Red Montblanc,"I like this one but don’t love it and I think if this has a few adjustments to it that it could be a top tier fragrance, however this has a beautiful opening but while it’s still good in the mid and drydown it just doesn’t compare to the opening (which I know the purpose of this is to be a money grab)

Again the opening to this is beautiful as it has a beautiful citrus note that’s clean but also has just the right amount of sweetness to be appealing but also stand out and be slightly different ! However, once this dries down it’s still good but loses that beautiful citrus and dies down to a more flat,dull,woodier version of the opening ! In the mid and drydown this just becomes boring to me and although pleasant I’d still prefer to wear something else that’s either more pleasant or unique.

Performance on this is by far the least out of any Mont Blanc I own as they all have very good performance except this one. Legend Red lasts me 4-5 hours with only decent projection for 30 minutes before becoming a faint skin scent.

Decent scent that I can see someone that isn’t into colognes making this a signature scent as it’s very pleasant but if you have an experienced nose this is a pass as there are many better “mass appealing “ colognes out there

Overall rating -6.5 out of 10 ! Love the opening but not a fan of the other aspects of the fragrance",12/01/22 09:44,Ryanmmas26

Legend Red Montblanc,"You'd think with this note breakdown that it would be a fall or winter scent, but it's almost strictly a spring scent. Too warm to wear in the summer, not strong enough for the winter. You could also wear it during the fall, but ideally just spring in 10 degree weather.

I'll test again come spring.",11/18/22 20:15,ry_ta

The dry down notes are detectable and decent but the pass-through is rapid.

Legend Red Montblanc,"Don't have one yet but it would be my next buy if I had the funds for it and urgently needed a summer perfume. I've been dreaming of it ever since the sales girl in one of my local stores forced me to try on skin. Usually they don't know much about fragrances and just make random suggestions to customers based on the little they know or on which brand is paying them a commission at the moment. Upon the sales girl's insistence I relented and gave it a go and... surprise, I think it smells delicious. Not as distinctive as the Starwalker I have at the moment, but this base notes combination is to die for. Rare example of a frag that gets off to a hesitant start but then gets better by the hour :)",10/09/22 06:06,ViceCity

There's nothing challenging here -- I agree that it's designed for the guy who only has a bottle or two and couldn't care less about notes and such. The pyramid is accurate: citrus and woods, all sort of candied. I've received lots of compliments, and my wife loves it on me and in the air.

Legend Red Montblanc,"@mwtx said it best in his review below. Mass appealing and synthetic. Having worked in fragrance for quite some time, I’ll tell you EXACTLY why this one gets recommended - to people that don’t know what they like (and/or people who just want one fragrance and nothing more), this is the best thing since sliced bread. Personally, I don’t get it. It’s okay. Like most of the Legend line, it’s inoffensive and versatile.

Montblanc are the masters of making fragrances for non fragrance people. I can’t fault them for it, and this would make a great first fragrance for someone (or a great ONLY fragrance) but, quite frankly, I wouldn’t say it’s worth picking up for most people.",07/16/22 16:36,Captain Odour
Legend Red Montblanc,"Nothing groundbreaking but it does smell really good. Juicy blood orange, and grapefruit, woody cedar.

Legend Red Montblanc,"Very nice but unoriginal scent that in the drydown smells like a banger discontinued scent(that scent being mahogany woods)

In the opening you get a fresh,uplifting juicy semi sweet citrus scent (that reminds me of a mix between polo red and Versace flame)

However, once this dries down that juicy citrus dissipates and the mahogany comes out making this more of a woody,sweet scent that at this stage the first time I wore this I knew this smelled like a bath and body works scent but I wasn’t sure which until I looked at the notes on fragrantica and I saw this had mahogany. So of course then it made sense that what I was smelling was reminiscent of mahogany woods !!

Mont Blanc Red could have easily been a Mahogany woods sport as it’s more citrusy as Mahogany woods was about Vanilla and Mahogany. So this isn’t a clone but something that’s pretty similar.

Performance- it lasted me 4-6 hours with moderate projection

Overall rating -7 out of 10 !! One of the better scents of the more recent releases but still won’t be a favorite of mine anytime soon. I do love that mahogany note though",04/10/22 11:45,Ryanmmas26

Legend Red Montblanc,"Here is the thing: Does it smell good? Yes. Does it smell better than Legend Spirit? No. In fact, I don't think it smells different enough to buy (at least now. Wait until it's on discounters) if you have Spirit bc 1) Spirit smells better. 2) Spirit is cheaper right now. 3) I'd save that money and buy another great red which is Polo Red.

I am not saying it's bad. It smells pretty damn good but if you don't have Legend Spirit, I'd just buy that. If you do have Legend Spirit, go by Polo Red which has a slightly more complex profile. It is very obvious they tried to play this one safe and appeal to the mass. The problem is it's too safe.",04/07/22 17:55,elliotscott

Legend Red Montblanc,"Montblanc Legend with a woody, citrusy twist.

Legend Red (LR) takes the same original Legend's (OGL) fresh base, the A&F Fierce base, and hides it behind hefty doses of citruses and wood.

Fresh, zesty citruses, mainly grapefruit, woodied up with beautiful saffron-y mahogany wood, and an unfortunately generic fresh woody accord of tonka, cedar, and juniper. The combination is spiced up very lightly with soft cardamom juniper berries, and all is built on a faint fresh base of the OGL of sage, juniper, and citruses.

Woody, citrusy, lightly-spicy, fresh, slightly green and aromatic.

My hopes for this one were higher but I was a little let down by the scent. The generic woody accord takes away from RL's beauty.

Nonetheless, this is worth re-visiting for me as I find the saffron-y woody accord's clash with citruses quite nice, and I do like OGL's fresh DNA faint in the background.

A warm-to-neutral weather scent. Good performance.

Don't get your hopes up for this one but it is still decently ""Likeable"".",03/24/22 03:25,AMajeedQT

Longevity is an issue. For a parfum you would expect a longer lasting fragrance. You'll get about 4 hours out of this fragrance. The pri e matches well. Might as well pick up a bottle. Again, not a bad fragrance.",01/31/22 22:23,j.pierc910
Legend Red Montblanc,"First thoughts - I wasn't bowled over upon first sniff but I got a tiny free sample from a store. Well, trying it again I like it more now, the opening is super bright and energising, it doesn't particularly smell like fresh blood orange to me but it is a slightly different citrus than usual, a little deeper almost as if there's a rhubarb accord mixed in there.

Imagine L'Homme Lacoste (original or Intense) combined with CK Euphoria men, an Azzaro Chrome flanker (as someone mentioned below) and a touch of the original Legend or EDP. There are perhaps slight similarities with L'Homme Rochas but to me apart from the immediate opening that one is sweeter and smoother, focusing more on the amber in the dry down.

I'm a huge fan of Legend Spirit (also own and like Legend Intense) but I'm not in a rush to add Legend Red to my collection, not right now anyway. It's not bad at all just doesn't wow me enough to warrant a FB, likeable though and worth checking out.

It smelled ok but considering the price of $80 - $100 depending on size, this is super overpriced for how weak a fragrance it is. I tried it on my skin and it was almost immediately a skin scent and almost gone completely within 2 hours.

Not a scent I'd wear in the summer at all, but fall, winter, evenings on cooler nights, this is perfect.

For me easily the best in the Legend line. I found other Legends ok, not bad just ok. But this smells exceptional ,and has great performance, sillage etc can't ask for much more honestly from a good fragrancefragrance.

Legend Red Montblanc,"I like the review below. I agree. This is bold - sharp citrus and wood opening. Very aromatic. Not a “light summer citrus”. Frankly, I think this has enough oomph to shine in warm and cold weather. It is mass appealing - and for good reason - it smells great. I’d heard that it resembles paco ultra red - I’m not seeing that. Ultra red is so sweet - and this isn’t. Maybe it’s the bottle? I also don’t get the connection with PDM kalan…that’s quite heavy and earthy with a touch of that MFK baccarat rouge sweetness. Again - maybe it’s the bottle. This is a citrus dominant - spicy aromatic scent. I like it a lot and recommend it.

On second thought - maybe there is a touch of kalan here. Just not the earthiness or deep sweetness that kalan has. Regardless, great scent. Easy to wear - rad bottle.

The moment it hits your skin, you know it’s cut from the same cloth as the original Signature. It has that comforting warmth that made the first one so special, just turned up a notch in sweetness.

Where Absolue took the Signature DNA in a more opulent, golden direction, Elixir feels like a return to the heart of what made the line shine - soft, cosy, confident. It’s nothing like Burberry Blush, Atheeri, Gorgeous Orchid, or those louder vanillas that lean sugary or floral (all of which I like btw).

Signature Elixir Montblanc,"I had the chance to test Montblanc’s Signature Elixir last week, in El Corte Ingles, during a trip in Malaga and I was instantly impressed. It’s not the type of scent I would wear in a 35 Celsius degrees heat, but I gave it a try anyway, being a big fan of original Signature.

First of all, it’s nothing like the original or the Absolue Signature, so not really the original line DNA with a small twist. It’s an entirely new scent, with a dark, rich, warm, ambery facets, in a vibrant red bottle, the kind of colour that matches the juice inside. Signature Elixir is a sweet, warm, cozy, floral, vanilla scent at core with a more sophisticated allure. I like it a lot, but I have decided to purchase other fragrances from my wish list, because…limited space in the luggage. If you shop a lot during holidays, you know what I mean.

For a brand new release, it wasn’t priced too bad, it was around 100 euros per 90 ml bottle! Obviously not the cheapie, like OG Signature is, but it had good longevity on the blotter, more of a moderate radiance in the air and the presentation is great. Really nice release, different than the others in the line, but not a groundbreaking perfume.

More of a spring and fall scent, it’s a bit richer, sweet, deeper than something I would like to wear during summer months.",08/21/25 05:16,Maya lilac

Then this is worth getting as a daily running errands perfume. It's not gonna be turning any head but it's a pleasant smell that you can smell. It's not strong or cloying in anyway and that's why it's perfect as an everyday perfume, easy to wear and work wells with every season imo.

Explorer Montblanc,"Easily one of my top 3 fragrance of all time and I have been collecting a while and have numerous bottles in my collection. I haven't tried the Creed Aventus yet so I can't comment on that comparison. I did however tried the Armaf Club de nuit intense, and I like explorer better. While both Armaf and this have a similar dry down, Armaf is slightly stronger, but explorer is more refined of the two and has a more even performance from start to finish. Armaf opens with a very synthetic citrus feel and dries down in a bit brash way. Explorer is more refined and has a more sophisticated opening and maintains that through and just ends up being a more balanced and nuanced of the two.

Overall I love the clean citrus vibe. The dry-down though is where the magic is, I always end up thinking of it as a nice citrus petrichor. Just that combination of water/earth along with the freshness of bergamot and pepper has something so unique that I enjoy smelling it on me, and you do get wiffs throughout the day. Projection is moderate and longevity for me is easily around 8 hours.",,AbyTrips
Explorer Montblanc,"Very close scent to Creed Aventus, its only problems (just like every Montblanc fragrance) is longevity and projection. After spraying , it projects for around 20 minutes, after that it becomes a skin scent for 4 hours.

A beautiful scent with horrendous performance, I wouldn’t be buying it again.",11/14/25 05:58,tamer1306
Explorer Montblanc,"A successful Creed Aventus clone. I can’t say its performance is great — it’s very ‘mid’. I think it has a metallic scent. It’s a true office fragrance. Not striking, but very gentlemanly. You can wear it 4 seasons. On top of that, it has a stylish and elite bottle design.",11/13/25 13:01,mek59

Definitely a compliment getter.
Very easy to wear as a signature fragrance.

A very affordable and a good alternative for aventus.",11/08/25 03:24,The_perfume.addict
Explorer Montblanc,"It's smelled a lot like a generic men's perfume. Patchouli and woods base, it is neither offensive nor notable. The performance was absolutely atrocious though so it gets docked points for not lasting at all.

If it lasts in you cool, and the price is right, a decent wood and citrus scent if it doesn't disappear when you turn your head .",11/03/25 06:24,AKyle
Explorer Montblanc,"Never trusted any fragrance influencers or fragrance collectors. Heard a lot of people saying the longevity is super bad. So I bought a decant first and tried out, what I get is juicy bergamot fruity, little bit sweetness and woody. But the projection or longevity not a monster but you can smell it even after 2 or 3 hrs mark after that it become like bubble around you and still people can smell it when they are close. Total 9hrs I can still smell it around me without sniffing. It's a very good fragrance and now I have 100ml bottle and I get same longevity. So remember never trust fragrance collectors and influencers. I never seen this as creed clone",10/31/25 01:38,KingPong

Explorer Montblanc,"INCREDIBLE NOSEBLIND MADNESS

I am new at this, I don't know all the terms or how all the notes smell. But I can confidently say that this smells INCREDIBLE, better than CDNIM which smells incredible too.

HOWEVER, this has a big noseblindness problem, to the point of when I go noseblind, even if I put a fresh spray on my hand and smell it up close, I can't smell it AT ALL. And I go noseblind to it VERY easily, which is a big damn shame.

I tried to apply it in many different ways. Even when I only apply it to the back of my neck I still go noseblind quickly.

I LOVE the smell, but I can't smell it most of the time and this frustrates me. Such a shame.",10/30/25 14:37,Justissier

Explorer Montblanc,"Montblanc Explorer is a designer take on Creed's Aventus. It's a smoother, less smoky, and more mass-appealing version of the OG Aventus, if you will.

Performance is nothing to write home about, and to be honest, for an eau de parfum concentration, it's kinda underwhelming. This one has moderate projection and longevity on my skin on a good day.

All in all, this is an okay alternative to the Aventus DNA. It's fresh, mass-appealing, and will get the job done. But nowadays, everyone and their pops are rocking an Aventus or a clone of Aventus, so you will not be the most unique-smelling person in the room wearing this. If you want a true clone of Aventus, go with one of Armaf's Club de Nuit. If you want a watered-down and more citrusy version of Aventus, this one is for you.

Explorer Montblanc,"I don't know why some women find the fragrance sexy. Perhaps it's because of ambroxan, which acts on them like valerian on a cat. In fact, this is a fairly basic modern men's perfume and nothing more. It smells like a classic combination of citrus, pepper and a woody mixture. It looks like Aventus only remotely, on one of its facets only. There is a lot of woodiness due to vetiver, which confuses me. I don't really like vetiver.I would turn it down a bit and add sweet and sour pineapple.",10/14/25 23:31,AlexPurple

It lasted all day and projected very well. I prefer it to CDNIM or Cedrat Boise by a long shot. It's a safe blind buy but recommended for those who are more mature or masculine.

One, the main thing, the drydown. When the leather and wood scents come out, i hate it. It just doesnt mix well.

Second, a decent work fragrance. Dont wear this in an office, as again, the leather and wood notes will mix and smell kinda off putting, depending on your preference of course. Better to wear in a warehouse where people wont smell you as much, but once they get close they will know.

Thats all. Just, make sure you DONT blind buy this. Not blind buy safe at all. Get a sample and let the drydown come through with the wood and leather, and see if its for you. Personally its not for me. But overall, a 6/10 fragrance. Its meh",09/17/25 05:11,Xavrance

I get average longevity and projection (it lasts longer than you think you go noseblind quick), and for the price off discounters i’d recommend grabbing it up. definition of a dumb reach year round frag that’s very safe.",09/15/25 13:10,robotdoctor
Explorer Montblanc,"Have just rinsed a 100ml bottle of Montblanc Explorer that I received as a gift. To me this is the perfect ""easy reach"" or ""daily driver"" for any season and any occasion. I actually prefer this over Aventus in the sense that it bursts opening with a stronger citrus note.

Scent profile is so good, citrus opening before drying down to a clean modern and woody scent. Don't get any of the leather mentioned in the notes though. But this is a superb year-round fragrance and at the price point of around £40 for 100ml I would have been tempted with another bottle had it not been for the release of Explorer Extreme this year.

Longevity appears to differ greatly looking at other reviews. My experience, moderate projection for 1-2 hours, skin scent for 3-4.",09/15/25 04:42,Gran Turismo 98

Explorer Montblanc,"I love this!
It retains every aspect and DNA of Aventus but so much more affordable.
I have gotten both the Club De Nuit intense and Explorer and I prefer this wayyy more.
It is overall, more smooth and the top citrusy note is not too aggressive and very well balanced and it dries down very nicely into the smokyness, very similar to Aventus.
This is the first fragrance that I have used till the bottle ran empty (100ml) which hopefully shows that this is a vvery safe fragrance to wear on a daily basis. If you are rushing out of the house and you dont know what your day is gonna be like you can always rely on this.

HOWEVER,
The performance is weak, 20-30 mins good projection after that it starts to get more intimate. I would recomment to bring a decant out if you wanna make this last the whole day. I would understand if this is deal breaker for many.

Clean

Dress it up or down as you please, the versatility of this is unmatched, even compared to Club De Nuit Intense Man. Explorer may not last you all day, but that just means you can top it up into the evening or choose a different scent for the evening.

Explorer Montblanc,"This is a really nice fragrance, think of a pineapple-free, smokier batch of Creed Aventus. The ingredients feel good quality, and overall it comes across as a well crafted scent. What puzzles me, though, is how it manages to have such strong longevity while still sitting so close to the skin.

If anyone from Montblanc is reading, please, do whatever it takes to boost the sillage of this fragrance. We’re sad.",09/08/25 01:49,Fragbo
Explorer Montblanc,"Tremendous juice. One of the best purchases on the market. Well-put together, incredibly mass-appealing, versatile, affordable, 8 hours performance. This truly ticks all the boxes.

Lo! At this point in my review I can hear a perfume hobbyist's mouth frothing in the distance. I hear the cry, ""B-but... this is just aventus! It's so unoriginal!! I need something challenging!!""

Indeed! MB Explorer isn't challenging.

It won't make you smell like a rare, esoteric strain of beaver urine drizzled over a mountain of burning tires at the start of the harvest season. It won't make you smell like an dirt-ridden, soggy, milk stained flannel. It might not even make you smell like a perfume-clever-clogs-man-of-distinguished-taste who stands out from the crowd.

However, Explorer does smell good. The first time I wore this, I immediately received a compliment. The advantage of being aventus-inspired and not aventus-impersonating means that this stands alone as a perfume in its own right, unlike the tiresome aventus clones that get wheeled out day after day.",09/08/25 01:28,jk1603

Explorer Montblanc,"Montblanc Explorer is easily the longest lasting fragrance I own. Even outlasting JPG Elixir and Sauvage Elixir. After reading all the reviews, your batch code is very important. Legitimately, my batch of Explorer is absolutely beast mode in every category. My batch code (the one I strongly recommend) is 03P20P096

With that being said, I personally prefer Explorer over Aventus or Aventus Cologne. Aside from it out performing Aventus in every category, Explorer seems smoother, sweeter, and more balanced than the batches of Creed I tried. Additionally, the women prefer Explorer more than Aventus. I had my fiancé blind smell Explorer, Aventus, and Aventus Cologne and everytime Explorer was the favorite.

Lastly, Explorer is a very budget friendly fragrance. I would encourage you to look for my specific batch code for beast mode performance. But with the recent prices hovering between $30-$60, it’s an absolute steal and blind buy safe.

Overall, Montblanc Explorer is an excellent take of Creed Aventus. With my experiences, Explorer is more preferred for your wallet and other people’s noses.",08/25/25 18:49,SmellChef

Explorer Montblanc,"This is honestly really nice. As others have stated, this is not an Aventus clone - I actually like this more, and I think it’s much better value. It swaps out the fruity pineapple for citrus and something a bit crispy and green, which must be the sage. The opening to this is peppery, but the dry down is a dark, incense-laced wood. I can see this working for most seasons, and would be an easy one to transfer from day to night with.

I’m inclined to go for something a bit more niche, but this is lovely for what it is. Definitely going into rotation for me as an everyday option for work or events that is just easy to pick up and be a “crowd pleaser” for those situations.",08/22/25 11:23,jace212

Explorer Montblanc,"Like others have echoed on this review board: if you’re coming into this expecting an Aventus clone, you will be disappointed. While it has some similarities, it does things a bit differently and should be viewed as its own thing.

Honestly, I really enjoy Explorer - to the point where it’s now become a favourite of mine. It surprised me when I finally got my nose on it (and I kept my expectations in check). I recently bought a full bottle and have been using it almost daily ever since.

It starts with a bright burst of citrus and zesty pepper but calms down into a smooth woody patchouli scent profile. There is also a “greenness” to it that I enjoy. The scent radiates like crazy as my fiancé commented for hours after how she could still smell it despite only using a couple of sprays. Definitely potent stuff and a great performer (at least for me on my skin).

It’s a very masculine scent. I think it leans more mature personally but I do know some people think younger folks can wear it too. I’d also say it’s fairly versatile - good for day or night across seasons, and both casual and dressed up situations (just use the right amount of sprays). That being said, I think it’s a bit too sophisticated and overwhelming for the gym so that is one use-case I’d avoid.

Overall, if you are looking for a solid, masculine scent and are a fan of the note breakdown, it’s a no brainer (especially when purchased for a good price via discounters).",08/18/25 07:15,5piece
Explorer Montblanc,"This isn’t really an Aventus dupe, it’s more like a different take. Aventus is super fruity, while this leans citrusy and has that aromatic vibe Aventus doesn’t.",08/18/25 02:42,Christopher Lloydd
Explorer Montblanc,"Explorer can be characterized as an interpretation of Aventus, yet it stands as an independent fragrance distinguished by its light and aromatic qualities, enhanced by the notes of bergamot, vetiver, and patchouli. It is an ideal fragrance for both everyday wear and formal occasions, exuding a smooth and masculine scent. While not overpowering, its presence is subtle and noticeable throughout the day. Wearing this fragrance is not intended to impress others; rather, it is a personal choice for enhancing one’s aroma. Unlike fragrances sought after for compliments, Explorer simply captures attention in a positive way.

Explorer is particularly suitable for office wear or travel due to its moderate intensity. Its projection is not overly strong, lasting approximately two hours at arm length, and its longevity is approximately five to six hours, with a lingering skin scent of Ambroxan thereafter.",08/16/25 18:29,dannyfragrace
Explorer Montblanc,"An excellent everyday wear in most occasions all year round.

BUT: I’ve had several bottles of this over the last couple of years. A couple of the 30ml travel size, a 60ml and now just recently a 100ml bottle. The other smaller bottles always had great performance but this newer 100ml bottle is a real letdown. I love the fragrance and with 3-5 sprays (some on skin and some on clothes) it’s gone within an hour or two. And I’m not going nose blind - nobody else can smell it either.

What happened to the formulation?? The smaller bottles from a couple of years ago would last 6 hours at least, especially on clothing. Doesn’t really seem worth the now elevated price unless you can get it from a discounter for a good deal.",08/16/25 13:24,albertnoel

Weak projection, stays close to the skin and all I get is just the smoke note. Disappointing. I'm so glad I did not buy this. Lesson: always try fragrances on your own skin and wear them for a while, you can never really tell how they will work based on just a paper sample.",08/15/25 00:12,vihri

Explorer Montblanc,"Montblanc Explorer might be the greatest work scent in the entire fragrance universe. Nobody will take anything negative from it... everybody will think you smell really good. It blows my mind how well-received (and compliment-pulling) this fragrance is in a work environment... it just lands so well with female coworkers. I don't fully understand it.

Now.... If you want something a bit more pushy for non-work use, here's a tip — decant and mix Explorer about 60/40 with Afnan Supremacy Not Only Intense. The result is FANTASTIC; it really kicks up the performance of Explorer, plus it fills out the fragrance with more depth and sweetness from the black currant, giving you something much closer to the original Aventus (minus the pineapple, which I never liked).

Explorer Montblanc,"This to me is a manlier, more masculine version of Aventus. It's like Explorer is a sexy, outdoorsy lumberjack and Aventus is his city boy, dressier cousin. There's a after-shave scent hier that Aventus doesn't have. I bought Creed for me and Explorer for a male family member and wearing both on my elbows I prefer the smell of Aventus on me, a woman.",08/11/25 12:56,Irinka. K

Explorer Montblanc,"I blind bought this as a young guy with little fragrance experience. I'd heard it was a safe blind buy and even could be uses as an office scent.

Boy was I in for a shock. As soon as I smelled this, it reminded me of old men, with beard stubble sharp enough to sand down 4x4s. I don't know what note or molecule is giving that effect for me, but to my nose it smells harsh and musky.

All I can detect is musk, leather, and smoke. I wonder if it's the patchouli, or the vetiver, or the ambroxan that has this effect on me. It's not that it smells bad, it's interesting but it smells very strong and hyper manly.

What I've learned from trying this and blind buying a few more fragrances (foolishly), is that I strongly prefer scents that are unisex or masculine leaning, but not so masculine that I couldn't imagine a woman being able to wear it.",08/09/25 22:54,RainyN1ght
Explorer Montblanc,"This fragrance is basically just Aventus but with less depth and softer around the edges. To me it takes the idea of Aventus and strips away all the character, leaving only the core essence. Which is not to say that it is a bad fragrance, it smells nice. The opening is vaguely reminicent of Sauvage to me with the bergamont and pepper. It quickly turns into Aventus, though it doesnt have the same smokeyness that exists in Aventus. Longevity and projection on my skin are fine. While not a bad Aventus inspired fragrance, there are many similar fragrances that have more depth and character.",08/07/25 20:45,SomethingEdgy

+ Does not smell cheap or low quality
+ Pretty decent value wise

- There are better alternatives for the money.",08/07/25 06:36,tmbt

Explorer Montblanc,This is 1 to 1 to Aventus’s opening. They differ in scent after 10-15 or so minutes as Explorer goes more to a fresh/woody citrus in contrast to Aventus becoming a smokier scent.

spray after shower and sit in your sofa and watch TV, if you step outside the house the smell will fade in 2 hours or less

Explorer Montblanc,"I like the drydown of Mont Blanc Explorer. It reminds me a bit of the drydown of Brunello Cucinelli Pour Homme. I think the ambroxen shared by both have a lot to do with that. But pepper, clary sage, and woods have something to do with it too. The Explorer scent profile is sort of like an Aventus/Brunello Cucinelli Pour Homme hybrid. Certainly enough of a profile variance with Aventus to make Explorer an interesting and affordable alternative, yet similar enough to interest fans of the Aventus profile.",07/25/25 16:04,JmThms

Between this and L'Aventure, I now know Aventus DNA is not for me. I'm just not into smelling like a pine tree.

Anyway, I picked up a 30ml last night at Burlington’s for way cheap, and I gotta say it’s like an old friend. Really came here to say that I’m not having issues with performance. I guess it’s truly hit or miss for everyone which is a bummer. I have one spray on each wrist and it’s giving consistent wafts as I move about the day. Can’t really speak on longevity just yet, but as far as sillage—yeah man it’s there.",07/18/25 08:57,jfram

Explorer Montblanc,"im absolutely addicted to this scent profile. this doenst smell like aventus, or cedrat boise, or hacivat. i like this stuff a lot, it was one of my first real frags. the sage that pierces through with the pepper and patchouli reminds me of the pine smells when walking around my neighborhood. i think it's really the addition of sage that makes me like explorer so much. wish this lasted longer, but def one of my signature scents. also the price for retail is great, unbeatable on Jomashop",07/16/25 08:40,dhera10

So, i've gone through a lot of cologne and realized that I only really needed one cologne and for me this was the one. I've worn this cologne to the gym, work, school, and other occasions. I just spray and go and It does the job very well. This cologne is a very nice citrus with a nice woody background. It's more subtle than it is strong, which I prefer because I don't like the nauseating/cloying effect of a strong cologne. I fell in love with this cologne and will continue loving it. I will definitely be buying another bottle once I am finished with this one.",07/15/25 12:00,Atosukii
Explorer Montblanc,"This is a great, great fragrance for what it is. And this is an important point. Yes, it is heavily inspired on Aventus, but they didn't try to recreate it exactly or give it a boost on performance or a twist or whatever, like other inspirations. Montblance took that and tried to make a designer version of that fragrance, taking its strengths into the desinger world and functionality, what does this means? Well That it is maybe not as deep or complex as the original Aventus (which isn't very artistry for that matter) but took the profile into a super mass appealing, versatile, and modern masculine territory, and in that regard they understood the asignment really well.

In the opening you can smel a bit citrusy pink pepper (which is a fresh and invigorating spice for itself) and then the vetiver is what takes the show, but not a classic/barbershop vetiver, is a more earthy, dark, woody and modern vetiver that feels masculine and modern. Not blue, ""fresh and clean"" or shower gel by any means so its a great alternative to all that genre that still feels safe and appealing without being teeny or sweet in the slightest. And yes the superpower of this is that is extremely versatile both in profile and performance-wise, from jeans and hoodie to semi formal you will always smell good and masculine without trying hard or making an statement. I actually use my bottle as my ""ultra casual"" scent: videogames nights with friends, lazy sundays, supermaket, late night tacos, whatever, is subtle but last a good 3-4 hours so take that, is is not any bomb frag. Maybe I would love it more if it was a bit stronger but it is what it is I guess. Still this is one of the best dumb reaches in modern masculine perfumery. Like, if you could only have a single designer fragrance this could be a heavy contender

Is funny how people see Ambroxan as a note and immediately start making comparisons with Sauvage like it is the Ambroxan staple. This does not smell remotely close to Sauvage in any department. And Ambroxan is used in so much more fragrances that the ones that list it in modern perfumery.",07/15/25 11:26,ljundia

It is, in fact, a masterpiece in its own right.

I have a modest collection and lots of samples, but I'm continually reaching for this bottle for the refreshment and joy I know it will bring me when I spray it on. It's also gotten the most compliments of anything I own.

For the price, I can afford to spray as much as I want, whenever I want. It's an excellent value. I carry a bottle with me so I can get my fix.

Just buy it. You can thank me later.",07/15/25 02:01,StarshipExcalibur

Explorer Montblanc,"So i purchased a big bottle of this stuff right at the beginning of building an actual collection in 2023. Back then, I was definitely chasing longer lasting frags, big scent bubbles, all of that. Gave the bottle away after purchasing cdnim edp, and getting insane performance from it. After giving my bottle of MBE away, I very soon, and for a solid uear, regretted it and wanted this stuff back in my collection, so I caved and bought it again.

This is EASILY my favorite fresh type fragrance. It sits within the Aventus wheelhouse, but it severely lacks the birchy/smoky vibe of Aventus, leaving you a crazy fresh citrus, leather, ambroxen bomb. This is what I hoped Aventus would smell like, it's what I hoped CDNIM would smell like, but this? If you boosted the performance a bit more, this would be my end all be all fragrance. The one I reach for on days i don't know what to wear. I have noticed as the scent sits on you longer and longer, it does develop a somewhat ""mossy"" version of the smokiness that Aventus and CDNIM have, but its still different enough that I feel I could wear CDNIM or Aventus tomorrow to work, and it feel different, but as it goes, and especially gets later into the longevity, I do get a somewhat fresh smokiness that comes out more and more as it fades. As insanely redundant as it would be, I STRONGLY feel that one of these clone companies REALLY should take MBE apart, and then clone it exactly, but boost the performance a bit more, at it's price point (around $45US when I got a 3.4oz bottle) I wouldn't imagine it being that hard to pick apart and reproduce.

It's everything I fell in love with the first time, and maybe my nose has gotten smarter, but the performance seems to have actually improved on my end from the first bottle in 2023... The longevity as I sit, 7 hours into a wearing, it's still going, a bit lighter, but still going. I cant lie, I read SO many reviews here talking about a lacking atomizer, so I will admit, I gave it 26 sprays, and it gave me the desired performance. My first bottle, the last time I used it, 40 puffs, and it was gone 3 hours later. So either they improved it a bit, or my skin care routine is great. 😂 almost 10 hours into the wearing, and the longevity is still definitlely present on my shirt, but on skin, it is now a fairly light, but still noticeable skin scent. In the end, I'd give it about a 10 hour duration in total. Felt nice moving my moderate longevity rating here to a long lasting one.

The sillage is there, definitely lighter, inoffensive, and good for being around anyone sensitive to fragrance, but its not as light as some say. Definitely provides a little bubble through it's duration. It's just lighter than most, especially if you're used to beast mode stuff.

Pulled probably 5 or 6 compliments right off the bat in the first couple hours at work with this one too. my coworkers know I love fragrance, and atleast 3 of them had to know what it was I had on.

I do believe there is an anosmic trait to this fragrance a bit, as I was having a slightly hard time detecting it on myself at points, but at around the 8 hour mark of wearing it, I asked a coworker if they still smelled it, and they said absolutely, whereas in the moment, I 100% could NOT smell it on me at all.

For me, this one is reserved for the sticky hot summer days where I'm guaranteed to be hot and even sweaty. It seems to thrive in that environment especially. All in all, you could genuinely wear this for ANY occasion, day, night, hot, cold, it doesn't really matter. A great work fragrance as well. I personally would never use this in any weather under probably 80, but thats also why I have 52 other bottles to cycle out for the other weather.

REALLY glad I got another bottle of this. I'll actually end up using and enjoying this one. 😌 Don't be afraid to spray the shit out of it though... It's cheap enough that it didn't hurt burning through what most people would wear in a month, in one day. :P",07/10/25 19:14,ISmellGood93
Explorer Montblanc,"A favourite. Slight citrus opening. More mellow than CDN, not as strong of a scent. No need for maceration. Vetiver and leather are primarily the notes that linger. Sillage was good and scent lasted a while, at least for my bottle. 10/10",07/08/25 03:52,JoshKosh08
Explorer Montblanc,"Steer clear from this one if you're seeking an Aventus dupe. Its harsh on the nose and an obnoxious mix of Aventus and Sauvage. For a quarter of the price of Explorer, go for Zara Vibrant Leather Elixir which is a much better clone of Aventus.

Explorer Montblanc,"Got the one ounce bottle and I'm wondering if that's why I find the projection to be atrocious. The sprayer/nozzle is pretty small on that bottle. Most of my criticisms revolve around that fact that it barely projects at all. But with that said, here's my experience: The intial spray of this smells like Aventus, dead on Aventus. And then Aventus is GONE for about three hours. What remains is a very weak smelling Montblanc Legend- actually to me it smells more like a $20 knockoff Sean Jean I bought in NYC a dozen years ago with barely enough oil in it to smell good for the instant that you spray it. This sits CLOSE to the skin. It is pleasant, but I'm not convinced anyone around you can smell it. Three hours after spraying it, a faint Aventus smell returns. Things smell nice, but perform poorly. The fragrance itself is extremely versatile and I think on a super hot day I wouldn't hesitate to reach for it like I do CDNIM. That one ounce bottle might contribute to a small spray/weak performance, but it makes a great travel bottle.",07/03/25 17:35,robvs
Explorer Montblanc,"An excellent interpretation of Aventus. Maybe not as strong, doesn't last quite as long, doesn't project as well, but I think Explorer is comparable in all metrics. Great value for money. Not much else to say, other than this is pretty damn good!",07/03/25 12:26,davepol
Explorer Montblanc,"I wore this again recently after many years and realized why I stopped wearing it: vetiver is the clear and dominant note.

Explorer Montblanc,"Will always be my favorite Aventus style affordable alternative. The fresher take without the heavy smoky note is so well done.

Explorer Montblanc,"The opening notes in Explorer made me sigh in disappointment. As I continue learning and understanding my note preferences better, this one just wouldn’t make the list right off the bat.

It opens with a strong burst of vetiver, along with some other deep, unrecognisable notes that evolve into that classic masculine scent I dread the most. I'm still on the fence with vetiver. For now, I can tolerate Haitian vetiver, but not its woodier, deeper counterpart, Java vetiver. Fortunately, the vetiver in Explorer is Haitian, and it does become more subtle and toned down over time.

The bergamot disappears almost instantly. I couldn’t help but chuckle; it vanished like a breeze. Ambroxan steps in, replacing vetiver as the lead solo until the very end. It’s quite linear from start to finish, and I can definitely catch a bit of that Sauvage vibe.

My nose is still pretty green, and right now I’m leaning more towards freshies, so it makes sense why this one isn’t really hitting for me.

I expected bolder notes or riskier transitions, especially for something marketed as an ‘Explorer’ but it turned out to be a safe, mass-appealing ‘City Dweller’ that wouldn’t even dare venture down an alleyway, let alone the countryside.

From my experience, the compliments I’ve received haven’t been anything over the top more like “Oh, that smells nice” rather than “Wow, what are you wearing?!” So while it might not turn heads, it definitely gets a solid “okay, good perfume” reaction, which is fine by me.

Explorer Montblanc,"Like all Montblanc fragrances, they’re cheap in price and smell mediocre.
Anyone rocking Montblanc scents, especially Explorer and Legend Spirit, is usually the type who uses a 20-in-1 product and thinks that’s peak grooming.

They call this a modernized Creed Aventus type fragrance. It’s boring, definitely doing its own thing, but the drydown does smell somewhat like Aventus.

It opens with a standard, boring citrus top note, and that part disappears almost instantly. What’s left is a strange drydown with hints of licorice and leather, two notes I really don’t enjoy. The result is a weird, unappealing scent.

Now, I normally don’t care about bottles. But this one is the ugliest, most annoying bottle I’ve ever owned. It’s way too heavy for what it is. You can’t see how much is left, and the design is dull and uninspiring.

I really tried to like this, thought it might be a fresh take on Aventus for warm summer days. But it evaporates into nothing within an hour. Honestly, this has some of the worst longevity I’ve ever experienced, right up there with La Nuit de L’Homme.

In the end, I’m genuinely grateful I got rid of it. I’m thankful I don’t wear it, and even more thankful I don’t own it anymore.",06/15/25 16:37,Eau de GT
Explorer Montblanc,"I usually perform pretty well from Explorer, with a wear time of around 6 to 8 hours. In terms of scent, it is similar to Aventus but starts to diverge during the dry down. It's extremely affordable on discount sites, making it arguably one of the best fresh fragrances available at this price point. While I believe Dylan Blue might be a better choice for those new to fragrances, Explorer stands out as an overall superior option.

Performance is solid for the price point—nothing beastly, but it’ll last you through most of the day with decent projection early on.

If you’re looking for a dependable everyday scent that’s easy to wear, smells great, and won’t break the bank, Explorer is a strong pick. Great for casual wear or even a fancy gathering. Definitely worth checking out.",06/09/25 22:18,Nauticus9

After hearing the Aventus hype/MBE clone talk I blind bought a travel size Aventus. They are in the same wheel house but I don’t think MBE is a clone. Really more of a flanker type. The MBE is an easier, less in your face, subdued scent and I honestly get MORE compliments with MBE than with Aventus. The performance can be pretty variable from bottle to bottle but otherwise it’s a great fresh.

I kind of understand the comparisons to Aventus, but they’re completely different beasts with only vaguely similar DNA. Explorer lacks the crisp, fruity elegance of Aventus and smells like a cheap parody of a modern classic.

Explorer Montblanc,"The dumbest of dumb reaches, and one of the best Aventus-likes out there. You could wear this on most occasions. Not groundbreaking but a pleasant fruity fresh and musky fragrance that doesn't break the bank. VERY masculine. Moderate projection and sillage, longevity is a little disappointing for an EDP but at discounter price you can't be mad. If you're looking for a fragrance to start your collection I highly recommend this for it's mass appealing aroma and relatively inexpensive price. 7.5/10",05/22/25 18:05,gamecube
Explorer Montblanc,"It is quite crazy just how well Montblanc did with this. It sits perfectly between Aventus and Aventus Cologne, which I have a feeling came out after this but I need to check. I’m not really sure what more could be asked of a fragrance at this price range. And although I think there’s a place for luxury fragrances at higher prices, I think it’s hard to root for Creed given how transparently rapacious their business has become. I think this is all I would ever need to scratch the Aventus itch, and it smells great to those around you. I do think noseblindness seems to come with the territory for this one, and so I wouldn’t worry too much about some people’s performance complaints, it’s pretty spot on average in that regard. 8.5/10",05/22/25 15:55,Scentered1997

Explorer Montblanc,"People don't understand the essence of this scent. Look at the ad.

It smells like an adventurous man on a journey into the unknown. I can see guys like a Bear Grylls smell like this.

It's not aventus at all, more like sauvage edt and parfum.",05/22/25 01:53,givenchyy

Explorer Montblanc,"Alot of people say this is a Creed Aventus clone. But to me it goes in it's own way. The citrus isn't to much, just right. The dry down is good. My first week wearing this got me 9 compliments.",05/18/25 07:12,Nick84
Explorer Montblanc,"I will GIVE AN HONEST REVIEW.

I have all three Creed Av, Nishane and Cedrat Boise — and MontBlanc is a mix of all. It leans more towards a citrus base in the opening, but the overall type of smell from the cap gives me a mix of Cedrat Boise and Creed Av, but it smells kinda fruity with that woody and citrus blended well with aromatics, but it is still NOT anything close to Creed Av or the other fragrances.

Opening/cap smell is somewhat 60-70% similar to Creed Av and 75-80% to Cedrat Boise and 20-30% to Nishane with that woody base. NO DUPE.

Also, base notes/middle notes are on itself different. Does not project well and lasts very shortly, but the smell is mid and good just to use as a freshie/quick/out-of-the-shower type of scent. Nothing specia.",05/17/25 15:07,Carter001
Explorer Montblanc,"A weaker, less sweet version of Aventus. Musky, a little leathery, and sweet although pineapple is not listed in the notes. I'm so bored of this scent DNA. Played out.",05/17/25 10:57,ws1482

I sprayed 8 sprays all over my skin and shirt. This is also leaning on citrus and leather pink paper. Dumont Nitro Black actually smells like Aventus. Juicy Pineapple, Black currant and Birch smokiness. Do not recommend Explorer.",05/09/25 06:06,Chrispy83
Explorer Montblanc,"Nice inspired fragrance of Aventus.
It isn't fruity pineaple like Aventus, more bergamot and citrus in the opening. The woods and spiciness in the drydown are a little harsh and synthetic.
Its a little bit overpriced for an Aventus style dna in my opinion.
There are better and cheaper alternatives on the market like Afnan Supremacy Silver",05/07/25 12:52,Arber Cami

Explorer Montblanc,"Poor, poor Explorer. Too close to Creed Aventus to have your own identity, too far away to be called a ""good"" clone. Regardless of its proximity to Aventus, it's sound enough in its construction to stand alone. It doesn't have the pineapple note that Aventus has, using bergamot for its tartness instead. The pink pepper, patchouli, and vetiver give it a nice woody crispness that wears well with just about anything that isn't formal evening dress. It's a light, very tasteful scent that's less commanding than Aventus.",05/02/25 14:15,Telamon
Explorer Montblanc,"I bought a Creed Aventus in Milan 2017 by 249 €, I bought Montblanc Explorer black before a month by 60 $. I feel Explorer is more comfortable and less bitter than Aventus.

Explorer Montblanc,smell is really good very similar to creed aventus but weaker than aventus. also price is of course lower than aventus.,04/28/25 11:58,5bes5
Explorer Montblanc,"Even though this is technically a flanker of Aventus, it’s far better — and honestly, the best flanker of the Aventus DNA out there. The Aventus DNA has been passed around so many times — some great, some bad — but nothing ever truly beat the masterpiece that was Creed Aventus... until this came around. I was originally gifted this fragrance for my birthday, and what a birthday gift it was. If you want an everyday scent that gives you less of a headache than Aventus, lasts slightly longer, and pulls compliments left and right, this is the one. It’s easily one of my favorite signature scents. It never gets old, it’s always pleasing to the nose, and it’s just timeless.

Explorer Montblanc,"Great quality for a decent price. This is very fresh and masculine but not in a boring shower gel-ish way. The pineapple is quite bright, there's strong woodiness, it's rich but inoffensive. If you want Aventus on a budget without going for a clone, this is your fragrance. 7.5/10",04/23/25 10:48,Tom Sweep
Explorer Montblanc,"Mont Blanc Explorer is a fragrance that truly impresses with its versatility, making it the perfect choice for daily wear in any season. Right from the first spray, the pink pepper note stands out, adding a vibrant and refreshing twist that captivates the senses. This makes it an excellent option for both casual outings and professional environments, where a refined yet approachable scent is essential.
While Mont Blanc Explorer may not hold the same iconic status as Creed Aventus, it undeniably carves out its own identity within a man's fragrance collection. One of the most compelling aspects of this fragrance is its affordability; you can find a 100 ML bottle for around $45, which is a fantastic value considering the quality it offers.
I would rate Mont Blanc Explorer an impressive 8.8 out of 10. It blends sophistication, versatility, and affordability seamlessly, making it a standout choice for anyone looking to enhance their fragrance wardrobe.",04/23/25 03:35,BradyFrags

Explorer Montblanc,"Of all the OG aventus inspired fragrances, this one is the best smelling one. As mentioned by many reviews it's not a 1:1 clone but very close and amazing quality. Yes CDNIM perform better but doesn't come close to the quality of Explorer on skin. If performance is the most important aspect to you, get CDNIM. If you enjoy high quality perfumes and don't care about filling the room with your scent, Explorer is the one to get - Class in a bottle!

Also super fast nose blindness alert but believe me, it's long lasting.",04/10/25 15:21,yashvardan
Explorer Montblanc,Starts off with some herbal spice and citrus. Some leather sort of hypes up the masculinity drying down to some peppery and musky patchouli rounding out the entire scent. Very enjoyable and somewhat fresh as opposed to a warm and heavy scent.,04/10/25 02:32,Killsocket
Explorer Montblanc,10/10 fragrance that cannot offend anyone in a crowd. the aromatic smell gives a smooth great smell.,04/09/25 18:57,Smookies
Explorer Montblanc,"The opening is very fresh, bright & citrusy due to bergamote and clary sage along with little spicyness of pink papper. After 15-20 minutes the leather comes to play the role in a nice way ( not being smoky like in aventus and CDNIM).

The drydown is very woody and earthy because of patchouli and vetiver with the touch of warm ambroxan. The longevity is 6 hours with 6-7 spray with 1-2 feet of projection for an hour thenafter only arms length projection till the end.

Overall it is great interpretation of aventus DNA by removing juicy pinapple and added more freshness. It is very versatile and cheaper option so great to go with it.",04/09/25 08:47,Scent_addict

The dry down is an excellent woodiness that feels classy even though this stuff is a steal. For what you pay, you can't loose with this stuff. The only issue is longevity, but just reapply. You can afford it with the value. Perfect signature scent or daily wear.

Explorer Montblanc,"Montblanc Explorer known as an Aventus clone, but I don’t really think it resembles it that much. This one feels more like it’s offering its own interpretation of Aventus’s mossy and pineapple side. It’s an excellent fragrance, and the price is also reasonable. Although it is edp, I can’t say the same for longevity and projection though, they could’ve been better. I think it’s time for Montblanc to release an Explorer Elixir or Intense version. Anyway, I gave it 9/10. If longevity and projection were better, I would’ve definitely rated it 10/10.",04/05/25 11:10,CptnRex
Explorer Montblanc,"Great product with a really good value. I read from more experienced users that this one emulates much more premium bottles which is great for anyone to hear.

I think this one is easily capable of a signature scent for many. The scent profile is easily enjoyable for most with very little probability that someone hates it. It does have a nice clean, yet natural smell to it, credited to the selected blend. Definitely give this one a smell if you see it.",04/05/25 03:08,TSmell

Explorer Montblanc,"For the price paid, you get a likeable scent and good performance along with the versatility of the scent profile. Overall, money well spent. When I first tested this (a year before I bought it), it was at a drugstore in the winter and the notes were so nondescript and weak I could barely smell anything. When I tried it again in the summer, this stuff (or perhaps my olfactory system) came alive. Fresh, smooth, well-blended. I definitely smell the vetiver, bergamot and ambroxan most of all and all of which are nice, but I would prefer if the patchouli and/or oud accord were more prominent. I found myself going anosmic with this more than any other scent I've tried or worn. You really could wear this anywhere and just about any time.

Where: Casual or office. Occasion/date wear if you're not feeling adventurous whatsoever.
When: All seasons at any time.",04/01/25 07:02,ScentOfJava

Then I had used 99% of the bottle I'm talking >5ml and I had left it in my draw as summer days were over and wasn't wearing it anymore, the next summer comes around and I see a couple sprays left this thing had macerated into a beast, so much smokier and sexier. So buy this and let it macerate for a while and the performance and the smell is just amplified.",03/28/25 03:09,Lmchx
Explorer Montblanc,"One of the bests of all time smooth classy and elegant, had a couple of bottles from different years and batches and they all perform above average, y'all just got fakes or went nose blind, I got compliments several hours after wearing explorer and that's solid proof that it's long lasting.

This is the less synthetic inspiration of aventus the other clones especially the Arabic clones all have a strong synthetic feel to them they smell good only in the air but weird up close, mont blanc explorer smell good up close and in the air because it's quality. Make no mistake I like CDNIM for it's beast mode and dry down, but this one is better quality period and I prefer quality and more natural smelling fragrances than a synthetic mess with beast mode.

I give it a solid 9/10. I do believe though that Mont Blanc Explorer is its own thing, similar to aventus yeah but it goes a different direction.

Nb: I own aventus and of course aventus quality is better than all the clones and inspirations.

Explorer Montblanc,"My second fragrance in my now 30 fragrance collection. It is good; bergamot is on the top; it is one of the most used notes, and because of that this can feel redundant or boring. In Explorer that top not of citrus/bergamot, combined with vetiver makes a very estringent combination, but here it is tempered by the use of leather and cacao, this creates a very brown citrus. The complaints about the performance are valid, but the delight it gives in 3 to 5 hours are worth it, considering the price of explorer. I find it interesting, very simplistic, i always associate this with the way i think a pilot would smell.
Still relevant after 5 years.",03/26/25 06:32,Robcal08

Explorer Montblanc,"This is king of the entry-level frags. It's absurdly versatile, but that too is its weakness: those who prefer loud & bold might be disappointed. Another thing worth nothing is that the performance + projection isn't quite up to par with comparable EDPs. However I'd take the criticism of its performance with a grain of salt -- my ability to sense it on myself was far stronger before I regularly started applying it. If you're curious I'd say take the plunge.",03/22/25 17:32,crescentlike

I literally woke up a day after i sprayed this (6 sprays), got into a pool, got out, and i still could smell this, yes very close to the skin but it was there.
In terms of the scent, I don't know if this is unique but it is a masterpiece. Totally masculine scent and able to be a signature scent. all year round for sure. If you look for ""how does a MAN smell"" in google, this will pop up. I compared this next to Cedrat Boise from Mancera and I prefer this all the way.

Explorer Montblanc,"I'm still new to the fragrance world (started in late November 2024) and Explorer was one of the first bottles I purchased after sampling a 5ml decant. I also own CDNIM EDT as well as a decant of Creed Aventus (I will get a big bottle later, down the road). I love this scent profile and DNA of pineapple citrus, smokey, woodiness. And because I'm still new to fragrances, I haven't been burned out by this scent profile like others. I have also learned everyone has different skin, oils and chemistry that interact with different fragrances and what may work well for some will not work as well for others.

With all that said, Explorer does not project as much as CDNIM and that's a good thing to me. I personally get about 5 hours with the last couple of hours being more of a skin scent. By the 7 hour mark, it's pretty much completely faded. Like others have stated, I cannot really smell anything after about an hour. However, I have had people comment on my scent after 2-3 hours. So, I know for me, I had gone noseblind. It is versatile and ideal for me as an office scent, smaller, more intimate gatherings, attending church, or being out and about during the day. I do tend to overspray a little bit more with this fragrance compared to others in my collection. And I can wear it pretty much all-year where I live here in Las Vegas, Nevada. Value for dollar, it's a great choice to me.",03/20/25 14:02,glenndaz

Explorer Montblanc,"Explorer by Montblanc is a nice, easy-to-wear, and versatile men’s fragrance. It features a blend of citrus, spice, wood, and aromatic notes, making it a well-balanced and fresh scent. While it doesn’t have the longest-lasting performance, it leaves a pleasant masculine citrusy freshness that feels clean and approachable.

That said, it leans towards being somewhat generic and lacks a strong creative edge. Nevertheless, it serves as an easy grab-and-go fragrance for daily wear.

So, after watching a bunch of influencers I thought that I would give Explorer a try.
Opening was a brutal chemical punch in the face. The dry down lightens up on the chemical overload but still comes across as synthetic and a bit harsh.

Update: I gave it a few weeks and it seems to have improved.

OK, I think that I may actually like this now.
It is growing on me.

A bit synthetic on first spray but after a few minutes it settles into a solid mass appealing summer scent. Performance is meh but I don't mind an intimate scent. 8/10",10/27/25 11:22,Therazz100
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"So, this one is pretty straightforward. A clean, soapy scent. Quite masculine as well. It smells like soap, but brought to perfection. Straight out of the shower. I can see why some people hype this up: it's a simple scent profile, but very well done. I've gotten a good share of compliments at the gym and out on the street. It projects in a moderate way, so it's not overbearing. The price is also quite appealing. Huge W",10/26/25 11:12,imnot_dnsz
Legend Spirit Montblanc,The first fragrance I’ve ever owned. It reminds me of freshman year of high school. Performance is nuclear on my skin. Versatile musk and bergamot bomb.,10/21/25 20:06,BRANSFRAGRANCE
Legend Spirit Montblanc,This drills your nostrils for 10 minutes giving you nausea and a headache and then its just a synthetic wood junk smell on your t-shirt until it fades 30 minutes later. It fades away and becomes unnoticeable from here to the door. This kind of fragrance was made to smell amazing in a store because of the opening to snatch and capture customers who don't test for the dry down.,10/20/25 19:24,Thepassionofthefashion

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"As time goes on, I've come to appreciate this more and more. Admittedly I didn't think that much of this to begin with, but it is actually really fantastic and great at what it does.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"This fragrance is so mass appealing that if you do not like the smell of it, you are the issue. My most compliment getter and there is a reason for it because it blends a clean musky aroma with this fresh citrus and grapefruit. Cant remember what rasasi hawas smells like but if Mont Blanc can make this fragrance last 8+ hours and project good, then this would be one of the best fragrances of all time. Might be blasphemy but as a straight male I think this is better than imagination in terms of cleanliness factor and scent profile that is masculine. But unfair considering Imagination is unisex but it doesn't come close to the scent of this.",09/13/25 19:58,jahanfragrance
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Still the best Montblanc fragrance I have experienced, it's so just good and as @hubbabubba suggested with his comment, it's not just a sweet bubblegum scent for teenagers, it's isn't even very sweet, certainly not compared to what has been released in recent times. This is an addictive scent which to me has different layers and with various elements coming to the fore at different times, possibly reacting with different conditions. One of those feel-good fragrances that will always have a place in my heart.

Close to perfection but I would still be interested in an EDP/parfum version 😉",09/12/25 06:29,Dark Owl
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"This fragrance really shows that you cannot blindly trust reviewers or the community because this is not what I'd expected at all. The ""bubblegum"" aspect that you often seen touted around this fragrance is vastly overstated, yes there is a little bit of sweetness and bubblegumminess but this is absolutely not some sweet gourmand or some childish scent. There's a deep, surprisingly spicy, masculinity to this one, the peppery and woody aspects of this fragrance are very underrated and comes through quite clearly.

Very masculine, not at all a ""teenager fragrance"" in my opinion.

This is definitely at its peak during spring, summer and fall, but the spicy and sweet aspects of this makes it even viable for colder months.

But get the idea of tutti-frutti bubblegum out of your head because that is not at all what this fragrance is all about.",09/10/25 10:32,hubbabubba

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I got this for very cheap and I have to say I'm definitely pleased. Legend Spirit is not the most standout or sophisticated fragrance out there, but it's great for what it does. It's citrusy, fresh, but still some other aromatics to keep it balanced, like pink pepper, musk, and woody notes. Best suited for a sunny spring or summer day and is also appreciated by most people in my experience. I recommend for anyone looking for a cheap and fresh fragrance.",09/07/25 05:13,mww07
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Not that similar to Nautica Voyage. Voyage is more shower fresh, Spirit is more fruity, maybe even a bit of a fruit candy.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Yeah since its goning to be discontinued or reformulated I decided to give this frag another chance, since it seems to be rly popular with ladies & gymbros.... and yeah.
Its start bright, like true white florals & dew on grass scent, but mainly that white flowers.
Thats continue to that watery notes-more like steam, since its not that air-y bc. Of other notes (rly simmilar to Nautica Voyage !!!)

I wanted to like this scent, but i can't. Its like that guy, who: Has no friends. No bc. Of his smell, he wears clean shirt + tie every time, but has some weight & straight bit oily hair. And in the end, he even dont want to talk to other ppl. (not describe myself at all) he wear this fragrance as routine, not bc he like it but someone told him so years back.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"When i was a kid my family had a membership at a racquet club. Not the exclusive, high end club, but a nice athletic club. The men's locker room was off limits to any under 17, but 12 and up could go in with dad accompanying. The locker room had a guy who handed out the towels when washing your hands (real fluffy white towels!) and for the guys who showered he had a ""secret ingredients"" aftershave that he would allow the men to spray on. It was an awesome, clean athletic smell. Didn't last very long but I associate that smell with fresh from the shower cleanliness. It is a big memory from my childhood.

Legend Spirit is the closest fragrance I have found to that secret aftershave spray. Smells like fresh from the shower at the club after a hard workout. And that's how i wear it now. 2-3 sprays after the shower at my work gym. Perfect freshie!",07/21/25 12:54,Rainman1124

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"How could you have anything bad to say about this legend (no pun intended)? One of my first fragrances, and I'm never disappointed to wear it. It's unique, mass-appealing, sexy, and awesome. I see this as less of a summer fragrance and more as an all-season fragrance. Have worn this in the winter plenty of times and it's amazing. The slight sweetness is what makes it so intoxicating. Also, why are u fools wearing fragrances to the gym? Chuck on some deodorant like a normal person and start cranking iron.",07/15/25 00:02,4Infvsi0n
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"This one is very citrusy. Like, aggressively citrusy. First sniff had me thinking of Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce vibes because of that citrus blast, but then it started leaning into Nautica Voyage territory. It’s kind of like if those two did a fusion dance and became one lemony aquatic scent.

For around $25, it’s not a bad cheapie at all. Smells clean, fresh, and like you put in at least some effort. I know Legend Spirit and Nautica Voyage are often compared when it comes to budget summer scents, but personally? I’d go with Voyage. It’s like ten bucks cheaper on Jomashop, a bit softer on the nose, and doesn’t hit you with a toilet cleaner vibe.

And to be fair, Legend Spirit doesn’t totally cross into harsh-cleaner territory, but it’s close. Not in a bad way, just... you’ll know what I mean when you smell it. It’s fresh, but also kind of sharp. Definitely better than smelling like B.O., but not something I’d full bottle. Maybe a good gym bag frag or something you throw on for those really humid days.

Solid aquatic, a bit too heavy on the citrus for me, but not a bad grab if you want something cheap, loud, and clean.",07/12/25 18:14,averycj

I prefer this over both Invictus and Hawas, as it feels less overwhelming and far less synthetic.
It's a pleasant, linear scent with moderate projection that lasts around three to four hours. The price is affordable, so I don't mind reapplying throughout the day. It's suitable for hot, humid weather or in close environments, such as the gym or workplace.",07/05/25 01:41,Marxwick
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"The first time I smelled this the first thing that came to my mind was a ""Damn, this thing is common asf"" and ""This is the kinda smell that your cool uncle would wear"".

Mister, let me tell you I was wrong.

I don't know if the perfume masturbated or whatever happens when air goes into the bottle or me that wasn't smelling correctly but, now smells AWESOME, a lot of fruits with sugarish water (in a fresh way, not gourmandish) with some sweaty skin odor (I think is the musk) in a clean way.

Just buy it, it is a 9.4/10.

Thank u Jeremy Fragrance for recommending this.",07/03/25 10:18,Yuu_19
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"A lovely, addictive scent. I like this way, way more than the OG Legend. Nothing wrong with being so close to A&F's Fierce, but I wore that during highschool and college so it's hard to wear Legend without feeling like a kid again (sometimes a good thing, sometimes not).

Legend Spirit is better from the start simply by being more unique and more versatile. There is a overwhelming sense of freshness that comes across and lingers through the whole profile. This must be the ""water notes"" listed. I personally don't smell the citrus, but I do get something here that is sweet, a tiny bit fruity, but not overwhelmingly so. Maybe the lavender? Maybe the cardamom? Whatever it is, it helps this fresh, aquatic smell become something almost mouthwatering. And then it gets even better as it dries down and the musk starts to come out. This is one of those summer scents that can be sprayed in the early afternoon and be absolutely perfect, and stays perfect as the day transitions into evening and the scent matures on your skin.

I personally don't get the performance issues others are complaining about. It's not a beast-mode fragrance, no, but I'm of the opinion that sometimes subtlety is the best strategy. With it being a EDT in mind, I spray 7-8 times (3-4 times on chest/back of neck, 2 times on each inner elbow) and I can easily pick it up as I move around 10 hours later. There have even been times where, a solid 12 hours later, I couldn't quite pick it up myself but my wife would comment about how good I smell when I walk by.

For how much a 100ml bottle costs (at discounters, cough cough), this is an absolutely killer deal. A dumb grab n spray everyday warm weather fragrance that actually has some depth and interest and smells amazing?

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Released in 2016 but still one of the nicest smelling designer fragrances (decent longevity too). It doesn't smell cheap at all to me, I'm surprised by some of the negative comments.

I finished my bottle last year but have yet to find something I like more in this type of fragrance, which is something of an all-rounder that still works well in warm weather. Just a great blend that is fresh yet somehow cosy or comforting, the sweetness never gets sticky. In the drydown there's an underlying scent of cleanliness with a soft touch of spice that makes it nothing outrageous yet still very compelling.

Even though I find the trend of some brands to release several versions of the same scent (flankers of flankers) a tad boring and unimaginative, I would LOVE to see an EDP version of this one but only if the scent stays true to the EDT.",06/13/25 04:36,Dark Owl

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Prime example why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Legend Spirit opens up with an amazing fresh and juicy blast of citrus which you quickly fall in love with... aaaaand the fragrance starts to eat shit after 15 minutes. It turns into a synthetic mess with abysmal performance and as a bonus I get some sort of weird metallic note that really really REALLY rubs me the wrong way. Longevity is as much as you'd expect from a mid quality citrus edt such as this (2-3 hours or less). Projection is meh.
I've heard many people declare LS as some sort of gym fragrance holy grail, however I wouldn't even give it that.

Now this may be just my nose but to me this is slightly more mature than the OG but its very slight.

What I get when it comes to longevity its 6-8hrs with about 1–1-1/2hrs of projection. This is not a beast mode fragrance, but its no pushover either. Its very mass appealing.

For the record it's got grapefruit and bergamot, and lavender, and musk, plus tons of synthetic notes to boot.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I like it for what it is. A grab and go or dumb reach scent. I have the EDP that I prefer but this one would be the second one I prefer from the ones I have tried from the legend line. They are different profiles, spirit is more youthful summer scent. The edp feels more like a more grown up scent. From spirit I get that sweetness, a bit of citrus not much, then it jumps into that lavender. I got dumont nitro red before this one and they are very similar only difference is the dumont has a melon note and a bit of that amber sweetness. And also the dumont projects more and lasts longer. The spirit presents the aquatic/sea notes on the mid and the spice is noticeable but doesn’t overtake everything. The particular sweetness never leaves it just tones down towards the drydown. At the drydown it gets more woodsy and cleaner, not fresh but clean. Its not a bad scent but it’s a common profile I guess. I don’t have a problem wearing it because it is easy to wear and will work for almost any occasion but preferably during spring and summer, maybe early, early fall depending on where you live. Now we go to performance and it does just ok. Doesn’t project more than an arms length for like 45minutes then it stays close to you for a couple of hours 4-6 before becoming a skin scent. It disappears after 8 hours on my skin. You can adjust it by spraying a bit more; I would recommend at least 6-8 sprays skin and clothing. Pricing on the $30 range for 100ml its not bad. I got the 200ml bottle for $59. Batch is from 02/2024 made in France.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,A smooth more grown up polished version of Invictus good for the office and the gym and casual wear this is one of the safest blind purchase fragrances,04/10/25 19:48,Dustin1250
Legend Spirit Montblanc,Off the rip u definitely get the fresh DNA that everyone loves. This is a great gym scent or a basic dumb reach everyday fragrance. Its not something that will make u stand out. But its definitely something that will make u smell good. The longevity and projection are not good by any means but I wouldn't call them bad in any way. The first time ı sprayed this I found great similarities between this and Invictus. The only different between them is that Invictus has more of that bubblegummy sweetness.,04/10/25 01:19,doruk060108
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Smelled like bug spray throughout. To me the specific definition of this is lost in limbo. It's neither sweet, nor spicy. Not even floral. Just a chemical mess. Definitely not a safe blind buy. Thank God for Micro Perfumes.",04/01/25 06:58,Tattooed Wolf
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I don't like the DNA of Invictus and this is clearly noticeable with my Rating. The artificial sweet scent is not my personal preference plus the longevity makes it not recommendable.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I’ll start off by saying the longevity and sillage on this fragrance is very moderate and considerably underperforming, but I can’t get enough of it. It smells like fresh bed sheets with a little bit of fresh spiciness. It’s addictive, easy to wear, and one of the best fragrances to wear for school. Overall I’d give the scent a 9/10, the performance a 6/10, the price a 10/10, and overall a 8.5/10.",03/04/25 09:07,TRizzler24
Legend Spirit Montblanc,citrus fresh laundry 7/10,03/02/25 15:10,linkin
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"First thing I smelled was bananas and this creamy citrus note. Quickly dries to notes of cardamom which isn't too sweet or strong. Not as fresh as I would like but it has this sort of old school vibe to it. Not like old people, but more like a nostalgic feeling, like being back in my old orchestra room from HS. You can smell notes of wood but also this chalky sweetness. It's not offensive but it's hard to love it. It could honestly be worn for several occasions during the day but it is not sexy enough for something elegant.

7.2/10",03/02/25 00:08,NoHoMike
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Great daily freshie. Inoffensive and affordable. Citrusy, woody, fresh and semi-sweet, kinda like a laundry freshness. I've gotten a few compliments on this. The longetivity and projection are kinda mid. If you're looking for a good everyday freshie to wear to the gym, school, work, or otherwise, this is solid.

8/10",02/26/25 13:11,stormyfalls
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I can KINDA see where the all the people are coming from with all the votes of “reminds me of” Invictus, but to me (thankfully, for me), this isn’t Invictus. I find Invictus much too cloying; I’m not down with the whole “gum-ball sweet” thing. Legend Spirit smells more citrusy from the get go. The middle is where it starts to get slightly like Invictus, but again, the sugary sweetness is not in your face; Legend Spirit turns into what I’d describe as a “light slightly-sporty floral”.
I’m actually a pretty big fan of the original Legend - I find them to be quite different, besides the main lavender note. I’d argue that the og Legend is slightly more versatile, as it is a freshie that I feel can be more easily “dressed up” if needed, while Spirit is airier and more playful; I personally wouldn’t reach for it in a suit. The Spirit does get slightly better performance in my opinion, but that could also just be me being more attuned to certain notes. If you like the og Legend and want to try something a little sweeter and sporty, give it a test, as they are not redundant.",02/26/25 13:03,Nlo13

This will never go out of style!",02/15/25 21:46,chart1931
Legend Spirit Montblanc,I gave this to my nephews. It smells like the speedstick deodorant I used to wear as a teen. It's an after gym scent to me. just blah...meh...maybe I missed something ...I don't know. It's just not something different or new. Just ordinary in my opinion.,02/14/25 14:17,My13ScentsWorth
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Try it before you buy it, unless you buy it as a gift for a teenager.
It's on the bubblegummy sweet side which could be a disappointing purchase as a blind buy.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"First Pass - Citrus. Very fresh, very clean. Hint of moss

2 Hours Later - Moss. Musk. Unwaveringly clean citrus, and now somewhat dry

4 Hours Later - Drier still. Musk and Moss are stronger. Still quite crisp and clean

Overall - I hated this scent the moment I smelled it. Thankfully, with this hobby I’ve learned to give a 2nd and 3rd look before passing judgement. This scent is aggressive and unusually strong. Legend Spirit (2016) is heavily influenced by Lacoste Blanc 12.12.12 (2011, which I have reviewed separately).

Where Lacoste fails is where Legend Spirit shines. The glaring citrus can be overwhelming, like dozens of fluorescent tubes spotlighting a room. And that is what this smells like, an immaculate, sterilized, bleached-white operating table, or the cleanest bathroom stall you’ll ever visit.

Montblanc adds a touch of moss and musk, which is just enough to balance the bracing citrus. It doesn’t mollify the citrus, I don’t think anything could, but it does add a layer of character that allows us to see something else.

It’s an interesting experience, and one that I think improves on Lacoste’s idea. I expect this scent to be polarizing, and very love/hate. Personally I do enjoy it, sparingly, but only on a very cold, very rainy, day

But I must say..I truly enjoy the smell of this. You know when you buy some new clothes or shoes and right when you open the box there is just this fresh scent. It's fresh, but also a bit of musk that just sits on you and I love it for that. If you can get it at a discount, it's perfect! I bought Explorer thinking that was the scent to have.

Legend Spirit is a great fresh out of the shower spray to put you in a good mood and if you want to smell good and inoffensive to pretty much anyone. As a cheap and mass appealing fragrance it's a 10/10. Obviously it doesn't have insane sillage or longevity but I find it lasts as a skin scent well into the next day.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I bought a 100 ml tester bottle for like €40 for the sole purpose of using it as a gym scent. My transition to more complex, niche level fragrances definitely created a need for a freshie and I couldn't have chosen a better fragrance, since I didn't want to spend too much on it. It's generic and mass appealing for sure, but it does have a modern aquatic take on the critrus, lavander DNA. It's refreshing and works well for daytime wear. I think the longevity is perfect for gym or just casual use, as it fades after 3-4 hours depending on how much you apply. As for its price, it was definitely worth it, I do believe you can find it for even cheaper. Bottle and cap are surprisingly good quality, atomizer is really decent, so it doesn't feel cheap. I would recommend this one over any no-name knock-off cheap garbage you find at the chemist. Considering the price and the versatility, I think it's pretty solid.",10/12/24 13:41,ayywolf

Legend Spirit Montblanc,Updating my review of this. When I first got this it was definitely more citrusy . It leaned citrus fresh aquatic with a sweet undertone. Loved it. I have now had the bottle for a bout a year and it has definitely gone through a profile change . I noticed the maturation change after about 4 months .It still has a citrus scent but I feel a little more sweet grapefruit/orange /lemon has come out. It's not sharp but has a sweeter tone to it now . It does give off some bubble gum vibes for sure. Like a sweet citrus aqua bubble gum with a speck of lavender. It's a sweet freshie. The base notes are pretty spot on as well. It does remind me of Invictus. Especially Invictus Parfum. I can see this being a bit too sweet for some. But I think it smells great. It can be worn day or night and just about any season.,08/25/24 12:02,WildCalifornia

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"First fresh/clean scent I bought. I tried YSL Y first, but hadn’t saved up enough to buy so went with Legend Spirit first. I have since replaced Legend Spirit with YSL Y EDT and EDP. I prefer the EDT Y over the two.

Comparing other similar frags, I prefer Legend Spirit over Invictus, Hawas, and a few English Laundry’s that smell similar. Montblanc wise, I much prefer Explorer and Individuel over Legend Spirit.

For a freshie, it projects pretty well. Lasts multiple hours on me usually. I know it’s meant to be sweet, but it’s overly sweet. I’m 40 years old and it seems almost sickeningly sweet. I think that’s why I prefer YSL Y, and Eros even, as they seem smoother/tamer in their sweetness.

Price is great. Discounters have 100ml for $40 on Legend Spirit. Can even possibly find at your local TJ Maxx, Burlington, or Ross. My first bottle was a tiny travel size from Ross, 4.5ml. Was a good way to try before getting a bigger bottle. I’ve since seen it at Ulta as a tester.",08/23/24 19:15,nastytrigger

Legend Spirit Montblanc,I don't own Invictus or any of the flankers. I think this one is a clone of the Edt or the Aqua? Something like that? I have never even put my nose to the scent. But if that's what this spirit flanker is related to... Then it's fantastic. Hot weather would be recommended. I wore it the other day in 100+ weather down here in south Texas. Cheap buy the big bottle! I bought the 1.0 but that's because I was skeptical. But that's why I'm reaching out to you gents. Cheap cheap cheap alternative to Invictus Rabban.,08/15/24 21:46,Albesure80
Legend Spirit Montblanc,This holds a special place in my heart since it was the first fragrance I ever owned. It started my journey so I may be biased. The performance isn't all there but I just overspray and it works out just fine. The price is amazing and the actual scent is so fresh and almost mossy. If I'm going to the gym I will always rock this or if I just want that nostalgic scent.,08/14/24 16:13,frogscousin
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I was in my local well known perfumery chain which starts with an 'S' here in France and they no longer stock this in store now! I asked if it has been discontinued but the staff member wasn't sure, it's currently still for sale on their website.

I hope if it 'is' being phased out it's because an EDP is on the way but who knows? I might have to re-purchase this as it's one of the nicest, most feel-good scents I've owned, curiously was part of my first order when getting into fragrances as a hobby in 2018. People say this smells like Invictus/Invictus Aqua but to me it's far superior and has it's own thing going on with the lavender, cardamom and cashmere, also more pleasant in warm weather than those, to my tastes anyway. A modern classic.",08/12/24 12:38,Dark Owl
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Dove anti perspirant deodorant with citrus. I mean that's the best way to describe this juice honestly... I don't necessarily mean that as a bad thing either, I happen to like the smell. I don't think this scent would offend anyone it's really mass appealing. Once upon a time it was very hyped. Especially by Jeremy Fragrance, but for under $40 for a 100ML you can't really go wrong here. It's the literal definition of a dumb reach grab and go fragrance. The performance isn't the best but something you can just keep spraying for the hell of it. I would wear this to the gym or to run errands perhaps. For the dumb reach cheap category this is a banger and it could be a decent pickup for anyone getting started in their fragrance journey.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I read a Marie Claire article that pitched the question of what makes a contemporary classic perfume to renowned perfumers, including Cresp. Cresp highlighted that there must be some familiar facet that people get; add to that some pleasing innovation and you're doing well.

To me, the familiar facet is deodorant (and, somehow, Legend OG). I am far too novice to say with authority what the innovation might be in an objective sense, but to me it's largely in the quality of fragrance. Blending, ingredients, other thingsss 👀... when have you ever smelled a deodorant made to the standard of perfume? It feels novel and quite fun.

The initial, intact deo whole spreads out into a juicy aquatic citrus, over creamy white florals and delicate, powdery musk and woods. In dry conditions I find it lands somewhwere dry and powdery, wheras if I'm sweaty the juicy citrus, aquatic and creamy notes stay at the fore.

Thus I feel there are three main contrasting facets that play sequencially: citrus - aquatic > creamy - silky > powdery - woody

That whole package feels new and familiar to me.

Longevity and sillage is really good on my skin, thanks in part to the supersoaker spray nozle (I don't think ""atomiser"" is apt here).

Suitability: anything where you want to smell fresh and unimposing for all day. It is not sexy, obnoxious or distinctive and would be ideal for someone working in service or healthcare for example. I wore it to a funeral recently because it was not an occassion that was about me at all.

For the gym it's fine, but I prefer something drier. The creaminess with high heat and sweat isn't ideal. Same goes for really hot weather. Not a date fragrance at all.

Deodorant but better. The price point is dead on. I think it's expert, useful, unperfumey perfume. A strong like, an eye-opener and not quite a love for me.

Hope this review helps you.",08/12/24 11:55,WhiffMeister
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Doesn't live up to the hype. Smells like a generic man's fragrance, maybe even a cleaning product. Also price has really gone up. What I would recommend instead is explorer by the same company.",08/11/24 03:16,BouklasDO

Smells like fresh air in a damp cabin on top of a mountain really getting that moist, clean, mountain air combo. A soapy damp wood frag that performs so well. It pulls 4-6 hrs. Pulled good compliments and its fun to layer sometimes aswell. Really love to wear it every now and then. Glad 2 have",08/03/24 18:15,where i felt home again.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"This is my first ever cologne and an amazing fresh clean deodorant cologne. It opens with this amazing citrusy watery musky deodorant smell that just is so pleasant be around. When it dries down the deodorant smell becomes more prominent with woodsy musky scents right along with it. This is inoffensive and can be easily worn anywhere. Great Spring, Summer, autumn cologne. This lasts me 7~ hours and is widely loved. If you love fresh clean deodorant scents you'll love this. Great price too.

Great cheapie starter fragrance.
It’ll lead you down the Invictus rabbit hole if you aren’t careful.
Also kinda reminds me of a less spicy Hawas (lesser performance as well).
Like i said, it’s safe. If you already have any of the top 3 or 4 “smells like” colognes this will be redundant.",07/19/24 10:30,SgtButtCheeks
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"This is my gym signature scent

It's similar to the OG Paco rabanne Invictus in the scent profile but definitely not in the cloning side of things, it's inspired by it.

The note breakdown shows its mostly watery notes, grapefruit and lavender, I don't know but for me this fragrance smells PURELY like an expensive deodorant (white musk with light pepper and bubblegum-ish undertones) which makes it perfect for sports or wearing it indoor to feel fresh and know you smell good rather than the sweaty dudes out there.

Honestly its a love or hate type of fragrance, some people hate the smell of deodorant in a fragrance, some will find it really sexy.

On my skin it lasts 3-4hrs depending on how much I spray it, the occasions used for this cologne makes the moderate longevity be pretty appropriate.

The bottle looks cute, portable and resistent and the atomizer is alright

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Can`t say anything bad about this fragrance, this is a perfect example of a beginner fragrance. Nothing interesting or unique, but smells nice and will get you some compliments. It is cheap, so please overspray this one, you can wear it basically anywhere.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"It opens with a bubble gummy sweetness that is aquatic and refreshing due to the pink pepper, lavender, and citruses. The dry-down consists mainly of an aquatic white musk and woody notes.
It shares some of Hawas/Invictus Aqua DNA but isn't a clone. There is none of that overwhelming synthetic aroma in Hawas and Invictus.
The drawback is that the projection and longevity on the skin are lacklustre, so it requires refreshing throughout the day. It is a fantastic and inexpensive choice for work and the gym.",07/06/24 03:01,Marxwick

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"Bought this after trying it on a tester strip in store but now I’ve tried it on my skin I’m not sure it’s for me.
Smells very generic, like a typical deodorant smell and for some reason reminds me of the 1980’s. I remember my dad had a cheap frag he bought in Spain many years ago. It was called Agua Lavanda and this is reminiscent of that.
Only 3 sprays and I’ve got a headache.
Much better on the dry down as opposed to the harsh opening but I can’t see me wearing it much so it’ll just be sitting with the collection. It was only £24.

EDIT: after a few more tries of this I actually find it repulsive. It’s like kitchen cleaning fluid or deodorant that’s been sprayed directly on top of sweat.
It’s not even going to stay in the collection, straight in the bin.",07/03/24 05:48,MartínW
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"A very attractive smelling freshie. I was at first saying that this is blind buy safe, but I have changed my mind. After more wearing, I find that it can be a bit cloying.

I don’t remember it smelling this good. This smells like ozonic SweetTarts to me now. This scent is fire, I remember it use to just smell like that bubblegum sweet Invictus for like 30 mins then just smelled like clean linens. Now it’s loud n has a sweet fruity citric ozonic opening and dries down to a sweet fruity ozonic n light Woody scent. This will be worn all summer this year. Who woulda known. I wrote this fragrance off years ago and now it’s in my top 5 for summer bangers. Unreal I was blind sided by this one.",06/15/24 07:59,JTB2468
Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I’m disappointed. This was good before the hype, it used to be 20 pounds which is fair and now everywhere it’s 30 pounds which is way too much for it. The thing is what it feals like it’s job is something that you wear so you don’t wear the same thing everyday because it’s not really a great fragrance, it’s generic and has got just ok peformance. But thanks to hype, it’s now like this amazing fragrance when it’s really not and they charge 30 pounds for it now.

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"You can purchase 3.3 oz of legend spirit for $42.52 on fragrancex -

One reviewer below me recommended spending the ""extra couple of bucks"" to pick up ysl y edp instead.

Yet ysl y edp sells for 129.74$ on fragrancex for a 3.3 oz...

So for almost 3x the cost you could get a superior fragrance?? 👌

OR

You could just buy legend spirit which has never failed to yield me a compliment.

OR

If you want something similiar to the ysl y edp profile, then you could get 3.3 oz of versace dylan blue for 67.75$ on fragrancex.... which i would choose over ysl y edp any day of the week.

Now ysl y edp could be had on joma shop for 95$ but it is still 2x the cost...

Legend Spirit Montblanc,"I personally never cared for this fragrance, I received a half full 3.3oz from my father in a cologne trade off we regularly have done. In my opinion it’s that super duper generic clean, light spicy typical “masculine” smell. It’s so generic/synthetic to me it’s absolutely boring and I would only wear it around the house. I can see some appeal for it and I would not say it smells badly or repulsive. I’d say for someone new to the fragrance world it would be a safe bet for a warm weather mostly crowd pleasing cologne.",06/07/24 21:16,Wild_Willy

Perfumes like this should be most gatekept to be honest, is pretty average and more lovely fragance for daily use, but it also attracts women and they compliment you 'bouta scent, I also actually like the pink pepper on it, it gaves it a certain touch of ""feminity"" that is attractive. 'Bout its sillage and duration, well, sillage is kinda ""intimate"" but it depends on your skin PH, imo it owns pretty average sillage and you can enjoy your own scent without getting a smell fatigue, 8/10.",05/30/24 00:08,zestangel
