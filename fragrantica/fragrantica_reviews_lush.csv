Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"It goes on completely citrus cleaner, but dries down to a very intimant honey sweetness quick enough to be worth it. Not a perfect honey perfume, but a pleasant entry to that category which doesn’t mix in too many other scents. Now if only Lush would release a Sticky Date perfume.",10/14/25 20:09,ArtemisCrimson
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,Sweet honey that has a beautiful soft dry down. Perfect.,03/08/25 09:38,macademialove
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I'm not much of a gourmand girlie, so I'm more than content with my wee 10ml via the Kitchen box, but my goodness do I love the HIWTK scent family! Brings to mind orange chocolate, honeycomb and gooey caramel all at once. Makes me feel like I'm being hugged by the person I love most. Super sweet, decedent, and above all, comforting -- but HEAVY emphasis on that 'super sweet' part. As much as I love HIWTK, in perfume format it's a bit too much for me a lot of the time (it released about 2 years ago according to the label, and I've only used about 3ml so far!), so I gravitate towards the handful of other gourmands I own a lot of the time. (FWIW, that would mainly be Replica Matcha Meditation & Kilian Angels' Share.) I'm still glad to own this vial for the handful of times I'm in the mood to rock it, but admittedly I prefer it a lot more in bath bomb, shower gel and soap format.",03/09/24 16:39,kpop_stan
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Why oh why don't they make this scent perfume anymore and why is it always stuck in the U.K. and never in thr states , I just received a lush kitchen version and it it's awesome and honeyed unlike the body spray which is enjoyable , and both have different facets why they should both be here .",09/19/23 12:30,Frankie12
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Initially candy caramel but dries down to vanilla yogurt quite quickly.
Not what I had expected - wanted a thick, rich caramel!",12/20/21 16:49,fyetan
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"This is such a comforting, feel good fragrance. Imagine a creamy toffee, milk and honey, french nougat and orange marmalade. This is probably what Paddington Bear would smell like if you gave him a snuggle!

I own the body spray version of this fragrance, and longevity is really really good.",03/19/20 04:03,Emma0714
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,This review is for the 2018 body spray. It opens with almost a yogurt tang. That tangy scent dries down quite quickly and morphs into a white floral/honey/toffee scent. It eventually settles into a lovely honey/toffee/white chocolate with only a hint of the white floral. I do not detect any citrus in this version. Not huge sillage or lasting power.,06/15/18 20:27,spitandpolish
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I expected a perfume replica of the soap (cf. Devil's Nightcap) but to my surprise it's actually not. There's a bit of sour, white wine tinge. I'd liken this perfume to vanilla yogurt.",10/30/17 19:49,Chaos Reigns
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Wow! It smells just like the notes listed! If you love sweet gourmands then one not to miss. Quite an intense opening. Too sweet for me. Loads of toffee! I was hoping the citrus might be more dominant but nope.
Moderate sillage and longevity",07/07/17 02:32,shushkin
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I'm reviewing the 2015 Lush Kitchen formula.
This is absolutely divine! This smells like toffee/caramel and honeycomb with a light soapy feel which is very true to the original scent in the LUSH soap. There is also a slightly white chocolately vibe which reminds me of the best hot chocolate money can buy. Or a bar of ""crunchy"" chocolate which they sell here in the UK (honeycomb covered in chocolate). It is very wearable, however, and not overpowering. I usually would not wear gourmands this thick in the summer heat, but this is light enough that it works in all weathers. Very clean smelling, despite the foody notes, and perfect those looking for something sweet and yummy without being too much.",06/01/17 13:20,icingsugar
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"This perfume is certainly something else. With a very prominent Play Doh note, crayon waxy toffee, very sweet and unmistakable. The honey is sweet, a little pee-y and the orange is mostly sweet and just a little zesty, bringing out the higher pitch in this caramel. Don't say I didn't warn you. The liquid, long discontinued, smells the same and is as strong as the solid currently for sale in Japan. The perfume is exactly the same as the soap, except the perfume is ten times more potent. Wear in minute amounts and this can be a real beauty.",08/11/16 03:37,paneradfisk
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"They have discontinued the parfum, but you can still find the scent in soap and in the solid shampoo bar. I love the honey with a hint of carmel/toffee scent. It is sweet but not cloying and doesn't make me hungry. My favorite Lush scent.",07/08/16 10:38,Neosmiaphyte
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I LOVE ""It's Raining Men"" shower gel from Lush. It does fabulous things for my hair and smells delicious. I love the ""Gold Fun"" bath playdough, the ""Honey I Washed The Kids"" soap (minus the wax on the top), and even the ""Honey Bee"" bath bomb even though it leaves clay in my tub. So naturally I had to hunt down the perfume to complete the scent circle. I always use their solids when first trying out a scent if I can, since my allergies can be iffy-wiffy. Omg, this smells so amazing and just like the bath products!

Buttery goodness with just enough citrus to balance out the sweetness, and just enough floral to make the honey smell realistic and not like cheap vanilla.


Edit: So the solid of this definitely leans more toward a butterscotch scent, whereas the spray version has a slightly more floral feel going. Both are awesome, though.",07/27/15 10:50,QueenieBee
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"For anyone wondering, the Lush shops in Japan still carry this as a solid perfume: other than the UK, Japan has the most Lush shops in the world! If anyone's looking for this discontinued perfume, you may want to get one shipped in from there. (Japan Lush also carries The Olive Branch solid perfume)

Delicious honey/caramel smell.",06/06/15 08:04,neonvibrance
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Simple 3 note wonder. First scent is largely of caramel, rich and thick but not too syrupy or burnt. It is seamlessly layered with bee's wax and honey, which evens out the smell of the caramel and gives it a 'thick' smell. Lastly, is a bit of orange which keeps the whole thing from smelling too sweet and gives it a slight fruit identity. It smells kind of soapy too, like the wax of glycerin soap. Sort of like clean skin musk. I think this helps create the illusion that the scent was transferred onto your skin by soap rather than perfume.",01/20/15 18:48,cassandra5322
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"They should make this perfume into food so I can eat it. Smells delicious, definitely gourmand but clean as well with a soapy finish which makes it very wearable. I wore this at Christmas all the time as it seemed perfect for the season.",01/15/15 05:24,LOUISELOUISE
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I had a solid version of this perfume and enjoyed it. Cozy and playful, clean and warm, with a touch of honey sweetness. The name of this perfume helps to bring these diverse sniff-impressions together :)",08/04/13 02:12,temporal
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"The soap is great, but the perfume (might have been the bottles I got--I got two different ones, one from each release, though) was kinda...well, it smelled mostly like alcohol and something bitter from the bottle. On the skin, it mellowed out to something closer to the soap, but usually still a little too bitter/waxy for me.",04/27/13 01:01,kayley123
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"It smells like the soap, but not as subtle. It was a special edition. I can see why they didn't put it in their permanent line. Something was just off..",03/28/13 17:41,lcommisso
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Unfortunately discontinued.
I know they still sell it as soap, but I recently tried Flying Fox and actually liked it better. Probably because I love jasmine. I'm hoping they'll eventually produce Flying Fox as a fragrance.",03/20/13 04:25,2746cstreet
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I keep buying the soap , but can't find the perfume in my country ( ITALY)",12/29/12 01:21,delara
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"When it comes to gourmands, I am much more enthusiastic about wearing something that smells like honey rather than cotton candy. I've been searching for a realistic honey scent for quite some time. I did enjoy Serge Lutens Miel de Bois, but it wasn't what I wanted. Since finding Honey I Washed The Kids, I believe I may have found the closest to what I was looking for.

Honey I Washed The Kids is a fairly linear scent, with syrupy honey, sugary vanilla and gooey caramel. It smells delicious and foody, just like a gourmand should be.

The opening is where the honey note is at its strongest. I was amazed by how realistic it smelt on my skin. It was just like sticking your nose in a jar of honey and inhaling. Although the honey note is dominant throughout this composition, it does tend to lessen in intensity. The heart and drydown introduces the vanilla and caramel which helps in balancing out the fragrance.

As far as I'm aware, Honey I Washed The Kids was a limited edition that has long since been discontinued. The last time I inquired about this fragrance in a Lush store, I was re-directed to a shower gel named It's Raining Men and told that it's the same scent, just re-named.

I was lucky enough to be sent a sample from a kind Lush fragrance collector. Since falling for it, I guess I'll now have to join the ranks of fans waiting for a bottle to appear on Ebay.",12/12/12 11:17,missk
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I wanted to love this and I am a honey fan. But the orange and bergamont made this too lemoney for my taste. It dries down and for like an hour, smells divine. It smells like honey, toffee and creamy vanilla. I also didn't care for the solid form which I had to scrape with my fingernail out of the tin. Luckily the Bath and Body Works reformulation of Warm Vanilla Sugar smells like the dry down of this. I highly recommend.",10/25/12 11:20,deliberateangel
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,Does anyone know of a fragrance that truly smells like Honey I Washed The Kids soap and hasn't been discontinued?,10/17/12 15:31,shiverwithantici
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Sweeeeeeet but dont care coz HIWTK is lovely super YUMMY scent! It's rich caramel toffee!!

If you still cant imagine how is the scent and dont have LUSH shop nearby, u can go supermarket & find Werther's original candy, it is the same!!!",09/10/12 11:16,Arkira M.
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Yummy! They captured this scent very nicely. Smells just like HIWTK soap and It's Raining Men shower gel. It is extremely sweet but so yummy. It's a very honey, caramel, and slightly floral scent that just makes you want to eat yourself!! lol",02/18/12 20:31,fullbottleworthy
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,Oh how I WISH they still had this available... The one LUSH perfume I cannot find anymore :-(,01/04/12 16:40,SS79
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,YUMMMMMMMMMM,11/25/11 23:12,hollyms
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I am a fan of Lush's Honey I Washed the Kids Soap and was excited when the fragrance edition of this scent came out. Unfortunately there's something here that's not quite right with this scent.

On my skin it never settles down to that gorgeous toffee/honey/caramel scent that I've come to love. I believe the bergamot and orange mixture in this is what's making this rather sharp. There's no warmth here, its very much a cold sharp sweet smell that reminds me of white bleached sugar.

However, when my bottle of this leaked onto a scarf I was delighted to find the resulting scent a lot closer to the warm toffee caramel scent I love. I wont be repurchasing this but its a nice thing to have in my collection.",09/07/11 20:47,Raina
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I really love Lush a lot.They care so much for the Mother Earth,and for the animals. I still have a pinch left of the solid for this lovely vegan scent,but I am running really low. I am sad that mine is almost gone.

I simply cannot afford this spray (I want it though,and I am so happy it is vegan)

I have a GORGEOUS dupe from a sweet online seller. It is a roll-on oil. It smells like sweet orange candy, and toffee. Very softly scented.",02/04/11 15:25,tenderhearted
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"There is something fresh lingering behind the sweetness, something that refreshes you while it lulls you. It's not really citrussy rather what's left after the citrussy has gone. A tingy sharpness that gives this sweet scent its charm.

Whenever I use it, people react. I love it, it lifts my mood.",07/15/10 14:26,Nemia
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Toffee, salted caramelised oranges and honey. Not enough honey IMHO, there's an almost Greek Honey yoghurt quality to this, not too bad at all, but works better in the Lush soap form.",02/22/10 07:13,EnglishCountryGarden
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I used to work in Lush so am very familiar with this smell. It's a one of kind gorgeousness that's hard to describe. The description of Citrus/Gourmand is wrong in my opinion. It's not citrussy.
If you think this blend is going to be overwhelmed by honey then fear not.
It's a very light, almost Tofee-Lite smell which is sooo addictive and comforting. Beautiful beautiful smell. The soap and other products are just as gorgeous. If you've ever had a chocolate bar called ""Caramac"" then you're onto the right track of what this smells like.",02/22/10 06:56,Ouch!
Salty Lush,"Yeah this is really good. Fizzy sherbet-y aldehyde-citrus opening, savoury musk, spicy rose and oakmoss and a very wearable oud note (I love how oud smells but tend to have to take a very cautious approach because smelling it on myself all day can tip over into headache territory easily). Weird combination of very edible-smelling Lush-y notes and the quite oldschool aldehyde-rose-moss chypre but it definitely works.
I see how this is marketed as a beachy scent but it’s way more versatile than that suggests - the cozy musk and woods means it works well in colder weather and it’s sexy and (weirdly for Lush, elegant) enough to go from day to night too. Has the classic insane lasting power of the Lush body sprays - does dry down to a skin scent after a few hours but if you get this on clothes you will be projecting it for days.
Curious to try layering it with more traditional rose or chypre scents to see what happens - I feel like there’s a rosy-woody-spicy strain in common with Chanel Coco that it could play nicely with but that’s such a beast in its own right that amping it up further could just be antisocial.",,halogencat
Salty Lush,"I rather naively bought my two young people this for Christmas. Both bottles sat there unused, then one of my young people turned 17 and wanted to wear scents. So they started wearing it, I had never smelled Oud and at first thought it was too strong, then it settled into this lovely warm freshness. So I’ve nabbed the second bottle, keeping it for other sibling and using some occasionally.",11/07/25 06:19,NiceCuppaT
Salty Lush,"Slightly reminiscent of seawater, but not as pungent or fishy. Has a slightly salty, musky quality. Essentially pleasant and neutral smell.",10/29/25 18:09,JukeboxSweetheart
Salty Lush,"I enjoy this much more than stormy weather. I do get a salty effect. I’m not a fan of oud in general but this is appealing. I wouldn’t mind if my man wore it. Too masculine for me overall, but I really wanted to find a pirate themed scent that I can wear with my pirate costume this Halloween. After some trial and error, I’ve decided that sticky dates and salty layer quite well to achieve a more complex boozy-salty-wood effect that is exactly what I’d had in mind.",10/20/25 22:01,thellycat
Salty Lush,"This perfume doesn't feel salty as such, but I definitely get what people are saying about hot person armpit. it's that mixed with them wearing a natural solid deodorant bar! I really like this as a trans-masc / butch lesbian (I see some others mentioned this as well). It feels very neutral, a sort of musky bad ass vibe with a soft touch. It's intriguing that the notes coming together, make this smell. I don't really see any of the notes in it at all! I can't quite pin point what I can smell. I do find that bergamot has a body odour vibe, which sort of feels like it's In this scent. This smell is great for feeling like you're not over doing it, but want to smell good. It feels like a personal aroma .",10/04/25 05:35,Halo_land
Salty Lush,"Addictive opening. Sex on the beach with a surfer. Whoever first described it as “hot person armpit” was spot on. I can see why this is popular with butch lesbians.

The dry-down leaves much to be desired. The longevity is fine, but it lingers to leave a powdery, plastic-like scent (almost like a crayon).

The oud is surprisingly not stifling, simply attractive. Definitely try before buying, the notes do not describe the overall effect well enough.

Pairs quite well with the solid perfume Dirty, as it gives it that minty freshness. I would also recommend a fruity or citrus-based shower gel, like Olive Branch.",09/17/25 08:49,arsonfilm
Salty Lush,"enticed by the description of this as something very sexy and salty (esp the hot person armpit comparison), i ordered a bottle off of mercari. it opens strong, sort of woody, herby, and astringent. it reminds me of the chinese medicine stores of my youth, and tobacco smoke. it softens after about 20 minutes into something a smidge more powdery and floral, a little muskier too, but sadly with very little salt. perhaps i'm lacking in imagination or sexual experience, but to this bisexual woman, it smells alluring and intimate, but not erotic.

edit: i love this. what was she (me ^) on about. i mean, i think i'm still right about the opening, which i think just sits poorly on my skin but, girl, this is so good. i spray it twice on my throat and once on each wrist and it sits around me in a divine cloud. it is a tinge aftershavey, but not as blue or cold. it does smell salty. it does not smell like sex but it does smell delicious.",09/09/25 23:10,QU33N0FH34RT5
Salty Lush,This layers excellently with all my rose and white floral perfumes. It's the most elegant of lush's body sprays and oud is gentle not stifling. Don't know if all queer women love it but I do!,08/02/25 11:01,myriadofsins
Salty Lush,"All I could say is that this body spray smells like the hairy armpit of an attractive person.
It opens funky in the first minute. A mix of Florida water, rose water, freshly cracked black pepper, powdery incense (not smoky!) and something sour. Like vomit. But like,
༺ 𝓿𝓸𝓶𝓲𝓽 ༻, cursive and all. Man, I don't know, please don't be scared.
Anyway, after that momentary roughness, it's a pretty predictable and smooth ride here on out. The woody powderiness is turned up a notch, very geranium and soap-like. Something in this prevents it from smelling like old-school men's perfume, because that's where I thought this was going. Magic starts to unfold within the 6-7 minute mark. Up close on the skin, it's burning the delicate hairs in my nose. But from a distance, though?
A gentlemanly, polite whiff of this tells you everything you need to know. It's musky. Warm. And just enough of a hint of floral sweetness. It's not fresh-floral by any means. Salty? Eh. Maybe. But If I'm smelling this down the street I'm tearing off your clothes. I don't know what they're putting in this ugly ass bottle but it's beefy. Testosterone pumped. Bite and chew on a bicep kinda vibe. Did I mention it smells like the hairy armpit of an attractive person? Yeah. It does. It's balmy the way deodorant smells like on a CLEAN armpit after a sweaty gym sesh. And it has to be hairy. I've smelt both hairy and hairless attractive people armpit and can safely say it's the former. It's horny, but celibate. Voluntarily. Ya hear that? Your conventionally hot, extroverted, friendly brunette gym crush that knows and talks to everybody in the gym. They do upper body on most days, especially back.
However, if that's not your first impression, I could easily describe this as smelling like a Lush store from afar. It has that quintessential Lush, patchouli smell.
Salty is one of the safest Lush perfumes you can get. If, and only if, you know what you're getting into. Surprisingly pretty mild for Lush, and the crazy intensity doesn't last that long. Situationship personified in a bottle. Maybe that's why it's attracting all the wlw folks like a moth to a flame. Side note: pairs EXTREMELY well with fresh fruity clean shampoo scents.",07/09/25 22:33,klukluklu
Salty Lush,Stunning I have had some many good compliments when wearing this it’s such a beautiful polarising fragrance it’s cozy in cold wether but cooling in warm wether I will always have a bottle of this in my collection,05/03/25 11:56,Dani83
Salty Lush,"i've been daily wearing this basically all summer (southern hemisphere) and i have, oh, just a couple thoughts.

1. this is the biggest compliment getter i've ever worn. like seriously, i've gotten multiple compliments from the same person on the same DAY wearing this, that's how well-received it is, which is interesting because here it seems fairly polarizing. i will say that in my case it is noticed almost exclusively by women (the one man that I've had comment on it was a gay man, so take that how you will) and the women who seem the most drawn to it are basically always queer. as someone who appears pretty femme in my daily life, i Love that this scent mascs me up a bit, but I think i'd be happy to smell it on almost any kind of gender presentation, it's a true unisex scent.

2. pairs FANTASTICALLY with a good sunscreen scent. i wear full body sunscreen every day in summer so this discovery happened organically, but i love layering this with anything in the coconut + white florals scent family (SDJ 81, MM Beach Walk, TF Soleil Blanc etc.) and it also plays very nicely with more intense white or yellow florals (Salty + Lust is my favourite night out combo right now)

3. i keep coming back to the oud in this. it's hilarious in that oud is so divisive, and this is divisive, but oud lovers do not seem to be drawn to this. I'd argue it's closer to sandalwood, or a true ""driftwood"" scent if that's even possible. to get out of the oceanic metaphors (which I think are a little limiting for representing what this scent actually is) it smells like spending hours working up a sweat on a woodchip playground with some white florals planted on the outskirts.

in conclusion - gorgeous scent, great performance, perfect for those of us who want a ""summer scent"" without having to give up on woody, heady gorgeousness.",03/22/25 20:48,soggysniffs
Salty Lush,"Okay, full disclosure, I got this because I read multiple comments around the Internet saying that queer women love this (and as a queer woman, I feel compelled to explore anything that gets the community's seal of approval), but I'm gonna need someone to explain this one to me. I guess I get how this could smell ""clean sweaty"" but TBH I think my actual clean sweaty body on its own smells better than this. Will keep testing because why not, I already blind bought the bottle, but I think I'm gonna have to break ranks here.

As for how it actually smells: it's a little oud-y (but oud lite) in the beginning, so slightly funky, but the dry down is dried ocean water on skin, salty and still a little funky, but now in that way that beaches are a little funky because of all the decaying seaweed and crab exoskeletons. I'm not getting any neroli or rose, unfortunately.

Edit: kokokoko's review below really nails the opening lol, is that why the lesbians are into this?",01/19/25 13:29,ponderbread
Salty Lush,"This blew me away. I've received so many compliments when wearing this and I need to get a backup bottle asap... I don't have anything that smells even remotely close to this!

The vibes this gives off is imagine being on a Greek island, you've just had the most amazing day at the beach, going back and forth into the water, the sweat beads all over you being washed off by the water, you dry off under the Aegean sun on a tanning bed... Then you and your significant other rush off back to your villa to have a very quick shower before you both just absolutely ravage the hell out of each other before heading off to enjoy the hot summer night at a Greek eatery along the water... THATS the vibe this gives you. Its a sexy animalic scent that just lingers and stays with you. My wife goes absolutely feral when I wear this, as do I when she sprays it on herself! Its an absolute love, a gem from Lush that not many people bother to try.",12/27/24 18:05,DeeCino
Salty Lush,"Oudh and Salt. Imagination exercise.

Salty body spray smells 90% like oudh and 10% like salt.

This is the first fragrance I've ever smelled that actually smells salty. There are many fragrances marketed as ''salty'', especially the ones that are created around a beach or seashore theme, but none of them actually smell like salt.
Salty does.
I think Salty is in the top 3 best body sprays Lush sells.
But where would I wear this? It gives me the vibe of a day by the sea in the dessert. Dubai, Oman, Qatar. Other than that, it beats my imagination. Suggestions?",12/14/24 00:57,JuliaToothFairy
Salty Lush,Ordered this today because no stores near me were carrying it and I see what everyone in the comments is talking about this is pure human secretions absolutely animalic. smells like salty saliva and vaginal fluids. I'm not sure in a good way for me personally. Then within 10 minutes I'm getting alot of powdery oud. It's not bad at that point.,11/04/24 10:59,kokokoko
Salty Lush,"So I went to Lush today, sprayed this on my arm and wasn't sure what to think. Ended up leaving with Honey I Washed The Kids and Lord of Misrule. THEN on the drive home I couldn't stop smelling myself where I sprayed Salty... Now I'm at home and I regret not buying it! The dry down on Salty is really addictive to me... Safe to say I'll be buying a bottle very soon.",10/27/24 02:09,DeeCino
Salty Lush,"This is probably my favourite lush scent they sell! This smells like a woman who smells really good whilst you're travelling, and you end up thinking of her and the scent the rest of the day. This scent has made me realise my hidden love for oud! Love!",07/16/24 13:54,Lanascola
Salty Lush,"I f**king love it. I think it’s such a great spring/summer scent, more to wear during the day but would work perfectly for summer evenings and nights. Smells great on women and very sensual on men too. It opens more masculine but dries towards more sweet and flowery. Everyone who smelled it on me or when I sprayed it had the same reaction - “It smells like the sea and summer!”, without knowing what it was or what the name of it was. I read in some reviews that people feel it’s too strong at times which I can understand. However, I’d just say that it’s its silage and longevity rather than just strength, you can definitely layer it to smell it more or less based on what you prefer.",05/27/24 09:41,dorsi007
Salty Lush,"This is pissy and floral in a really, really old fashioned perfumery sort of way that I don't typically expect from Lush, which is kind of nice. I'm disappointed though, because there is no oud--listen to Lush's description, not this one, as the only wood I detect is this marine sort of sandalwood, or more particularly dry, salty driftwood--and Salty is definitely the right name for it. I actually quite like it but for me it's too weak to wear as a perfume, so I plan to use it as a linen spray.",03/29/24 18:16,bricolage
Salty Lush,"This is such a gem!! It’s like the chypres of yore, but so different, and so good! The name is aptly chosen as it is and stays salty throughout.

It opens indeed with a smell that is reminiscent of sweaty skin, but in a good way! It’s not like body odour, it’s sensual sweatiness, mixed in with salt. It’s the smell of someone who is spending a day at the beach, sweaty, salty, bronzed body. It’s so addictive that I keep sniffing and am tempted to lick my skin to taste the salt.

While it’s definitely not feminine leaning, as there is absolutely no sweetness at all, I consider this squarely unisex. What makes a perfume masculine to me, is if there are certain notes that are only found in male perfumes. Those are most common in blue perfumes for men, and give that typical male cologne smell. None of that is present here, it’s just a very natural smelling chypre, without any sweetness.

The opening lasts long and the salt in this stage is the most present. There’s something else too, which I’m sure is the oud, though it doesn’t really smell like oud to me in this perfume; it smells like driftwood. It’s also very mossy in this stage, which makes sense, because oakmoss in perfumes always smells a bit salty to my nose.

Once the salt settles down after the very long opening (2.5 hours), the driftwood comes forward more, and so does the neroli. The neroli is present in this stage, but subdued. Rather than taking centre stage, it plays a supporting role ; adding a layer to the driftwood smell and creating the illusion of a salty gentle sea breeze, that carries just a hint of the smell of neroli with it.

Slowly the rose develops too. A crisp, dry rose, but not powdery. It’s a white rose to my nose. It’s not lush, jammy or thick, but delicate and subtle. In this stage the scent becomes more elegant and refined, and very very beautiful.

It dries down quite dark and musky, with the smell of almost rotting driftwood and sea water. This is not a fragrance to make you smell pretty, this is a fragrance to transport you to a place and setting and I love it!

I’m definitely going to get a full bottle of this juice. It’s an amazing, interesting scent that’s well worth the price and lasts very long.",03/02/24 11:29,Amber Plokchouli
Salty Lush,Very masculine. Its reminiscent of salty sweaty skin. Its an oud but more of a musky oud than a strong dark oud. Its more of a sweaty person who has been in the sun & went swimming in the ocean rather than having a proper shower.,02/03/24 14:11,Shan101beauty
Salty Lush,"This one's so fuckable. It in honestly embarrassing how fuckable this is. This smells like riding someone's thigh. If it's rose, it's a rose that someone with a flashy lipstick just bit into, holding it in between their lips. Oud gives it this bodily, musky sort of dirtiness; and neroli keeps it fun and light, in ""don't get attached"" sort of way. This is a perfume to spray on your ankles. I would say I love it, but it would probably reject me after that.",12/13/23 14:26,SimpleButch
Salty Lush,"I wanted to like this but I can't. I don't like the opening in particular because it has a woody, aftershave smell. If you're sensitive to oud, use it sparingly. Thank god it doesn't last, after a while it starts to smell more floral but it's still too masculine for me. Not the tropical, beachy smell I was looking for. A blind buy which I regret.",08/17/23 12:15,km1266
Salty Lush,"Not bad for the price. I’d say it reminds me of a surf shop that also sells bongs and essential oils, if you know what I mean. I think the name is pretty fitting. It’s woody and salty at the same time. The rose is very soft, and not cheap or prominent. I wouldn’t notice it if it wasn’t mentioned.",08/04/23 20:37,sarakp999

Salty Lush,"This smells like if you had gone to a beach party, danced until the sun threatened to shine a light on your debauchery. You wake up a bit salty Sandy and a bit sticky, you take a dip in the sea to refresh and ‘wake up’ then you let your skin dry in the mid morning heat. This, this is that smell that smell of skin with sally elements - it’s got a stink but a sexy stink.

Salty Lush,I wanted to love it! But I get the worst headache and nausea when I wear it. I don’t get any other notes beside oud on me. Plus it’s very long lasting and projecting so you only need 2-3 hits. Not a bad fragrance at all…just makes me sick sadly.,08/05/22 07:11,PandaCharm3005
Salty Lush,"Oh well this is intimate isn’t it?

I never smelled Salarium, but Salty is exactly what I’ve been looking for in a perfume. Uncomplicated, sexy, understated, woody, incensey. It smells like that natural after-sex smell, if you’d had sex in a beautiful hotel on a beach, with the slightly salty night wind flowing in through the window. God I love it so much. I cannot believe this is £30 for 200ml. Buying a full bottle as soon as I finish my sample.",07/16/22 15:02,chlorodream
Salty Lush,"I own the shaving cream form of Salty/Salarium 2.0, Shaved Ice. The scent really grew on me as I really love Oud-based scents. Owning a couple oud oils from the SE.Asia region has deepened my appreciation for Oud, and this is one that is a keeper.

The smooth, salty accords harmonises with a light and elegant oud note presented in Salty. The scent stays uniform throughout its longevity, only dwindling in terms of its projection.

Understandably, the bottle (Salarium) was costly due to ingredient constraints and this would be somewhat of a middle ground for those who love its scent but may not be agreeable to its costs (in comparison to Lush's other compositions).",02/06/22 18:05,Inconucopia
Salty Lush,"This is a much much cheaper version of Salarium which is going to be discontinued in my country. Love the scent as it's really not bad! A linear scent which is quite well blended. I'm really not sure how to describe the scent.. I didn't get the salty animalic feel. I had the initial impression of a much lighter version of MFK's Oud Silk Mood, but no. This is really different and pleasant and I can't stop going back to sniff the paper strip.",11/21/21 21:49,Riverwind79
Salty Lush,"I don't get the notes listed here. I get musk and salt, maybe aldehydes too? a very intimate smell, kind of like hair/scalp and vintage clothes, but not in a bad way. The barnyard accord that we get in Lush Kerbside Violet is here in Salty too, but much more subtle. I love this scent. This makes me think of a sexual conquest: someone you never thought would reciprocate interest, but there you are, with them, letting you get close. You never even thought you'd be in their orbit, but they're consenting, letting you close enough to inhale their scent. This is a gorgeous scent, unisex, and I love it.",11/03/21 14:21,ChypreAnn
Assassin Lush,"First scent gives pine definitely in a resin or bark way, woody, I really like resin-y pine smell in this, there's more vanilla then I like but it's ok and not too sweet for this scent. Helps keep it more unisex then feminine.

Overall deep and slightly fresh or intense outdoors scent of fallen pine needles, bark, with strong vanilla base that lasts on my clothes until the next day. Wish there was more green or sharp notes. The lime is nice, but fades and turns into fruity background. Personally feels too warm base/vanilla for my preference but nice in autumn.

Prefer wearing on my skin. Lasts a decent time,
Strong scent from first spray.",04/25/25 02:02,insanehectic
Assassin Lush,"How I hated this. The original Assassin (a shower gel) from Lush was woody and green perfection with depth, and without the addition of the horrendous sweet and fruity notes. The original was truly like a walk in the forest. We weren't told about the change at first and quite a few purchased the perfume excitedly because we loved the original. I am glad it was discontinued and never brought back, as were many. (The original thankfully did return in a subscription box once.)",03/31/24 17:14,merrymondegreen
Assassin Lush,"I wish this scent got more attention. It is one of the most interesting black currant scents I wore. It is like a walk through an abandoned garden, there are no flowers there, just overgrown plants and grass, wet soil and rotten leaves, there is also a pine tree but first of all there is this strong prominent sweet black currant juice. It was discontinued for good as it was only limited edition :(((( I am sure more people would have discovered this gem if it had been sold in all Lush stores. I will always miss you Assassin.",01/09/22 23:26,achatina

The Comforter Lush,"I have a bottle of the liquid EDP. I love the comforter as a bubble bar,so I was very exited about this perfume. And while it does smell a bit similar,it just doesnt have the same warmth to it. I see many people write about cat pee, licourice, bergamot and herbs, but I don't get any of that. To me,this is not layered at all. All I get is a very ""thin"" Black currant juice with some vanilla,and it mostly dries down to a sweet vanilla scent,and that's it. Not unpleasant at all, but very simple and child-like,to me.",07/10/22 10:03,Marianneaurora
The Comforter Lush,"I'm reviewing the body spray here. It mostly smells like blackcurrant to me. I can see where people get the cat pee from I guess, but it's only when I really think about it. I wore this a lot spring of 2020 when covid first hit the States, a very bittersweet time in many of our lives. It may have been stressful beginning to the year, but I got to spend lots more time outdoors in that bright old sun, with my partner whom I just started dating at the time, with this amazing fruity-green body spray. Every time I smell it now, it brings back those memories. I wanna buy a full bottle again some time soon for this coming season",04/02/22 12:39,smellworthy

The Comforter Lush,"Folks, the 'cat pee' being smelled is coming from the black currant accord. Black currant scent profile per Fragrantica: ""A tangy fruit note with a very characteristic ammoniac ""cat piss"" nuance sourced from green leaf buds."" I despise black currant in fragrances for the very reason of that description because my nose is hypersensitive to such smells. I do find that when the fragrance pyramid indicates a scent has the leaves, the scent is more tolerable, but I still get a 'catty' undercurrent. I'm not sure why perfumers gravitate toward black currant rather than using blackberry, but I wish it would fall out of favor...",07/27/20 18:45,DarlingNikki
The Comforter Lush,"I know EXACTLY what people are talking about, when they say they can smell “cat pee”. BUT, it’s the “green” in the fragrance. If you’ve ever walked around, back in the bush, you can smell it on really hot days. It comes from the green on wild fruit, weeds, and some flowers. Some people even think it smells a little “skunky”, like a pot plant. I think their goal was to make it smell real, rather than synthetic. And they did a good job imo. Yes it’s a little “skanky”, but I actually like that. If someone is just wanting to get into some “skank” THIS is now the one I would recommend. It’s STILL fruity, but the scent really does remind me of a hot, and sweaty day in the sun. So it’s a LITTLE dirtyISH, but not really!?!?",07/27/20 17:31,Banana ladyslipper

The Comforter Lush,"Bought the solid and yeah, cat pee. Thought I'd try it anyway in case my nose was just being crazy and it smelled all weird and herb-ish on top of the pee smell.

Really hate Lush's ""limited edition"" shenanigans because the ebayers are killing me.

Anyone know how to get rid of the pee smell? Melt it down maybe?

Because the Comforter bubble bar and lotion, and the ""You Snap the Whip"" all smelled fantastic!

Edit: Just bought a bottle of the liquid -that arrived broken all to hell, but managed to save maybe a third of it- and while it is really, really sweet smelling I'm still getting hint of cat pee. Wtf is up with this perfume? The liquid isn't nearly as bad as the solid, but damn. Something in this is ruining the scent.",07/26/15 20:17,QueenieBee
The Comforter Lush,"I have the solid version of this fragrance. It is a bit licorice-like at first, but then it develops into something creamy, fruity, and soft.

I can't comment on the liquid version, sadly.",03/11/14 18:38,fartknocker
The Comforter Lush,"I blind bought this online in 2012 during the Lush forum special sale that year (I say that in order to establish that the perfume was fresh, presumably no issues with it). I got a very strong cat urine odor with it, just nothing but cat pee -- some other reviews on the web say this as well. I wish I'd sought out more reviews before buying it, oh well. It's definitely one to try before you buy.",01/19/14 12:14,ChypreAnn

Pansy Lush,"i initially walked into lush looking for guardian of the forest body spray, as i have been longing to smell like a druid. unfortunately, they were out of stock. which led me to pansy.. love at first spray. i find that it just melts into the skin, the rosemary note is particularly pronounced on me, hints of white musk. i dislike perfumes that make me smell of..perfume. i prefer intimate, skin scents - easily found in nature. pansy ticks all my boxes. it is warm and earthy, it reminds me of the lillith fair, very 90s singer songwriter. this is my new go to perfume",10/15/25 03:43,sweetgwendoline
Pansy Lush,This smells like clean laundry but the laundry was done in a river in the forest. And the soap was made from flowers and herbs. And the laundry was line dried in a clearing with wildflowers. Can you tell this is my favorite perfume?,10/14/25 09:42,Lou.aoea
Pansy Lush,"Pansy is lovely. It is so SOFT! I'm in my late 20s and love old lady scents - though sometimes they can be a bit overwhelming. However Pansy feels like the perfect substitute for that. It has a sense of wiseness to it, some sophistication. It feels like it pairs well with talking about old memories. Having said that it smells like an old perosn, I feel like the said person would be someone a bit quirky and Earthy! It is certainly complimentary to natural body odour, it sits very nicely. It makes me want to frolic through a field with my partner.",10/04/25 05:45,Halo_land
Pansy Lush,"This is pretty musky to my nose. Not a lot of mentions of that. Also soapy. Unfortunately the green, fresh rosemary notes fade pretty quickly. Wish I wouldn't have bought a 100 ml bottle before testing it out a few times. Not saying it's bad but it's not good either.",09/30/25 17:55,Vonette
Pansy Lush,this is such a baffling and sexy scent. the rosemary comes across super strong to me so it reminds me of like a middle aged mountain woman who has an herb garden and washes her hands frequently. this could be the scent of a hand soap. however i can’t stop smelling it on me for some reason i think it fabulously complements the scent of skin rather than competing with natural stink or “smelling like perfume.” it just smells like part of you and makes you feel measurably more grown-womanly and alluring. spray this on some hot skin in store because a test strip doesn’t even give you half of it,09/22/25 16:59,disgraced

Pansy Lush,"This is an unbelievably sexy fragrance in my very humble opinion. I don’t love perfume. I definitely don’t love straight up florals. I’m usually into fruity body sprays. But this, oh my gosh! It smells like the hottest person you know, male or female, has gotten sweaty picking oranges but they showered right before and the phermones compliment their bougie soap perfectly. It’s clean but natural, simple but elevated. I smell citrus and the cleanest, slightly powdery musk.",09/07/25 14:45,MeanMama
Pansy Lush,"The bright opening of bergamot, not overly sour, is paired with the sharp, slightly bitter edge of galbanum though not too green. This is followed by a soft touch of rosemary and orange flower that never feels overwhelming. The bergamot only flash by briefly I wish the opening lingered a little longer because it feels so fresh and uplifting before transitioning into a gentle floral-herbal blend, resting on a light oakmoss base that isn’t as strong as in vintage fougère or barbershop fragrances (a style I truly love). Labdanum further softens the base, giving Pansy an even smoother dry-down.

The scent lasts around 4–6 hours and projects well around first 1-2 hours, It’s a soft, gentle fragrance built from floral and herbal notes—never offensive, never too forceful, and always friendly.",09/01/25 23:48,rakuyou___o2
Pansy Lush,"This is perfect for rainy days. It's herbal, sweet, fresh and cosy at the same time, it does smell like being in a garden centre in a way. I love that it's a little tart from the blackberry note <3

The longevity is excellent and the projection is moderate, which is nice as I feel it could end up being a little suffocating if it were stronger. I really really like this - in the summer it's a bit much but it's perfect for wet, spring days.",08/31/25 04:08,maddieonline

It is subtle, though. I wear this constantly.",06/05/25 12:24,cl195238

Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't immediately buy this.",06/02/25 22:50,skrzydlik

Pansy Lush,"This very quickly becomes an intimate green, sweet powdery scent on the skin. I have to add some on my clothes to keep around some of the herbal, candy-like notes that project a bit more.

I feel it lacks something, but layers well with Nishane's Wulong Cha, and is very comforting, like scented talc. More of a personal scent than a going out scent.

It reminds me of Foin Fraichement Coupe by Oriza.",05/11/25 04:50,Greentig3r

Pansy Lush,"I’ve been wearing this for over two years now, always in spring/summer, becoming my signature scent. It reminds me of the mediterranean sea, when you‘re on the walk, you catch a hint of flowers from someone’s garden and life feels easy. It‘s fresh, calming and somehow warm too.

Despite having relatively few notes, they are all clear to notice while being well blended together. The blackberry, bergamot and orange blossom provide subtle freshness, then there is herbal rosemary giving a bit of spice to almost powdery flowers and labdanum or oak moss giving it a creamier base. As some reviewers said, the dry-down is different from the initial spray, though i personally love both. The green herbal curtain and the flowers you get when it opens.",03/23/25 03:04,zuzana_na

Pansy Lush,"Kept wondering why it smelled familiar and then had a lightbulb & smell checked it against the ever present enormous bottle of Neutrogena Rainbath under my sink- bingo! The resemblance is especially apparent upon initial spritz, with it losing that sharper spiced edge later in the dry down. Warm, comforting, spiced as if with dried nutmeg and clove baking spices...and a hint dusty, like the back of an old wood drawer- as someone who loves antiques, that works for me! Perhaps the back of one of the drawers in my great grandmother's bathroom vanity.
Beautiful, nostalgic type smell. I've never tried the other Lush bath products containing the same scent, but as someone who has previously searched for a perfume that evoked Rainbath- how happy to have accidentally come upon this!
Somewhat ephemeral on skin (perhaps 3 to 4 hours?), but lasts well on clothes.",07/25/24 13:39,waldene.28

Pansy Lush,"I mean, of course it smells soapy, after all it is a LUSH fragrance. But its dry and herbal and very overpowering. It is unisex and sweet in a way, but I personally feel like the rosemary note makes it a bit masculine leaning, but it is definitely in the unisex realm. I see in the votes and comments that this reminds of the shower gel ‘Olive branch’, also from LUSH, and that is spot on.

This is an early morning jog in the mediterraneans, and then a nice shower followed by your new thick olive body butter, and then eating breakfast under a citrus tree.",07/02/24 07:38,monamushroom
Pansy Lush,"Opens unpleasantly sharp and green, perhaps this greenness is rosemary — but it doesn’t really read that like to me, but nearly immediately begins to sweeten and take on a gourmand quality. This fragrance reminds me of those old-fashioned lemon and violet candies that come in metal tin. Over time the citrus mellows into the background and the galbanum takes center stage, turning the fragrance into something muskier. It settles into a very wearable creamy, powdery floral.

The overall combination of notes isn’t very interesting for me, but sometimes when reaching for an everyday scent, you don’t want something remarkable. This would be good year round, but especially suitable in summer and spring. It’s a girlishly feminine fragrance, but in a short of old-fashioned way. There is a youthfulness to the fragrance that keeps it from wandering over into grandma territory. Silage is close, but longevity is not great, 2ish hours for me.",06/15/24 08:55,notomys
Pansy Lush,"Soft, sweet, clean, cozy, creamy, powdery white floral with the signature Lush twinge. A mild well-rounded perfume that can be worn regardless of age, season, or occasion.

Pansy Lush,"Very unisex and I can smell each and every one of the notes. Very light, neutral. Greatly balanced between floral, herbal, fruity and citrusy.

Pansy Lush,"Who would have thought that rosemary will be such a great scent in a perfume. This is very aromatic but grounded. I like it, my go to fragrance at home. I use it at work sometimes when I'm getting stressed, it's calming. For some reason, it works really well with my chemistry. It turns a bit musky but the scents gets deeper, smells sexy after a while. You start smelling like a bath bomb, then it gets sexier.

My fave lush scents:
American Cream (when I feel pretty)
Karma (when I'm super stressed and I need to be alone)
Twilight (makes me sleep really deep)
Sikkim Girls (I miss this scent! Super sexy, bring it back!)
Pansy (soapy and sexy)",04/11/24 12:42,vivaLVmarie
Pansy Lush,"Not a huge fan of floral scents but this one strikes me as more warm and herbal than floral. Feels almost like Karma's more springy sister. To my nose, top notes are ambery orange peel, middle are patchouli and base are leathery pine. It's a very robust Lush coded scent. A friend of mine dislikes it as it smells like a ""granny"" to her. I do agree that it smells somewhat old-timey (but not granny-like) and something about it just translates to 60s Mod and yellow floral wallpaper to me. Lasts for ages on me! Always a winner.",03/23/24 21:45,GoodyGoodwitch
Pansy Lush,"super wearable; a great balance between powdery and green. smells like you took bubble bath in ancient rome. very springy but could really be worn year round, as the powdery notes make themselves known within about an hour of wear. the true dry down of the musk + powder + slight floral nature is divine. another visual: imagine if someone sprinkled baby powder on a fragrant patch of moss.",03/21/24 23:50,aalijawijaa

In reality, I just get florals and old cigarettes. No real drydown, just a fadeaway, but another reviewer said that they got noseblind to it and the smell definitely stuck around for longer, so maybe that's what happened. I can't really relate to these notes at all, but I suspect that might be a formulation problem with the solid version. A tiny, tiny smidge of solid Dirty on top of this helped bring a little bit of life to the bergamot and rosemary here, but that thick dusty nicotine-stained quilt of Pansy was very much still present.",02/28/24 19:36,pessb

Could be worn any season but especially when plants are lush and full in spring and summer.This is my favorite reach in the spring, especially when spritzed on the hair. For a very lush green floral experience, combine with the Happy Happy Joy Joy conditioner.",08/20/23 10:48,Tembacat
Pansy Lush,"Gah! I wish I could enjoy this perfume with the rest of you (I love the shower gel) but it always pulls so masculine on me... Dry, herbal, leathery... I can smell the fruitiness from the bottle but once it hits my skin it's only there for 15-30 minutes and even then it's faint, the base notes dominate right from the start. :( Has good longevity though, about 6 hours but doesn't disappear completely until 7-8 hours.

If you're familiar with Lush perfumes, to me this is like a mix of Orange Blossom and Devil's Nightcap.",06/06/23 16:57,kpop_stan
Pansy Lush,"Interesting fragrance.

Starts out an aromatic - similar to Aqua di Parma Colonia or 4711 cologne - petitgrain/citrus/bergamot heavy. The unusual part is then the creamy, soft, woody vanilla comes out. That is why I can’t decide if I love this fragrance or not. The 4711 vibe mixed with creamy vanilla confuses my nose lol.

Pansy is a bit of a misnomer - it is not a very green nor is it a floral fragrance. Everyone says it is similar to Olive Branch and that would’ve been a better name for this perfume imo. Because it does evoke the Mediterranean- smells like someone wearing Acaua di Parma while eating vanilla panacotta.",05/03/23 21:57,Jicky1982
Pansy Lush,"This is lovely, the opening is very herbal with a slight hint of citrus, the middle is mostly citrusy with a hint of fruitiness, and the base is a light citrusy amber. For a Lush perfume it's quite transformative. My only complaint is that I wish that the herbal phase lasted a bit longer, I only really get it for a few minutes.
I would say that this is actually an amber perfume rather than herbal because of how quickly I get that base. The amber in the base reminds me a lot of L’Ambre des Merveilles by Hermes.",04/01/23 06:42,Caroline22
Pansy Lush,"Since I love the scent of Lush The Olive Branch and heard Pansy had some similiarity I dove in and bought a bottle.
I can detect the rich spicy deep orange from Branch but it is combined with a bit of sweetness I'm guessing is from the blackberry at the heart.
This is really nice!
Aromatic and joyful.
I only wish it were a stronger performer.

Pansy Lush,"An herbal and citrusy floral. It's very bright and fresh but not obnoxiously so, other reviewers have noted that Lush perfumes have a sort of earthiness to them, and that's what I love about em. It's very grounding. The body lotion in this scent is great too.",01/16/23 21:25,smellworthy
Pansy Lush,A bright and sunny floral citrus opening with a herbal undercurrent. I've been enjoying using this during the summer months as it's quite a fresh and light linear fragrance. As I find with quintessential Lush fragrances there is a 'dirty' note that can be an acquired taste.,01/09/23 05:47,vnttj_144
Pansy Lush,"To me, the beginning smells very male-leaning unisex. A bit fruity and citrusy, then it dries down and the coumarin shows up, I was surprised to find it pleasant.
I'm not a big fan of the coumarin, vanilla or buttery/gourmand kinda scents as those smell sticky, overwhelming and could be nauseating to me, but Pansy's the first perfume from my personal no-go scents that I could see myself wearing. So I picked this up for whenever I need a change of mood as it gives me a soothing, cozy feel, like drinking chocolate or caramel milk.
On me, the smell stays close to my skin and lasts about 3 hrs before it becomes powdery and barely noticeable. Not bad, but also not impressed either.",11/29/22 07:05,pimmyprink
Pansy Lush,I wish I could agree with other reviews that this smells good in the dry down but it just doesn't.. I love citrus fragrances but this specifically smells truly chemical. Not to offend but It actually reminds me of cheap public bathroom hand soap or air freshener. Everyone's describing this as cozy and it just ain't. Floral citrus hand soap.,11/21/22 16:19,MaxieF
Pansy Lush,"This is the same fragrance as The Olive Branch, sweet and herbal and a little powdery. I really like this fragrance in other LUSH products, unfortunately it feels too intense for me to wear and smell constantly as a perfume.",10/15/22 05:07,oubliette

Pansy Lush,Wow! This is just one of those perfumes I cannot stop smelling. It’s very sensual but still fresh. Smells warm and earthy. I tried this fragrance on a trip to the mall and decided to stop by lush. I sampled all of the fragrances but this was a stand out to me. The Labdanum really makes this fragrance for me. If you are a bergamot lover as I am but want something a little sexier this is it. Definitely might become my signature scent.,06/30/22 12:11,Lagatasfragrance
Pansy Lush,"I loved this in the store. Hugely green but with a dusting of beautiful florals. I bought it immediately.

Unfortunately by the time I got in my car the frag had disappeared entirely. So I tried again the next day - same thing. Within 20 minutes the smell is totally, completely gone, vanished like a gentle fart in the wind. I’ll be returning it.",06/18/22 16:15,Writtany

Pansy Lush,"Pansy is sooo pretty. There is a sweet fruity vanillic basenote that’s not really listed here and even though I don’t like sweet scents that much, it is given so much floral, spicy, smoky, and dark depth by the labdanum, galbanum and citrus that line the fringes of this perfume, adding mystery and allure to its aura. This is truly a one of a kind feminine perfume and totally signature scent worthy. And it’s made of healthy ingredients to boot.",11/11/21 18:10,DahliaFragrance

Pansy Lush,"I’m a huge fan of Lush’s Olive branch shower gel. But recently (idk if it’s just me) i felt like the smell isn’t as strong as it used to be. Years ago, when i used the shower gel my bathroom would have clouds of olive branch for hours.. now it’s so weak!

So i searched up online for perfumes that smell like it. Lo and behold i found pansy. I was so giddy when pansy arrived at my doorstep. I sprayed it on AND WOW! It does smell super duper close to the olive branch. However i find it creamier.. the reviews below me nailed it. It smells like cake. The cake/gourmand version of the olive branch. It’s strong.. seriously. It has a huge sillage and great longevity imo. Typical Lush!",10/23/21 00:30,adelaidesandrina
Pansy Lush,"Pansy smells to me like ginger cake. I have no idea why as there is no ginger in the ingredients list. I can smell citrus and rosemary as well. I don’t get any powdery notes. To my nose it is linear. I think it is unusual and definitely not for everyone and I wouldn’t wear it everyday. I feel like the best situation to wear it is in winter by the fire, feeling cosy and relaxed. In my opinion it is quite heavy fragrance and not suitable for summer. I also wouldn’t call it unisex. I think it is more feminine. It stays on skin and clothes for a decent amount of time.",09/23/21 14:30,Natlon
Pansy Lush,"I love galbanum. Pansy opens with a blast of green leaves and galbanum. I’d never actually place the Rosemary. I guess mixed with the orange blossom it simply becomes slightly astringent green, and then it moves towards a slightly powdery, herbal-floral balance. I had an Aunt Pansy, not a blood relation, but she was a very sweet person. And this reminds me of her and her back yard when we used to visit her when I was a child. Sunny and green and mossy. Did I mention I love galbanum?",08/09/21 19:56,jterjesen

Pansy Lush,"I loved the olive branch as a solid perfume and was devastated when i realized that they would stop selling it. Tried some copies and also Lush's re-make a couple of years ago but didn't really like the copies, and the re-make smelled like cat pee on me. Pansy as a solid perfume does not last at all. I had high hopes on this one, but i think it has a strong scent of anise(?) which i don't like at all in this one. And it is not as soft and cozy and balanced as i find the old olive branch solid perfume.",06/06/21 09:53,Missholypanic
Pansy Lush,"Not at all what I was expecting for the name, pansies have this overpoweringly sickly honeyed scent. But this Pansy was a pleasant surprise - it opens up with a blast of crushed green leaves, if its the blackberry its the fresh leaves of the plant, its actually very nice, almost nettle like. At the same time there is sweetness, neroli orangey sweetness and these two main note themes make a really lovely contrast for each other. I wish it would stay like this for a bit longer but sadly the longevity on me is quite weak. It also does not project much so this one remains a private joy, says she bringing her wrist to her nose for another dose of this verdant beauty. Its lovely, if a bit hidden.",05/02/21 11:31,Frangipanilove
Pansy Lush,"What. A. Disappointment.
For a dude, I really like floral scents. I like to blur the gender boundaries. This one is sickly syrupy and thick, sugary-sweet, cloying urinal cake crossed with cheap valentines heart candies and glade plug-ins... its sharp and unbalanced, and has this trashy and cheap musk background that makes it smell like the perfume from Mattel sold with the barbie dolls. Its just bad. Beginning to end, absolutely terrible.",02/25/21 16:16,Jephero
Pansy Lush,"I bought several of the solid perfumes today at Lush, and while I like the scent of most that I bought, I don't like that they all start out smelling like Crayola crayons. That must be the wax that is used. This is the worst offender. While it does lighten up, it seems to be running beneath the surface when I smell where I applied it. It's pretty off-putting. Once it lightens up to where I can smell the perfume, it reminds me of a spa scent. Citrusy, aromatic, slightly sweet, slightly floral, and slightly powdery; very formulaic. I tried the liquid version in the store, but the problem with this brand is that the sprays seem to give enormous silage that's almost overwhelming, and combined with all the other scents in the store it's hard to get a good read on what you're actually smelling. Since the solid was cheap enough I bought it so I could try it at home. Figured, if I didn't like it, not much was lost. We'll, I'm not crazy about the scent and compounding the dislike is that waxy Crayola crayon smell. Oh well, live and learn. Thank goodness it was cheap.",02/10/21 18:33,Anamandy
Pansy Lush,"I don't know why but this (solid version) smells just like the typical scent that one gets when one goes in a Lush shop.
I wish I'd get the herbal scent that some reviewers wrote here but all I get is a soapy, powdery something. It somewhat reminds me of a weaker Smuggler's Soul (which I can not stand as well) so I thought there must be sandalwood in the composition but it doesn't.",02/02/21 17:11,rurufu
Pansy Lush,"I like it! I tried it in store, was gonna purchase Rose Jam but the SA recommended it to me. Got home and tested it out and I regretted purchasing it. The opening is very hebal...?

It’s very, very pleasant and warm.",11/27/20 16:26,Rosemary14

Pansy Lush,"A girl friend of mine was wearing this and I felt the need to ask what fragrance it was. Then I went to purchase it thinking I could always resell it or gift it. Little did I know I was going to keep it for myself. Pansy is a bit too feminine for men to wear confidently so I use it as a pillow/stay-at-home scent. It's so smooth, warm, comforting... Also kind of unique! The blackberry note is the most noticeable to me but not the most dominant if that makes sense, it sticks out (sharp, watery quality) like a top note that doesn't budge away even an hour post spray. The rest is sweet, warm, enveloping, cozy.

Definitely worth a try, Pansy has one of the best price/quality ratio

End note has a mature texture. I smell little bit of vanilla,too. Honestly think this is one of the most pleasant end note, which managed to perfectly sip into my skin scent.
I would say that this scent is rather plain. It really doesn't have the distinguishable identity. Not that complexity to anticipate..To praise in other way, predictable.
Yet I think this obviousness makes people to feel safe. This is a scent of floral harmony where I'm sure that this is generally appealing and nobody would be offended by this.
Good for everyday use, but a bit pricey for a student like me.",04/10/20 08:57,peppertoki
Pansy Lush,"Warm, smoky, cuddly. It doesn't follow me or envelop me in a billowing perfume cloud, but rather a tight warm embrace. To me this is a perfect autumn/winter fragrance when I crave a bit of warmth but not the loud heat of summer just yet!",02/14/20 06:24,Tamago37
Pansy Lush,"Lately, I have learned that American Cream is available in perfume version in my region and I was rushing to try it in a Lush store. I tested American Cream and what I detected was a non rich nor creamy version of slight vegetal herbal vanilla with a trail of antiseptic scent along with it, maybe that was a bad batch and it was nothing like the hair conditioner.

With several Lush newly available perfumes in store in my region and have been under my radar: Imogen Rose, Two More Hearts and Cocktail, my nose was too busy to allow each giving me a clear impression. They all seem quite wearable and likeable. Imogen Rose has some middle eastern rosy vibe going on, but relatively lightweight... Cocktail is refreshing green and summery, Two More Hearts has a toned down Ylang Ylang along with some white florals that’s not too heady.... only 100ml for these were available, probably were not what I would consider to purchase... I have tested Breath of God many many times, it’s nice and quite unique, but for some reason it never becomes something that’s so captivating and a full bottle worthy to me... however, Pansy stood out from this bunch, the opening is all about lime and blackberry... refreshing, tart, green, citrusy.... after it settles down... A faint powdery floral... something green but I’m unable to identify if it’s rosemary or not... Overall it’s quite well blended, reminds me of a little bit of fizzy pop soda, happy and summery. I can relate to how it was a scent for a shower gel from the dry down.

I found it quite challenging to test perfumes in Lush Store, might give it another try next time.",02/09/20 04:31,Purrsian

Death and Decay Lush,"In all my years of buying fragrances, this is the only blind buy I kinda regret. I found out about it from a YouTuber and bought it thinking it would be a moody dramatic gothic fragrance like Dior's Midnight Poison. I wanted to like it, I really did. And objectively it's not a bad scent at all. But, true to its name, it does evoke feelings of sadness and (like a few other comments mentioned) smells like a funeral home... which is probably the point. Anyway, I don't exactly hate it, but it's a pass from me.",09/12/25 04:18,elvenqueen81

Death and Decay Lush,"Sniffed it and I got a big frown on my face. Something about this makes me sad which is the point. Not a fan. Very thick with the florals (Lily? I'm not strong enough to identify what I smell in this but it's certainly not jasmine or gardenia!) in a way which I don't like, but that's the point of this perfume so I can't really say the perfume failed in this regard. Maybe if it toned down the lilies I would enjoy it, I want to peek behind the curtain of this a bit more some day. Maybe I will sniff again.

Edit: Let me save you the trouble. If you've ever smelled Tubereuse Criminelle by Serge Lutens, then this is just Lush's version of it. But more grim, darker, and thicker on the white florals. I don't like it but I like Tubereuse Criminelle, because it's all these things in moderation.",07/15/25 18:14,BloomingWatergrave

Death and Decay Lush,"So lovely and unique! Kind of indolic, not in a seductive way, more in a ""funeral flowers"" type of way.

Death and Decay Lush,"A nice scent, but as a funerary archaeologist I was looking for something a bit more...realistic, more like thousand year old bones and the *actual* cloying smell of decay so advanced it just smells more like a forest than anything else. I expected notes of petrichor and a more forward animalic scent, but instead it's overwhelmingly floral. It's still a beautiful scent but not what I was expecting. I see the vision of funeral bouquet and respect it though.",06/10/25 04:42,Xcess
Death and Decay Lush,"i just went through the list of cons on this scent and i'm going to have to hard disagree with some of them.

i think the strong indolic nature of this scent and the overpowering lily note is what truly makes the name of this fragrance so apt. some may liken it to Funeral Home by Demeter, and while i've not smelt it i'm ready to disagree.

i first smelt this on a mid-afternoon in autumn, and i immediately saw an image in my mind's eye. (**let me preface this by saying that i'm not much of a daydreamer or an imaginer, so when i do receive some kind of imagery from a fragrance, i'll usually purchase it. that to me is a sign that the scent speaks to me.**)

this smells exactly like a British park after autumn rain in the late afternoon or early evening, when it's starting to get dark. this is when the trees are starting to shed their leaves and become bare, and the litter is slowly beginning to break down and decompose. i get the scent of wet leaf litter, the slightest hint of that raw/ animalic(??) vibe from rotting plants, but also the sweet smell of decay that is often associated with decomposition. i'd say it's fairly melancholy because it clearly smells like something to do with death, yet it is beautiful to me in the way it is serene and comforting. it's definitely more outdoorsy than a funeral home. another possible comparison if we're going along the lines of funerals is a columbarium by the mountains.

i think this is a palatable and wearable gothic scent for the lovers of all things dark and mellow. while Death and Decay itself isn't the darkest, heaviest scent out there, it's a fragrance that evoked a strange sort of peace and bittersweetness in me when i first smelt it. i've rarely liked a fragrance so much on the first sniff and i'm not even exaggerating LOL. i don't find it overpowering despite my usual aversion to many white flower forward fragrances (i have a vendetta against jasmine LOL), and i'd argue that the lilies in this perfume are quite delicate and almost intoxicating. on that note, i will say i don't get much powderiness from this fragrance.

one last note: i have an old leather handbag that i thrifted and didn't bother deodourising because i'm a sucker for strange smells and quite like the animalic, smoky and slightly sweet notes i get from the smell of the old leather. i often wear that bag when i wear this fragrance to add more of an animalic feel to my overall scent profile for the day, and really play into the mournful, funereal feel of Death and Decay.",05/19/25 09:04,sintura
Death and Decay Lush,"Does not smell like funeral home, maybe like a cemetery though. I was mainly looking for lily but I get a bunch of mixed florals, perhaps chrysanthemun among them, but lily did not stand out. Performance is fine.",04/23/25 13:34,Bordo
Death and Decay Lush,"It's a very pretty, powdery floral fragrance. While Fragrantica lists lily and the creator notes mention it, on the Lush website, lily is not mentioned anywhere. They list Jasmine, Rose, Ylang-ylang and Tonka..NO lily. Strange, right?

With the florals, it has this warm presence in the drydown which adds interest and keeps it from being boring. I really like this, in spite of the name. Rather femme leaning.
Ok performance, does better on clothes.

BUT LET'S BE CLEAR - there is
Nothing funeral.
Nothing about death.
Or decay.
Or a coffin.
Or a vampire.
No gut wrenching goodbyes or grief acceptance or cold stone mausoleum floors...what the heck??..LOL(THAT made me laugh A LOT, such imagination!.., 😁)

IT'S A PERFUME, lol...with some rather strange & interesting MARKETING. Lush does that- all the time.

It's not goth, or dark ...
It's a softly spicy, floral fragrance.
It smells like THE BEST hotel soap in the world. I plan on buying a bottle.

Death and Decay Lush,"I have only used the solid version. Death and Decay is my favorite fragrance of all time - it's strong, floral, slightly powdery and peppery, dark, brooding, gothic. For me it's not quite giving funeral. It's walking past almost nauseatingly strong blooming flowers on a hot, humid late summer night. Flower bouquets on the bedside, quiet, still air, hot feverish skin as the inevitable approaches. There's a sense of doom, like knowing something bad is coming but accepting it and choosing to take it in with all senses since you can't avoid it.

D&D is my signature scent and I only apply it on special occasions, as it's no longer available as solid and the liquid is for sale three countries away from me. I keep searching for something, anything that will scratch the same dark, gothic floral itch so I can move on from D&D but I've not smelled anything like it anywhere in any form. It's bewitched me.

I'd say it feminine-leaning unisex, I myself am a goth man and it makes me feel powerful and confident.",03/04/25 15:19,VesperBat
Death and Decay Lush,"It smells like embalming fluid. Very synthetic and chemical with a floral cover up. There is an element of that spit/ skin smell that comes with lily and lilac, which is new for me. Kind of a different take on a funerary scent, it’s interesting to compare with Demeter’s Funeral Home which is much cleaner but equally plasticky. Plasticky works in both these cases, especially considering the ways we use glamour and artifice to avoid facing the reality of death (at least in north america and western european traditions).
Perfect for late winter, but i get the sense it will be overpoweringly cloying in warm weather.",02/20/25 15:01,girlhaggard
Death and Decay Lush,"This is a lovely scent that I don't really think I need given the price point.

This is a lily Soliflore that does smell great for what it is. It smells like waxy, wet lilies with a slightly smell of Nivea Creme going on.

It's indolic and a little spicy as lily tends to be and generally smells quite pleasant if you're a lily fan like I am.

So why do I not want this lovely scent?

Simply put, Anais Anais offers a delightful Lily scent that is much more complex at a far better price whilst offering a similar ""funeral parlor"" feeling. Between that scent's oakmoss and the delicate powder of hyacinths that undercuts the lilies I just can't in good faith purchase Death and Decay at the steep £100 price when Anais Anais is £32 on the worst day. Even vintage bottles are cheaper!

Also, Viktor and Rolf Tiger Lily offers a more upbeat lily scent for the days when I want a bit more pep in my lily scent.

In conclusion, very nice scent but it lacks the complexity to be worth the price for me.

Try Anais Anais if you like this though. You may very well join me in the floral bliss.",02/03/25 15:15,lalapope
Death and Decay Lush,"Death and Decay is a beautiful, gut wrenching goodbye. I expected Death and Decay to be dark and gothic, something dramatic and moody. Instead, I was hit with the quiet reality of death itself. This isn’t the scent of romanticised decay, it’s the air inside a chapel during a funeral. The overwhelming presence of lilies, their fragile beauty arranged in honour of someone who is no longer there. A perfume of grief, of remembrance, of love that lingers even in loss.

To me, this smells exactly how I imagine the ending of Robert Eggers’ Nosferatu would. A chilling finality, the beauty of death intertwined with sorrow. It embodies the Death and the Maiden motif; delicate florals against the shadow of something inevitable, the contrast between innocence and the inescapable embrace of the unknown.

The white florals are strong, almost too much at first, just like the emotions they represent. The lilies feel waxy, almost suffocating, the way funeral flowers can be when they fill a room. There’s a slight freshness, like the chill of stone floors. It’s haunting, not in a ghostly way, but in how it reminds you of moments you wish you could forget, yet hold onto all the same.

Death and Decay is heartbreakingly beautiful. It doesn’t romanticise grief; it captures the aching truth of it. The kind of scent that stays with you, long after everything else has faded.",01/31/25 13:08,maryfagdalen
Death and Decay Lush,"I thought this would be a great unique fragrance for a gothy, cemetery vibe but there is a very sharp and cloying urine/ ammonia like smell upon first spray all the way until dry down where it mellows out that I just cannot stand, the dry down smells like one of those fancy old soaps your grandma has that she’s never taken out of the wrapping because it looks good as decoration. Overall for matching description I’d say it’s a 5/10 definitely smells like a funeral but like cat pee as well lol",01/15/25 14:33,rioxochi

Death and Decay Lush,"I absolutely love this perfume. My go-to turned from Vegan Leather Jacket to Death and Decay when I began working at lush. I wanted a gothic, light smell compared to the smokey perfume I was currently wearing. Death and Decay is just that. A goths dream. It smells like lilys, planning a funeral and choosing the flowers for the coffin. It smells like your Nans house in spring and the grief that comes with remembering it.

I often also layer it with VLJ and the combination of the two leaves you smelling like a smoker at a rainy funeral, trying not to cry while a wet black blazer weighs you down. It’s grief and warmth and never feeling whole.

Death and Decay may be my all time favourite fragrance, I think it is beautiful.",11/21/24 14:30,Juneygloomy

Death and Decay Lush,"There is a strong, sharp, powdery pepper note that I don't think enough people are picking up on, and when I spray it on my neck, I sneeze almost every time. It's a very polarizing scent, and the lilies are dominant. My aunt said it felt like a funeral parlor. But to me, it smells like the Church hall on Pascha-- a little incence-ey. I get a lot of compliments on it, though and its projection is just over arms-length and leaves a very faint trail. More compliments on it from men than from women. A lot of men think it smells gourmand, specifically cinnamon, specifically specifically, ""like a cookie"".",10/03/24 12:02,Aphris

Too young and innocent to know it would decay soon. How strange the scent but the beauty of the little bird remained.... death inbetween beautiful white flowers. Beautiful decay on your skin, lilys on your clothes.

Bought this while abroad in Belgium and was fortunate to have got it in its oil form; the bottle cost me over $100usd at the time but it lasted me nearly ten years with scarce use and its memory still sticks with me.

Death and Decay Lush,"I have an old dropper bottle of this from back when I worked at lush and a kind coworker grabbed this and All Good Things for me from the UK. I have to vehemently disagree with the review highlights saying it doesn’t smell like death and decay. It absolutely does, but the beautiful aspects of those vague ideas. It smells like funeral flowers. Like they’ve been sitting in water for a little too long and are at that point where you can tell they’re on their last leg but you’re not ready to toss them yet. It smells melancholy if that makes sense but it’s really beautiful. I love jasmine but I usually stay away from powdery fragrances. However, this isn’t baby powder like I usually hate. It’s like… your mom’s old make up she let you play with. There are a lot of things about this perfume that conjure feelings of nostalgia and longing for what used to be but in a loving way, not a sad way. Like “look at this beautiful journey I’ve been on that shaped me into who I am today. Full of heartache and happiness, somehow I’ve ended up here”. And that’s the Death and Decay that gives it its name.",03/17/24 08:42,TheFinalPurl

I lost it not long after…so annoying. fast forward, just found it a few weeks ago, safely packed up in a forgotten box stored in a cool dry cellar…I feel like I won a prize! And wow it aged so well. Deepened. Smoooooth. I live on the North Atlantic ocean, and this I layered with Lush Lust solid. They sing together in ocean fog. Great longevity and the scent stays true, softly fading but never fully leaving. It’s too bad Death&Decay isn’t available as a solid anymore, it really is the cleanest & highest quality solid I’ve tried…maybe a limited run? Anniversary promotion perhaps?

Death and Decay Lush,"I‘ve been a huge fan of Lush perfumes for 7 years now but I didn‘t get to try this perfume till now. I guess I kept distance from floral scents for some reason for too long and most of the Lush perfumes I haven‘t tried are florals, I‘m a guy and I don‘t like wearing heavy powdery florals. I got this perfume a few days ago in Prague and I gotta say it surprised me a lot.
At first it smells really fresh. Almost like a garden in the summer after it‘s rained at night. A little bit like some flowers that have been in a vase for a day or two and you smell that floral aroma mixed with watery notes. It‘s very clean and fresh. The top notes remind me of Lust but it‘s not as in your face and heady as Lust. I guess it‘s the combination of rose, jasmine and ylang ylang that both of these perfumes have. Chances are, if you enjoy one of them, you‘re probably enjoy the other. I had Lust 6 years ago and I loved it at first but I had to sell it later on because it was just too strong for me. Death and Decay is lighter but not weak. You also get some tonka bean notes in the background. After some time, the scent becomes a little bit more powdery (but not in a grandma type of way) and soapy (again not in a bad way, it just smells clean and fresh) and you‘re left with a delicate floral aroma that definitely screams LUSH and is unisex.
I put this perfume on around 10:30 am and now it‘s 11:30 pm. I can still smell it on my wrist (of course it‘s not as strong as when I sprayed it earlier today, but the scent is there) and I did a lot of physical activity during this hot summer day (I went cycling for an hour and took 15 k steps). This perfume lasts and is high quality. The price is high but its performance is outstanding. I definitely recommend buying this perfume if you enjoy the scent.",08/14/23 14:40,cinksm
Death and Decay Lush,"Very nice upon first spray - I actually got a lot of jasmine, a bit reminiscent of their Lust scent. Smelled kind of dusty in a way that I liked upon opening.

Death and Decay Lush,"My dearest Death and Decay, what can I say! Another heavy-hitter from Lush. Purposefully lethargic, numb, indifferent. Complex and subjective. Hypnotically off-putting. Vampiress whispering to her soon-to-be victim, ""come into my boudoir.""

Bountiful white lilies compete with other white florals: roses, ylang-ylang, jasmine, some of them fresh, but many withered with age, giving us a foreign sense of floral musk, the Decay. Mortician's cosmetic powder dusted liberally onto the corpse, illusions of cleanliness trying to mask the heart beneath: the Death, something damp, indole (the semi-sweet, dirty, rot kind), cream with no sweetness, wax, and cloves. The girlies who've roamed cemeteries during significant downpours or happened upon a shallow, poorly concealed grave would get it—the girls that don't get it, simply don't!

If you don't care for the morbid or occult themes, if the name on the bottle unsettles you, if you only like your florals smelling fresh and vibrant, if you mainly enjoy upbeat and peppy, if you hate cloudy days, if you enjoy basic, this is not the fragrance for you.

Smells like Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead:
""The virginal brides file past his tomb
Strewn with time's dead flowers
Bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a darkened room
The Count
Bela Lugosi's dead...""

Same potent and long-lasting Lush formula. Good for intimate settings (used in moderation, of course)—funerals or office settings alike. I have this in both the spray and solid, I find the solid has more of the creamy and spicy notes shining through. A gentle scent that does not command head-turns like most other perfumes, but instead suggests you to sniff till you are content. This got me the compliment ""you smell very comforting, cozy,"" if only I could describe how their face twisted with confusion when I replied ""Thank you! I'm wearing Death and Decay by Lush.""

This fragrance has had a haunting influence over me. Shivers up my spine after application, I am commanded to do my eyeshadow and eyeliner heavier, darker, my lips done with burgundy, deep browns, and black; I trail to my wardrobe and dawn only black or muted deep colors for the day, silver accessories. I am imbued with something gothic, something Victorian—I become a muse of Dark Romanticism.

Entranced and soothed with Death and Decay's namesake reminder of the inevitable fate we face as mortal beings. And this fragrance has allowed me to make peace with it.",07/24/23 21:21,honeyedclover
Death and Decay Lush,"Strong lily scent. This scent is evocative of the scent of potent, spicey spring flower bulbs - like hyacinth, narcissus and Easter lilies. Not in a fresh, green way - but in a rich, thick, indolic way. It also reminds me of black locust flowers.

It goes on a bit strong at first, a bit sharp and slightly mothbally. But luckily that aspect fades fast and the scent smoothes out. It remains a lily scent thoughout the wear - but by the drydown it becomes much softer, soapier.

I think this is a perfect spring scent (when it is still cool out) because as I said it reminds me of heady/spicey spring flower bulbs. It would also be nice for fall tho, because it is floral, but it is rich enough for autumn season. This scent is too heavy for summer imo and it goes a bit sour in the heat.",07/02/23 21:27,Jicky1982

Death and Decay Lush,"As someone who's mother's favourite flower is white lily, I was expecting a 'rich floral bouquet' or 'decaying floral bouquet' as described by at least half the reviewers here... But all I got was burnt plastic and used public toilet from FIRST SPRAY.

Seriously, this is just as pungent as faecal oud - downright offensive in most environments. This is far from sophisticated and elegant... Nor is it complex or ''unique'' - it's burnt plastic / public toilet from first spray to dry-down.
What really peeves me is this costs $125, Lush is really pushing prices higher than well-known niche brands.
The only upside (or downside in this case) is that this is very strong and long lasting compared to other Lush scents.

Not impressed, there are far more interesting scents from Lush. 'Death and Decay' is very aptly named through - I'm sure something died and has started to decay inside my body ever since I sniffed this.",01/15/23 14:02,Palmer Eldritch
Death and Decay Lush,"After reading the reviews, the name of the bottle, the notes, and the vibe, I was extremely excited to try this, as someone who spends a lot of time in cemeteries. The smell of the cemetery is something which I find to be the most beautiful smell to exist. Sweet, freshly-cut grass, earth, blooming lilies and decaying flowers. What did I smell when I tried this? A service station toilet. Seriously. Like, the smell of a toilet that is regularly used which hasn’t been cleaned all day, mixed with a cheap, powdery foam soap. Now I’m all for dirty fragrances, but this just smells straight up disgusting. If you want to smell like a motorway toilet, this would be perfect for you!",01/14/23 04:39,Davidleeroth

Death and Decay Lush,"Got my hands on the vintage formulation this week. The one in the dropper bottle. Never been opened so the scent is entirely intact. I must say, for those who wonder: to my surprise, the reformulation of this scent is pretty much the same. Bravo lush!

Its a heady floral, lily to be exact. But its the smell of lily's in decay. This makes me feel nostalgic but i don't know why. The very first time i sniffed this, i was in store and i was a bit overwhelmed by it. Its the feeling you get when you've unlocked a scent memory, only there is no memory? It made me feel a tad bit nervous like something was about to happen but i wasn't sure if it was scary or exciting, maybe it was both? I felt so moved by this i thought it was a little silly at first. The current version is slightly more powdery then the vintage version (wich is the one i am wearing right now) the vintage version is just slllliiightly more syrupy. And maybe I'm mistaking but i feel like the current version is a bit stronger maybe? Projects more maybe? I'm not sure about that though. I just remember when i used up a tester vial of that one, the smell stuck in my house for weeks. It was on everything i had touched when wearing it. I feel like the vintage one i am wearing is just a tad closer to the skin, but i only just started wearing it so maybe it's too early to tell. Anyway. If you are into let's say, Bpal perfumes, you will 100% like/love this one. I am still going to buy the 100 ml as well as i don't think I'll ever want to run out. :)",06/03/22 09:58,miewtje

Death and Decay Lush,"Lou Reed’s mistress’s balled-up tissue. Diaphanous organza dresses making way for a spider’s web. Defenestrated polyisoprene dipped in a lipstick sugar kiss. Sanguine cabbage served on a bed of frostbitten Flixotide. One thesaurus borne of a single mind and spread over two reviews, destined to fight itself in a masked ballroom. The ouroboros. A dog eating its own vomit.

A semi plastic lily interspersed with wafts of supermarket mushrooms. I find this strangely balmy with a morning breath indole. Mildewy…Occasionally smells like the inside of a pencil case. I am mesmerized by @sarahswitchblade’s review! Inspired by this, I would like to add my own lyrical interpretation of this captivating fragrance.

Death and Decay Lush,"rotting lilies weeping in a sunken garden. fog gathering on glistening grass outside an abandoned church. pale hands pulling flowers out of the earth, trailing with wet soil. stretching supinely with hands turned up. dearly departed, decaying by a creek.

a period of statis. lush perianths dance in spectral air, a tender song of indolic jasmine lulls. the writing on the wall meets hushed voices of solemnity. formaldehyde and dust settle onto cold linoleum. a forgotten bouquet of lilies in a hospital room eating oxygen.

wandering of whim, waxing and waning. draping of lace, interment eternal. parting willingly, sweetly, with not an ounce of malignity. a final testament for those who recall such adversities to efface them for the better- to remember me through death and decay.

a dolorous take on indole. so delicate yet tranquilizing. i remember testing this perfume when i first discovered lust 5 years ago. lust was my signature when i was 14, and the fact i still wear it today solidified my belief that i'd now be head over heels for death and decay.

i decided on a whim to blind buy 3.4 oz of it and i could not be happier in my decision! it's so keen to me. i find it beyond comforting, it's a very touching scent. so mournful and poetic and beyond words.

Death and Decay Lush,"The name is meant to mislead you. The nose behind this fragrance wanted to create something ""surprisingly pleasant when you're expecting something awful"". If you smelled this I think you'll agree that's exactly what he managed to do.

This is honestly not only one of Lush's best but one of the best perfumes I've ever smelled, hands down. I think this perfume is a work of genius. The way that it evolves is so interesting to me. It's one of those rare ones where I love it for every single second of its life. It's a floral through and through but changes so much more than you would expect. The opening is like a fizzy, bubbling, fermenting floral bouquet from which the jasmine distinguishes itself more and more as it progresses into the core. During that time when the jasmine is at the forefront, it's really similar to Lush's Lust (basically pure jasmine). If you aren't familiar with the way Lush does jasmine, it's like chemical and plastic yet addictive and intoxicating.

As the jasmine dies down, it turns into such a beautiful, delicate white floral. That's what you're left with except as it dries down, it turns creamier and creamier and the end result is so comforting. The drydown is really similar to Lush's Ghost (or Lush's Sultana of Soap in terms of creaminess). I only picked up a bottle this summer so I didn't get a chance to smell it in cold weather yet but so far, I've found that I like it much more on humid days. It projects well, it has decent staying power, it was recently made more expensive but it's worth the price.

(This review is for the version they came out with for the black label perfumes they only sell in big bottles, I've heard that this is slightly different from older versions in that it's more soapy but it's the only version I've ever tried so I wouldn't know.)",08/28/21 14:06,O+M+D

It helpes me realise what is going on. I put it on when I moved out of my moms house and when we put the family dog down. It has besome my scent for goodbyes. Its bittersweet and comforting at the same time. The image I get when I put it on is sitting in the pews at church, everyone in their own little world of grief. Notes playing on the organ, the sound of crying. I look up at the casket, flowers laid on top, an the sun falls through tall church windows. I realise this is as much a beginning as an ending.

It is like dying lilies, when they are starting to decay, pollen everywhere, petals curling up. With an interesting, plastic note in the beginning that fades a little over time. Indolic, yes, but more in a decaying way. It feels a bit incomplete, as in another layer would complete this scent - I am going to test layering this with other perfumes.

Death and Decay Lush,"This is one of my favorite fragrances (as previously reviewed below) but it was only available for a limited time!

Well, I just found that LUSH have brought it back!
However, I'm quite sure that the ingredients are different. I have read previously that they have been adding water to scents which previously contained none, thus making their scents far weaker.
It's also pretty pricey, coming in at £95 for 100ml, so if it is weaker that's not so grand. Good to see a bigger size being made available though!

Looking forward to trying it and finding out if it's anything like the original version - which I own in the solid variant and the dropper/splash bottle variant.

My problem comes with the introduction of the tonka, that creates a smell that reminds me quite a bit of acetone. I feel like it clashes, dries down aggressive and could do with some more sweetness. But who knows, that might just be my sugar addiction talking.",04/28/19 07:43,aishmiqru
Death and Decay Lush,"Beautiful and complex. A thick soapy and slightly cloying (which adds to it's charm) fragrance.

The overwhelming smell of Lily in this is from Lilial which is a synthetic aldehyde used in Laundry powders. This is backed up with cinnamyl alcohol (natural or chemical based) which is also powdery, and has notes of hyacinth. Combined they create quite a punch.
The natural fragrances sit underneath these and I find them difficult to detect as the synthetics remain constant and very loud (which I assume is the intention).

The only way I have been able to unravel Death and Decay is to use it along side Arlesienne by L'Occitane only then can I pick out the Rose (Damascus) and the Tonka.

After quite some time the synthetics start to calm down but they take the natural oils with them so you never get to the stage where the perfume changes and the notes become readily identifiable.


I love Death and Decay and I'm really sorry that it's been discontinued.",09/15/18 15:44,msginsling
Death and Decay Lush,"It smells just like lilies! I love lilies so I am totally into it. It is fresh with a little bit of baby powder. It is exactly the kind of scent you smell in funerals when there is a bunch of flower surrounding you. Overall it just reminds me of my family's love her lilies. However, the scent is probably to ""old"" for me, if that makes any sense.",03/14/18 02:00,kol_beans

Death and Decay Lush,I was hoping for indolic and challenging. Death and Decay smells of neither death nor decay but the pearlescent white soap in government bathrooms in the 90s. A positive is that the solid perfume is white/cream so it doesn’t stain your skin or clothes like some of the other pigmented solid scents do.,02/23/18 20:17,Neosmiaphyte
Death and Decay Lush,"I am not sure what indole smells like. This did not smell of death or dying flowers to me though. I guess indole is that strange background smell on the initial blast, that quickly turns into fresh cut spring flowers, very green with a hint of rose and tonka (almost marzipan like)in the background. The dry down smells very similar to the Mary Quant perfume in a tin from the 70's or indeed, Lush's own 1000 kisses.

I like it but see it as a summer evening or formal occasion scent. No black goth outfits or sexy siren red, more floral wedding guest attire or slinky pastel number. Different from the norm and quite strong. You will get noticed!!",02/04/18 11:11,lolitajade

Death and Decay Lush,"Just the sickly sweet corpse-like lily I was looking for. Nice goth gf aesthetic, obscenely strong opening, then mellows out to a bready smell close to a diluted red aoud. Amazing quality for the price. I got the dropper bottle because it's stronger and more complete of a scent than the solid.",09/02/17 14:22,Ape Wilson
Death and Decay Lush,"I ordered the solid. Wicked lovely concept, but I feel it just didn't hit its mark. I expected angsty, vintage-guitar-playing vampires in lacy cravats or whatever. Maybe if the other notes had played a more balanced role, but this was just overwhelmingly WHITE FLORAL. Obnoxiously so. No complexity. It reminded me of a funeral only in that I wanted to avoid it.

Way back in my tweens I had a bottle of some Yves Rocher number that was made with lilies and something spicy and the dichotomy was actually quite lovely, so I really feel like this one just needs to be reworked because the concept is just too cool to abandon.

....now I need to go figure out which Yves Rocher perfume that was. Dangit.",08/21/17 21:28,QueenieBee

Death and Decay Lush,"I just received the liquid version of this beauty. I loved the solid so much that after spending some time with it, thought it worth the expenditure in hopes for extra projection and strength. And it delivers.

How do the solid and liquid compare? The liquid is not as waxy/soapy from the container. It also has a bit of a boozy vibe to open, not like an inherent base alcohol blast, but like an intentional note of styrax or extra indole. It does settle down into virtually the same vibrant scent (see my first review a few boxes down), but with with more staying power and sillage.

I just wish that the dropper was a spray instead as I like to apply diffusively instead of on a concentrated spot. Easily fixed with a transfer into an empty spray bottle, however this stuff is strong and one drop from the pipette does the trick, so I'll be spraying with caution or diluting with some perfumer's alcohol.",06/26/17 20:18,Tigerlillian
Death and Decay Lush,"I finally tried this today, worrying it would be too indolic, but I don't find it indolic at all. Lush scents work well with my skin chemistry, I don't get indoles, Lust is actually a compliment getter for me even from perfume haters! :) Anyway, I found this disappointing because it was just soapy and clinical. Nothing dark, gothic, or even sexual. Just hospital bathroom soap. Oh well.",06/16/17 23:22,tiababy
Death and Decay Lush,"Buxom, thriving, flourishing. Death and Decay is a fully realized, optimistic flower in the height of its beauty; a truly superb operatic aria.

This lily is narcotic and mature, heavily laden with dark orange pollen and reeking with an indolic sap. A little spicy, like a hint of metallic clove accents this beauty. Any fuller and her petals would be falling and her pollen littering the stage with rust; right on the verge of decay.

I am madly in love with this scent. I had sampled a few lilies recently in my quest for the perfect one. And here she is, thanks to a beautiful Fragrantican who gifted this to me.

This is the perfume solid. I see chimidoro's observation below that this is spicier than the liquid perfume, so I'll be sticking to the solid because this scent is perfection. The texture also feels like waxy petals which adds to the experience. I think this lily-bomb will be fantastic for layering too. So pleased, I haven't been so unexpectedly seduced by a fragrance like this for a long time.",04/15/17 22:28,Tigerlillian
Death and Decay Lush,"I love this scent. I'm talking the liquid version.
I wonder why Fragrantica's note list tells that it has lily, powdery notes and spicy notes, and nothing else. You can go Lush's own page and see that it's listed ylang ylang oil, tonka absolute,rose oil, jasmine absolute, and indole. Also there's lily note ( not lily-of-the-valley) but I don't know if it's natural or not (go and look, maybe you understand better).
This is really really beautiful floral perfume. Im going to add that in my collection as soon as possible.

Edit, February 2018: I never thought that they would discontinue this beauty. Lush changed almost the whole collection, and I never got this. When I went finally to buy this, they said it doesn't exist anymore. I'm so disappointed...",03/28/17 13:36,Chic-girl

Death and Decay Lush,"A gorgeous, delectably soapy, spiced & silken, moist & musky lily.

This scent is in the same vein as The Body Shop's original White Musk oil (which I love), only cooler/crisper/more biting in character, with less notes & boasting a dominant, all-encompassing focus on the lily.
Striking shades of Donna Karan's Gold are also apparent here, but I find that rather sickly sweet, too strong and too dry for my taste.

I smell no lily of the valley here.
(Appreciate & agree with Calvini's review.)

Powdery, but not overly ""tonka bean style"" dry.
Soapy, though not overtly aldehydic.
Creamy, yet not overly vanillic.

The solid is a touch spicier than the liquid version.
I was actually put in mind of a good korma the first time I smelled the solid. (Please don't let that put you off!)

This is one of those scents that I've often applied before bed. A classic, ladylike scent, I assume is intended for evening wear.
I often find myself opening the bottle to take a sly sniff of the dropper rather than to apply to my skin.

I adore LUSH's Death & Decay & hope it remains available indefinitely. (Though I'm upset by the price hike....)

Death and Decay Lush,"At this point you’ll have to admit that the Gorilla perfume house has no difficulties going even anti-marketing when they feel like. Presenting really non-conformist art concepts is already forceful, but look at how easily they’ve launched a product with this sinister name and such an awful smell. Similarly, launching a supposedly dystopian perfume describing it by words such as ’’unnerving, unsettling, disjointed, fractured"" and ""bitterness’’ (see: The Bug) - doesn’t this all go against marketing as we know it today? Still, these shelves at the shops can be sustained the way they are by the support of all the other popular products that they’re trading (as I figure). Anyways, all I can smell here is a badly scented floor cleaner version of pungent, unpleasant, artificial lily and nothing else. I like, however, the idea that at funerals a lot of lily is used, hence they present a lily perfume with this name.

TLDR: The worst of any Lush perfumes I’ve ever smelt and the biggest rock and roll concept of theirs.",12/18/16 13:18,Chaos Reigns
Death and Decay Lush,"To me this is very nice and natural; it's fresh, clean/soapy & dirty/musky at the same time, and not really sweet (unlike most other well-known lily fragrances). It feels rather serene as opposed to anything rotten, which is the true message of this fragrance: Acceptance and peace with death.

*BTW true lilies and lily of the valleys are actually quite different; they're both monocots but are in different order & family... This is not an interpretation of the latter",10/16/16 01:54,Calvini
Death and Decay Lush,"Tried a sample. BLEECH!. All I got from this was a cheap, overpowering lily scent. It could have benefited from combining dank earth with a sickly sweet lily and violet scent; if it wanted to convey death. Be bolder with creating a fragrance that represents such finality.",09/18/16 22:07,kateridelisle
Death and Decay Lush,A great lily fragrance. The opening smells just like inflateable plastic lilos lol It settles quickly and then its all about lilies but there is not a lot of powderiness on me. Im not getting much spice but there is some sweetness. Not too much though. Im sure I can detect musk which is stopping the lily from being to screechy. Moderate sillage and lasts for a good few hours. A nice fragrance for a summer evening.,07/29/16 04:09,shushkin
Death and Decay Lush,"Despite their names, Death and Decay is almost a mirror image of Lush’s Vanillary. While in Vanillary the dominant sweetness of vanilla and tonka is cut by the fresher but still heady scent of white flowers, in Death and Decay the white flowers are rounded out by vanilla and tonka.

Ylang-ylang and jasmine dominate throughout, from the opening to the dry down. Without the name, I’m not sure I’d have caught lily at all, unless the powdery base is lily pollen. Rose makes a cameo appearance in the heart notes, while vanilla and tonka bean add warmth and creaminess.

This scent is noticeably indolic, which is an uneasy combination with the gourmand notes, and goes some way to explaining why Death and Decay is so polarising. A smidge more sweetness and it would turn from slightly overripe to positively rotting.

I don’t associate Death and Decay with serenity, or even solemn funeral flowers. It’s more like a busy flower market at the end of a hot day, when some of the plants are starting to turn, and others have been crushed under foot.

This all sounds rather unpleasant, but in fact I return to Death and Decay again and again. Like a song that grows on you the more you hear it, this scent is intriguing and unusual. It’s another Lush experiment that manages to create an interesting, challenging scent with just a handful of notes – and a successful one in my opinion.",07/05/16 05:49,Fallstar
Death and Decay Lush,"""lily with over-ripe tones of indole""

Basically.... lily (funeral scent) pumping out ripe indole (feces scent) accurately creating death and decay. If white florals work with your skin chemistry this might just be an interesting and soft scent. Very similar to demeter's ""funeral"" which is an overload of lilies, but with baby powder and hints of rot.

Death and Decay Lush,"Very indolic white lilies and jazmine. Reminds me of my beloved Jazmín en Crema by Vizcántar, with its oily, very indolic bottom. Also reminds me of some vintage floral scents by Myrurgia. It's powdery, comforting, soooo vintage and intoxicating. Only for people who appreciate some dirt and indole in their fumes, not a clean, innocent or youthful floral. It goes rather strong at first but does not last long in my skin,only about two or three hours and it becomes a skin scent, like an expensive floral soap. I find this elegant and propper for a spring day, does not smell of funerals to me perhaps for the different cultural background (in my country the funeral flowers are chrysanthemums and carnations while lilies are more liturgical). It has a certain melancholic quality anyway. Love the packaging, sooooo much reminds me of a potion out of Harry Potter books, more so as it's mainly a lily powerhouse. This could have easily been one of Severus Snape's concoctions dedicated to the memory of his beloved Lily Evans. I'm not ashamed to admit I bought it for the Harry Potter connection and the lovely packaging. A bit too expensive, won't repurchase as Jazmín en Crema de Vizcántar and Nebras by Al Rehab satisfy my taste for white florals at a much lower price and last much longer on my skin.",05/06/16 04:54,Loca del Tó
Death and Decay Lush,"I'm torn about this fragrance. The first hour or so of wear is lovely, overripe lilies with a lot of powder, it smells very vintage without being ""old lady""-ish. The overripe lily I feel can be polarizing, the note comes off very sweet and somewhat musky. However, I feel like you need to be careful while applying because this stuff is STRONG. Not only on skin, any fabric this touches will have the smell of Death and Decay for days, and this smell can easily can be overpowering, suffocating, and even nauseating in excess. After a few hours a note begins to appear that, to be blunt, smells like poop. Like, actual poop. When I first smelled this note I had no idea where it was coming from until I realized it was Death and Decay.
TL;DR It smells like a powdery floral at first, then morphs into what can only be put as flowers and poop.",05/05/16 18:15,izzo

Death and Decay Lush,"I wrote my previous review of Death and Decay last year. Then life (and death) happened, and I was caring for a dying person I was very fond of, often wearing this scent while doing so. After she'd passed away, I swapped my bottle, as I did not bear to smell it. Too many associations. I promised myself, though to wait and buy it again in due time. The due time came today, but this time round I went for the solid, as the liquid perfume is of monster strenght.

I do not want to write another review here, just want to share something interesting I heard in a podcast with Carla Valentine, curator of Barts Pathology Museum in London. According to what she said, indole, the chemical we all know so very well from jasmine and other white flowers, can also be found in coffee, chocolate, semen, poop (we also knew that one, right?), of course all kinds of perfumes and last but not least decomposing bodies! Call me morbid, but I find it somehow touching and beautiful. This faithful little aromachemical accompanies us from our conception via all the delights and necessities of life till death and beyond. How nice! From now on, I will officially think of indole as the bridge between this side of the Styx and the Big Unknown Beyond.

Hm. I am happy to own this little beauty again!",12/05/15 06:23,Ditta70

Death and Decay Lush,"Death and decay is a true winner. I did not realize this was such a polarizing fragrance!
Death and Decay (as explained to me by a store rep in Tokyo, Japan) is not being interpreted correctly. It is meant to represent and highlight its main note of Lily of the Valley in all of its stages of life from vegetative, to floral, to full bloom and then into decay.
The funeral flower (lily) is alive and well i assure you. This is a lush green floral, a beautiful and new idea that carves its way into my heart through its use of natural oils, its balanced and well blended composition and its polarizing affects on people.
Namesake aside, this awesome fragrance is long lasting, stunning stuff.
I'm enamored. I call it a winner in my book!",08/06/15 07:55,FeelingRisky
Death and Decay Lush,"Death and decay is a lovely thick floral with an overall feeling of lily-of-the-valley, reminiscent of both Idylle and Diorissimo, but less dry and more juicy vegetal, perhaps due to the fact that this one contains some true essential oils (not all natural).
The name is weird and not nice, buut an SA explained the personal experience behind this name. Being lilies typically a funeral flower, one could be mislead, but if you step over this concept you will have a nice thick floral with a fresh edge and quite contemplative. As for many Lush perfumes the final effect and performance are different from mainstream. It smells more of a vegetal smell rather than a trendy smell.

Death and Decay Lush,"If you want a perfume smelling of a decaying corpse, gravedirt and slow decomposition, search elsewhere. This is not it. Death and Decay is a lovely, quiet, meditative, melancholy floral. In its mood I could compare it to Lutens's De Profundis, althought they are very different fumes. D&D features powdery florals, probably lilly, ylang-ylang, jasmine and rose. It does remind one of a funeral parlour with large bouquets and wreath of lillies and roses, but the flowers feel somehow muted and distant, as if looked at through tears. I would only wear this fragrance for myself on long autumnal walks, when one contemplates the impermanence of everything, remembers departed loved ones and looks forward to long, long winter evenings. Interesting and beautiful perfume!

Update (15/8) I bought a bottle of this perfume yesterday in the lovely little Gorilla Perfumes Shop in London, and I must slightly amend my review.
Probably I put very little on the smelling strip when I tried it at the launch, because it is not muted at all! It is a rather strong floral perfume, and a rather realistic one, too. It is strong and vivid, one drop is perfectly enough for the whole day. It lasts and lasts forever. I applied my drop at 2 pm, and now at 10 pm it still goes strong. The Death and Decay subject may be expressed by the fact that what I am experiencing is the fragrance of lilies at the precise point in time when they are just about to start wilting. They still look wonderful, but...you know that fragrance of flowers when they've reached their peak and start to slowly turn towards decay. This perfume captures just that moment.

Glinda Upland Lush,"Way back in November 2018, I was given a wonderful gift: the chance to create my own personalized perfume at the Tonatto Parfums boutique in Piazza di Pietra in Rome (which, as far as I know, sadly no longer exists). The resulting composition was so true to me! A powdery, resinous floral with a typical ""retro-cosmetic"" scent. It had notes of rose, Vanilla, lilac, mimosa, benzoin... One of the few perfumes I've used until the last drop. I unexpectedly found a very similar scent in this Lush body spray, Glinda, in collaboration with the film ""Wicked""! It has notes of rose, iris, vanilla, sesame, and benzoin, and has perhaps jumped to the top of my list of favorite Lush body sprays (in terms of strength, it certainly surpasses all the others in my experience!!!). I recommend a sniff to all lovers of these floral, sweet, powdery scents 🥰.",09/30/25 06:03,maelleinrome

Unfortunately, I never got to test it. So when she surprised me with it, I was literally beyond excited to open it and finally get to see what it smelt like.

This perfume is the only perfume I’ve ever had to give away. It is terrible. It’s a huge let down. It smells like it’s a Demeter fragrance titled “Talcum powder”. It’s nauseating. The notes and vibe are completely misleading. I don’t think anyone would think Glinda would smell like this. I will always keep it though as it reminds me of that co worker and how kind her gesture was.

Just like Turkish Delight candy: pink, sweet rose-jam scent with undertones of pistachio/almond and a dusting of powdered sugar. Not too powdery (I detest powdery scents).

Glinda Upland Lush,"One of my dearest friends gave me this perfume because she found it difficult to wear such a powdery fragrance.

At first I was wary of using it, but I have to admit that, despite not being a revolutionary fragrance, I have ended up developing a certain temporary addiction to this fairy dust.

It smells like a kind of sugary powder (a lot of sugar and a lot of dust) made with roses (as the main ingredient), violets, orris and vanilla.

On my skin it is a practically linear fragrance, although its start is a little more lively and it settles sweeter and powdery, flatter. It has an intense projection and lasts more than 12 hours on me.

I find it a romantic and naive fragrance, clean, relaxing, for use in cold seasons due to its sweet nuance, but only suitable for lovers of powdery perfumes and the rose note.

Glinda Upland Lush,"I like the comforting powdery rose scent that it leaves, nuttier than rose jam but I wish there were more pistachio and amber. The lush dna is strong in this one like you can TELL it's from Lush because it has that lingering lush smell that all their frags have, this is a shame because I find it a bit offputting since it reminds me of a period in my life where I wore a lot of Lush and it's a period I'd rather not go back to.

I don't think it's as basic as people say though, I've been looking for a decent rose scent because while there may be many out there, none of them are in my collection even though it's a favourite note of mine.

I respect them for not just recycling Snow Fairy and LOM for Wicked like I thought they would. I used to wear the LOM spray a lot and when sampling the Elphaba spray in store (which is not LOM but has similar notes) two seperate people said that it smells like me. I was a little offended because when I smelled it I thought it was rather strong and spicy, but they're not wrong because I do smell like an autumnal bonfire sometimes. I like both sprays, I think £40 is a lot to ask but they project and last forever.

I'm wondering which one to buy, do I do what everyone expects and buy something similar to what I already have or surprise everyone and get this Glinda spray which I prefer, is more agreeable, and is unlike what I own already. Also Wicked is better than you think it's going to be, went in with low expectations and left a convert.",12/17/24 16:23,spectravondergeist

sadly this smells like one of those canned hair color sprays that you’d get for your halloween costume, you know the really strong-smelling, cheap stuff that you’d have to go outside to use when you were a kid?

it gave me a headache!! i was sooo sad about it!!

the other bath products from the wicked collection are fantastic though - both the glinda and elphaba fragrances were a huge let down :(",12/16/24 17:23,glindathegood
Glinda Upland Lush,"This body spray isn't revolutionary by any means, nor is it awful—very middle of the road.

At first spray, it's straight roses. Very floral and heady, slightly powdery, like rose oil. A couple of hours into the wear I start to smell some sweetness with the rose which I feel like is the vanilla starting to emerge. After about four hours, I get a very slight nuttiness from the pistachio but not in any significant way.

This lasted for about 6 hours on me and the sillage was moderate. I was intrigued by the notes but overall underwhelmed. In my opinion, there could have been a stronger concentration of vanilla and pistachio because, otherwise, this is just a very standard rose scent.",12/06/24 13:18,banjeekundt
Glinda Upland Lush,"I'd agree with @kpop_stan, but it's not that negative to my nose. No rancid notes, but yeah, first something already seen before – rose – then a bit of Play-Doh. Not bad, just okay.",12/02/24 15:41,ZekaChi
Glinda Upland Lush,Kind of just smells like the lush store to me. Like a bunch of bath bombs mixed together. It's not unpleasant though,12/02/24 15:23,jadeorquartz
Glinda Upland Lush,"Goodness GRACIOUS this is rancid!!!! In the first couple of minutes it's pleasant and reminds me of something Lush has released in the past, but after 5 minutes or so it just started smelling like play doh. Lame.",12/02/24 12:12,kpop_stan
Glinda Upland Lush,"Soft, clean, comforting, sweet. I get the rose, the coumarin, the powdery violetty/heliotrope nuances. I don’t get anything nutty or salty. No vanilla. It reminds me of a very light Loukhoum (Keiko Mecheri) more than anything.
It’s sweet but cosmetic at the same time. It never becomes cloying and its gentleness makes it comforting. A rose powder smell with slight hints of musk. A touch of White Musk Libertine as well.
The perfect after bath body spray or before bedtime scent. Not bad at all. Might get a bottle before it runs out.",11/30/24 07:29,Mel_Nocturnum
Glinda Upland Lush,"This starts off as a slightly more powdery Rose Jam, then turns into a slightly more spicy version of Amelie Mae - a lipsticky rose. Really if you've got either of these, you wouldn't need to buy Glinda.",11/17/24 06:21,Tomockakillingbird
Glinda Upland Lush,"Smells like powdery marshmallows sitting on a bed of vanilla dusted rose petals.
Moderately sweet, soft & delicate.
Not a love, but I like it.",11/15/24 16:10,Whirly
Glinda Upland Lush,"Rose Oil, Palmarosa Oil, Sesame Seed Absolute , Vanilla Absolute, Almond oil, Orris, Benzoin, Coumarin

Citrusy rose with a hint of creamy sweetness. Imagine Rose Jam mixed with Creamy Candy and you have something like Glinda. I don’t think I’d have guessed that this has pistachio and sesame in the notes because the rose is pretty dominant but the almond here is creamy and sweet - it’s kinda similar to the way the Almond comes across in Space Girl. All this is to say that this is very identifiable as a Lush perfume. It’s a decent strength and has a decent longevity for a body spray (better on clothes!).

I struggle with the Rose note in Rose Jam, Amelie Mae and No Way To Say Goodbye but this is probably the most wearable Rose I’ve tried from Lush. I think that if you like Rose Jam you’re likely to be into this one, but you might also be safe with it if you like American Cream, Creamy Candy, Space Girl or even the Barbie perfume.",11/14/24 13:25,Skinscents4Fusspots
Glinda Upland Lush,I can't wait to try this!!! 🫧🫧🫧,11/04/24 20:03,Chaderic1986
Confetti Lush,"First, I'm a big Lush fan. Have been for decades.
But, when I first sprayed this on, I was ...confused. I smelled ..dandelions! I've NEVER smelled dandelion in a perfume before! ...within a couple minutes it was sharply green, dandelion weed..with a strange bittersweet something in the background. Not saying that they ACTUALLY used dandelion, but that was how it smelled on me. That faded after about 10 minutes.

Not violet at all, imo..I have many violet perfumes including a couple bottles of the very hard to find Belanciaga Paris...also, Kerbside Violet and V by Lush. I just don't smell violet in this.

It actually smelled like something was a bit off in the blend. The sharp greenness mixed with a bitter coffee in the opening,..the coffee doesn't blend well, it's better when it goes away ..it's like something didn't match up right.

Emma Dick is the perfumer and I want to ask Why, Emma ..why? Why bitter coffee? Why not white chocolate or a tea note or something less clashing? Ah, well. 🤷

SO-
The longer it was on, the more wearable it became. I smell a LOT of rose in the drydown. It IS quite original, I will say that.
Lush website advertises this as a wedding perfume and speaks of Jordan Almonds...no..I smelled no almond at all, which is too bad. Almond would've been better than bitter coffee.

It has very good projection and nice longevity. You won't smell it but everyone else will. And, in the drydown, I got compliments.

Again, the DRYDOWN is a BEAUTIFUL slightly green floral.. eventually. And that's the most important part, the part you live with.
But getting there ...well, it's a challenge. When I'm on the fence I let my guy decide and he gave a thumbs up.

I can't say this is a safe blind buy, though.",04/21/25 13:55,Magellan0101
Confetti Lush,"Fresh and green with violet being the star of this fragrance. Lots of pear right from the bottle and when sprayed, but the dry down on my skin has only a hint of pear. The longer this sits on the skin the more palatable it becomes, turning into a lighter powdery violent scent that is more ozonic on me, but doesn't have much projection. I don't smell any coffee or sandalwood so I'm not sure where that is coming from lol. If you like the Daddy-O shampoo from lush this is that with a sweeter more feminine twist. For some reason I also think that if you enjoy the 'Alina' fragrance from lush you would like this one as well.
To me its also very different than Lush's other violet fragrances, V and Kerbside Violet.",02/25/25 21:35,or4ngejuice
Confetti Lush,"Wearing this today. Pungent green, vegetal to begin with, then goes sweet, so I get the “sugared” but not the almonds at all. Almond is a very distinctive note. Do not get coffee or pear whatsoever. That said, what I do get is strange and quite beautiful. There’s a hay like note in the drydown. Do not get sandalwood either. Bit of a trickster this one.",07/16/24 12:26,ihughes123
Confetti Lush,"My nose isn’t so well tuned yet but I think I can smell coffee and almonds only on my skin. I smell fresh pear and roses covered in a dusty powder in the air and on my clothes. It lasts a long time on me. There is a very fresh and green quality as others state.
It wasn’t love at first or even tenth wear. I thought it was too feminine for me. I gave my sister a sample and loved it on her and so I tried a few more times and I love it now.
I did have a sample of lipstick rose for comparison. Lipstick Rose is smooth and refined and so incredibly well blended. LR is luxurious and elegant, the gold standard for vintage make up/lipstick perfumes imho.
In comparison, confetti is screechy and sharp, a little off. I personally know someone it is headache inducing for….but not me!… and I do prefer Confetti over other similars, I’m a Lushy and it just suits me much better and I feel more comfortable wearing it. It better suits me and my being. It does not smell like Rose Jam to me.
I'm fine without compliments and I’m even more ok if it keeps people away from me haha. But really, it does smell good and I love it so much more now that I’ve been wearing it a couple seasons.",06/22/24 04:42,SmellYaLaterHater
Confetti Lush,"I was so excited to get my bargain bottle on eBay, & so wanted to love it!

Sadly, & disappointingly, to & on me, this is a very expensive (if at full price!) Devil's Nightcap with a woody Rose Jam dry down. Nothing else.

Also gave me such a headache, that I know it's not worth giving it another try to see whether or not I get anything different.

Will be re-selling this one! 😷🤕",06/10/24 07:12,FallenLeaf
Confetti Lush,"Can’t explain why but I absolutely adore this perfum, the opening is quit strong and kinda tickles but it settles in a relaxing and comforting smell, definitely rosy and powdery but with a touch of papier d’Arménie, which makes me love it more then lipstick rose for this very reason. I look forward to wearing my clothes that still have the smell left on it <3
only critic is that my skin doesn’t keep the smell that much ;( but that might be just my skin lol",05/30/24 14:46,Selunaee

I really wanted to like this, but Its just sooo sharp and overwhelming.",10/18/23 13:07,G0D'Sdaughter

Confetti Lush,"I don't know what notes are on here because the one I smelled at the store smells like jasmine.
For whatever reason they copied pasted the same exact smell in their ""Ginger"" perfume only made it more masculine with undertones of tobacco and banana peel. They didn't have a tester for Ginger for 3 months and the sales rep kept saying that the scent is clear from the bottle. It turned out as masculine as Boss No 1 even though it was marketed as Unisex. Well, anyways, you live & you learn.",06/28/23 01:28,rednose
Confetti Lush,"This is very much lush’s take on lipstick rose. The rawness of lush doesnt go well with it. What makes lipstick rose good is the perfect nuanced roundness of it. Theres something a little screechy, a little green, a little sour about this. If you like this and havent already, try lipstick rose.",04/29/23 02:58,neome
Confetti Lush,"This hits you with sweet prickly pear and vanilla and then dries down into a sweet woody scent. The pear stays but it turns more into a candy-sweet smell. It's beautiful.

I've had this perfume for a while now. I only wear it for days I want to smell very sweet because the sillage is intense.

I will say that while I was in Rome, Italy, I smelt this smell everywhere in natural areas. So now it pleasantly reminds me of Italy :)",04/29/23 02:36,Violetbop
Confetti Lush,I blind bought a FB on ebay a while ago. I was just curious about the notes and the price was just fine. Quite interesting. To me it smells like suguered almonds + violet with a sniff of coffee. This is the only perfume with coffee as a note that I own. I like the smell of coffee but I don't want to smell like it. So far the coffee note in that one is light enough that it is easily wearable.,04/16/23 09:03,annema
Confetti Lush,Opens with a big hit of sandalwood then gives off huge dark mossy vibes which remind me greatly of Devil's Night Cap (is that the coffee?) Eventually the scent takes a big 180 and becomes quite sweet and fresh leaving you with a rosy musky drydown.,04/16/23 05:49,MsKayJae
Confetti Lush,"It smells like jasmine green tea, talc and soap.
In fact it smells like Luxe's Camelia Aloe soap.",03/13/23 09:36,rednose
Confetti Lush,Gorgeous complex candied violet. Now discontinued. Get a bottle while you still can!,03/04/23 20:02,Oriental_Dream
Confetti Lush,"Okay, so I liked this, but it smells IDENTICAL to a Mid East oil I got on my honeymoon in Dubai all those years ago...
I ended up getting 6 then, and in many ways, that trip kickstarted this obsession-hobby, so for me, this was a bit of a throwback, of sorts...
The coffee note burns off quickly, or, it's overtaken and held in check early. The rose-pear accord is inSANE, it's cloyingly sweet, and if I'm being honest with myself, possibly a little too sweet.
The violet leaf note is minor, but sorta holds the sweetness and bitterness together...
I like this, but I already have something reaaally similar to this already...!",02/03/23 18:37,muzzbait
Confetti Lush,"Initial spray smells like coffee liqueur (kahlua) and not exactly coffee (there’s a difference I swear) because this is sweeter and greener, it kinda smells like coffee and green tea mixed together. On the dry down it’s all just the soft and powdery violets. I don’t know where the rose and pear are I can’t smell them very much but this is a genius fragrance because I’ve never encountered this before where the initial spray smells nothing like the dry down",01/13/23 08:08,wqqqr_anne
Confetti Lush,"On my skin (which is clearly different to many other peoples experience of this scent!) Confetti is fresh violets plus leaves, Parma Violet sweets, bright and fresh with a hint of bitter black coffee. It stays like that for an hour or so before it starts to change and a sugared almond scent peeks through and mixes with the violet. the deep deep dry down is dragée, but not cloyingly sweet.

Love it, it's beautiful! Goes perfectly with my hair after I use Lush Daddy-O shampoo and Candy Rain Conditioner.

If it helps give you an idea of what to expect, I feel like this smells like an old-school British sweet shop that sells Parma violets, violet & rose creams, coffee creams, fudge and sugared almonds. It's a very different vibe to some modern sweet shops filled with herscheys, twinkies, sweet tarts and caramels, which is much more of a Aquolina Pink Sugar scent!",10/21/22 08:37,Skinscents4Fusspots
Confetti Lush,"This perfume made me realize I'm not the biggest fan of ""green floral"" scents. They don't mix well with my natural chemistry and are too sharp for my nose. However, the scent itself is nice (I'm a floral whore) and lasts a good amount of time (8 hr+). With that said, I definitely don't get the ""almond"" vibe Lush was trying to make this out to be.",07/07/22 20:30,nanaa_from_ghana
Confetti Lush,"Confetti is a quietly impressive fragrance if you're able to distinguish the scent from the name and marketing. I think the coffee and sandalwood create the impression of nuttiness, and the pear, though not a particularly detectable note on its own, gives it a hint of sweetness. I can see how sweet nuttiness evokes the feel of candied almonds, but this is in no way a literal representation of what's going on in Confetti. Instead, it's a green floral with a hint of something roasted and nutty, dusted with sugar. I find it earthy and calming. It's not evocative of weddings, and it's too serene to be particularly celebratory, but it's very nice.",06/07/22 17:52,GenevaX
Confetti Lush,"I really wanted to like Confetti and the early stage was really promising. But the drydown comes rather quickly, is really boring and lasts forever. Something generic in the base, which doesn't match the notes list. In my experience this is common to the few Lush perfumes (liquids, not solids) that I have tried, there is a forever lingering incense-like close to skin smell in the drydown.

I do not detect roses, nor violets when applied on skin. What a shame!

I bought Confetti when it was on sale and I think it is not worth the money on normal price. Luckily there is many other alternatives to choose from and I am not stuck with Lush products :-)",01/27/22 07:19,ShechireCat
Confetti Lush,"Soooo delicious when I sniffed it at the store. I was put off by the name “confetti” because I thought the smell would be like sugar sprinkles and cotton candy..i don’t know why i thought that. This has an ancient, earthly vibe with dark Turkish roses sitting like a jewel inside incense, woods, spices, and florals rounding it out. It smelled insanely delicious and of all the available perfumes, this was one of the hardest to stop sniffing, and I smelled like 7 of them. I didn’t buy this at the store cause they didn’t have solid perfumes and I already bought lust and pansy and dirt and didn’t want to overspend, but I really should have cause they don’t sell it in lush USA..only in lush U.K and its a large expensive bottle there only : (.",11/08/21 17:32,DahliaFragrance
Confetti Lush,"Lush has unique, impressive violet scents like 'Kerbside Violet' and 'Fantabulosa' in their roster. How does 'Confetti' fare? Not very well.
This is named incorrectly. I agree with SailorV, there are no candied almonds or anything remotely nutty in here. I also +1 'Iris Dragees' & as a cheapie Zara 'MSK/NTL' as true candied almonds / confetti.

You know what this is closest to? Insolence EDP by Guerlain, but heavier and with rose oil. Beginning is a blast of thick fermented roses with powdery sweet violets. There is an extremely bitter coffee facet that fades away after an hour. It's not coffee, but the bitterness of it, similar to what you get in Lush's 'Cardamom Coffee'. I get nothing fruity, Pears who?
SailorV is also spot on with the 90s lipstick vibe because guess what... This smells identical to Lancôme and L'Oréal's signature lipstick scent. Just much heavier. The violets get sweeter, thicker and powdery as it dries down, otherwise quite linear.
This is not ''cool and damp'' but rather thick, fermented and heady.

Projection is average, but longevity is great. This is on the heavier side of Lush's perfume portfolio and becomes extremely pungent in warm environments.
For comparison: Fantabulosa is also a violet perfume but is much airier and youthful.

I am sorry to say but, this is such an unimpressive scent with no edge to it. Is it 'Lush'y? No. Is it niche worthy quality? No. Is it worth wearing as a natural fragrance? That's your call.
After experiencing Fantabulosa, Superworld Unknown, Breath of God...Confetti is your run of the mill heavy makeup powder / lipstick fragrance. Not worth the price tag.",11/04/21 13:21,Palmer Eldritch
Confetti Lush,"This was named Confetti because it reminded some people at Lush of the candied almonds served at weddings. And I don't understand that at all. It's a violet scent to me, no almonds in sight. If you want candied almonds, try Reminiscence Dragee instead.
That doesn't mean Confetti is bad, just misnamed. It opens with a spicy green blast of violet leaves and flowers. For a moment I can sense the pear and coffee note, but they move far into the background really quick. If you test this at the Lush store with a mask on they're easy to miss, at least this is how it was for me the first two times I tried it. The violet is intense though. It's sweet, dewy and slightly spiced. Now that I think about it, the scent is quite close to a violet dragee instead of an almond one. But blended with the rose it also reminds me of glossy 90s and 2000s lipsticks. The ozonic green leaves are noticeable, too, so several facets of violets are present in this perfume. In the drydown the scent finally turns more powdery with the sandalwood warming it up.
I wish the other notes were a little more present next to the violet, but that's just my personal taste. This is a nice sweet floral and quite strong, easily projecting through a leather jacket with one spray. Contrary to some other perfumes by this brand it doesn't smell like the Lush store or like bath bombs and doesn't have a homemade vibe, so it could work even for people who aren't big fans of Lush.",10/29/21 16:43,SailorV
Confetti Lush,"This perfume is pure sugar and I love it! Depending on the situation, the opening is either very green or very reminiscent of Hale's Blue Boy syrup which is a great nostalgic blast of one of my favorite sugary drinks growing up. It's cream soda, a little almond, a little caramel and very, very yummy. I don't find it over bearing but I have yet to try it on a very warm day. It dries down to a very flattering sweet sandalwood scent. It's probably not for every day but I think it smells great and gives me joy whenever I smell it.",10/11/21 03:21,janevee
Confetti Lush,"I know that this perfume is named after candied almonds that people find at weddings, to my nose this comes across as ozonic-salty smelling. This is shocking to me because I would expect something that is gourmand, sweet and crunchy. I kept smelling my wrist to deconstruct the smell in my head and I realize that this effect is what violet brings to the composition.

I do smell coffee, but it is not as strong as the coffee in Cardamom & Coffee. I can detect rose and sandalwood as well. But somehow, the sandalwood in it does not bring the creamy effect that I normally find in sandalwood based fragrance. It stays dry and sharp to my nose. Thankfully, I cannot trace any pear scent, which I detest.

All and all, this is an intriguing smell and it rough around the edges.",09/20/21 06:59,foreverine
Confetti Lush,"I love violet perfumes and I really dislikes most rose perfumes. This perfume has both violet and rose and I wanted to try it anyway because of the violet. I wish I hadn't bought it, I couldn't go to a Lush store so I just bought it.
At first all I can smell is rose and something weird, something old. After a while the rose smell is gone, only the weird smell is left and a headache.",08/01/21 04:13,Allinug
Confetti Lush,"Tested today. Initial spray it’s mostly rose & violet. I can smell the fresh green violet tho’ only for a few minutes. After 10 mins it’s a sweet sort of gourmandy rose mostly, the violet is gone. It reminded me strongly of TF Cafe Rose. That puzzled me - but I was unaware of a coffee note in this until I came here to write this review....So that explained that anyway! I can’t detect distinct almond here at any stage. I expected pink & lilac tinted sugared almonds, but maybe Italian Confetti is different to the sugared almonds we have in the UK?
Unfortunately, after about an hour this turns absolutely rank on my skin, very sour, dusty & quite unpleasant. I think it’s the rose combined with synthetic woody base? On the paper strip it still smells Ok - & still reminds me of Cafe Rose. I just don’t think this suits my chemistry at all - it smells just plain bad in the dry down...oh well. As ever, just my experience,ymmv.",07/24/21 09:05,indigo
Confetti Lush,"Confetti is a potpourri made of roses and violets with something bitter green. And a portion of confectioners' sugar. It has a very distinct vintage makeup note. That particular pressed powder smell. Personally I like that, but I can see how it can appear ""stale"" or like mothballs to someone else.

I have two lovely body powders from LUSH that I use sparingly: Ginger and Silky Underwear. Confetti smells like a combination of those.

Almonds are listed among the notes, and I have a weakness for marzipan (both in perfumery and food) but to be honest I can't smell almonds distinctly. There is a nice, almost nutty sweetness to Confetti, but not necessarily almonds.

There is nothing remotely ozonic or aquatic in this, to my nose, which I'm grateful for. (ozonic smells make me queasy)

No distinct coffee note either.

Overall this is a nice, bitter-sweet, powdery fragrance with an unusual green twist, and different layers that add to its complexity. Fun name too!",07/17/21 13:00,sistermoon
Confetti Lush,"Powdery fresh aquatic roses, sugar dusted with a dash of almond. The almond notes make the sugar not too sugary ror cloying, just nice and pleasant.

Confetti Lush,"Rose, violet and sugared almonds. What it claims to be basically. Green to start with with vioet leaf I like the opening a lot but it dries as a sugary sweet rose. Not my favourite, a bit sweet for my tastes but pleasant enough on the odd occasion. Not a daily perfume for me.",06/14/21 10:31,penguinrabbit
Confetti Lush,"To me this smells familiar. Im thinking Turkish delight. Rosey and sweet, but also green, but also dry, like dried rose petals... A ""pot pourri"" or ""drawer liner"" accord. Blends well with lush ginger for some base. I think those two scents together have a life of their own. Very strong. Female scent typically, but my mouth would probably water if I smelt it on a guy. 😉",05/23/21 18:42,Evenfragrance
Confetti Lush,"I bought this impulsively in the store because I was so taken aback by this scent! My senses are confused, in the best way.

This fragrance has an entire storyline, a beginning/middle/and end! Just like Lush’s older fragrances (The smell of weather turning, etc.)

It opens with a WARM, woody, cinnamon-y chocolate coffee note. The dry down happens so softly, before you know it this delicate and powdery doll-head violet is present, mixed with rose and damp earth. If you know Lush’s violets, you know they are DEWY. humid.

It’s a thrill of a scent. ADDICTIVE! It’s ~simultaneously~ always two sides of each coin and I just can’t figure out how. Unisex, yet both “delicate” and “robust”. Woody, and dry- yet sweet and full of humidity. Vague and comforting yet definitely not a people pleaser. Every single element is tangible at all times - ITS A PUZZLE TO ME ENTIRELY.

Definitely spray it ON skin when you’re in the mall next! Walk around!",05/05/21 19:05,Bloodlust
Confetti Lush,"This really does smell like pure roses, violets and sugar. Really delightful girly scent. Totally sugared almonds plus violets. I smell no coffee or pear. I do smell a base of sandalwood which gives a perfect balance but does not overpower the scent.❤️",05/05/21 00:17,candyfluff
Confetti Lush,"It is interesting as it says ""Amber Floral"" - where is Amber in the notes?

In the article fragrantica says it is Floral Chypre: where is oakmoss, labdanum and bergamot? Or at least patchouli + vetiver?",05/05/21 00:00,tandem_4x4
Confetti Lush,"I had high hopes for this scent, because Ouch110 spoke highly about this one (and I love coffee and almonds, so I thought it must be lovely...)

Well thank goodness I tested it - everyone's nose is different - and what a let-down this was for me, personally...

From the first moment on, to me it smells like grass and hay - not dry but moist and balmy, and yet powdery at the same time, like smelling green bananas mixed with fresh cut grass (is this the scent of violet leaf??). It's very unpleasant for me.

It definitely made me think that I am smelling iris/orris. I'm surprised that wasn't featured in the notes.

No coffee, no almonds. But then again, it was so unpleasant I didn't want to keep smelling it so I scrubbed it off after half an hour or so.

Not recommended for people who aren't into green powdery scents.",04/18/21 00:57,JustSimpleThings
Confetti Lush,"Dewy and super green in the opening, but the opening only lasts a few seconds. It quickly dries down to green violets and rose with a slight undertone of coffee. It certainly has a quality reminiscent of sugared almonds, but I think it smells closer to Rockets candies. The rose comes off as a bit jammy, which reminds me of a more sophisticated version of Rose Jam. This is like an airier, greener Montale Intense Cafe with violets. Very pretty! New favourite spring scent for morning or casual occasions.

Notes according to my nose (in order of prominence): ionone and green violets, jammy rose, coffee bean",04/17/21 18:46,Enigmatic
Confetti Lush,"I was looking for a perfume with rose and violet leaf combination. I tried La Douceur De Siam Dusita sample but it left me disappointed when it lasted a whole two hours on me for such an expensive perfume. So, I was hanging out in a Lush store trying out perfumes since I have a gift card and the SA pointed out Confetti saying that this is limited edition. I don't like coffee note so was a bit hesitant. Thank god, I can't smell the coffee note but the first blast was a refreshing rose scent, sweetened by the pear. The dry down is the best part, a matcha tea and almond combination. Weird, right, at least on my skin, that's what I get. The scent last 6 hours and I get whiffs of rose throughout. This is a winner in my books.",03/23/21 13:16,panda-inc

Confetti Lush,"Some of my favorite Lush scents are violet (Tuca Tuca and Bathos), so I was excited for a new violet offering. The main note I get is sour, talc-y rose. Very vintage smelling. The violet is green and fresh, and faintly reminds me of Bathos. Confetti smells better further away, wafting off of me instead of having my nose directly pressed to it.
I think you need to like vintage florals to fully enjoy this one.",02/16/21 09:48,pickynikki
Confetti Lush,"Lord, what a shame!!! I absolutely love the opening, it smells exactly like violet sweets over a sort of foresty base. But after a few minutes it is 100% cloves on my skin, which happens to be one of my least favorite fragrance notes. I even compared it to dried cloves in my kitchen and it's exactly the same smell. I don't know if it's like this to everyone or if Confetti and I just don't have chemistry. Scrubbed either way.",02/12/21 01:55,Kaleidosaur
Confetti Lush,"The first blast is slightly odd, but within a few minutes it settles into a lush (!) creamy, rose/violet sweetness. Yes it's definitely reminscent of sugared almonds, but there's a waxy/creaminess that keeps it from being 100% gourmand. A good thing, to my nose, since I like gourmands to smell like perfume - not an exact copy of foody scent. I wouldn't have thought of coffee unless I knew it was there, but it adds a roundness and edge which is nice.

This also reminds me of Lipsalve, one they don't make any more, I find it soothing and very pleasant, and though I don't usually go for sweet perfumes, this is lovely. The drydown has something like a woody labdanum that's quite earthy. Remind sme of Miller Harris perfumes.

I think it would suit anyone who enjoys a flirty feminine perfume that's high quality.

Sillage is noticable, longevity very good.",01/13/21 08:48,woodlandwalk

Confetti Lush,"This is so good! Green and sweet at the same time! I smell violet leaf, a little touch of rose, and a honeyed, powdery base. It seems to me like a greener version of Loukhoum Eau poudree (Keiko Mecheri), that I absolutely love, more than the original version, and I'm wearing often in these days. I can't smell sandalwood, pear or coffee at all.",01/08/21 04:23,maelleinrome
Confetti Lush,"I purchased a bottle of this in the Edinburgh Spa store, just after i had a 'Renaissance' treatment downstairs in the spa. (Which was completely magical!)

Confetti reminded me of Charity Pot body lotion, but with lashings of violet and coffee notes. One of those scents that you sniff and keep coming back for more!",04/12/20 12:41,VintageViolet_
Confetti Lush,"Wow this is an unusual one for sure. It's one of my two favourites from the Florence exclusive perfumes from Lush.

It's an unusual powdery green, lots of violet leaf with coffee. A weird mix that works! I sometimes feel a fleeting whoosh of pear/banana when it's first sprayed to so, this one is all over the place in it's olfactory group. It feels planty and stemmy and dusted with violet powder. The coffee is a great surprise considering I would never think that a roasted brown feeling note would work with a green composition. It's a winner!!

:)",12/18/19 06:31,Ouch!
Confetti Lush,"What a gorgeous scent that is brilliantly blended with two seemingly contrasting notes, i.e. violet and coffee. The final composition is rich and sensual. The lipsticky/leathery violet and the gourmandy coffee are married to create a surreal floral that is beyond this world.

A must try.",12/12/19 11:02,JoeMacchiato
Elphaba Thropp Lush,This smells like a broom i only bought it because i have the glinda one and i wanted the set i did test wear this its not that bad just dislike it alot,10/05/25 10:32,Arianagrandestan
Elphaba Thropp Lush,I am sure there are inconsistencies in the making of this spray. For me it smells primarily of black pepper then a woodsy smell. I bought it in the sale but would buy again if it smelt the same. I spray in on my body and clothes and when I go back into the same room 24 hours later I can still smell it. Very similar to Lord of Misrule perfume in its vibe but with much longer longevity. I do mix it with the Glinda spray and I wonder if that makes it last longer. I definitely wouldn’t wear it to work as I think others would find it overpowering.,10/05/25 04:47,Car1971
Elphaba Thropp Lush,"JuliaToothFairy is spot on - it's impossible to rate this using the notes above because they're entirely incorrect !

On spraying I immediately got a blast of citronella which ironically I didn't get when I tried it in store, so I'm guessing those top notes are rather volatile and already softened as it had been open awhile.
Fortunately they evaporate and soften quite quickly and instead you do get a lemony tea note with something a little spicy which is reminiscence of one of that originals: Ginger ( I actually used to distribute the products for Cosmetics to Go which was a forerunner to Lush and this was available back then ). It's only after quite some time to the woody notes come through which does improve it quite a lot. I would find it completely unwearable otherwise, as I'm really not fond of bug spray ( I also get bug spray from Jicky, so maybe I'm just weird !!). In fact , it was the dry down that made me purchase this, because a couple hours later it was actually smelling really nice, as I walked around.

I do think they missed a trick though. I really hoped the green theme would have inspired something , well, green and we'd have something akin to maybe Guardian of the Forest or Grass or even better Tramp ( but that perhaps would be hoping for too much !) Also whatever you do don't go on the scent of the shower gel because it's entirely different. I bought a small bottle and it's some sweet, sickly, boiled sweet* scent. Unless that's your thing, obviously ! ( *hard candy )

I'm afraid these days I'm frequently disappointed with Lush and so rarely bother. I would say 80% of what they produce as either largely unwearable ( a few random essential oils thrown together, unblended, totally discordant and not suitable as a fragrance ) or just playing to popular tastes and could be found cheaper elsewhere ( something sweet with notes of marshmallow, chocolate and vanilla ) . Which is a shame because when they did occasionally get it right, they got it really right. It's just hard to believe this is the same company that produced things like Kerbside Violet; The Devil's Nightcap, Tramp, and Lord of Misrule. *Sigh*",08/15/25 04:34,Scent_Insensibility
Elphaba Thropp Lush,"Elphaba Thropp, the body spray, by Lush, smells like grated ginger and lemon.

Elphaba Thropp Lush,"There are not a lot of perfumes that would straight up disgust me, but this is one of them.

Stupidly blind bought and sold it the next day. First of all, the price is ridiculous. Lush started doing all that FOMO thing and making all limited edition stuff even more expensive - I hate it. Anyway, back to the topic - to sum up, this spray smells like holidays in a dumpster.

Celery, distinctive aroma of raw meat and dirt mixed with mold. It's gross. I can't believe someone thought it'll be a good idea to make a dumpster scent, especially Lush. Weird interperation of what Elphaba smells like!",03/03/25 03:36,CrescentWitch
Elphaba Thropp Lush,"Shoutout to everyone who doesn’t like this fragrance because it leaves more for those of us who can appreciate this gem. This is my first Lush Body Spray (it took my nose a while to adjust to Lush’s dna) and I am thrilled. So much in fact, I may have to buy a backup before this collab has run its course.

This is the most perfect simple, woody vanilla. If you’re a fan of Eau Duelle, Commodity Gold, or any non-gourmand vanillas, this is for you. This is simple without being boring, yet, is unique and many people won’t be smelling like it. There’s also a natural quality about this that I love, especially as most body sprays tend to smell synthetic (which makes sense given the ingredients).

Three words: grounded, assured and woody.


EDIT 1: after wearing for a few days consistently after I purchased it, this is a bit more herbal and aromatic than I initially thought. It smells like lemongrass and vanilla. Still just as good, but definitely vibrant. Could easily be worn in warmer weather as well.",02/24/25 01:54,KKDYLM

Elphaba Thropp Lush,"i love this scent!! i typically go for more gourmand fragrances so the glinda body spray was more my speed. luckily, i picked up samples of both because my lush didn’t have them in store yet and i live too far to try them once they did. i like to layer this with the glinda body spray as lush suggests and it’s heavenly. the perfect amount of vanilla and sweetness, but also not too sweet that it’s sickening. this is nice for when i want a sweet perfume without possibly making myself nauseous in my own scent bubble 😅 it also lasts forever ! i put this on christmas morning when i got it, and woke up after sleeping and still smell it without having to hold my wrist up to my nose. 10/10 lush! just wish the price wasn’t so high. $100 for two 200ml body sprays is pretty steep especially when they recommend you get both. but also lush’s body sprays are beastmode, they’re way stronger than any typical body spray, closer to an EDT than anything.",12/25/24 23:23,angiesides

Elphaba Thropp Lush,"This is an interesting and welcome departure from the usual gourmand and floral body mists.

At first spray, it's peppery and piney—very green and like Pine Sol with an edge. The spice and cedar go well together. After about an hour, the coniferous tinge fades and leaves you with a bit of the pink pepper but a mostly, generally woodsy scent.

After about three hours, the vanilla starts to come out and mixes with what's left of the pepper to make a lovely sweet and soft, warm spicy accord. For the remainder of the wear, it's sweet woods from the vanilla and cedar.

Overall, this is a decent body mist and I enjoyed it more than the Glinda Upland spray. The longevity is good too, lasting on me for about 8 hours.",12/06/24 13:42,banjeekundt

HELP LMAO",12/05/24 10:03,ArlissLux
Elphaba Thropp Lush,"Lol. Had to create an account to share my thoughts on this ""perfume"". Have you ever seasoned a piece of meat with lemon pepper seasoning and thought, ""Hmm, I want this on my body."" Then look no further! Lush was able to craft a perfume that truly encapsulates lemon pepper seasoning with the dry down of pinesol! I asked my grandma to smell me and now she is in the hospital, doctors told me to wait outside because I smell like a biohazard. Not for me, not for my grandma, not for anyone with a nose.

The opening is just pepper and takes a while to dry down into something more tolerable. If you can manage to get through the opening, you will smell a fresh spicy lemon lime scent. Still not good, still not getting vanilla at all. This was not worth the price and most definitely not worth the headache. Plus side is that has longevity, but is that really a plus when you smell like a meat seasoning?

I don't recommend this to anyone, not even as a room spray either. If you love it, I love that for you! But it aint for me.",11/27/24 08:21,chuckles_lol

Gets a bit sweeter on the dry down when the Vanilla shines through.
This is nice.",11/15/24 16:52,Whirly
Elphaba Thropp Lush,"A fuller set of notes - Hiba Wood Oil, Cedarwood Absolute, Vanilla Absolute, Sicilian Lemon Oil, Pink Pepper Oil, Cardamom Absolute, Coumarin, Oakmoss Extract.

This starts off like a citrussy forest and ends up in a candy store lined with Cedarwood. It goes through a pink pepper stage too but the deep dry down is very candy sweet - that classic Lush combination of Vanilla and Coumarin that you get in American cream... that kind of vibe, so it's sweet but it's not a just vanilla. If you're into Lord of Misrule then this one is quite a different feel imho.

It's really quite magical when it dries down but it's honestly a bit challenging in the beginning so it needs time! I tested it in store and didn't buy it but but then I got on the tube and kept getting whiffs of this beauty so I'll probably have to go back and pick a bottle up! I suspect the scent trail from this one is amazing because the scent bubble around me was so comforting. I found the scent I caught in the air to be nicer than when I put my nose to my skin, but towards the end of the night my skin smelt like what I could smell around me.

A bit pricy for a body spray but it's 200ml and it's a similar strength to a lot of modern edt's so I think it's worth it. This lasts for ages and gets increasingly sweet, so it could become sickly to some people. Guardian of the Forest would be a better choice for anyone who doesn’t enjoy very sweet perfumes and Lord of Misrule would be better, if you're after a less candy-like green vanilla!.

I can see the similarity to Eilish 3 but I find this one more creamy and a little bit less like a Christmas tree. It's got the wood and leaves from a forest but not too many pine needles! Just to also mention - Bare from And Fragrances (by ex-lush perfumer Simon Constantine) also has crossovers with Eilish 3 and Elphaba, but I think the fact that Elphaba is less piney than both makes it easier to wear!",11/11/24 10:46,Skinscents4Fusspots

This is horrible. I’m trying my hardest to empty this as I hate waste, but it’s so hard. The smell fills the whole room, even after hours and hours of reapplying it, my skin strongly still smells of it.

I don’t think it’s quite as creamy as the hair primer but overall pretty darn close. I wish they’d bring the perfume back too a that they would keep this one around.

Sipping bergamot tea under a lemon tree in a glasshouse, while having a cake with marshmallow-y frosting on the side.

Super Milk Lush,"This is a review for the glitter spray version. Long winded so bear with me.

Okay. When the Super Milk hair primer first came out I got a free sample from Lush. I wasn't impressed with the formula or the fragrance. It smelled like very burnt French toast with some maple syrup. Would've been good without the burnt aspect. I then wrote off this fragrance as ""meh.""

Flash forward to April 2025. I saw they had the glitter sprays on display at the register when checking out. Out of curiosity, I sprayed it on my arm right before leaving. The initial smell was a sharp lemon / licorice. Again, I wrote it off as ""meh."" Very surprised by the hype surrounding this fragrance. Then, probably 10 minutes into my drive home, I started to smell something very nice. I smelled my arm, and it was the glitter spray! As the day went on and it dried down further, I liked it even more. I decided that I would purchase it and give it a try.

I ordered a bottle for myself late August. Once it arrived, I sprayed it, and OMG! It was so synthetic! It had a sort of metallic licorice smell the entire duration of it sitting on my arm! Ended up scrubbing it off after an hour. I was BEYOND disappointed. Lush is known to have pretty hit or miss fragrances with different batches, so I figured I got a bad bottle. I tossed it in my gym bag and forgot about it.

Last week I was cleaning out my gym bag and stumbled upon this confusing spray. Again, I decided to give it a try now that it has been opened for over a month. And it was even BETTER than the sample spray at the store in April! This perfume has given me so much whiplash, but now that it has finally settled, this is simply incredible.

With all of that being said, here are my final thoughts : Great longevity for a body spray, lasts 5 hours. The dry down is very reminiscent of the Josie Maran Vanilla Vibez body butter, they smell almost identical to me. There is a slightly sharp lemon-y opening that smells VERY MUCH like Avocado Co-Wash from Lush, but without the throat tickling incense note. The dry down is more of a creamy, lactonic, COLD vanilla... like vanilla ice cream rather than a vanilla cake. But still much more appropriate for fall / winter than spring / summer. It may take some trial and error to find the version that you prefer, but I definitely recommend the glitter spray above all else. I also think this is great for people who tend to get tired of gourmands quickly. It's delicious, edible, and sweet, but not in a way that is too cloying or overly food-ish. Great value, great longevity, and an overall delicious fragrance!",09/30/25 12:58,maddie2503
Super Milk Lush,"Just smells like marshmallows with a touch of lemon. I didn't expect to like this, as I found Avocado Co-Wash too intense for me (I assumed they would be similar), and I wasn't loving it that much for the first ten minutes, but it becomes more pleasant to my nose as it dries down. I've never tried any other Super Milk products, so I'm not comparing to the rest of the line. Might have to go back for this one.

Update: I ended up buying a bottle, and alas, it was too artificial on me and I had to return it. May be a batch difference, as I did a skin test the first time I tried in store and didn't have this problem.",09/27/25 17:12,niepokoya

Super Milk Lush,"It seems like the batches vary a lot on this one, but the one I got was first a much more synthetic-smelling lemon candy (compared to the more fresh lemon of the hair primer), and then went straight through to a very strong burnt sugar biscuit scent, which remained for hours. It smelled like graham crackers a little, but sharper. It smelled good in the room I had sprayed it in, but to wear on me as a perfume it was too overwhelming, like a lot of Lush perfumes are.",09/14/25 02:44,Sidhe
Super Milk Lush,"It starts with intense citrus, it takes a moment to really feel the almond and vanilla. When the citrus dissipates it becomes sweet and comforting, pleasant, but then the almond is a bit play-dough. I thought it was good in the first 30mins or so of wearing it, but it became too much, too artificial, and a bit cheap imo. Its not terrible but there are better sweet vanillas out there.",09/05/25 15:37,just28
Super Milk Lush,"I really don’t like this. On me it’s just way too heavy on the citrus. I was expecting something softer and creamier but it just doesn’t work for me at all.

Super Milk Lush,"i'm not a gourmand lover but i love the hair primer. especially with how many different whiffs of it i get throughout a day - lemon, coconut, cinnamon, almond, milk, the sweetness of a biscuit... it's all over the place in a good way. this body spray is much more linear, it is a straightforward vanilla lemon. the first spray of it is overwhelming, like melted lemon candy, but once it sits for like 10 mins it's great. still a pretty sharp lemon scent, but i love citrus so i'm fine with it. smells so good layered with Karma.",09/04/25 14:01,psychiccat
Super Milk Lush,"In the opening, it is very similar to the primer, but as it dries down, all I get is vanilla and almond. It's a very smooth vanilla, very creamy like nut milks, but to my nose, it's lacking some citrus and the warmth and spice of the primer on the drydown. It's quite reminiscent of BBW's Vanilla Bean Noel on the skin, almost plasticky, artificial, but if you can get past that, it's really quite delightful. It's very strong on the intial spritz but dries down to sit closer to the skin, to within an arms-length.

I paired this with Avocado Co-Wash to replace that lemon note I love so much, and my younger students walked into my classroom exclaming ""why do I smell cookies!!!"" -- And my coworkers pass by me saying I smell sweet like candy. If that's any indication to what this smells like, I hope it helps. To me, it just smells creamy and not too warm or heavy, creamy like the hair primer consistency hehe.",09/01/25 19:02,briiami
Super Milk Lush,"(This is a review for the glitter mist spray, not the regular body mist spray! Read the last paragraph if you’re debating which version to get ) In my opinion the glitter mist spray is way closer to the original hair primer scent than the body mist spray. I first tried the super milk hair primer spray and absolutely fell in love with it. It smells like a warm, comforting, lemon sugar cookie. I’ve always loved gourmands but disliked citrus scents very much, so this took me aback with how much I adored it from the first time wearing it. I remember the first time I bought super milk, I sprayed it in my hair immediately after leaving the store. And while I was walking around the mall, I had 3 people come up to me and ask me what fragrance I was wearing because it smelled “heavenly.” One of the people who asked me literally ran up to me, they were sniffing me down around the mall and rushing to find me before I left so I could tell them what I had on. With all lush scents, it’s very strong and long lasting. I truly don’t mind paying around the $45 price point for lush body mists because they last longer than some perfume I have that cost $200.

If you are thinking about which version of super milk body mist to buy, I’d say go for the glitter. The glitter smells closest to the original, most people say the standard body mist smells way too lemony and not enough gourmand, and that you can’t smell any of the coconut milk at all. I saw someone describe it as “windex with a sugar cookie smell” lol. Not to mention, the glitter mist is more bang for your buck as well. In the USA, the glitter mist is $26 for 8.4 fl oz, and the regular mist is $45 for 6.4 fl oz. Also I personally love the glitter aspect and packaging, I don’t care at all about packaging, but glitter mist packaging is “less ugly” than standard lush packaging. Overall, glitter mist wins in every category!",08/30/25 07:48,maryramone

Super Milk Lush,"Like many others, I blind bought the Super Milk body mist after falling in love with the hair product. While the scents are similar, they’re not identical. The mist opens with a strong lemon note that initially reminds me of a multipurpose spray. Thankfully, it settles into a softer, lemon-meringue pie scent, somewhat like D&G Devotion, but it's still lacking that lovely biscuity note. It’s pleasant enough and I’ve had a few compliments, but it doesn’t have the same wow factor as the original hair product -disappointing given the price.",08/26/25 22:54,Missy_Moo
Super Milk Lush,"I’ve been wanting to try the body spray and original hair primer for some time, so I ordered both along with a Supermilk body butter and a lotion and body wash of Superfairy. The hair primer smells really good like sweet milk as well as the body butter, but the spray is named wrong. This is a creamy lemon meringue that reminds me of Lattafa Victoria a lot. It smells delicious and I love it but I feel like the body spray is false advertising and Lush missed the mark here. They should not have released a milk body spray unless it was going to smell like the original hair product.

With that said, the potency is surprising for a body spray and at least they make it worth the 40 bucks they charge! I really like this and I’m definitely going to be wearing it!



Edit 9/2: So I’m actually really loving this!! On clothing the lemon is stronger but on my skin it smells like à lemon amaretti cookie( biscuit) with a rich creaminess that is so yummy and cozy! I layered this as my bedtime scent with Super Fairy body wash and Super Fairy body lotion, Bath and Body Works Milk lotion, and Orena Fragrances Strawberry Marshmallow body oil and it smells incredible! The body spray is so strong that even with the very potent oil, the spray is the main scent dominating.

In case you’re wondering about Super Fairy, it smells like the pink amoxicillin you used to get as a kid, when you smell it in the containers, but leaves a much better smell on the skin.",08/23/25 10:01,OlfactoryTopTier

The almond and sugary notes come through more than a lactonic or citrus (the best parts of the hair treatment IMO). It is the closest ""dupe"" I've found yet. It will take some layering to find the true replica but I do quite like it.

The opening is very vanilla tea biscuit and the dry down is soooooo similar to a bag of BIG LEAGUE CHEW GUM.

Silage is great for a body spray with such subtle notes.

This paired with the hair treatment is the best. There's something about the spray alone that's not giving super milk but when the hair treatment is in, I've achieved true nirvana. Hope it sticks around.",08/20/25 16:33,ilovebunnies

Super Milk Lush,"right off the bat, i immediately notice that the body spray is missing the “burnt” milky note that makes the hair primer absolutely enticing and addicting. this is a zesty punch that reminds me of lemon hard candies with clorox, it’s giving granny. to me, this is not gourmand but a summery bright fragrance, i’m not getting any vanilla or creaminess. i also think that the glitter spray smelt more similar to the primer than this. disappointed af because i could of just bought another hair primer, but to make this a “combo” i’ll pair it with silk + noir’s marshmallow citrus whip body oil phlur tangerine boy or philosophy lemon custard body lotion for something brighter. it’s not beating the cleaning spray allegations at all",08/13/25 00:22,Lollidolli
Super Milk Lush,"i don't know how i feel, its def missing the milky aspect. i don't know why they try to replicate the hair primer in perfumes/sprays. the true super milk smell just might be unattainable in an alcoholic fragrance format. i would say the glitter spray is the better one, as its milkier but kinda has a watery feel to it. (not that bad tho)

i got a defected one so i requested a refund so i kind don't feel as ripped off, i would say its not as needed only if youre searching for super milk. if you enjoy lemon gourmand scent profile you might not mind it as much.",08/12/25 18:20,gulaabs
Super Milk Lush,"First 15 minutes, it. reminds me of lemonheads in a bottle; similar to Lush's other scent ""Chelsea Morning"". After 20 minutes total, the vanilla came through. Took at least 30 minutes to dry down completely. I would describe this as a lemon/vanilla blend. Good mix of both. The lemon in this is like a custard. No cleaner or lemon pledge vibes here (thank god!) Lasted a good while, with overspraying, 3-4 hours.",08/09/25 11:28,cunt.dracula
Super Milk Lush,"At first, I was skeptical of buying this body spray because a ton of people said that it smelled nothing like the hair primer. I really liked the way the hair primer smelt and ended up getting a sample of it when I was getting another body spray by lush. When the body spray finally came out, I can see what people are saying about it not smelling similarly to the primer however, once you allow the body spray to dry down, it’s actually really nice and I would say maybe 70% similar. I did not like the glitter body spray. It did not last on me and I feel like it’s a distant cousin of the hair primer.

Anyways, about this body spray, it lasted very long on me. I had sprayed it on myself around 3 PM the previous day while being in my house and I still smelt it on myself the next day at night. I couldn’t smell it because it was very faint, but for some reason, my sister did when she was very close to me. When you first initially spray it, it’s very lemon-y but it does dry down into a really nice vanilla biscuit. It kind of reminds me of Jackie Ainas Hard to Get. I like it. I think if you’re skeptical, go in the store, spray it on yourself, let it marinate and come to a conclusion yourself if you like it or not.",08/08/25 20:14,kadijatf
Super Milk Lush,"notes/ingredients: litsea cubeba oil, tonka absolute, vanilla absolute, almond essential oil, benzyl benzoate, citral, coumarin, limonene, linalool

Super Milk starts out incredibly lemon heavy, literally straight lemon essential oil. the lemon effect lasts about 15 minutes on my skin and then the tonka, vanilla, and almond start to come out. The dry down smells like a dialed-back version of Sticky Dates (I like Sticky Dates but it is nuclear in projection, I find Super Milk to be more wearable). I'm happy to have picked this one up, but you have to be a fan of lemon to enjoy it",08/08/25 16:00,pluralfern
Super Milk Lush,"Got an email stating 5 new body sprays released, saw ‘Supermilk’ and rushed to Lush to try them out. Lush had recently released a Supermilk Glitterspray, but glitter is just not my thing. They also had a perfume, but sold out immediately so this body spray was music to my nose.

The scent is about 80% similar to that of the cult favorite hair primer. The similarities are in the lemon forward opening and the gourmand tonka/vanilla layer. The main difference is the almond/coconut backdrop of the spray is more prominent in the heart and drydown, giving it a fuzzy, summery sun-balm quality.
The hair primer sillage smells more like ‘candy’. Wearing both will not conflict.

When comparing to Chelsea Morning perfume, it has a very similar opening. However they diverge into two different paths. Chelsea Morning leans more buttery, toffee-esque, with a smoky incense base. Their dry downs don’t smell alike.

After hearing Supermilk body spray may be limited edition, I walked out with it. I would compute the overall scent profile to a combination of Lush’s perfume Furze (which I’ve been wanting for awhile) over top of Supermilk Hair Primer.

At $45 USD for 200ml, it’s a delectable treat for the end of summer, and an excellent value!",08/07/25 10:36,modernwarpaint
Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"I probably hit the jackpot with the batch that I got because WOW, the performance is excellent. It’s very strong and long lasting, I can smell it all day and even after taking a shower before bedtime. I‘ve gotten a shit amount of compliments - everyone was asking ""what‘s that unique smell???"" the other day in uni. People around me are absolutely in love with this perfume, I guess it blends really well with my skin. A friend told me I smell like a mysterious witch (I‘m a 24 yo guy), another friend told me he couldn‘t imagine this scent on anyone else but me.

After the spray, I could initially smell the smoke and almost peatiness, like in an Islay Scotch whiski. But then, after letting it sit on my skin for a while, I could start smelling the leather and then a bit later a light sweetness like incense toned down by the medicinal cloves. There is a dirty, naughty sexiness to it.

Then I stumbled on this + the reviews sold it to me, the name does it no justice. This is quite simply an Asylum Hospital on fire and I am living for it.

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"Agree with other reviewers, top notes are STRANGE right out the bottle.
Settles down to be very orange/spicy, smells almost like cumin, I think? I was reminded of hay, that sort of dry and sweet scent. My boyfriend thought it smelt like strawberries, but I didn’t get that at all. He also thought it just smelt like a Lush store.
For me, it felt quite intense. Bit of a headache inducer, but I could not stop smelling it.
Last notes were lovely. Wish that had been the entire fragrance – the smell of warm leather as you leave a warm café and go out into the cold night. Sweet, spicy, a little menthol-y.
All in all, not a bad fragrance! Not a blind buy, but also not a divisive one either. Smells good when it settles down, so definitely trust the process. In fact, don’t smell it at all when you first put it on, wait an hour. Think that’s what gave me the headache.

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"Has notes in common with Breath of God but is simpler and less confusing. Vetiver is strongly identifiable in both. LOVE the clove, it makes it a little goth. I had been mixing up a body spray with tons of clove EO for myself and so I have been hooked on smelling clove-y all year. On the unisex side of masculine. The person who says it layers well is correct but I am a tomboy and this is perfect for my aura all by itself. The other person who warns not to blind buy is also correct.

It’s one of those typically odd Lush fragrances. I’m a big fan of Lush fragrances and this is another addition to that long list of favourite frags.",04/18/25 11:18,jejwillett

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"at first spritz this was a smoke bomb, with a little leather underneath offering absolutely no respite (10/10 perfect, no notes) but for some reason on my skin this just kept getting sweeter and sweeter - i'm talking All Good Things levels of sweet, if you're familiar with that. The tonka and clove combined in a way that almost reads as cinnamon to my nose, or at least on my skin. Like red-hots bubblegum sweet cinnamon scent. I wasn't opposed, but I almost missed the harshness of the opening once it was gone.",03/22/25 20:25,soggysniffs
Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"I always find Lush perfumes a bit abrasive. The last time I wore one regularly was during my teenage obsession with ""Karma"". I bought Vegan Leather Jacket immediately after trying it because I knew it would be fantastic for layering, and it is. Alone, it would be shocking, a nose-stinging disinfectant and a damp campfire. However, I'm a fan and often get compliments when I wear it over something sweet. If you don't want a smooth leather but a punchy one this is worth a visit.",03/13/25 20:08,Buckwilde

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"This is a very odd and divisive perfume and sort of shocked me in the store. It smells like a campfire and that is it, nothing else. I can imagine it working well with layering though. Maybe with something as a contrast such as a gourmand or sweet or something clean smelling.
I didn't get around to smelling the drydown and so that may be more wearable.

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"Speaking of smoky scents — who knew a perfume from modern Lush with such a stupid name would actually be amazing? Back in their day, Lush’s Gorilla Perfume label put out some truly amazing heavy hitters. But over the last ten years, it’s seemed as if they’ve eschewed niche experimentalism in favor of remaking three of their popular shower gel scents over and over again in different forms. I see cause for hope in the new line of perfumes they released this year. Some, like The Dew on Their Hems, were standard niche fare, a pretty aquatic reminiscent of something you might find at Jo Malone. Others, like the fun Leonard Cohen sendup No Way To Say Goodbye, were interestingly hyper-saccharine to the point of obscurity. I can quite easily imagine this perfume, which smells somewhere between children’s toothpaste and nightcore bath bomb blackcurrant, fitting in mixed with ironic cigarette smoke on some disaffected twenty-something girl’s jean jacket. The clear standout from the collection, however, was Vegan Leather Jacket, which perhaps is trying to appeal to a tongue-in-cheek sense of postured edginess. I honestly don’t care, because this smells reminiscent of something Jorum Studios would make, and can be bought at a strip mall. There is no leather, here, only a heavy-handed trio of cloves, cade oil, and vetiver. Tart, supple, and gorgeously smoky, this opens with a blast of animalics, not unlike Monolith, and then settles into a flaming spice medley that lasts on skin for a neat couple of hours. People online seem to compare it to Estée Lauder’s creamy ‘70s spicebomb Cinnabar, but I only really agree inasmuch as the drydown occasionally drifts toward dark orange Opium territory. To me, this is really just a fine one-trick pony to scratch the arsonists itch in your wretched little heart without breaking the bank. I love to see mainstream perfume retailers cater to niche markets like this — and know that in their refusal to pander down to a younger consumer base, they will eventually be rewarded.",01/02/25 10:36,foldyrhands

the tobacco and spice notes are much more palpable in the solid form than the liquid fragrance. get the liquid if you want to smell like a leatherdyke stoner; get the solid if you want to smell like a clove cigarette hand-rolled by aforementioned leatherdyke stoner.",12/20/24 18:38,basementscene
Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"Hated it when I smelled it in the store. Adored it when, after I came home, I smelled the little bit of it I accidentally got on my wrist. It's an interesting scent. Heavy on the leather and wood and smoke. Almost a little plastic-y or like gasoline or burned rubber at first spritz. I love how it dries down into bonfire, though. The plastic quality changes into something muskier. It becomes both more subtle and more intricate the longer it is on the skin. A very sexy scent.",12/18/24 15:30,stardognose
Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"The smell of a slutty cowboy.

Ashy tobacco, peaty vetiver, and spicy clove all come together to form this really dirty, slightly animalic leather accord. After this dramatic opening, the leather accord sticks around but calms down for the ashy & smoky tobacco and earthy & woody vetiver to shine through, slight pops of clove fueled spice gives a nice nuance to the fragrance.

One of the dirtiest, mud and sweat covered, thick, and spiciest leather fragrances on the market right now. The opening is bombastic and in your face, but the dry down is much better put together because the vetiver and tobacco really tone down the possibly annoying or unpleasant animalic facets of the leather. A good introduction to animalic leathers, but I think there are better ones out there.

Very good performance and projection of 10 hours with strong projection for the first 4ish hours.

6.5/10.

Song vibe - Too Old to Die Young by Brother Dege

TLDR - Smoky, mud covered, spicy and slightly animalic leather accord that breaks down into the ingredients that make it what it is: vetiver, tobacco, and clove. Would be a good scent for a dive bar or a honky tonk.


Side note - I can sort of get the comparisons to Firewater by Jorum Studios, but I think this uses the smoky, earthy, and dark notes to form a loose leather accord more so than leaning into the smoke filled birch direction that Firewater goes into. Additionally, it’s missing that iconic citric, green, and marine nuances that Firewater has. The comparisons for when smelled in the air are still definitely valid, but when put side by side and smelled up close they are much more different than similar.",12/18/24 12:30,TBonetheFella

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"Vegan Leather Jacket is the best new Lush scent in many moons. Starting with a blast of smoke that veers toward—without ever outright becoming—barbecue, VLJ soon settles on skin with heavy spice rising to the fore. I can understand why Youth Dew and Cinnabar appear in the “reminds me of” section above, but it doesn’t directly relate to either. Rather, it’s as if one of those clove-dominant scents has been pared down to its bare essentials, then flung into a bonfire. Intensely smoky, intensely spicy. VLJ feels rough and rustic, but quite sexy too. Somehow, it reminds me of a leather fragrance without actually smelling of leather. Perhaps that’s the point—this is VEGAN Leather Jacket, after all.

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"I was so happy Lush finally added some new fragrances to the mix! And i was delighted to see that they are trying to stay true to their origins meaning that their perfumes tell a story wich let's face it, they had stopped telling for the last couple or years. Lush has been doing nothing but discontinue and water down their best creations, so obviously i was absolutely thrilled to discover new fragrances labeled with art that don't just smell like citrus or like another blend that stems from breath of God.

Vegan leather jacket smells exactly like the name suggests. It smells of leather worn next to a bonfire. It's not sweet at all and might lean masucline to some because of it but obviously it's entirely unisex because why should scent be gendered? Because of the lack of sweetness there are no smores roasting by this particular bonfire. There is no softness no milkyness. Just the smell of charred firewoods stuck to the collar of your favorite (vegan) leather jacket.

Vegan Leather Jacket Lush,"I love a Lush fragrance. Most Lush frags are very individual. Shade is absolutely unique. Vegan Leather Jacker isn’t. It’s very dry, has a genuine smokiness to it; I get the amber comparisons (VLJ is kinda the country bumpkin cousin of YSL Cinnabar) but it’s not leathery. I get no leather at all really. And its reach is very poor. This frag sits close to the body - two/ three good spritzes to my skin and the same again to my clothes and after 10/15 mins I cannot smell it and no one has yet to comment on it.
Do I like VLJ? Yes I do. It’s an everyday frag. More masculine I’d suggest. I’ll continue to wear it. And for the price…why not? But don’t buy this expecting a leather bomb. You’ll be disappointed.",09/17/24 13:26,Ten2Midnight

It may mix well with Obsession by Calvin Klein, but I think the Obsession would be doing the heavy lifting there.

Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,"I have a hard time finding floral perfumes that aren't heavy, sultry, and/or earthy which I dislike. This perfume is beautiful, and perfect for spring and summer. I absolutely love it!

Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,"It’s like standing in a hot and humid, green and dewy flower garden while the sun beams down on you.

Then you piss all over it.

Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,"This is a very comfortable, soothing scent to be in. Yet its not boring. Be aware, the first few minutes bring up the cat pee edge of chamomile but this smooths down after a while, allowing for the honeysuckle / white florals to come through.

Its heading to winter as I am writing this, will be lovely to revisit this scent in the spring / warmer weather.",12/23/21 10:03,Frangipanilove
Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,Cheery pretty Springtime floral. Prominent lavender and chamomile gives way to white florals and waxy-plasticky-fruity 'Lush' smell. The drydown smells like something from my childhood but I couldn't say what. Nice and happy.,11/06/21 14:06,amberonic
Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,"This is really beautiful, hazy, ashy, soft green and sweet scent. Yes it’s sweet, not synthetic sweet, It’s a realistic chamomile and honeysuckle sweet, but nothing offputting. The green edge and hazy-ness balance it out. It also has a bit floral milky, some nameless wild flowers that give soft milky scent. It’s serene and very comforting to wear in summer.

Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,"I love this scent. It was a blind buy for me and I was really anxious because it is a bit pricey, but it worked out! While I also love Demeter’s Honeysuckle, this is not it. Demeter’s is a bright, light honeysuckle. This perfume also smells like honeysuckle, but a beautiful, deep, syrupy honeysuckle, with a dash of chamomile to ground it. Would it smell ‘sickly sweet’ to some, like a commenter mentioned below, but also smell beautifully syrupy to me? Sure, why not! It all depends on what you like. For what it’s worth, my husband who does not like florals smelled this on me immediately after I sprayed it and loved it, asked me right away what it was! The longevity and sillage is not bad, people will definitely smell this as you walk by!",02/10/20 22:40,Rh1071

Ladyboy Lush,"This has been rereleased as 'fantabulosa' - lush told me that they dont plan on restocking this online, but it will continue to be produced & be exclusive to the Liverpool store.

As for this perfume:

For the 1st few seconds, I get an unpleasant blast of synthetic banana, which then morphs into the smell of condoms, I also smell palmaviolet sweeties & theres a slightly stale mustiness in the background.
After about 30 min its just powdery violet & thankfully its pretty much just a skin scent.

The violet lasts quite a few hours, then theres a ghost of something ever so slightly sweet & musty, I guess kinda unwashed smelling - but it's hard to describe when I can barely smell it


I can usually find something that I can appreciate in a fragrance, even if it's not my cup of tea, but I've thought over this & made myself wear it 3 times - the only nice thing I can say is that the colour of the juice is very pretty.

Lush describe this as being ""sophisticated"" & ""chic"" - which does make me question their understanding of those words, because smelling like some manky old pick 'n' mix that's been stored in a condom, doesn't really fit my understanding of either. If you realllllllly love violet, you might be able to enjoy this - but for me, it sadly just turns my stomach",04/29/19 04:41,Kristen_SWYT

The solid perfume was available so I got that. I learned my lesson; don't wait forever to buy something you love, and I do love this one. The opening has a sense of humor with the strong banana note, but the dry down is wearable, lovely, and surprisingly sophisticated. But I really wanted it in the largest size.",10/09/14 17:43,Capricious Capricorn
Ladyboy Lush,***** THIS FRAGRANCE HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED - STOCK UP NOW!****,07/10/14 06:06,VintageViolet_
Ladyboy Lush,"This perfume is both more and less weird than sniffing the bottle lead me to think it would be.

Just sniffing the bottle-or a tester strip-what you get is holy-crap banana. At the co-op where I buy most of our groceries they have a little hot food section, and one of the things they serve for breakfast is French toast made with a reduction of bananas and walnuts. I always scrape off the lumps of banana, but I like eating it, and Ladyboy smells powerfully of something you should serve on an egg- washed piece of sauteed baguette.

Unless and until you put it on your skin. Then it's an entirely different perfume. It's amazing, really. The banana evaporated from my skin immediately and left behind a sugar-caramelizing smell (breakfast!), which almost immediately yielded to a powerful scent of oakmoss. An hour later it smelled like leathery oakmoss-which is fine with me, since I love both leather and oakmoss-and then an hour or so later it also revealed a lovely green powdery smell.

But the crowning glory was what it did after about four or five hours: it gave me a breath of Camay soap. How weird is that? I loved my grandmother's Camay when I was a kid. Do they still even make it?

This is one of the most interesting perfumes I've ever tried. It was a real journey, and I liked every bit of it. I got all this from trying a 1 ml tester! I will probably buy an actual bottle and add it to my stable of daily wear perfumes.",06/03/14 16:05,Eloquaint
Ladyboy Lush,"What a fun fragrance!

I get banana, chocolate, violet & oak moss on my skin. This is a great scent for men as well as women. For those who like something earthy-sweet. Great for summer.",04/14/14 07:39,VintageViolet_
Ladyboy Lush,"I have been sniffing my empty decant of this for about a year and am on the fence about it. Yes, it has an initial, rather cheeky, banana note at the beginning and then dries down to something, IMO, very sophisticated. I love violet and violet leaf is one of the notes; I must like oakmoss too. I'll update this review if I get it.",04/01/14 13:41,Capricious Capricorn
Ladyboy Lush,Banana's all the way. I don't like it.,11/24/13 14:21,GabrielaBurolo
Ladyboy Lush,"Ladyboy hasn't grown on me as much as other fragrances from Lush have. I'm not surprised that this is a men's scent. The dark, somewhat thick oakmoss drydown is very masculine on me.

Just when I thought Lush Cocktail smelt a bit like bananas, Ladyboy comes along to show me what Lush's spin on banana really smells like. I can't say that I like the powdery, candied banana scent in Ladyboy, but I do welcome the violet and chamomile accords.

This fragrance overall is fairly musky and herbal. On a man's skin Ladyboy would smell very unique, like a breath of fresh air. The name of this fragrance may be a deterrent to some, but believe me when I say that all men, regardless of their sexuality would enjoy wearing Lush Ladyboy.

The oakmoss in the base lends a real chypre quality to this composition. I really enjoy this somewhat dry, earthy component. Ladyboy's sillage decreases towards the base, softening considerably before fading away altogether.

Ladyboy's longevity is fairly impressive, at least five hours. I'd be interested to smell this fragrance on other people's skin. I don't like the way it smells on me, but I think it has some real potential.",09/23/13 01:42,missk
Ladyboy Lush,Someone gave me a sample of this and I'm getting simply a patchouli/vetiver mix - huh? No bananas or anything else listed above. No longevity.,06/13/13 13:36,truffles
Ladyboy Lush,"Happy and colourful flamboyance!

As everyone else has said, this is definitely a unisex scent.

Personally I loved it, and after seeing another reviewer compare it with banana sweets, that is my opinion too, but in the best possible way.

I was hounded by a Lush rep when trying this in the store (as is standard in Lush...), and basically all she kept repeating was what a 'fun' fragrance it was... Maybe she got it exactly right, or her words have just mingled with the smell memory engraved on my brain, but that's exactly what I think of now when I think of LadyBoy... 'Fun'.",06/10/13 16:26,kristina.l.myers
Ladyboy Lush,"I don't think this is a fragrance just for men at all. It is more of a green unisex scent, not a superficial/fresh green either, but a rather deep one. The banana stays mainly in the opening, where it is overwhelming a little - and it is more like banana syrup really. But this lasts only for about a half hour, then it evolves with the rest of the notes creating this kind of ""greenness"" which is very sophisticated. For a Lush creation, the violet is not very noticeable, it is much better blended and balanced than what they usually tend to do with it. This is a favorite.",11/10/12 01:35,djcrybetty
Ladyboy Lush,"I know Lush are big on saving the environment... but come on! This could have benefited from a much better bottle. The plain black pot just doesn't do it any justice. Even just putting the original 'Ladyboy' logo with the banana on the front would be preferable.

Having said that, this fragrance is very powerful on first spray - in fact, I had trouble picking any individual scents out at all! (I since found out that it was supposed to be banana.) It also lasts a very long time on me; I've even smelled it a good 15 hours after applying it, even with handwashing, etc.
In fact, the longer it's on, the better it becomes. This is definitely something that smells its best after about two or three hours. It matures into a deliciously warm, slightly spicy scent with a tiny hint of mint. After that, only the violets are detectable, but they do last ages! This definitely lives up to its moniker of 'quirky,' but it's just not unisex to me. Again, I think it might be the violets; I can barely smell the oakmoss.",10/18/12 14:24,Ellzee
Ladyboy Lush,"I've now worn Lush LADYBOY several times, a testament to the potency of this house's potions. My sample vial contained 2 ml, but it seemed as though I'd never reach the bottom! Of course, that's great news, if you happen to like the rough-hewn, home-grown ""perfumes"" of this house. The largest size they come in is a 1 ounce bottle--and with good reason!

My problem with Lush in general is that I find the compositions harsh, not lush. Even the ones which are less harsh are still so much more harsh than most niche perfumes. Have I become a snob?

LADYBOY opens evocatively with a blast of artificial banana which instantly calls to my mind my walks home from junior high school. Why? Because there was a Tenneco along the route, and I often stopped there to buy candy, with Beich's Bananas at the top of the list. I have no idea why I liked that candy. If I saw it today, I'm sure that I'd read the ingredient list and veto it immediately. It's bound to be filled with a laundry list of non-food items. What was great about this candy was that it came shaped in these huge rectangular pieces that filled your whole mouth, and the texture was totally awesome (and I have chosen those words deliberatively!). I'm sure that Beich's Bananas are (or were--not sure if they still exist...) every dentist's dream come true. How many fillings have need to be fixed because of Beich's Bananas? I ask most sincerely. On the dental-work destruction front, they are rivaled only by JuJuBes and Milk Duds.

Anyway, the very same artificial banana flavor appears to have been used to create Simon's little joke about a lady boy's anatomy. Ha ha. Good thing he didn't go into the entertainment business. Once the banana fumes clear out (and they are very fumey--like most of the loud scents of this house, always toeing the paint-thinner line), then judging by the ingredient list on the vial, I should love LADYBOY. Anthemis nobilis (chamomile), Cistus ladaniferus (could be a type-o--it's supposed to be labdanum resinoid), Viola odorata (no explanation needed!), and the sacred evernia prunastri (oakmoss), which everyone knows has been pulled from the vast majority of perfumes, resulting in sometimes tragic reformulations.

I do think that this particular Lush concoction ends up smelling pretty decent by the end, and it is not destroyed by Simon's apparent near anosmia to citrus oil (I can imagine him in the ""kitchen"", adding more and more lemongrass oil to his creations, never reaching the point of detection, all the while unaware that he's actually hyposmic to the stuff!) No, grâce à Dieu--or reasonable facsimile--there is no lemongrass or any other citrus whatsoever in this perfume! It's a miracle! But in place of the caustic citrus oil, there are banana fumes.

I think that LADYBOY is okay. For me, it's a sure trip down memory lane, every time I wear it. But how many more times do I need to reflect upon my junior high school days, walking to Tenneco to fill my mouth with Beich's bananas? Not on my wish list, in the end.",10/05/12 15:53,sherapop
Ladyboy Lush,"Had no idea what the notes of this was before I sprayed it - yes it hits you like a smack in the face, synthetic banana. However I've been searching my whole life for an artificial banana scent so this was a welcome smack in the face....

Reminds me of that banana medicine they give for kids with ear infections, (again I love that smell lol).

On the spray card about an hour and a half later sadly the banana has pretty much gone, got a very natural minty aquatic smell left, it reminds me a bit of Lush Dirty.

Wish the banana lasted a bit longer, but overall it's an interesting 'aquatic' , going to save up for the 30ml bottle.",09/03/12 08:05,ChemistRhi
Ladyboy Lush,"The previous reviewer must be kidding. ""Unwashed human""? C'mon... Are you serious?

Well, after testing it, I decided to buy the solid version (just because I haven't got any solid perfume), that is supposed to be ""in honour of Brazilian beaches"" but, I assure you, there are no ladyboys in Brazil. Ladyboys are part of Thai culture. Anyway, I like the scent but I think Lush fragrances are a bit pricey and the product design (black plastic with a sticker) is boring and cheap.

This scent is definitely a dividing one. It has something, that is very eighties. Then something I can`t put my finger on, but feel like, it is the same thing that makes the classics the classics. To me this is very classic-y, nevertheless unique, different.

It is elegant, yet playful. Sharp, but not fresh. Very sexy, I love wearing it. The masculine notes make it very sexy to me. It is indeed the perfect unisex scent, as it is truly both masculine and feminine.

Very different. Qualité bohémien.",05/27/18 11:44,thechantal
B Scent Lush,"I never got the dry down of floral that is mentioned, just woody-citrus. Like high-end furniture polish! In a good way, though. Another unusual fragrance from Lush.


Edit: So I bought the solids of some random Lush perfumes right as they were being discontinued, but my scent-palette wasn't very devoloped at that time so I didn't really know what to think of these.

Well, they've been aging on my shelf for about two years now, and I have to say they have only become more amazing over time! So glad I impulse-purchased these!

Anywho, so this is one interesting fragrance. I'm definitely getting more of the powdery-floral notes on top of the citrus and spice. Much more complex than furniture polish, this is more like the whole woodworking shop!

The imagery these evoke are really something to experience. And leave it to Lush to make me eat my ""dislikes"" list of perfumery notes... :/",07/27/15 10:33,QueenieBee
B Scent Lush,"A big surprise from Lush, since they usually do real weirdos (for which I bless and adore them). I love Ladyboy, and respect and admire Breath of God; B Scent is something new, pretty without being complacent, edgy without being aggressive, fun but not freaky.

B Scent opens with citrus, lemon, I think, a tasteful and discrete rose, and a surprising and delicious note of fennel. There's also a very subtle backing of white flower. It has a straight-forward dry down that doesn't change the composition of the perfume much, although the fennel fades a little and a more earthy note shows up. It stays roundly and sweetly pleasant.

This is a terrific summer perfume, with the fennel providing a cooling note, and the rose prettying up your sundress and flushed cheeks.",08/01/14 09:42,Eloquaint

B Scent Lush,"Lush B Scent is an intense herbal-lemon fragrance with a hint of musk. Once again, I am left speechless, in awe of this brand's unique style.

B Scent opens with a somewhat sour, lemon detergent note, which is strangely alluring despite the fact that I'm not a huge fan of lemon. Fennel and lavender make a rather brash entrance in the heart, smelling like a cross between liquorice sticks and play-doh. I know this blend sounds revolting, but it actually smells quite nice.

The lemon accord gets sweeter and sweeter throughout the course of this fragrance's development. The musk and sandalwood in the base are both smooth and earthy smelling. That distinctive 'hippie vibe' that Lush is known for is definitely present in B Scent.

I think B Scent is either a love it or hate it. I totally dig it, but I must admit that my friends don't understand why I'd want to wear it. Like Sherapop so eloquently put it, this fragrance is a bit of a 'punch in the face' in terms of sillage.

Like most Lush fragrances, B Scent has excellent longevity and is another eco-friendly scent. I feel like I'm embracing my inner bohemian whenever I wear this fragrance.",09/22/13 00:58,missk
B Scent Lush,"I guess, to be perfectly frank, I'm really not feeling the Lush love. All of these extremely potent perfumes have a very hardline edge of essential oils--often citrus, spices and herbs--which makes them come out on my skin more as pre-bath concoctions than as perfumes. They really are rough-hewn, it seems to me, and part of what I am perceiving, what carries over from fragrance to fragrance, appears to be the Lush house base. It is so much more powerful than any of the delicate flowers with which it is combined, that it comes through no matter what, even in a jasmine bomb such as LUST.

I'll keep trying, but it's going to be a hard sell. I keep donning these ""made in the kitchen"" perfumes (which I do believe!) in the hopes of seeing the light--or rather sniffing the magic, but in the end they always make me feel as though I need a bath. B SCENT opens like a punch in the face with a citrus accord which appears to feature lemongrass--or has some of that essence absorbed permanently into my fat cells from my testing of other creations from this house? Then it just takes time for it to settle down to an acceptable level of nasal assault, but honestly I cannot understand how anyone could consider this a rose perfume! Really?

Ultimately, this all boils down to a matter of taste, it seems to me. If your idea of a pleasurable olfactory experience is to spend an afternoon at the Lush store, then you may love everything in this line! Do you find Keiko Mecheri ""boring""? Well, you may be the perfect Lush customer, my fragrant friend. When I went to the store in Harvard Square to purchase a bottle of LUST, the SA gave me a complimentary slab of LUST soap, the scent of which is so powerful that every time I enter my bathroom I cannot help but remember my visit to the kaleidoscopically colored land of Lush.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,Good longevity and projection but I feel this year it smells different. It’s very spicy and smells a lot like clove. Not very smooth or vanillary like I remember older bottles,11/08/25 21:50,Adog22
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,I love it! This is one of the scents I am looking for during fall and winter. Dark brown spicy warm vanilla and spices. Yes! The other perfumes are hella gross at Lush.,10/31/25 18:39,Boomkin-pie

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"i fear i am doomed to dislike any scent made by lush, regardless of how appealing one might sound. this one is no exception. i was desperately searching for a chai latte fragrance (if you know of any scents that smell like the dove spiced chai latte deodorant, please hit me up) and i thought this one might be a winner. unfortunately, it was not.

to my nose, this is all turmeric and no latte. it's overly spicy, and i usually enjoy spicy frags- but this is just straight up turmeric with a slight milkiness. i could see this working better for a guy. this perfume could be saved by layering it with vanilla, but for the price point i don't think it's worth doing all that. all the lush fragrances i've tried have this weird DNA i can't really pinpoint. they all smell ""off"" for some reason :(",10/20/25 10:46,boringstella
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I do not see any connection with Tobacco Vanille. To my nose it has citrus opening and developes to a kind of raw and sweet dry down. I'm glad I didn't buy it blindly, but it is worth more testing.",10/19/25 11:03,octobersun
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I'm a bit confused by people describing this as a spicy or chai scent. I detect zero spices. This is a slightly lactonic, very earthy turmeric scent. Not sweet in the slightest. I was hoping this would have a bit more interest to it, but it's a straightforward realistic turmeric.",10/17/25 15:40,babepdx
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,I love this but I need to stop sniffing it. Also one spray goes a LONG way so it's a good investment,10/15/25 21:01,ebalmsworld
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I LOVE Turmeric Latte!! I FINALLY picked this up today after wanting to, meaning to, but not being quick enough about it for the past few years! Today, I went into LUSH with purpose, and picked up the 100 ml after sniffing it for the 3rd year in a row and being thoroughly enchanted by this caramelly, sweet, rich vanilla. I really wanted to love Bianco Latte, but felt underwhelmed by it. THIS is what I wanted that to be, and THIS, baby, is my latte scent!! It's also SO reasonably priced given the current state of perfume prices these days! I also happened to finally smell Tobacco Vanille today and I personally don't find Turmeric Latte to be very close to that one (and I also REALLY want T.V.!!). This one is sweeter and more easy going, great for every day and a 100% autumnal scent. I also don't pick up on the turmeric -- it's giving more vanilla latte and I'm very much fine with that :-) LOOOOOOOVE!!

PS- for a really fun sweet coffee experience, layer this with Versatile’s Croissant Café 😘👌",10/11/25 09:32,Ambercrazy5
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This smells like a chai latte. I really like it, but yeah it just doesn't smell like a turmeric latte for me. It also reminds me of gingerbread houses. I've been waiting to purchase this for a year after seeing it at a Lush store last Christmas, and it has returned in stores now that Lush has started releasing their Christmas stuff again. Longevity is mixed – sometimes it lasts a good 7 hours and other times it lasts maybe 5 max. Could be weather/temperature dependent. Otherwise the longevity is really not much to complain about. Sillage is also stronger than expected for me. This makes me feel like I spent hours and hours inside a cafe drinking countless amounts of coffee and tea and my clothes have ultimately absorbed the scent of the cafe. Lovely scent and to me, a purchase well worth waiting for.",10/10/25 22:38,jbel7510

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is a warm, cozy fragrance with a hint of spice. The opening bursts with turmeric and vanilla, creating a unique and comforting scent.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This one is definitely not what I expected. It smells like sweet, old wood, like a heritage building with a lot of wood furnishings, but in a nice, non-musty smelling way. I don't hate it, but it doesn't smell like anything edible to me. I do detect a spiciness, but it reads more as wood to my nose, like a spicy sandalwood.",09/27/25 17:05,niepokoya
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I didn’t get a chance to purchase turmeric latte last year, and I sincerely regret it because of how much I loved it. After smelling it again this year I undoubtedly will purchase. I’ve not seen any other person mention this, and the notes in this fragrance don’t really suggest this — but I personally feel that this is a photorealistic Thai tea scent. Albeit a tad bit spicier than a real Thai tea, the turmeric and benzoin do a lot of heavy lifting to give this a sharp tea-like aroma, balanced by the sweetness of Tonka and pure vanilla.",09/20/25 23:13,ruefrida
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I was in a department store a few days ago and sampled Ambre Nuit Espirit de Parfum by Dior - I was immediately in love and kept smelling the sample card throughout the day trying to place where I had smelled this scent before. It was haunting me all day, I knew this scent, I was deeply familiar with it… later I opened my perfume drawer to apply my post shower fragrance and Turmeric Latte by Lush caught my eye. I gave it a smell. It couldn’t be? I grabbed the sample card with Ambre Nuit and smelled them side by side… wow. There are definitely differences and Ambre Nuit is far more refined and well rounded. But Turmeric Latte by Lush is an INSANELY affordable likeness. I always get complimented on it too. Worth picking up. Just say it’s Dior.",09/20/25 19:55,belsburgers

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I tried this perfume in-store last year and became a little obsessed. It's very comforting and unique. I didn't end up purchasing it, but think about it from time to time. Today I tried the popular niche fragrance called ""Blanche Bete"" (not a Lush perfume) and to me, from what I can remember, they are cousins! Blanche Bete has some incense notes that Turmeric Latte doesn't quite have, but the dry down I found very similar.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"seriously so sexy!! it's a little dark, and i know there's no tobacco note but there's something smoky about it to me? idk. downside is that the projection is not the greatest in winter/on clothes, but i bought this in summer and wore it all the time and it actually works quite well in heat? for me, at least. Anyway this was one of my first fragrances so i'm probably biased but i love you turmeric latte you are beautiful to me in your own way<3",08/29/25 01:25,luzing.the.race
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"i got the massage bar of this recently and it smells heavenly, maybe the smell differs between products but oh my gosh this smells SO nice. i’m not usually a fan of spice scents like turmeric and ginger that sort of smell but this is really nice. as you apply it the turmeric hits you but not long after it’s followed by tonka bean and later on the turmeric dies down leaving the scent as a nice, warm and heavy scent.
you could probably layer this with eilish 1 or very heavy/pure vanilla scents if you do prefer that with hints of warmness, i can’t wait to layer the massage bar with vanillas in the colder months i can imagine it smelling incredible
i’ll def be getting the perfume ASAP
update: i smelt the perfume on skin and the first 20 minutes was awful just full of ginger and spices but the dry down was so lovely, creamy vanilla with a hint of spices. idk if it’s worth me suffering the first 20 minutes of wearing this just so i can have a bottle :/",08/25/25 18:19,freyja0619

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"It pained me to have to sell this fragrance because it’s an iconic limited edition lush perfume, however, it’s not versatile enough to wear.

It’s delicious, but not something I want to wear.",08/14/25 22:13,Poliscihottie
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"to me this smells like christmas in a bottle, not bad but i’d probably only ever wear it on christmas or cold winter days/nights",08/13/25 12:45,LeahM02
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is a lovely, layered fragrance with real vanilla wrapped in woody, resinous warmth and a gentle kick of spice. The vanilla seems to mellow and sweeten the turmeric, with a rich rooibos tea infused with turmeric and woodsy tonka heart.

Despite the long list of base notes, it only lasts about three to four hours on my skin, so I happily respray. This is gorgeous and an accessible spiced fragrance. I'm often wearing this on an autumnal work day.

Notes:
-The Tobacco Vanille comparison works in terms of autumnal cosiness, although this is less dense and more tea-forward. I do not see this as a dupe at all. Maybe if someone has a limited collection and only wants one ""autumnal cosy chai/tobacco,"" they would choose between them. This isn't me.

-For me, it was part of the journey into spicy fragrances, and it is the perfect bridge for someone moving from a vanilla oriental or vanilla gourmand into vanilla with depth. You start with turmeric latte, then you might blend Vanilla + Babycat. Fast forward, and now you're wearing Ishq Al Shuyukh Gold.

-I would rate the turmeric higher than it is on the voted notes. I think the vanilla takes the edge off it though, so I can understand how it was rated. This is a good introuctory turmeric for the spice-nervous",08/09/25 05:14,yourbela
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I didn't find the perfume at my local Lush but only the massage bar, and it smells the same. I find it very unique as it remind me of a sweet cacao dessert but a gourmet one. I'm a gourmand perfumes lover and particulary every perfumes with caramel notes, cacao, vanilla... and this one didn't dissappoint, I find it sweet but not too much, the vanilla is there, the tonka bean and benjoin too and then the star, the turmeric. it's kinda weird first because it's so uncommon but then an addiction begin 🫣😍",07/30/25 13:32,E2S

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I didn't like this at first but it's really grown on me recently. It has a sweet vanilla smell not in a cookie or cake kind of way but like vanilla extract from the bottle which can smell kind of synthetic but I like it nonetheless. Not a safe blind buy but definitely worth trying if this kind of smell is what you're into. I wish it was a little less sweet because it can be overpowering but it's a nice kind of darker and headier gourmand.

Has a similar profile to Matiere Premiere's vanilla powder for me but sweeter and less powdery, as both are sort of dark intense almost synthetic vanilla fragrances on my skin.",07/07/25 15:04,sallyly
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Lives up to its name, but leans more into the insence/coffee/smoky side than gourmand vanilla; the sweet vanilla side is certainly there, but it isn't as forward as in some other Lush gourmand scents. It's wonderful when layered with Vanillary (I use the solid perfume).

Letting this one macerate for a few weeks helped to remove the strange cola tinged opening...",06/30/25 10:30,ComingUpRoses
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I've known Lush for 11 years, I kinda know what to expect from their perfumes, but this one still left me speechless.

It's a comfort in a bottle. It's cozy, delicious in a way, it's unique but I'd have never, ever thought it will be so complex. There's so much going on here, it feels like there's a whole world inside the bottle.

There's smoke here and warmth of autumn sunny days, there's comforting but earthy vanilla, there's spice and sharpness, there's sweetness here too. So much thrown into one scent, yet it's balancing each other perfectly.

This isn't a safe blind buy, not a vanilla gourmand girl dream. It's mysterious, smoky, dark and intense, but warm and comforting like a blanket at the same time (and super long lasting!). It's one of the best and most unique perfumes I've ever had.",06/25/25 15:14,CrescentWitch

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I wouldn’t call this a 1-to-1 dupe for TF TV because turmeric here smells completely different than the clove/cinnamon dominant spices in TF. There’s also no tobacco here and an unremarkable but present one in TF. This smells like a hyper-realistic golden latte. Like if you go in youe kitchen right now and simmer turmeric and spices in milk, you’d get this scent.",05/13/25 19:24,nillamoonlight
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Omg....smoky gorgeous incense vanilla.
Pretty much a 1-1 dupe for Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille.
Sprayed it in the Lush store and thought it was very subtle but as the day wore on I noticed its presence with the intense smokey wafts all around me. It really comes alive once it warms on the skin.
It really is a masterful fragrance.
Cozy stunning powerful smoky vanilla.
Love it!!!

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"A freshly brewed spicy coffee simmers down, glowing on the skin with a strong and fragrant dry down of tonka, benzoin and faint lingering turmeric; this is not a vanilla that is light on the nose and can get cloying extremely quickly sprayed more than twice on an individual wrist.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Turmeric latte is spicy and sweet. Read that again, because if you don’t like either of those, this will be a MAJOR no for you as it leans heavily into both. But for me? Looovveee this. It’s cozy yet bold, sweet yet spicy, playful with some edge, unoffensive yet totally in your face. It’s a chaotic little hodgepodge of everything I enjoy in a fragrance. Combine that with amazing performance, and in my humble opinion, it’s easily one of the top fragrances in this scent profile. Don’t believe me, choose your best fighter, I’ve already put my money where my nose is.",04/18/25 08:55,BerryBizarre

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"got this to gear up for winter. this fragrance is spicy, it's vanillic; reminiscent of a chai latte. the tonka comes in during the dry down and adds to the warmth and comfort this fragrance brings. having read the notes prior to trying the fragrance, i was a bit weary of the turmeric note. however, the turmeric note is very weak and not off-putting; it mainly sits in the background and only adds to the spiciness. a unisex gourmand for sure. perfect for autumn & winter exclusively.

what a beautiful entrance into a new season and way of welcoming the cold.",04/11/25 01:19,palosanto72
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"i really tried to like this... but it just smelt like incense and tobacco to me, no vanilla whatsoever. i waited for it to dry down and nothing changed. maybe it just works poorly with my skin chem but it was just horrible to me",04/10/25 13:43,angelestia
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"The description had me longing for it and I wish it lived up to the hype. The sweetness is nothing like vanilla, I actually think it smells like a certain brand of baby wipes or a sickly yellow floral while the benzoin was weird and medicinal. This is both in regards to the perfume and the massage bar, but only when they decide to smell like the same scent family! Sometimes my bottle plays a strange game where it has a 1/10 chance to give me a smoky blast of burnt wood out of nowhere while the bar has a weird tendency to smell like an ancient cucumber Dove deodorant I have lying around. I thought I wanted that smoky edge but the perfume was just distracting and people around me kept asking if something was burning. I don't think I can enjoy TL directly but I keep the bar in my drawers without any storage and it acts like an eternal room freshener.",04/08/25 20:05,heavensblues

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Turmeric Latte reminds me of being young and stepping into the bustling Indian market, where the air is rich with the scent of spices and mithai. This perfume's main accords are a blend of warm, spicy notes intertwined with sweet, milky undertones, reminding me of a traditional Indian turmeric milk drink (haldi doodh, for those of you that are desi).

Upon the first spritz, you're greeted with a bold combination of turmeric and spicy notes, which can be a bit overwhelming initially. As it settles, the fragrance unveils a comforting heart of vanilla and tonka bean, adding a creamy sweetness that balances the initial spiciness. She can be your summer, depending on the region of the world you live in and the season, but she can also be your winter too. Warming, spicy yet vanilla and ever so creamy.

Longevity is impressive, with the scent lingering on the skin for hours, and its projection is notable without being overpowering. Some might find the opening too intense, and the dry-down could lean towards a slightly synthetic sweetness. It’s a unique journey that reminds me of childhood and transports to the heart of India, blending traditional spice with modern gourmand elements.",03/19/25 06:48,AqsaAtiqRana

Its very smokey, almost cigarette smokey. It smells like vanilla, smoke, some spice and BREAD. It's very very bready. Some would even describe it as starchy rice. Like standing next to a rice cooker.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"A warm chai latte with frothed oat milk: bottled.

𝐬𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 - Creamy, sweet, and spicy this fragrance opens with a sucker punch of warm chai spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves mixed with milky and smooth vanilla that's extremely reminiscent of the vanilla found in ""Tobacco Vanille"" but even more amped up. As it dries down a wonderful nutty tonka comes in to mingle with the sweetness and spices and forms a great connection between the two accords.

𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 - It's quite literally like you take the spiced vanilla aspect from Tom Ford's ""Tobacco Vanille"" and boost up the amount of spices, add a lot of nutty tonka to the mix, and add a frothed milk-like accord to the mix. Honestly, it's one of the best Tobacco Vanille-esque fragrances on the market, and I highly recommend picking this up before Lush inevitably shelves it after the winter season.

𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 - 8-11 hour performance with great 6-foot projection for the first 3.5 or so hours.

𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 - 9.5/10.

𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐞𝐚𝐫 - Museum and coffee dates; Snuggling under your favorite blanket while sipping chai on a cold day; holiday shopping dates around midtown

𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐯𝐢𝐛𝐞 - Feather by Nujabes, Cise Starr and Akin

When I first smelled this in a Lush store I was a little puzzled even though I liked it, but now everytime I smell this it comforts me yet transports me to a more exciting place.

Easily a fall reach, has good longevity and pretty decent projection. Creamy and lactonic but also spicy from the turmeric. Perfectly linear frag, notes don’t change whatsoever throughout the lifetime. Just very, very realistic. May be a little too realistic if you’re not a gourmand lover but if you are and love chai, you need this in your collection. Don’t know when I will bite the bullet but I will at some point :)",01/31/25 21:04,Azisai-
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"they really need to make this an all year round perfume, i don't care if it doesn't suit spring or summer, this perfume is just absolutely amazing.

a super smoky bonfire with a strong layer of a vanilla bean custard that's been dusted with turmeric. it reminds me a lot of replica's 'autumn vibes' but the vanilla is much stronger.

it's definitely something i'd wear nearly daily in november-december, but still wear occasionally throughout the year.

definitely interested in looking into lush's over perfumes now, i was only really interested in their soaps and bath bombs before...",01/30/25 07:20,shizumafu
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is an absolute masterpiece that’s still under the radar. Once people realize how good it is, they’ll regret not getting a bottle, especially now that it’s discontinued. Turmeric Latte is a truly hidden gem, blending warm, spicy notes with a creamy, cozy undertone. It’s rich, unique, and far from the typical mass-market gourmands.",01/30/25 02:23,Goltnor

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"My first ever perfume purchase and I could not be happier. Seriously addicting. I love it so much I got the Turmeric Latte massage bar from Lush too, so I could smell it without using up my precious perfume!! My blind first impression on paper was that it smelled like a delicious wooden desk, but now that I have worn it many more times I definitely understand people describing it in gourmand terms, or ""smelling like christmas"". Feels sweet in a cute way both feminine and masculine, which I really enjoy since I'm nonbinary. Friends who I've shown it to agree that it smells delicious. Not sure how it holds up in hot weather/spring/summer months, though, I can see how it might become cloying. I can also see the potential for it to smell like Play-Doh in the unfortunate way that a lot of Lush stuff does when it goes sour. I understand why it's a seasonal winter product but I wish it wasn't so limited edition!",01/23/25 14:31,orm01
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I blind purchased this after falling in love with their Sticky Dates and Yog Nog products. It is a nice spicy vanilla scent but I was kind of dissapointed that it wasn't a bit sweeter. The notes made it sound like a very sweet, caramel spice fragrance. I get no caramel at all. It also doesn't have great longevity. I will let it sit and come back to it.",01/18/25 05:37,Mshapiro2115
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Don't listen to anyone who says it's smoky or similar to TV or whatever. Those people have a recently purchased bottle of Turmeric Latte. For like a year, that's what it smells like. But then it changes into rice pudding. You know, like the dessert? Just milk, rice and vanilla. Just the slightest trace of smoke, so slight you'd have to be looking for it. My husband always comments that I smell delicious whenever I wear this. Buy it now and forget about it in some dark recess of your closet until next fall or winter. Then try it out and you'll have your newest favorite cozy scent for cold weather.",01/16/25 07:24,O+M+D
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is my favorite winter cozy scent. It smells like a Christmas candle, but not overly artificial which is amazing. It is just a little boozy on me, as well, which I love. Syrupy, fragrant, cozy, a little boozy and smoky. Kinda smells like a bar in your hometown the weekend before Christmas with a simmer pot in the background. It smells more like Tonka bean to me rather than vanilla. Longevity is not the greatest on me 4-5 hours and then it dies down. This is a great winter nighttime perfume though so that does not matter. Projection is fantastic! I would rate this a 8.5/10.",01/15/25 08:09,HannahKathryn
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,Much more Almond / Marzipan foreword than I expected. I like it after it's been on the skin for 5ish hours but I can't get over the initial almond every time and so will probably not keep.,01/12/25 13:22,leonakitty
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This IS a TF Tobacco Vanille dupe but better, it doesn't have the odd metallic dried fruit note that I dislike in TF. Projection is amazing, I tried it on and had people a few feet in front of me comment on it.",01/11/25 11:22,Tiamw
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is a gorgeous scent with a warm and spicy, vanilla dry down. It creates a beautiful, warm and comforting scent bubble around you that lasts all day! I’m not keen on the opening, which I find quite harsh and punchy, but this does settle quite quickly. The dry down is everything! Perfect for a cold autumn or winters day.

This actually reminds me of BDK Rouge Smoking. It’s also relatively cheap and currently limited edition. If you like chai latte fragrances, this is an excellent buy! Get it while you can. I hope they bring it back in 2025!",01/10/25 23:12,CaroleAnne81
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Absolutely love this fragrance. The tumeric notes are very subtle, it's mostly a strong, spicy Tonka and vanilla scent. One of my most complimented. Layered with the Chelsea morning solid perfume, you've got the most sexy gourmand fragrance ever! Will mention, it is pretty strong and spicy so if you're not into smelling a little bit like a fireplace, you may not like this. But this is my winter signature scent!",01/09/25 19:31,ajwinchester
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I am by no means a fragrance expert, but as someone looking for decent vanilla scents, I’m in love with this spray. I stumbled across it while sampling at lush, and it was the only one that wasn’t too sickly. Since it is from lush, I personally don’t feel like it’s actually that complex of a scent, it doesn’t really change throughout the wear. But it’s very good for a vanilla and gentle spice.

I have actually gotten comments about smelling like vanilla while wearing it! It doesn’t last the longest over clothes, maybe 6H max, but UNDER clothes it still smells phenomenal even after a 12h active on-my-feet shift.

Love it for the cold months, it’s great for layering with the vanilla bourbon MixBar body mist. Currently my staple scent, but probably won’t be on the top for the rest of the year.

Overall like an 8/10 especially for a perfume that’s from a bath company rather than a “professional” perfume company.",01/07/25 12:27,vanillabeancrabqueen
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I am not smelling anything chai from this. I was very excited for this release and finally had the chance to test it out. To my disappointment this is a super harsh and woody fragrance, with hardly any vanilla or anything gourmand. It's straight up turmeric with other unknown spices thrown into the mix. Longevity was barely there, so this was easy to wash off.",01/06/25 12:01,lilymichelle01

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I actually hated this one, so glad I tested in-store and didn't blind-buy based off the glowing reviews on the official website.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Its very warm and spicy i luv it, i blind bought it and i didnt regret it at all. For me it smells kind of ginger and tumeric when you first smell it, but when it dries down it smells like a warm milky vanilla latte, and tbh i dont really think it resembles a chai latte. but kind of disapointed that the sillage of this perfume isnt good enough, it last long on your clothes but doesnt last really long on your skin.",01/01/25 07:18,ethrealistic

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Spicy. Sweet. Warm. Cosy. Comforting. It's perfect for colder weather and the Christmas season. Don't let the ""Latte"" in the name fool you though, I wouldn't describe it as creamy or lactonic as the word would suggest. But I love this scent. Good projection, lasting power and sillage. Have received compliments at work on this one.",12/30/24 03:40,Yy_mlb
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Spicy, sweet (but not too sweet) vanilla with some smoky amber. I also get a slightly lactonic impression of hazelnut? It's not all that creamy/milky for a 'latte' perfume, but it's very cosy. Strong and long-lasting (particularly on clothes), which does make it easy to overspray.",12/28/24 03:53,mickeyfallowdoe
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Okay I know that I love this, however I opened a new bottle I got from the lush seasonal sale and upon the first spray I seem to be getting a whiff of slime???

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Easily one of my favourite fragrances of all time. A gorgeous spicy vanilla scent with a touch of incense. Slightly smokey, but so beautiful on the skin.

Could be overwhelming if you’re used to more gentle vanilla scents.",12/26/24 11:44,strawberryplutonium
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"First spray is quite jarring, a very back-of-the-throat fragrance, not a huge fan on the initial spray. One of my favourites when it's been sitting for 20ish minutes. Gorgeous smoky vanilla, my personal everyday alternative to babycat",12/26/24 06:53,Emmaadey
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Incredible addictive.

This fragrance is lovely. Warm and cosy, like a hug from a maternal figure. Grounding and comforting.

I purchased a 30ml in store and had to get the 100ml when I realised this is a limited edition.

I simply cannot live without this scent, it’s sublime.

The projection is great too and lasts all day, I’ll be thinking about this scent for years to come.",12/25/24 13:22,rosieposie92
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"On me, I get vanilla and a LOT of woodsmoke, like full-on campfire. Absolutely no turmeric or coffee, though, so I don't really know where the name comes from. I actually don't feel comfortable wearing this to work because it smells so clearly of smoke -- not a 'clean' scent by any means, but absolutely fab for weekends and nights out. Really affordable, too (I paid £30 for my 30ml bottle last year).",12/24/24 12:21,isabella_andromeda
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"this is a beautiful scent. blind bought this based on some reviews and wow! on me, it pulls as a spicy, sweet vanilla, almost like a chai concentrate with ginger. my partner says it has an incense like smell to them on paper, but not so much on skin. it doesn’t radiate very far, but it is super long lasting and comforting. i want to purchase the larger bottle so bad its perfect. 10/10",12/22/24 22:06,deathgrass2000
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"was shown this in lush the other day and fell in love instantly. i smelled vanillary at first, which was a disappointing assault of jasmine on my nose. this was everything i expected that to be!! sweet, spicy, yummy gourmand goodness, perfectly smoky and warm. it brings to mind the experience of eating chai cookies fresh out of the oven, or a hug from someone just departed from a bakery on a cool winter evening. i'm quite surprised nobody has mentioned this as a dupe for van cleef & arpels bois doré. trying both on the same day, i was struck by the sheer similarity; both maintain a gentle balance between smoky-spicy and sweetness. truly two gorgeous gorgeous scents, but tumeric latte especially for the price point!!",12/21/24 16:12,nadalaforet
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"My nose is a mess after having COVID last August, and perfumes with natural ingredients seem to be the only fragrances that don't smell ""off."" I decided to give Lush fragrances a sniff, and I really enjoyed Tumeric Latte. There's a lovely incense (not listed) in the beginning that I wish stuck around longer, but overall, it smells like a better, more natural version of BDK Rouge Smoking. As it dries down, it becomes softer and simpler until you're left with a vanilla/amber skin scent. It lasted a solid six hours. Lovely perfume that isn't too sweet or gourmand.",12/20/24 11:47,singlehandedbeauty
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Literally the best thing I've smelled to date. My friend told me I 'smell like Christmas' when she first smelled it on me. Turmeric latte is a comforting cup of coffee paired with a massive piece of delicious gingerbread on a dark autumn evening as the leaves on the trees dance down to the ground. It's a little smoky, very sweet, delightfully warm -- perfect. It's the fragrance that has gotten me the most compliments and I deserved them.",12/18/24 15:22,stardognose
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is a weird one for me, I don't get any gourmand from this, on me it's straight up smoke and incense from the start. Kind of intense. After an hour or so, it's still smoky but less intense, like bonfire embers? No Chai, no Latte, no spices, not sweet, barely any vanilla at all, maybe a hint at the end. Mostly smoke. I'm a little bummed because I would have loved to smell what you all smell. Debating whether or not to return it, I kinda like a little smokiness with something else, but this is nothing but. Maybe I'll try to layer it with something else and see.",12/13/24 13:36,njbutterfly
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Wowwww, second winter wearing it and I'm in love all over again. It lasts ALLL day and stays on clothes for ages. Cozy, spicy, powdery luscious vanilla. The slightest milkiness, but not sickly sweet. A bohemian gourmand*~*~

Marzipan and Nag Champa 🥹",12/12/24 14:36,jdb_
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Many people here have described it as a chailatte, so when I blind bought it I imagined a rather vanilla, light, fluffy chailatte scent. But this one is much spicier and darker than I thought. It has a syrupy kind of sweetness and I can feel a hint of something lactonic in the background. It would have been perfect if it wasn't for the metallic scent that I get on my skin at first when I spray it. After a while it goes away though and after I first let it macerate for a couple of months the metallic smell got weaker, although it didn't go away completely.
The longevity is up to maybe five hours and the sillage is good enough for other people to feel it if you walk past them.",12/10/24 08:46,Melli_648
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,This smells just like the starbucks chai tea latte. Spicy and perfectly sweet. Might be the perfect gourmand scent for winter and fall.,12/07/24 21:45,kingnok
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"no idea where people are picking up the gourmand vibe in here because this scent definitely translates into straight up powder on my skin (especially on the dry down), which yes i absolutely love but just didn’t expect from the reviews.
i tried the turmeric latte body bar before buying the perfume and i can assure that it’s a pretty strong scent! the body bar alone can be smelled on my skin even the day after using it and i’m sure the perfume will perform well!
the spices are definitely noticeable in this so it’s not something to consider trying if you’re a fan of those sickly overpowering sweet gourmands ;)",12/06/24 07:07,s4rbb

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"i fell in love with this immediately. feels like a comforting, warm hug in the winter as you sip a cup of chai latte. it's my favourite fall perfume, worth a try if you're looking for a gourmand that's not sickenly sweet!",12/05/24 00:38,ylraesunsets
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"A photorealistic gourmand, perfect if you want to smell like the most delicious Chai Latte. This one and Sticky Dates are, so far, the most interesting fragrances from Lush.

Turmeric Latte smells like a photorealistic Chai Latte, full of yummy spices, cinnamon. It's very spicy, but not the pepper spicy kind, more like the yummy spices of gingerbread.

A true gourmand, it makes me hungry when I smell it, or it makes me crave something sweet or a Chai Latte. The notes that are listed are irrelevant, just as they are for many Lush fragrances. I guess they don't want others to know their recipe. The only listed note that is noticeable is vanilla. An apple note in this fragrance would've been chef's kiss. I recommend layering Turmeric Latte with an apple pie perfume. Small note to myself, this smells exactly like the Spiced Chai Latte from Renee Cafe, minus the baked apple taste (which was the best Chai Latte I've ever had in my life). It has depth, smells way more complex than 90% out of all the designer fragrances.",12/05/24 00:30,JuliaToothFairy

I genuinely cannot smell a difference, apart from in the drydown, I smell more of the turmeric note but it's slightly sour so more like a tamarind. Not a bad sour though. Rich, dark and slightly boozy. I sprayed it once in the morning on my wrist and could still smell it (not strongly) throughout the day. I get the spice and the woodiness throughout the day.",12/04/24 03:36,fragrantcey

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I really enjoy this perfume, though it makes me sneeze when I first put it on.

Its like a warm smoky cozy tonka hug.",11/27/24 04:04,pulmentidiei
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Omg....smoky gorgeous incense vanilla.
Pretty much a 1-1 dupe for Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille.
Sprayed it in the Lush store and thought it was very subtle but as the day wore on I noticed its presence with the intense smokey wafts all around me. It really comes alive once it warms on the skin.
It really is a masterful fragrance.
Cozy stunning powerful smoky vanilla.
Love it!!!

A beautiful, smokey vanilla that only becomes more complex as it dries down. Sweet, but with a darkness that stops it from being cloying or nauseating with wear. Definitely my signature cold-weather fragrance now.",11/19/24 22:57,kassn
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,I really don't get a latte style scent from this. I think when I wear this I small like a bonfire with a marshmallow toasting in it!

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"love love love this fragrance. i've been slowly trying to get into vanilla/gourmand fragrances and although i think the spice could be a bit intense for some, i think it complements the vanilla really well. there's a bit of creaminess in there as well. weirdly smells like thai tea to me? i see a lot of people compare it to tobacco vanille, but i personally much prefer turmeric latte - i don't get tobacco at all from this. lasts forever on my skin as well. huge fan!

not a safe blind buy for sure, but if you like gourmands go to ur local lush and try it when it comes back!!!

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"hmm, everyone keeps saying that it smells like a fresh chai latte but idk. Would probably only layer it with something vanilla heavy and sweet/creamy to add some spice.

It almost gives the texture of a Christmas tree trunk, I do love clove but the opening is just so strange and a little off-putting. On me that opening lasts longer than the vanilla phase which is unfortunate. This has little to no lasting power and the colour of the juice aside feels very watery?

Hopefully with time the vanilla with come out more...",10/07/24 19:44,Alex

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"smells like campfire, smoke, fragrant wood burning. i dont detect too much spice. definitely unisex, and not as sweet as i expected? i don't think i would even classify this as gourmand..? i like it though, but i wish it lasts longer. definitely a cooler weather/nighttime scent. i bought this because i loved the massage bar - but it was sadly way more creamy/sweet than the perfume. at first spray the smell makes my nasal cavity close up, literally like i'm breathing in smoke so i definitely can't overspray this one.",10/07/24 10:56,snackbot
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"So moderately spicy and sweet that it actually comes off a little boring. I would use this to layer. It's not bad, and you might like this if you're into uncomplicated scents. I do agree with the other commenters, do not blind buy. This reminds me of Eau Duelle (which is much more powdery and not as spicey. Not a dupe, just similar). This is earthy enough to not be mistaken as anything other than a Lush brand fragrance.",10/06/24 13:45,caulicake
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Not blind buy safe. This is not a gooey gourmand. This is somewhat like a woody-slightly sweet scent. Try to smell it in store, there's no chai vibes here, nothing lactonic. It is like...a vanilla candle? Disappointing tbh I think it would smell better on clothes than skin",10/03/24 14:53,cunt.dracula
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This one’s confusing. It smells good then bad, then good, then bad. When it smells good, it smells like tonka bean, when it smells bad, it smells like literal dog food, kibble. Do not blind buy this and test on skin.",10/03/24 04:36,Aquapinkmoon

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I really wanted to like this. It starts out with an earthy, smokey chai, with some vanilla in the background, but the dry down smelled more and more like liquorice on my skin. Maybe 20-30 minutes later it’s begins to smell like a nicer soft vanilla which I like just not willing to wait to get that vanilla note I like. Smells better on my girlfriend than on myself, but definitely a unisex scent",10/01/24 04:50,_lllwlll_
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Very spicy and a little bit pissy. More so than I thought it would be. Dry down is softer and vanillin like. I wound not wear this in its own I think, but definitely will be layering this with sweater vanilla scents to give them more punch. Very unisex in my opinion and might even be better on a man!",10/01/24 03:56,sambal93

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Ahh! Are you my signature fall scent, Turmeric Latte?!

This scent is just...everything. It's the cozy drink you order at your local café; it's the perfect fall candle you buy as soon as it hits September. It's an ode to comfort and soft, quiet nights with soft jazz and a book.

Sweet, just a touch smoky, just a little spicy. Nothing too strong. Less nuanced than I expected, but I love the scent so much that it's okay to be a bit linear

Sampled at the store and had all my friends say that I smelled like a candle (in a good way)

I never would've smelled this on my own - but the Lush associate recommended it! So pleasantly surprised",09/30/24 20:07,verymadz
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"If there are any Canadians who think this smells familiar but can’t quite place it, it smells exactly like the vanilla scented orbeez air fresheners in a little plastic tub they sold at Dollarama in the early 2010s (might still sell them actually)",09/29/24 06:09,Deeznuts01

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,Not a review but a comment. I haven’t tried this perfume but I know I don’t want to smell like tumeric. My tumeric pills smell horrible. Can’t knock it until I try it I guess.,08/22/24 15:30,BrittJ
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I do like the scent of this but on me it came off a little strong, and sort of invoked a memory of someone cooking something delicious in a cosy kitchen. Not a bad memory per se, but I wouldn't want to wear it all day unfortunately.",08/19/24 12:30,vidstrom
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,Discovering this while working at lush was the best thing I got out of the job. Very wintery scent but I wear it all year round because I like it so much. Spicy gourmand and vanilla excellence.,08/07/24 09:16,escuhporex
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,Hmmmm the turmeric latte massage bar is so good hmmmmmm,07/24/24 09:21,Ionlylikeblue
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is nice. It’s nice to see it when it’s on sale. It’s like a hug in a bottle. Like walking into a candle mom’s house around fall/winter time (iykyk). It sort of has an almost plastic undertone to it similar to vanillary, but it’s way better. It doesn’t seem to be a loud and intrusive smell, but I don’t see a bottle lasting me that long, tbh. I’d probably have to use a bit. It almost reminds me of serge lutens chergui, but softer and a little more feminine. I do think this is unisex, but leans more feminine.",07/16/24 03:21,sarakp999
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"One of my favourite perfumes ever, so whatever I'll write here might still not give it justice! But I'll try.

My husband said it smells like Christmas. I get tonka, caramely benzoin notes, and cloves. Absolutely ZERO tumeric. None. Chai latte would be a much better name, but even then, this is not milky enough.

It's very rich and creamy; I can also see where the comparison between this and rice pudding comes from. It's a gourmand perfume that does not copy all the other, pedestrian gorumands available on the market. It's definitely more of a winter scent, but, to my suprise, it works well in any weather. I live in a country that is hot all year round and I found it easy to wear even when it's 30 degrees outside. Some vanilla perfume can get boring after a while, but this is just wonderful. I can't get enough!

The projection and longevity is spectacular, particularly if you spray it on clothes. I wore it on a windy day and I kept getting these whiffs of deliciousness throughout the day.

Lastly, I agree that this is similar to Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford, although perhaps slightly less smokey (in a good way). Myrrh and Tonka by Jo Malone also comes to mind, but not so much in terms of how it smells: it is a similar ""vibe,"" or genre of perfume, particularly in the way it uses tonka. If you are into either of those, you should definitely try Tumeric Latte! Don't let the name fool you.",06/15/24 00:50,Frymbles
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I wore this to work one time for the first time and someone said it smelled mmm mmm good like rice puddin’!!! I wasn’t mad at it though. 🤷🏻♀️

When I smelled it in store for the first time it had that campfire Smokey element at first blast which is what I first loved about it and made me want to purchase it! However when I ordered my bottle online… that campfire smoke aspect was no where to be found. So I’m still on the hunt for a campfire burning wood scent. But this smells nice and it projects like a beast. Someone gon smell you chile that’s for sure lol.

It’s giving off chai latte vibes.

It’s giving a snickerdoodle cookie, with a glass of almond milk on the side vibes. It’s a spicy, mature gourmand.",06/12/24 18:27,Pheromone Princess
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I went from disliking this to loving it, to it being one of my most used fragrance. Originally I thought it smelled like very flat vanilla. Now it’s a warm and inviting, slightly spicy scent. Not suitable for the hottest summer days, but it’s still quiet versatile and enjoyable all year round.",04/17/24 20:41,liquidsword
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is a really interesting fragrance I like having in my collection. I like that this fragrance is authentic with its more raw form ingredients, it doesn’t get cloying due to this and it’s easy to wear even during the day despite it being and warm. I wore this for a big walk in the heat of the sun in summer and it didn’t make me feel sick or anything.

This is spicy like chai with a vanilla base which makes it yummy, however I personally don’t find this fragrance that sweet. Perfect autumn smell, really different and yummy. It for sure has that raw unrefined feeling to it which I appreciate.

At first whiff I definitely get the Tom ford Tobacco Vanille, however once you are familiar with both they are really quite different so wouldn’t say this would dupe tobacco Vanille. It’s a totally different vibe of perfume. TV is intense, night time, sexy. TL is yummy spicy, raw, soft, approachable.",04/11/24 17:22,perfectly_pink
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This brings me back to uni days when my flatmates used to make chai and the whole apartment used to smell. It's really sweet, it's got milkiness as well as spiciness. I can't say turmeric is the spice I feel the most, it's more like cardamom to me. I didn't have the best of luck with Lush perfumes so far, having not like Shade, Breath of God nor American Cream, but this one is really good.",04/10/24 23:08,ava96
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"The turmeric in this is the most powerful note. If you don't like food from other places in the world, you won't like this, it's pungent! It's absolutely perfect, spicy and smoky and just like having an almond milk chai latte, heavy on the chai. Yellow, root-y, slightly charred. Love spraying it in my hair, works really well with oils. Reminds me of steam coming from a pot in a spice market.",04/02/24 23:44,G0rebloom
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"There's a smokiness & bitterness to this that I can't tolerate.

Another reviewer said something along the lines of it not being a complete fragrance, there's something missing to round it off, & I agree.

It's trying to be gourmand but it's just not sweet enough! Perhaps layering it with something sweet would do it for you. I've read some reviews where people have layered it with Vanillary (also by Lush). Maybe give that a go ¯⁠⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

There is something about it that draws me in & messes with my head! Overall however, it lacks the gourmand-esque vibe that I was hoping it would give.

It's a NO from me!",03/16/24 05:05,FallenLeaf
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"these perfumes are so comforting! it is my latest blind buy and i have to say, i’m love. it’s so warm and addictive! if you expect lactonic vibes, i don’t feel it to be honest. it’s more sweet warm spices without milk. it gives me a TF tobacco vanille impression. perfect for colder weather.",03/02/24 14:59,jasmine27
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Very very very similar in dry down as TF Tobacco Vanille.
I worked in Lush for a couple of years and have a bottle of TL at home.
One of my male friends visited me and was wearing Tobacco Vanille and it kept reminding me of something.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This is a rollercoaster of a perfume to me. Very intense and overwhelming (but in a good way) at first, rich smokey and spicy scent, but the drydown is soft, but gets rather tacky couple hours down the line.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"honestly, to me this reads quite powerdy, almost like a fresh diaper. I didn't like that aspect of it at all.

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"very smoky, more than expected from a perfume called turmeric latte, i thought there would be hints of coffee or cream, either way its a lovely sent for winter and autumn, I like to layer it with other vanilla or amber scents, I imagine it would work nicely with an almond smell also.",01/05/24 07:19,aleksandrej
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"A lovely, heavy, sweet winter perfume. It felt so comforting and familiar when I smelled it in store. It's a little more dark and sultry than a typical sweet vanilla. Not super smoky, but a deep spiced vanilla. It leans more honeyed than sugary. I don't get turmeric, but there is some anise, cinnamon, and coumarin in it.

Trumeric Latte fills a niche in my fragrance wardrobe that saves me from buying other high-end perfumes. It isn't a dupe, but it reminds me of the following that have been on my wishlist: YSL Babycat, TF Tobacco Vanille, Acqua di Parma Mandorlo de Sicilia.

Unfortunately, the packaging doesn't match the quality. The metal cap scrapes against the sprayer and makes a terrible sound and it has already started to leak.",01/03/24 06:59,figgypudding

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"This a nice perfume, but it's not what I thought it would be based on influencer hype. The top notes are strong and almost dirty/dusty. The vanilla then starts to shine through and it smells a lot like Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford.
If you already have TV, I don't think you need this in your collection but it would make for a good dupe/substitute.
It's got a spicy, dark vanilla vibe that is cozy and warm.",12/18/23 15:28,Nocciola23
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I agree with reviews saying it smells similar to 'By the Fireplace', it is SMOKY. There is vanilla and tonka yes, but it's more of a unisex type, it's not sweet at all nor creamy. It doesn't smell like a chai latte at all. So if you see this and hope it's a gourmand like I did, sadly it's not. This is coming from someone when trying on skin gourmand/vanilla notes tend to be elevated usually. I'm shocked it was the other way around for this one. Lush is really unpredictable.

The weird thing is, when I smelled it from the bottle I did get the vanilla in a sophisticated way and barely any smokyness, but somehow when I sprayed it on myself it was SUPER spicy/smokey, amber-y and kinda bitter (?). Like it reminded me of the bitterness of taking medicine. The vanilla is kinda there still but just gets buried underneath all the smoky heaviness for me, which is a shame. I tried at least.",12/18/23 09:32,wenshere

Maybe I got a bad batch? The earthy notes and clove was far too intense, it felt like I was smelling turmeric mixed with dirt. For the first few hours I was desperately trying to wipe it off. However, it's been approximately 8 hours since I sprayed it on and now it's a really nice, warm, vanilla scent that smells scrumptious. However I don't think the initial few hours of nausea is worth the vanilla, nothing special. A+ for longevity though!",12/09/23 02:02,ringwald-haze

Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,Tumeric Latte is mostly sweet tonka and warm spices to my nose. I sprayed this once in the Lush store and got several complements on how I smelt when I was walking around the mall. This is quite heavy so I would only wear this in cold weather. Its more unisex than I typically go for with heavier scents but I love it regardless.,12/08/23 18:15,wintersnow7
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"Lol I came to say that it smells like burnt marshmallows over a smoky firepit and I can see that quite a few people feel the same! I'm not sure if this one leans too medicinal on me or not. I think I might like it, but maybe not enough to actually crave wearing it when I could be wearing other warm and sweet LUSH perfumes.

If like me you wanted to love Replica By the Fireplace but found it sickly, too smoky and too vanillic, then Turmeric Latte might be a good one to try! They don't smell the same at all but they both smell like sweet bonfires!",12/08/23 05:45,Skinscents4Fusspots
Turmeric Latte Perfume Lush,"I believe I saw a review here saying that this smells like a marshmallow burnt in a campfire, and that’s spot on to me! I was expecting something sweet and creamy, but to me this is definitely very spicy, and smokey first and foremost. There’s for sure sweetness, but I don’t think this is an overly sweet fragrance.
Not what I was expecting, but I actually really, really like! The perfect cozy, warm scent.",12/07/23 06:16,tilly222
25:43 Lush,"I loved this perfume from the first sniff. I was in lush store buying shower gels and sniffing my way around the store when the sales person asked me what perfume I was wearing. I'm pretty sure I stupidly applied lemongrass and vanilla essential oils directly to my skin. She pulled me over to the perfume display and sprayed this for me. I went through two bottles and multiple travel sprays during the time that it came as in production. I worked at a department store at the time and I smelled different to most people working on the sales floor. Getting complimented that you just smell good all the time and not overly perfumey is the best. It was earthy, sweet and fresh all at the same time. I haven't found anything that smells like it since.",07/28/24 14:18,OlfactoryAmbiance
25:43 Lush,"A wonderful, fresh perfume.

Everything comes together quite well in this perfume. You'd expect the litsea, lime and lemongrass to overwhelm this perfume, but they meld in so well with the tonic that they don't stand out as top notes, but settle in to create a deep ambery, silky, and somewhat sharp scent. While this would be great in the summer due to its freshness, the caramel aspect makes it a great evening or even autumnal scent.

You'd love this if you're already a fan of Lush's Turmeric Latte, Love, or Cardamom Coffee.

A wonderful scent I'd love to see come back, but I'm glad I still own.",03/14/24 11:18,bloomlikewild

25:43 Lush,"I'm indifferent about 25:43. It's definitely citrusy and very sweet. I'm not a big fan of in-your-face citrus fragrances, however, I adore sweet gourmands. This is both. With each spray, you get b#*!h slapped with lemon & lime, which makes me think of kitchen cleaner, ugh. But, directly after the citrus assault, you're caressed with creamy sweetness. This isn't a fragrance I would ever wear, but I do enjoy smelling it.",08/23/18 13:20,N8vDoll
25:43 Lush,"I adore this perfume. One spray in the morning and it lasts me right up till bedtime. I love the zesty citrus top note but love how it develops into a sweet caramel butterscotch scent with a touch of powder and just a hint of citrus like a kiss remembered. So many people have asked me what it is that I'm wearing as they love the smell. My fave perfume of all time has to be Yves Rocher Rose Ispahan (special occasions only - unfortunately down to my last few drops and can only find a couple of bottles of EDT which is nowhere near as good as the Parfum), but this has got to be my second fave so far.",04/15/15 14:39,rachel.feetham
25:43 Lush,"This perfume captured my fancy at the LUSH boutique in Abu Dhabi in 2012. The top note is definitely lime and lemongrass with a bit of hay. When it is first sprayed, the smell is a bit overwhelming so go easy on it if you are going to be in tight quarters quickly. Once the top notes mellow out, the base notes with caramel, tonka, vanilla come out to play and on my skin, the result is a very nice gourmand fragrance that makes others within my personal bubble say, ""Something smells amazing. Is that you?"" This is simple, yet classy and light scent for the type of girl or perhaps guy that likes a fresh, citrusy beginning with a warm & decadent end. Definitely a unique fragrance that I would recommend to those that are looking for something delightfully innocent.",02/08/15 15:43,thatgirlmeghan
25:43 Lush,"I got this in one of my first swaps and tried it today.

25:43 Lush,"I didn't know how much I disliked lemongrass until I smelled 25:43.

When I first put it on, the lemongrass was *so* overwhelming. It took about an hour for it to fade into the background. I really wanted it fade completely away, but it didn't.

Being a gourmand lover, the caramel and vanilla dry down was very nice and warm. It saved this from being a scrubber. I can see how people would describe this as a ""zesty cheesecake.""

If you can hang on for about an hour after first spray, it does become something other than lemongrass. That I can promise.",08/28/13 14:19,GlobalGirlyGirl

25:43 Lush,"25:43 IS an interesting one. Actually quite the little masterpiece for something created in less than a half hour.
Delicious, candied, spiced, lemon/lime. A scent that is both fresh and warm.

As one review states, this is almost like two separate fragrances in one. Opening with the ever so zesty and mouth watering lemon/lime sharpness of a frozen margarita, 'summer holiday"", but then drying down with warm caramely/vanilla spices, and just a hint of lingering citrus,""winter holiday"".

25:43 is a gender bender with a refreshing and unique duo personality. But as unusual as it may be, also possesses a clean, casual elegance.

I could definitely see this as a wedding fragrance for the right individual.",07/02/13 00:40,sweetmagnolia
25:43 Lush,"Holy crap!! I just had a epiphany about this fragrance. My original review is underneath, but I just wanted to add that this smells EXACTLY (from beginning to end), like fruity zebra-stripe bubble gum that was sold in the U.S. throughout the 80's and 90's. I can't believe it.

...

I appreciate 25:43 for two reasons.

The first is that it evolves big time, so I don't have to wonder whether it is my imagination that the fragrance has changed completely on my skin. Often, but not always, I feel that a scent is losing its character as it develops instead of transitioning through distinct and beautiful phases. Compositionally unbalanced or not, 25:43 expresses itself unapologetically from start to finish, and never leaves me thinking my imagination is to blame for the appearance of its unique faces.

The second reason is that it smells pretty good! It is definitely weird (after discreetly spraying it on my arms and then getting into a car with my boyfriend's relatives, they remarked that something smelled ""WEIRD, like cloves and tobacco or something... What IS that?!""
However, to my nose, it smells good because it smells weird. Beauty and strangeness do not necessarily go hand in hand, and one absolutely does not imply the other. However, on my skin, the beauty and the strangeness work out. They just do. It's weird though. No doubt.

Here's what it smells like to me:
Fresh and realistic lime oil/lemon grass citrus blast
changing to:
sweet cinnamon bubble gum flavored mouthwash
changing to:
powdery Cow Tail brand caramels with the vanilla cream center (with all of this ""changing to"" stuff, I feel like this fragrance was based on the I-Ching),
and finally tonka bean with a trace of Nag Champa incense.

Longevity and projection are only slightly above average, which I feel in this case is a good thing, because this is more of a carnival ride type experience than something you would want people to associate with you. Unless, of course, you are a carnival ride of a person.

...and no, I do not get any cloves.

The End!

25:43 Lush,"What kind of woman lets her husband's father decide what she smells like at her own wedding?

Will the father be featuring heavily during wedding night/ honeymoon, I wonder?

And indeed, what kind of perfumeur brags about how quick it was to compose a perfectly mediocre (or perhaps ""inept"", as some say) fragrance?

Having read the name, I was expecting to read some hulabaloo about the magic of the 25th hour.
But no. It's much worse.

I'm not usually fussed about how my scents are packaged/ sold /marketed, but this tale is creepy and off-putting enough to make me stay away from this purely on principle.",06/27/13 13:41,liinu01
25:43 Lush,"Lush founder and autodidact perfumer Mark Constantine tends to wield citrus oils with a heavy hand, so I braced myself upon reading the ingredients list for Lush 25:43, near the top of which are lemongrass oil and Persian lime oil. The first two ingredients are alcohol and tonka absolute, and I am happy to be able to report that the sweet tonka wins out in the battle of the notes. Usually the lemongrass and lime oils used in Lush creations are at nose-burningly acidic concentrations, but here they have been moderated to some extent by the tonka bean. Which is not, however, to say that they are not still strong!

Apparently this perfume was composed in twenty-five minutes and forty-three seconds, which is probably twenty minutes longer than most Tweet-esque perfumes being pumped out by the multilaunchers these days. All in all, I'd say that this creation is not bad for a half hour's work. I find it to be more of an event perfume than something which I'd choose to wear in a regular rotation, so I won't be acquiring a bottle, but it was nice to imagine what the wedding of Simon, Mark Constantine's son, must have been like. I suspect that there were plenty of drugs on hand. Perhaps they whipped up some acid-laced Koolaid punch?",06/07/13 14:01,sherapop
25:43 Lush,"This fragrance starts out promisingly enough, with lime and lemongrass so persistent that you'll be lulled into believing you might have found a cologne that will last for more than a hour. Then there's a really inept transition to a horrible caramel note. The two co-exist for a time - which is a real stink.

Strong and nasty stuff.

Question: What kind of a perfumer brags about the short amount of time it took him to throw together a fragrance?

Answer: One who is being way too clever for his own good.",05/31/13 10:33,wesleyhclark
25:43 Lush,"Thanx Allinug for a sample. This one start very citrus and lemongrass-fresh in a very nice way. Then the Caramel hits my nose and it turns syrup'ish. To me its very caramelsweet all through the pyramid. I'm not a fan of sweet or sugary scents - so this one is not for me.

Tack Alling för provet. Denna startar med citrus och citrongräs-fräsch på ett superfint sätt. Sen smäller karamellen till och alltsammans blir sirapslikt. För mig är den karamellsöt rakt igenom hela pyramiden. Jag är ingen fan av sockriga eller söta dofter, så denna är inte för mig.",04/09/13 07:19,Mooniq
25:43 Lush,Love this! Starts off with a burst of lime. I really wish the lemongrass in the opening would last longer. Later it mellows out into this delicious caramel and cinnamon. The dry down reminds me of L by Lolita Lempicka. Will be buying a full bottle of this.,03/26/13 20:35,ta2kitty
25:43 Lush,"I love this scent! I smell Lime and Tonka Abs at first with a little bit of Ylang Ylang. It's not strong to me but it is very addicting, I find myself smelling my shirt several times after I spray it on. Reminds me of Coconut Lime and sun bathing in Hawaii.. One spray is all I use. One negative is that I find it does not last more than 2 hours.. I have tried almost all Lush's perfumes and I think I have found my favorite though!!",03/03/13 19:30,gertrudesjoy
25:43 Lush,"This is a unique scent.

The citrus is short lived. It's all day strong tonka bean and vanilla add a hint of caramel. Kind of cinnamon/cardamom like.

Not too heavy of a fragrance. But too tonka spice for me!

25:43 Lush,"This is a strange but sort of fun fragrance. Initially it is very citrusy with the lemongrass standing out, but within 10 minutes the citrus notes are nearly gone and it turns into a sweet syrupy tonka bean and vanilla scent. It seriously reminds me of the cinnamon buns you buy at the mall with the slightly lemony frosting (cinzeo I think) which is nice. Unfortunately following the hour or two of ""cinnamon bun"" goodness it becomes cloyingly sweet caramel. Overall this is a fun cheap and cheerful scent if you like gourmands, but it is very unbalanced and not particularly well blended. Maybe if Mark Constantine had spent more than 25 minutes making it, it would have been better, oh well.",01/17/13 16:31,silagelover
25:43 Lush,"At first it starts off with a blast of lemongrass and lime.... very strong! But only minutes later it fades away and a vanillacaramel note along with the tonka appears, sooo delicious!! Mmmmm, a unique lovely scent with a powdery hint.... reminds me a little bit of a cake but at the same time very fresh. One of my favorite from Lush along with Karma, Love, Ginger and Orange blossom... by the way... I love most everything from Lush :))

Till en början doftar den citrongräs och lime.... mycket starkt! Vaniljtoner och karamelltoner finns dock med hela tiden i bakgrunden, sååå ljuvlig. När de första skarpa tonerna har lagt sig (ganska omgående) tar vaniljkaramellaktiga och tonka bean över och 25:43 doftar ljuvligt!!!! Mmmmm, en unik underbar doft med en aningen pudrig känsla... påminner lite grann om en bakelse, men samtidigt fräsch. En av mina favoriter från Lush, tillsammans med Karma, Love, Ginger och Orange blossom... för övrigt äääälskar jag det mesta från Lush.",01/04/13 03:37,TaniaClamp

25:43 Lush,"Finally! I have been waiting for this to be added to the database for so long and now I'm very excited to review it! The fragrance starts off with a blast of lemongrass and lime. If you love lemongrass, you'll find this intoxicating. It's very fresh and summery. Oh but wait... there's more... As the lime and lemongrass fade, the tonka and vanilla come out with a hint of caramel. The drydown is like a creamy, sweet cheesecake, with a sprinkle of powder. It's thick, delicious, and so unusual. The lemongrass with a hint of citrus never really leaves, but remains in the background even through the drydown. From the topnotes, it would seem this perfume is more suited to summer, however the drydown is rich, thick, powdery, sweet, and to me could be more suited to Fall. One more thing I appreciate about this is that it reminds me of my beloved Avoshower limited edition shower gel. I am clinging to the last ounces of this with my life but the perfume helps fill that hole! Overall, beautiful, unique, lovely perfume. Sillage and longevity average to above average.

It’s perfect for Christmas, it smells like freshly cut oranges and warm spices. The scent is really strong too, one spray will linger for hours and it’s a scent you don’t really go nose blind to. I can imagine this isn’t to everyone’s taste as it does smell a bit like pumpkin spice but I personally love it and wish it was available for purchase outside the advent calendar.",10/11/24 15:54,robertogibson

Sticky Dates Lush,"Every time I tried this in the shop, I found it absolutely disgusting. I am a huge fan of ragingly sweet scents, like Lush's Snow fairy, and other gourmand foody and diabetes inducing smells, but I found this to be horribly rancid. It smells grossly synthetic and foul, it doesnt smell sweet or delicious at all. It smells like the ingredients have gone bad.

I was once gifted a ""sweet smelling"" lip balm many years ago, but I hated the smell of it, and to me it smelled like it went bad, so I never wore it. After I tried this scent for the first time, I realised it reminded me of exactly that lip balm.

I really wanted to like this scent, as on paper it's something that should be right up my alley, but it unfortunately isn't and probably never will be.",11/10/25 12:47,Pekmez

Sticky Dates Lush,"""YO DAWG!! I heard you like sugar!!
So guess what!?!?!?
We put some sugar inside your sugar...put some MORE sugar on top of your sugar....and added some MORE SUGAR!!!""

This is disgusting.
It is 90% Ethyl Maltol.
This smells like the Ethyl Maltol abomination I made when I first started making my own perfumes.
It was completely unwearable...just like this disgusting mess.
For the first 2 hours it's an oppressive cloud of Ethyl Maltol that chokes the life out of you. Then at hour 3 you start to get nuances of something else in the background...what it is, I couldn't tell you.
I can only pick up sugar sugar and SUGAR.
I cannot understand how anyone can wear this...and I wish I hadn't asked for this garbage for my birthday.
I would return it if I...actually...I'm going to return this.
There is no way in Gods green earth I'm wearing this...

UPDATE:
You gotta be kidding me....at hour 4.5 it dries down to ""ESCAPADE GOURMANDE""!!!!!

I don't think it's necessary redundant to have both if you're a detail oriented freak like me, but I don't think it really matters when smelled from afar.

One one hand I really want to love this, as to me it smells like Bailey's liquor in the opening and then as a toffee liqueur for the rest of the wear. However, while I do like it - on me, so to speak, I feel like it's a jump that never lands
Something that is just a taad too...waxxy? weak? not sure.

I think I would prefer this if they leaned into the alcohol notes, I think that amped up liqueur - caramelised vibe would really brighten it up.

It's nice, but it simply lacks the wow factor or anything that would signal to my brain that this fragrance is ""my own"", even though typically I do enjoy foody gourmands.

I think I would prefer this as a candle. Who knows, I might change my mind in a couple of months when winter bears it's fangs properly, but for now this is just ""nice"", and not anything that I feel I must immediately get.",10/06/25 05:35,Heliotrope72

Sticky Dates Lush,i love the sticky dates scent but the spray just isn’t rich enough for me. not the scent’s fault at all it’s delicious but it’s a pretty superficial brown sugar and dates gourmand without anything to ground or deepen it. it’s like a little richer than a b&bw scent when i’m looking for some more substantial base notes. completely my fault for wrongly assessing my own wishes the scent is delicious though if that’s what you’re looking for,09/24/25 10:27,disgraced
Sticky Dates Lush,"This truly is the most powerful body spray I have ever encountered. I've had mine since the community release with the brown label - maybe 2023? - and it's still insane. The projection on this one is enormous and it lasts for days and days on clothes, I easily get a full 12-15 hours out of it on skin alone with no lotion to help it stick.

It's like burnt brown sugar (in the best way possible) with the most luxurious vanilla extract and thick gooey caramel. I don't love the lotion so much, on me it pulls more fruity, but the body spray and body wash are absolutely worth every bit of hype they get. I love this in autumn and winter, though I do find it's good in the summer as long as you don't go too crazy with it.

I find this layers particularly well with coconutty scents - Kayali Utopia Vanilla Coco is excellent with it as is Le Monde Gourmand Lait de Coco. I also like it with Cheirosa 71 or layered with Vanilla 28 to amp up the vanilla even more, but it's honestly not necessary to layer this one if you don't want to given its comically nuclear performance.

Sticky Dates Lush,"Textbook example of ""sickly sweet to the point of throwing up"". I enjoy gourmands, but this one is unbearable. It's so strong and sweet, it genuinely feels like someone made a mistake and added far too much of sickly artificial caramel to the mix. If you use this spray, you won't be able to smell literally anything else around you for days. Had to return it before I suffocated to death. Strangely enough, I also have SD body lotion and it's brilliant. Not so heavy and offensive, it's balanced and cozy.",09/02/25 10:24,CrescentWitch
Sticky Dates Lush,"To me this is a very intriguing scent.

I finally bought it after having tried it many times, and comparing it with other Lush fragrances as they developed in my skin at the same time. In my experience a lot of Lush fragrances tend to dry down to very similar notes, but this one works a little differently.

What FASCINATES me about it is that what on a first impression seems like a fun & teen-like gourmand caramel, on further inspection reveals itself to have a hard, burnt, bitter, masculine, woody structure.

The dry down is interesting because it goes from feminine to masculine, in my opinion. Around 3 hours after the first spraying, the caramel loses intensity/freshness and the sandalwood becomes the protagonist, but it's quite synthetic, so it smells a tiny bit like cheap incense or male deodorant.

Sure, you can smell the molasses and some toffee, but what it reeeeeally brings you to is: ""I was baking flan today for a party and I accidentally burnt the caramel until it became very dark"", but you're NOT the person baking, you're at home, you had lit a sandalwood incense in the living room, and you're just finding out something is burning as you enter the kitchen. The burnt caramel smell spreads and mixes with sandalwood incense background.

That's my most accurate description of what it smells like to me.

I would not recommend spraying too much, to me it has the potential of becoming nauseating and vulgar when in overdose. Works better as a scent that one feels only when close to the skin. But it's not for everyone. Very weird perfume. I do like it though.

Also, since it's made from essential oils, I suppose this will change on the bottle as months go by as well... We'll see.",08/30/25 08:52,pomd
Sticky Dates Lush,"Honestly, the body spray really dissapointed me. Maybe it wouldn’t had let me down if I didn’t use the shower gel before (of which I adored).

At first it smells far too smoky, almost burnt, which completely threw me off. After it settles on the skin it turns into a sweeter caramel scent, which is nicer, but still not what I expected. Sadly no sweet, rich date note at all… Eventhough that’s the whole point?

Bonus points for the projection and longevity, you can get really far with 1-2 sprays.",08/30/25 08:16,erikssonines

Sticky Dates Lush,Layer with LTGTR and watch the compliments roll in!,08/16/25 15:41,yunapie
Sticky Dates Lush,"first, i loved it. then, now after wearing it all day, i threw my clothes in the hamper and showered it off. there is to much ""honey"" smell, which translates to, this smells like pee. or a diaper. GROSS. i am returning it! I'm going back to BumBum cream!",08/16/25 07:38,sandsea
Sticky Dates Lush,"A yummy caramel scent, what’s not to like? Much prefer this over LTGTR.",08/14/25 11:54,vanillacandyperfumelover
Sticky Dates Lush,sorry but smells like vanilla incense sticks :(,08/12/25 03:24,sensesual
Sticky Dates Lush,"Buy this if you want to smell like a delicious caramel drizzled cookie for life. This scent lasts ALL DAY AND NIGHT, if you fall asleep before showering guess what? It’s still going to be lingering onto you lol. 40 for a body spray… questionable, but when you purchase you will truly understand. Lasts better than 98% of my perfumes. Perfect for a cozy day/night in winter and fall, love it! BUT truly only for gourmand girlies, if you dont love smelling like sweet baked goods it WILL be nauseating. DONT WEAR IN SUMMER WAY TOO WARM SMELLING",08/02/25 05:09,onomatopoeia leah
Sticky Dates Lush,"So warm and cozy... I smelled it at the mall and bought it expeditiously. It lasts all day on me and a little goes a long way! I don't get why it's called sticky dates when there's no date note, but I won't sweat it.",08/01/25 21:11,w_isteria
Sticky Dates Lush,"I hate that we seem to be in an era of aggression when it comes to gourmands. This would be so nice if a) it wasn’t quite so concentrated, and b) the spray bottle didn’t absolutely douse you in the stuff (or look like that). That said, this also has a really strong treacle / molasses note on my skin that isn’t entirely pleasant. I only wore this once or twice (both times out clubbing as that’s the only time something like this felt appropriate), and I had to give it away as it just overwhelmed the senses.",07/31/25 02:32,Verity123
Sticky Dates Lush,smelling this makes me hungry it’s so delicious,07/27/25 16:27,myadbest
Sticky Dates Lush,So sticky date-y but doesn’t last long on me unfortunately.,07/26/25 11:37,cheesecakecat
Sticky Dates Lush,"Dries down to maple syrup. It’s a straight forward burnt/smoked caramel. Better than Let The Good Times Roll, which smells strange to me (I don’t get popcorn at all)",07/25/25 15:35,Alaida
Sticky Dates Lush,"The most delicious sticky toffee pudding with custard, it’s photorealistic. Bakeries and restaurants should spray this into the street to get customers.",07/23/25 17:22,Rebecca_deWinter
Sticky Dates Lush,it sweet,07/21/25 20:34,swagcookiej
Sticky Dates Lush,"Sprayed once on my wrist and once on my hair and people around me can still smell it 10 hours later. This is definitely to be sprayed sparingly or you’ll suffocate. Gorgeously gourmand and sweet, with the benzoin adding depth and complexity.",07/20/25 04:24,EngineNo9
Sticky Dates Lush,Unbearable sweet nuke. Quite realistic but completely asphyxiating,07/18/25 15:20,junegl00m
Sticky Dates Lush,"I LOVE this fragrance, however I’m not sure if it’s the bottle I bought or what, but I found that it was not long lasting at ALL. Very different to my other Lush body sprays. It feels like I can’t even smell it anymore the moment I walk out of my bedroom. Hoping my bottle was just a fluke, because I’m a huge fan of caramel scents and this one hits the spot.",07/17/25 12:54,mossybee
Sticky Dates Lush,"i made an account JUST to review this because holy moly this shit smells amazing. i had bought sol de janeiro cheirosa 71 and was disappointed- sticky dates is like a way better version. it doesn't have the weird salty piss smell (i think it was supposed to smell like popcorn) that cheirosa 71 had on me, it's much sweeter, yummier, non-headache inducing and i think more feminine, dare i say cuter and sexier. it also smells good on a hot day, which i found that cheirosa 71 didn't. not trying to be a hater because the 71 smells good in the bottle but just not on me, so if you wanted to love it but couldn't and are looking for similar flavours i recommend trying sticky dates instead!! u can finally smell like the pancakes and toffee and heaven of your dreams :P i want to eat myself
lowkey expensive for such a small bottle though and the design is kinda quirky",07/06/25 10:17,cemetarygraveman
Sticky Dates Lush,"I will never not want to smell edible. So I saw the picture and I was sold. I'm so glad I blind bought this. Its scent combines predominant caramel notes with very realistic dates. It's creamy, nutty and sweet -a well rounded gourmand. Whenever I want to buy something pricy, I tell my husband it's ""therapy"" or ""a work of art"". This fragance is both.",07/04/25 12:19,AntoFioren
Sticky Dates Lush,"This is one of the best gourmand body mists on the market. The scent is incredibly sweet and delectable, with decadent caramel and a hidden liquor note that makes it stand out. The performance is truly EDP tier, sooo much better than any VS or BBW spray out there. If you wanna smell like a sexy dessert, if you want to make people wanna take a bite out of you… go get yourself a Sticky Dates body mist!",07/04/25 03:31,cassilisil
Sticky Dates Lush,"it's literally sticky, the sexy version of let the good times roll from lush. it's a bit darker, the caramel is deeper, and overall it feels ambery, but on my skin it smells sweet, literally like a photorealistic butterscotch coffee. i was between this and cheroisa 71, but cheroisa 71 is literally a mall girl perfume, while sticky dates is way more mature than ltgtr and cheroisa 71. almost no popcorn, no cookies either, just a rich caramelized coffee, slightly burnt, paired with a butterscotch pie in a cozy setting. my husband tried to eat me the moment he smelled it. highly recommend.",07/03/25 16:54,perritoparchecurita
Sticky Dates Lush,"I really tried liking this, I just ended up using it as a room spray. Way too sweet, synthetic, screechy and it reminds me of some sort of medicine. I wouldn’t mind smelling it in the air, but not on myself.",07/03/25 12:12,burnbaby
Sticky Dates Lush,"Looooove sticky dates! The first spray is very very very strong but it dries down beautifully. Lasts ages on my clothes. Bought it about a month ago now, so I’ve only had it during colder weather. I think it’s an all year round scent tho! It’s $50 AUD for 200ml which I thought was a little expensive at first but now I think it’s good value for money bc of how long it lasts",06/29/25 01:29,niki222
Sticky Dates Lush,"Initially, I LOVED this spray - I wore it for a couple of months in autumn and winter and couldn’t get enough of it. It smelt exactly like my mum’s sticky toffee pudding. However, I can’t stand it anymore (I am not sure whether this is due to personal preference changing or the formula maturing.) I honestly regret buying the full size as I can’t wear it without feeling ill and I still have over half a bottle. Something in the background of this scent smells a bit like urine. Other than that, it is so overpoweringly sweet and chemical-y, very synthetic smelling to me now, which I didn’t get before.",06/26/25 19:35,meadowcryptid
Sticky Dates Lush,"this body spray is one of my favorites. it is super strong and smells very yummy,the notes are accurate and its sweet as fuck. smells like unicorns and rainbows!!!!!! perfect if you love gourmand scents plus it lasts a long time. one or two pumps from this and im literally nose blinded it is highkey rlly strong. its perf for winter and fall,but im going to use it this summer too bc its so good i wanna drink it.",06/25/25 09:52,iloveaotandhxh
Sticky Dates Lush,"overwhelming, sticky, very sweet. The dry down is more bearable. I got it for my birthday and I love my sister so I wear it sometimes, but the first blast is a battle",06/25/25 06:10,erasmierdziela
Sticky Dates Lush,Whenever my girlfriend wears this I want to eat her up.,06/21/25 00:58,Moxx
Sticky Dates Lush,"fresh dates but amplified. i literally gasped in the store when i first smelled this, it is truly unique and they somehow managed to exactly pinpoint the scent of dates dipped in caramel.

i honestly would buy a whole bottle of this and im not a huge gourmand fan",06/20/25 14:34,maraviere
Sticky Dates Lush,lush scents have this specific smell. nauseating,06/18/25 19:22,itchyratballs
Sticky Dates Lush,"I was once wearing this on a train - I'd spritzed it on in the morning; this was around lunchtime. Someone walked into the carriage and exclaimed ""this train smells like cake!""

I adore gourmand perfumes, always have. I adore Sticky Dates, but it's my absolute upper limit.

It smells photorealistic. You know that sticky toffee pudding you order in the pub after Sunday lunch despite your better judgement? It smells like that. Thick, buttery, dollops of hot creamy custard all over it, toffee sauce mixing in. Exactly that. Maybe a dash of rum in there.

To me, it is the ultimate gourmand. Literally foodie. I've had mixed reactions - some people love it, other people have recoiled from the burnt caramel smell. A male friend of mine adored it to a point he asked me not to wear it around him! Interestingly he also picked up coconut notes, which I can kind of get.

It's not a safe blind buy. I mean, I adore smelling like what my best friend calls ""a slutty cookie"", and this absolutely fulfils the brief. You're sweet, oozy, plump with fruit, slathered in custard. Sophisticated it ain't, and not everyone wants to smell like pudding. I do though!",06/17/25 04:43,hallandoatmilk
Sticky Dates Lush,"Sugary sweet caramel vanilla ! As a lover of sweet gourmand scents I love this so much !!! I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't like very sweet scents , as it is slightly cloying but I personally like it very much . Don't blind buy !",06/14/25 21:04,ririruru
Sticky Dates Lush,"despite how popular sticky dates is i dont think ive ever smelled something like this before on anyone or anywhere. i went to my local lush to smell it and it was love at first smell. i have never eaten / smelt a date before but sticky dates to me smelt like a strong coffee with caramel syrup, then it progresses to a buttery toffee popcorn and the drys down to warm, creamy vanilla - with a perfect amount of sweetness to me. but when i bought a new bottle it was way more sweeter (almost sickly sweet if i spray more than once) maybe after a few months the sweetness will mellow out. people around me who smell it on me describe it as “vanillary”. i bought this in the summer time but i think it would be more enjoyable in colder weather.
although its a body spray it lasts so long and smells so strong even after 6 hours! im excited to buy more scents from lush.",06/14/25 12:48,csyzastar
Sticky Dates Lush,"lush body sprays always seem to have a terrible opening, but then an excellent dry down. as a lot of other commenters stated, at the first initial spray, you get a really gross burnt caramel smell, mixed with plastic, but the dry down smells similarly to the soap; like a really decadent dessert dripping in a rich caramel sauce. i do prefer the scent of the lotion/body wash, but overall, it's definitely a nice fall fragrance if you can get over the opening!",06/11/25 15:55,milklattes
Sticky Dates Lush,My best friend wears this and it sticks on their skin even after a shower. Insane. Like actual fresh caramel. So strong at first but sits beautifully on skin.,06/10/25 04:45,Xcess
Sticky Dates Lush,"Superrrrrr sweet and that’s coming from a gourmand addict for perfumes. I must say the dry down is beautiful but that initial spray is horrible, smells like burnt caramel and maple syrup to me. Don’t blind buy if you can smell in on stores do it before purchasing",06/08/25 22:23,Chxrry
Sticky Dates Lush,I smelled this for the first at the store to see all the hype. It’s way too sweet like sickeningly sweet I felt nauseous after one word because of the sweetness. Definitely not for me even though I love gourmand perfumes this one is just too much. I honestly don’t get the hype around this.,06/06/25 00:09,Berrryyy
Sticky Dates Lush,"""who baked cookies?"" MEEEEEEE :D no but on a real note a very heavy scent. I can def smell the ""burnt"" caramel notes if that makes sense? Don't spray too much on urself tho, otherwise it will become too overwhemling (comming from a girl who loves a scent that u can SMELL) < 3",06/06/25 00:06,moroccanbarbie
Sticky Dates Lush,"The first time I smelled this sample in the store I thought it smelled wonderful, then someone got it for me as a gift, and I was really excited to wear it. But... after smelling it actually on my skin and clothes and wearing it multiple times it's almost just too syrupy and candle-like for me :( I really wanted to like this one and I've worn it many, many times to see if it would grow on me but sadly it has not. I do see why other people like it though it just didn't work with my skin chemistry specifically.",06/05/25 14:54,alliemidl
Sticky Dates Lush,"Burnt caramel and sticky toffee. Thick, rich, and heavy like dark molasses. There’s a syrupy depth to it that I really like. Perfect for cold weather.",06/04/25 04:35,Charlie bowie
Sticky Dates Lush,"This opens as a nice caramel scent that reminds me of Eilish and a little like Bianco Latte. However, something in this makes it smell musty (think old, dusty basement) as it dries down. It is also very potent; you only need one or two sprays at best (especially on clothes) otherwise you and everyone around you will be coughing and sneezing all day long. Personally couldn't stand the musty note so this is a room spray now.",06/03/25 18:18,poudreeprincess
Sticky Dates Lush,"Burnt caramel scent, very realistic. After sample this I think I didn't want to smell like this.

The good side is Its my first time in lush store and very happy that salesperson really helpful.",06/03/25 06:59,LezzIsMore

Sticky Dates Lush,literally caramel. literally. so magical you’ll love this if you are a heavy gourmand girly,05/25/25 08:35,lulianalala
Sticky Dates Lush,"The pungency on this thing is next-level; like being smothered in resinous caramel with a side of scorched wood. The sweetness is aggressive, almost confrontational. And don’t even get me started on the alcohol blast—I'm pretty sure I burned two whole new nostrils into my face. Somehow, despite all that, the projection fizzles out faster than expected. Bold move for a sugar-coated flamethrower.",05/22/25 22:45,venusinyourfurs
Sticky Dates Lush,"sniffed this yesterday at Lush and I much prefer the body lotion and shower gel over the body spray--i got smacked in the face with alcohol on the first spray and tbh I don't feel like waiting it out for the rest of the notes to take over. the lotion smells divine though, I've been laying off the gourmand scents for a while since it's summertime but this one! this one takes the cake heh",05/22/25 05:25,kimcheesey
Sticky Dates Lush,"I'm a beginner fragrance collector and this is my first purchase. I already got myself a backup bottle. Exactly my type of scent. It's a scrumptious caramel-date syrup with a touch of wood. It's a little boozey but I personally like that and after a few hours my skin smells like sugary vanilla milk. (This is not a lactonic scent tho, so don't expect it to be milky!!)

Even if Sticky Dates is just a body mist it's still kinda long-lasting and it lasts even longer on my clothes. Only negative thing I could mention is the bottle. I couldn't care less about how a fragrance bottle looks, especially a body spray but the atomizer is sh*t. It gets stuck like every three sprays. Apart from that, this thing is just meant for me.

If you like an almost sickly sweet, syrupy gourmand, absolutely go for it!",05/20/25 14:33,gourmand_goth
Sticky Dates Lush,"The Lush body sprays are great because they're SO strong, you won't even need a perfume. I adore this one, but it is pretty heavy and the caramel is very rich, so it's also very divisive. Definitely try this one in store before you get it. I would also recommend Caramel Skin by Phlur if you want similar notes but a softer scent.",05/17/25 11:50,spectreszn
Sticky Dates Lush,"I'm literally obsessed with gourmands so I got this on a blind buy with the body scrub, lotion and body wash. I can truly say this is the first gourmand I didn't like. It's just way too heavy. I normally say the sweeter the better but not with this. Never thought I'd see the day when I'd say a scent was too sweet.

Edit: I wrote this review four months ago and I don't know if it's because it's now fall or if my nose has changed but I actually like this now. It's a very strong warm gourmand, perfect for fall.",05/17/25 02:19,geenamariiie

Sticky Dates Lush,"I finally have this mouthwatering delicious sugary sticky dates scent as I am a heavy gourmand lover...... This is so amazing

Sticky dates notes are dates... Caramel syrup..... Vanilla.... Brown sugar molassis and it smells exactly as the lush version

Sticky Dates Lush,creme brulé and alcohol. very sweet.,05/13/25 11:57,deathacademy
Sticky Dates Lush,"its suuuppperrrrr sweet but i like that personally. Its just like a sweet caramel teeney bit vanilla smell. It lasts ages but it doesnt really have good silliage. like usually my friends comment on whatever scent im wearing (whether they like it or not they usually say something) but i havent gotten any comments and have to smell my shirt to actually really smell it. when you first spray it, its a bit of a smack in the face with how sweet it is, but after a while it just becomes a nice soft caramel scent. DONT spray on white clothes idk if this is common knowledge but it is like a brownish colour and it left a mark on one of my shirts (it washed out i think). overall pretty good but a bit overpriced at least where i live. im also NOT a fragrance expert by any means so go smell it for yourself cuz i probably didnt describe the notes well.",05/08/25 05:47,rhiannon444
Sticky Dates Lush,"I didn’t like it. The scent is too strong, with a sharp alcoholic and sour note that I find unpleasant. It does change over time and becomes more bearable, but only if you have the patience to wait for it.",05/08/25 03:37,Erynis
Sticky Dates Lush,Half a bottle of this mixed with half a bottle of avocado co wash smells very similar to Supermilk. Caramellish burnt sugar lemon cake,05/07/25 16:39,yunapie
Sticky Dates Lush,"This isn’t what I usually go for when it comes to fragrances. I lean heavier towards more herbal fresh scents, but I looove this scent. Very decadent almost sickeningly sweet. Very warm and enticing. It almost has a gooey quality. Makes me think of a Ghirardelli chocolate commercial where an artisan chocolatier bathed in sunlight is melting caramel in a gilded saucepan. A lovely cozy fragrance for fall and winter time. Also has a very strong silage; a small amount goes a long way.",05/05/25 00:04,Sirens0vtian
Sticky Dates Lush,it smells like that one wax melt from walmart,05/03/25 18:21,arieleva
Sticky Dates Lush,this is genuinely the worst gourmand perfume i’ve ever smelt. the best way i can describe it is a waxy caramel candle. like this smells like a wax melt. it’s disgusting and nauseating. i’ve let it sit on my skin and clothes to dry down and it smelled the same. i really wanted to like this and i wanted it to grow on me. definitely not a safe blind buy but it does last a very long time.,04/30/25 16:27,kenzz227
Sticky Dates Lush,"sweet, boozy, long-lasting and with enough sillage to be complimented but not enough to be written up anywhere- the indolic gourmand i've been looking for my entire life. told the lush employee that i prayed for sticky dates to be a year-round scent back when it was an eid exclusive, and god once again treats me like his special little princess!

you definitely get caramel, but not caramel candies- the process of caramelising something, slightly-burnt sugar poured over the fruit of palms. sandalwood keeps sticky dates grounded enough to not be a true 'dessert' scent, vague oud qualities. if you somehow poured boiled, liquified sugar over a date palm, that'd be sticky dates, your perspiration from standing so close to fire included.

sticky dates and rose jam combined smell like yalda to me. heavy fabrics draping over tables, high-quality candles, copies of the divan with pages yellowed by time- all complimented with smooth glasses of wine, syrupy-sweet pomegranate molasses, noon khamei, and whispering poems with your loved ones. lush warrior until the bitter end.",04/29/25 13:47,melfleur
Sticky Dates Lush,smells like walking into an ice cream shop. delicious vanilla sugar cookie and cotton candy. i love it! i love it i love it i love it! a little goes a long way. i am a sickeningly sweet kinda girl lol,04/28/25 19:37,jannarose

I'll keep note of this when fall comes around.",04/28/25 13:09,Millslikesperfume
Sticky Dates Lush,"I have a tester in this for the sticky dates body lotion. I will edit when I try the spray.For me the lotion smells like caramel, coffee and dates. I only like it for fall/ winter.(I prefer tropical fruity scents for summer.) I use it with the super milk hair primer. It’s super strong and stays in my hair for days. the lotion was quite nice though, strong as well, until dry. They are both scents I have never wore and I didn’t like them at first,but they grew on me 😀",04/24/25 15:00,VioletDaisy
Sticky Dates Lush,"I’ve been waiting to review this one because I was hoping we would have a falling out. I am a long time Lush hater. The store is radioactive. Couldn’t possibly be for me.

Unfortunately, I am deeply embarrassed to say I am obsessed with this fragrance, despite the truths of the negative reviews: it IS sickeningly sweet at the beginning, it IS weirdly boozy. The benzoin DOES overwhelm at times. But for me, the magic is when the warm, over-buttered butterscotch wraps you up in drydown.

Here’s the thing: the sprayer sucks and lets out way too much fragrance due to being a windex bottle. I’ve decanted some into a smaller bottle with a slightly finer mist and I find that the distribution makes a positive difference. I also recommend spraying clothes, which I normally dont do but it helps to increase the longevity (and also hangs on to the drydown a little better than skin). I never would have tried it if not for the comparison to Amore Caffe (they smell NOTHING alike btw), but I'm so glad I did. I spray my shirt with this before bed and when I wake up I’m still enveloped in a warm semi-skinlike butterscotch heaven.
Color association: dark brown


LOTION vs BODY SPRAY: I prefer the spray because the lotion barely clings to clothes and I miss that drydown. However, the lotion is what made me realize this was actually a good fragrance since it develops much faster and isnt nearly as strong as the spray. I also think the even scent distribution makes a difference here. I might try this in the summer if I’m feeling adventurous.

COMPARED TO SHAGHAF OUD VANILLA TOFFEE: They might share some of their buttery caramel goodness, but otherwise are very, very different. I unfortunately cant recommend it for lovers of Sticky Dates. It misses the warmth of this, opting instead for a slightly acrid and fume-y arabic coffee cardamom note, which in theory sounds great, but clashes in execution. I admit I was a little disappointed, and I’m hoping that maturation helps it out a bit.",04/24/25 11:07,lobakie
Sticky Dates Lush,Eye watering boozy and extremely literal. This was a scrubber for me. The amount of booze turned my stomach.,04/22/25 23:13,Buckwilde
Sticky Dates Lush,"Sickeningly sweet. Wore a single spray and my aunt and grandmother complained it smelled atrocious (they are more critical than your average person) and I unfortunately have to agree. Very difficult scent to wear as it is very strong. Makes me feel a bit nauseated. If I were to force myself to wear it, I'd have to pair it with something that counters some of the sweetness (citrus maybe?). If the amount of fragrance by spray was smaller, it could work. Also, tried it in the summer and it definitely wasn't the best choice. Probably a better fit for a more heavily-clothed weather.",04/21/25 18:40,rainierdays
Sticky Dates Lush,"Genuinely nauseating. It smelled exactly like a fresh sticky date pudding if that's what you're going for bust its extremely potent and made me feel sick, I sprayed it on my skin and tried washing it off- it was on there for like a whole day. Not a crowd pleaser, so many of my friends and family commented on the potency of the scent. its technically spot on but just way too much. the atomizer makes it really hard to control how much you're putting on as well. I think the packaging is fun, just really difficult.",04/19/25 04:37,Toast_tee
Sticky Dates Lush,"Sticky toffee pudding! This scent is rich, boozy, and gooey — like a blend of thick molasses, rum-soaked raisins, and date syrup. The combination of dried fruit, caramel, and warm spices instantly reminds me of festive treats like fruitcake and mince pies. A warm, syrupy gourmand.",04/19/25 04:32,archerries
Sticky Dates Lush,Lotta hype around this one. Smells like what I imagine raisins soaked in beer being reduced over heat would smell like. Gunna be a no from me.,04/17/25 17:57,Abxsarah
Sticky Dates Lush,"You need to trust the process for this fragrance. The initial spray is overwhelmingly saccharine and almost headache inducing. but if you wait an hour, sticky dates melts into a lovely, milky, skinlike, biscoff cookie-caramel-burnt sugar scent. It's how I’d imagine bianco latte to smell as someone who's only read descriptions. Lasts longer than most full-concentration perfumes- the base notes linger in my skin and hair, blending pleasantly and naturally with my skin-scent. Fragrance profile is a little flat, but that makes it great for layering!",04/16/25 13:13,twinfantasy
Sticky Dates Lush,"bought this one very impulsively like five mins ago and i already regret it because i'm not even sure i like it. it's not bad, but it's SO absurdly strong it's overwhelming. don't know how i'll make this work, honestly",04/15/25 13:53,ancarat

Sticky Dates Lush,"Super sickeningly sweet, which I love. Lasts a long time on clothes. I sprayed this inside my leather jacket, and it lasted a good week. There is a slight burnt note, which cuts through the sugary syrup. I don't experience that note as strongly if I don't spray too much of it but it is for sure still there. Not a blind buy, this fragrance is thick and could give some headaches. Be careful spraying this HAHA",04/11/25 23:01,derbyrunner2017
Sticky Dates Lush,Smells like how biscoff tastes. Very rich and almsot like a caramel icecream. I personally love it but I do see why people find it sickening.,04/11/25 17:34,gabbyjaynee
Sticky Dates Lush,"I love the smell but god is it overwhelming. This scent is so powering. I can't believe I'm going to say this but this would be so much better if it was less sweet. I definitely don't hate this scent, it has to be one of lush's best, but unfortunately it is much too sickly.
I like the fact that after a while the scent slowly fades a little into a less extreme smell, but I'm still on the fence.",04/11/25 13:17,SwanWings
Sticky Dates Lush,Love Sticky Dates! There is an underlying oaky bitterness which cuts through the sugar so I wouldn’t suggest a blind buy but to me this spray is absolutely delicious like a syrup pancake. Layer it with Mar E Sol Caramel Macadamia and Vanilla to become a true caramel cookie!,04/11/25 06:26,Missmimington
Sticky Dates Lush,Sickly sweet. I like sweet smells but this one is very one note. I used it a few times in the same room and the whole room keeps snelling like it after months!,04/11/25 00:59,Abseurdt
Sticky Dates Lush,I get so many compliments it's silly but I'm a gourmand girly and iykyk,04/10/25 22:39,berriesandcream222
Sticky Dates Lush,"straight up caramel drizzle, kinda reminds me of the bottom layer of brown sugar boba— but without the milk tea. testing a single drop on a blotter strip is manageable, but i can imagine in spray form even 1 spray would be sickly sweet. very photorealistic and linear, if you want a fragrance that makes you feel like you’re covered in caramel, this is it. the drop stained my blotter strip, so definitely be careful spraying this. the sillage and projection are also enormous.

i don’t love this as a fragrance to wear, too sickly for me, but i can see myself enjoying the scent as a diluted wash off shower or bath product. thank you to the lovely seller who included a surprise sample with my decant order; even though i knew it’s not my type of scent, i’ve been curious about it and i’m glad i got to check it out.",04/07/25 16:00,teasleeves
Sticky Dates Lush,This genuinely smells like my boyfriend’s armpits after a long and hot day out. It’s a mixture of deodorant and bo with a hint of caramel. Please don’t wear this in public.,04/07/25 07:41,3mma10
Sticky Dates Lush,"Disgusting. I'm sorry but please do not buy it. Smells like BEER alcohol and very synthetic caramel mixed with burnt plastic. I sprayed it once on my arm in the store. I was very dissapointed because of how highly people spoke about it in reviews. It just smelt like a bad alcocholic synthetic caramel. I shruged it off and I kept walkig around the city, but this weird, very strong beer scent kept bothering me. At first I thought it was just spilled on the pavement (you know, London) but everywhere? And then I smelled my wrist. It was disgusting and so strong. I could still smell it on my coat the next day, my skin stoppped smelling after a shower, but it was after like a 15 hours, so its longevity is unfortunately insane. The worst dissapointement of my life when it comes to fragrance.",04/05/25 07:42,matys1a
Sticky Dates Lush,"Ok I’m all for sweet perfumes, but this is like diabetes in a bottle. It’s the furthest thing from an airy and light gourmand. I swear it feels like it’s suffocating me sometimes. If you’re thinking this is gonna be like a cute vanilla moment bc of that caramel note, you would be dead wrong. In my head I conflate the two, so maybe it’s just me who would think like that, but🤷♀️🤷♀️. Regardless, it is NOT a safe blind buy. It does have great longevity for a body mist though, so if you’re one of those people that genuinely enjoys this scent then it’s a great value. For me though, it’s almost as if I paid $40 so I can feel nauseous.",04/01/25 17:41,Briana35
Sticky Dates Lush,Overly sweet,03/31/25 22:31,SaraZigova
Sticky Dates Lush,"I want to love this so bad, but there is a sharpness in the perfume that tends to overwhelm me (I don't get the same sharpness from the lotion). The projection, longevity, and amount you get for the cost are absolutely amazing. I'm hoping that the scent grows on me and that I enjoy it more the next time I try it out.",03/31/25 12:42,weirdfishy
Sticky Dates Lush,"This body spray is a true perfume and actually projects better than many perfumes. However, it is extremely intense. I love sweet and sugary fragrances, but this one is just too much.

I don’t agree that the sweetness comes from caramel, but rather from dates. However, on a car trip, I completely got sick of this scent—although I did overapply it. Since then, I’ve been using it as a room spray.

I recommend testing it first. That said, the price is excellent for the amount you get.",03/29/25 09:58,Overthinker
Sticky Dates Lush,"I tested it the 2nd time in a Lush shop yesterday as I couldn't believe how good this is.
Wow! What an amazing scent. And so powerful. I took several test paper strips of many different designer perfumes back home and it outperformed almost all of them. This stuff is incredible.
I LOVE how this smells. To me this smells identical to sticky toffee pudding. I'm obsessed. I need it in my life!",03/28/25 10:14,Lebkuchen
Sticky Dates Lush,"Smells almost identical to the body wash!
Never gonna stop wearing this for as long as they make it.
It's sweet, a little musky, it's perfect for anyone who loves a gourmand scent.
I would drink this scent if I could not gonna lie",03/28/25 10:10,mookimoo
Sticky Dates Lush,"Stunning realistic sticky dates pudding smell🤤 however, the note of Fenugreek can be too much for some people.
But personally, I love it, I would love to enjoy it as a comfort scent at home😍",03/27/25 14:24,Reema199
Sticky Dates Lush,"I usually go for more sweet candy like scents, but this is amazing! smells like caramel, toffee, and apparently burnt marshmallows according to my parents. I have the travel size lotion, and I regret not getting a full size. it smells so yummy, and it left my skin very soft and shiny.",03/26/25 04:37,taintedheartzz
Sticky Dates Lush,"So i really like this i think it smells amazing, BUT nobody enjoys it on me so i decided to test out why. I had my mom spray it and walk around the house with it and when i passed by her i asked her ”why do you smell like liqourice?” She said that she hadn’t put on anything else except than sticky dates, and i had been getting liquorice comments from other people so that pretty much explains it..

I love it yeah, but i dont want to smell like that for other people.",03/24/25 00:02,FrappSam
Sticky Dates Lush,"worst blind buy of mine, so much benzion ruins it",03/23/25 04:37,jeremyfragrancefan478
Sticky Dates Lush,".... It's nice... I guess????? First spray is like sticky toffee pudding and syrupy dates. The dry down is like rum and raisin ice cream. I love rum and raisin ice cream but, I'm not sure how I feel smelling like something an 8 year old would probably love. It's very linear and doesn't have any 'expensive' notes. It might do very well for a cheap way to layer something more grown up and woody to help make it sweeter. Not sure what people are talking about when they get benzoin from this. There is no benzoin. It's something I would have died for when I was an 8yr old girl and still reading sabrina the teenage witch magazines.",03/22/25 09:21,CicadaHime
Sticky Dates Lush,"If you’re a gourmand lover like me, Sticky Dates by Lush is an absolute dream: a thick, syrupy, sugar-drunk delight that practically oozes decadence. This isn’t just a sweet perfume; it’s a sticky one, like warm caramel dripping over a mountain of dates, drenched in vanilla and a whisper of sandalwood to keep it from becoming completely unhinged. Hence the dramatic prose.
The first spray is a full-on sugar rush: dark, chewy dates meet a flood of toffee, almost like unwrapping a molten candy bar straight out of a dessert fantasy. As it settles, the vanilla and benzoin create this ultra-luxurious, slightly smoky warmth, like the aftermath of baking the richest, gooiest dessert imaginable.
It’s loud, it’s dense, and it’s absolutely not for the faint of heart. Some people might find it suffocatingly sweet (more for me!), but I adore its unapologetic, dessert-shop explosion. If you love smelling edible, borderline obscene in its sugar content, and don’t mind leaving a trail of melted toffee in your wake, this one is for you.",03/21/25 09:43,viramed
Sticky Dates Lush,"To me unfortunately this smells like rum and raisin ice cream, and I'm not trying to smell like rum and raisin ice cream over here T-T",03/20/25 06:38,jotakiepie
Sticky Dates Lush,"I've sprayed this on my hand, just one spray. I'm amazed on how this is strong and overpowering. Being completely honest, I couldn't wear this, and I feel like it's something that could bother a lot of people around, but well, we can't say that the name doesn't do justice, it's super sticky.",03/19/25 11:32,Tsmarcondes
Sticky Dates Lush,The benzoin is sooo good in the background. Just having to sift through the caramel to get it is a bit nauseating. AND I am a gourmand lover.,03/18/25 14:00,YourFragranceBoo
Sticky Dates Lush,"This is the EPITOME of gourmands in my opinion! A photorealistic scent of (at least in my life experience and notes) caramel cheesecake! How nice! Not for non-gourmand lovers, as it is very very gourmand.",03/15/25 12:36,santalberrysilk
Sticky Dates Lush,"The first few seconds of sticky, buttery dates are amazing. Would have bought it on the spot if I didn't start getting hints of burnt rubber. Unfortunately, this is a pattern with most of the LUSH fragrances I've tested - they start off strong, but just can't seem to stick the landing.",03/12/25 15:18,ilonkailonka
Sticky Dates Lush,"As a warm caramel gourmand fanatic, I am obsessed with this scent. I bought it first as a $15 travel lotion and quickly realized I'd be needing a full bottle of it ASAP. Only sad part is, this smells exactly how I imaging LTGTR to smell like but I get next to nothing from that fragrance. (I may be anosmic to it) This one though? This is like opening a bag of caramel popcorn, sticking your nose directly inside and taking a longggg slow whiff. I have yet to see how it does in hotter weather but I got so many compliments in the winter!",03/11/25 18:43,fabeany
Sticky Dates Lush,"I didn't look at the notes before trying this one and I was surprised. I was expecting a more fruity scent. Very butterscotchy, but in an expired holiday candle way. Sadly not for me.",03/09/25 19:44,greensandgourmands
Sticky Dates Lush,"Extremely sweet fragrance, however, because of the burnt sugar note it does not come across as nauseating. Imagine cooking caramel and accidentally burning it — that’s how Sticky Dates smells. Just don’t overspray it, and it’ll be fine. I usually spray twice in the air and then go through the fragrance cloud, which makes the perfume less intense.",03/07/25 11:02,Mercuryvapor
Sticky Dates Lush,literally STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING!! if you're british you know this iconic dessert and how absolutely divine it is- well this smells EXACTLY like it😍😍,03/05/25 07:20,nymphfairy
Sticky Dates Lush,"This might be the cloying burnt caramel fragrance to end all cloying burnt caramel fragrances. I bought this because I used my friend's Sticky Dates body wash and thought it smelled gorgeous, though after using the body spray, I can no longer stomach the other products in this fragrance line. Nauseating and yucky.",03/04/25 03:42,tenderstems
Sticky Dates Lush,"I will open this review by saying that I am normally a gourmand and sweet scent hater. They mostly smell like sugar and perfume to me.

This is great however. Its sticky, syrupy, buttery, and sweet. Its a brown sugar/caramel bomb. I think the rich buttery facet is what sets it apart.",03/01/25 12:05,Sunmoon
Sticky Dates Lush,"incredibly strong sweet syrupy sort of smell, upon spraying it fills the room. smells of dates drowned in caramel and toffee. divisive scent and definitely something you should sample in-store first (i love it but my bf says it 'stinks' lmao) . it lasts AGES though and has great silage, could still smell it on me at the end of the day. i have no clue what to layer this with as it is rather unique",02/28/25 12:33,jindori
Sticky Dates Lush,"A very pretty girl was standing next to me at a public place, and almost immediately I caught a whiff of a delicious sweet perfume. I couldn't help to ask her what it was and she said ""Sticky Dates by Lush"", as she pulled up the phone to show me a picture of it.
This perfume is delicious, its simply a caramel bomb with some ambery tones. It reminds me a lot of JPG Scandal le Parfum for woman, just way sweeter and without the flowery jasmine notes. She walked away and left a cloud of her smell hanging in the air, I couldn't get her smell out of my head for hours.
I can't say anything bad about it because it smells delicious, but I will just say that this might be more suitable for younger ladies. There are other alternatives that are very similar in aromas but with different intensities (i.e Scandal Le Parfum, or Dior Hypnotic Poison).",02/25/25 17:38,Jose Zerpa
Sticky Dates Lush,"Never smelled a scent this sweet. Ever.
It is a warm sticky toffee pudding in front of you that you will regret eating. You finish it anyway.
Can’t get sweeter than caramel and dates. Dates are strong in the beginning but eventually fade (slowly). You’re left with warm syrupy caramel or butterscotch. It is way too sweet.
But for some reason I can’t help returning to that strip of tester over and over again. It is a very realistic scent, honestly very well done. And I almost bought it, even! Voice of reason talked me out of it. I have no occasion to wear it. Living in a tropical climate I will annihilate everyone. You haven’t smelled sweet until this one. Not a safe blind buy.",02/25/25 07:38,partypooper
Sticky Dates Lush,"So good! I’ve been looking for a super sweet gourmand and this is it!
Honestly I smell a little bit of sweet lemon in the opening? Which I don’t dislike, as it still has a caramel/toffee pudding overall scent. I tried this along with their Chelsea Morning perfume and it has worn with the same longevity and sillage, which I’ve heard their body sprays have great longevity and I agree. I love the scent so much based off the tester I sprayed in store that I bought the gift set of it (which if you can get it, and you like this scent, is a great deal). For colder weather, I can’t imagine a better, cosier scent to be wrapped up in, so worth the hype.
I do get vanilla in the full dry-down (been on my wrist for about 10 hours), still with the caramel note in there.",02/24/25 15:34,rosemary.milk
Sticky Dates Lush,SICKENINGLY sweet. Dry down is much better than initial spray. Very potent for a mist.,02/23/25 10:02,Hotaruchanhehe
Sticky Dates Lush,"I don't usually go for gourmand scents but this one is too good. It can be too strong, too sweet and caramel at the beginning but then it settles down to a very cozy warm scent. I get whiffs of it during the day and it's just delicious. I hated let the good times roll but this one is good. It last days.",02/21/25 16:11,Herroww
Sticky Dates Lush,"This is the ultimate gourmand! Pure caramel, liquid caramel, caramel in its most perfect expression. Very sweet, wonderful, a paradise of sweets! If you love gourmands, this is a must have.",02/13/25 12:18,Anna Declan
Sticky Dates Lush,"A warm, full bodied, satisfying fragrance. Warm dates, thick caramel, brown sugar, good enough to eat. Too sweet to wear in hot weather but serves as a wonderful warm hug on a cold and dreary day. I dont think its synthetic at all, it gives me the feeling of spending an evening reuniting with old friends in a cozy, warmly lit bakery and indulging in syrupy desserts together.",02/13/25 10:08,Byterisk
Sticky Dates Lush,"I like it. It isn't an instant obsessive love like Chelsea Morning was - that is almost Holy Grail - but I like it. I absolutely refuse to have one of those spray bottle thingies, though, so I will only be adding a full bottle to my collection if they bring it out in the perfume version and not the cleaner bottle.",02/11/25 09:51,Kaleigha
Sticky Dates Lush,"Absolutely delicious. Makes me hungry to smell it. Definitely will repurchase. It stays very long, too.",02/11/25 06:16,JaeRiot
Sticky Dates Lush,It's okay....I just get straight MAPLE SYRUP or PANCAKES. Brown sugar & caramel. No vanilla imo. It def is a true gourmand fragrance. Great projection and sillage. Just not for me.,02/09/25 05:33,angiemc
Sticky Dates Lush,"Lots of date at first with some rich sugar notes, but it fades into a fairly straightforward brown sugar/caramel that lasts pretty well. I do like it, but it’s not necessarily groundbreaking. And while I’m not itching to add it to my collection, I could see myself picking it up in the future and/or would enjoy wearing it if gifted to me.

I’m excited to finally (!!) find a fragrance from Lush that I actually get on with.",02/08/25 21:28,supergirl9412
Sticky Dates Lush,"Pure caramel, that’s it. Simple. Caramel.",02/07/25 14:42,Ammi123
Sticky Dates Lush,"very strong caramel body mist, smells SO edible, but I get why some people would consider it to smell synthetic. personally I think its a very realistic caramel, but someone told me they think I smelled like crème brûlée which is a win in my opinion!!

also, if you like the scent but think it's too strong/overwhelming, spray it only on the lower half of your body. absolute game changer, it's strong enough to still smell it without it being suffocating",02/04/25 13:14,MichealVoltaire
Sticky Dates Lush,"I love this! Perfect must have for gourmand lovers. It is something between Bianco Latte, Amore Caffe and Cheirosa 71. Perfect balance of these parfums. Long lasting. Good for all seasons, day and night. I will layer this with Amora Caffe or BL, or any other vanilla parfume to get more depth. It is nothing compared to Let the good times roll, i did not like that one. If you love this too, please try also Chelsea Morning parfume.",02/03/25 07:47,safaana
Sticky Dates Lush,"🍫I cant i really cant, this is masterpiece, you will smell like a HOT bakery, i love this scent sm, it works very well with my billie eilish n1 or kayali 28, SUPER MILK HAIR SPRAY or jist with anythink that smells like edible hahha❤️

🍒AND ITS LONG LASTING!!!",02/02/25 13:10,seichick
Sticky Dates Lush,"Not a blind buy safe. True, it is incredibly potent for a body mist. But I smell no caramel/gourmandy notes. Mostly, I'm getting citrus, something else pretty sweet and complex too. Be careful and suggest sampling first before buying?",02/02/25 04:24,Bordo
Sticky Dates Lush,To me this smells exactly like butterscotch. It also reminds me a lot of sol de Janiero 71 but without the salty & nutty notes. Very sweet and realistic gourmand. Definitely not a safe blind buy!,02/01/25 04:45,Madeleineloder00
Sticky Dates Lush,"As a gourmand lover, this was a nightmare! I understand it's a body spray, but this thing drenches you. All I pick up is heavily burnt synthetic sugar with hints of vehicular diesel exhaust. The TikTok hype pulled me in, and the intense nausea it gave me dragged me out.",01/31/25 22:33,lusteze
Sticky Dates Lush,"had such high hopes... i don't get the sandalwood notes at all. very caramel-y, almost smelled like butterscotch.

Sticky Dates Lush,Initial spray is kinda janky but once you let this dry down it smells so heavenly I quite literally cannot stop smelling myself,01/29/25 18:52,rayelovesyou
Sticky Dates Lush,The new batch with the permanent range are so much better than the limited edition ones with the gold label. Gold label which I have has a weird soapiness that’s also in the body scrub. The new ones don’t have that at all and is a super rich and creamy sticky date scent. Haven’t tested longevity on the new one tho but on the gold label it projects very loud for about 4 hours,01/24/25 23:11,Adog22
Sticky Dates Lush,"literally better sillage, projection and longevity than my actual perfumes???? also this is a gorgeous scent i might have to start buying only lush body sprays",01/23/25 22:59,elis4ma
Sticky Dates Lush,"Loving it! I'm all about that creme brulee vibe with Let the Good Times Roll. This one screams buttery caramel and packs a serious punch. Thought about layering it, but it's a boss on its own. Not for everyday wear, but in my car (or office?), it's a game-changer against the smoke. Gonna be my ride's signature scent for sure. That aroma? Pure love! 😍",01/23/25 10:59,HollyBiani
Sticky Dates Lush,"Caramel dream!!! My boyfriend loves it. However, the sandalwood note is very much stronger than expected. I wore this and someone asked if I was burning a wood scented candle haha",01/22/25 19:12,queensilllysophia

Sticky Dates Lush,so sweet and syrupy-smelling. definitely not for everyone but people who love super sweet and gourmand scents will love this. smells like a sticky caramel pudding and eventually you can smell a hint of the sandalwood,01/22/25 13:11,malibubarbie
Sticky Dates Lush,"Ehh, not bad but also not great. The body spray is almost nauseating, however I do think the sandalwood note cuts through the sweetness the tiniest bit, and makes it a bit tolerable. I feel like the ""sticky date"" aspect gets lost in this frag, I don't get that at all from smelling this. I absolutely LOVE the body wash and lotion of this, but the fragrance doesn't match the scent of them at all in my opinion and is way more cloying. I enjoy gourmands but there are so many other gourmand fragrances I have or know of that I would reach for/purchase over this. Wouldn't say I hate this but I wouldn't say I'm in love with it either. I will be using this up through the winter but I don't think I will be repurchasing. However, absolutely love the body wash and would recommend giving it a try - it has that true sticky date scent and it's what I wish this smelled like.",01/22/25 11:07,camryb
Sticky Dates Lush,"I HATED THIS BODY SPRAY— which was so surprising to me because i am a big fan of the body lotion, body wash, and body scrub. this spray on the other hand is incredibly sweet to the point where it smells nasty! i would honestly just get the body lotion and layer it with a nice vanilla perfume.

all of the lush body sprays are extremely overdone. the only tolerable one imho is rose jam.",01/21/25 23:41,Poliscihottie
Sticky Dates Lush,"I got to smell this in store yesterday and let me tell you I find gourmands very intriguing but THIS… is just extremely over the top. There is nothing quiet about this fragrance. It stains anything it touches, and it’s violently sweet. I get overwhelmed when I eat something too sugary, it makes me feel sick, and this fragrance elicited the same emotions despite it only being something I sniffed. I cannot say how much I dislike the aggressiveness of this smell. Literally made my face scrunch up. I would never wear this, but If very over the top, unapologetic, attention demanding gourmands are your cup of tea, then this is a must have for you.",01/20/25 15:16,strwbrricurls

Sticky Dates Lush,"I finally got my hands on a bottle of this after falling in love with the body wash and lip scrub. Unfortunately, this doesn't have the same beast mode performance as other Lush body sprays and the scent profile is different. The initial spray is very synthetic and screechy, then it quickly dries down to a beautiful creamy caramel that projects for maybe an hour before settling down into skin scent territory. Not a bad price - worth trying for yourself!",01/18/25 23:32,RobynCrabtree
Sticky Dates Lush,"I’m pleasantly surprised by this fragrance. I initially thought it would be a beast mode scent. On the first spray, it smelled like dates getting sweeter as they ripen. However, I have to admit that it wasn’t as strong during the dry down, although it does last a long time. At that point, the scent is also more tolerable than it was at first. For me, it’s definitely a wintery gourmand fragrance, and I find it to be a really nice scent.",01/18/25 08:00,Hayriye

Sticky Dates Lush,"Yo es como que quiero que me gusten las fragancias de lush pero ellas se resisten con fuerza. Todas empiezan agradandome hasta que centro mas la atención y acabo aterrada. Sticky dates es un caramelo tostado TAN tostado que te dan ganas de llamar a los bomberos. Muy agresivo, muy quemado. Y cuando centras la atención, empiezas a oler una serie de cosas raras y quimicas que emulan el caramelo, pero que no son. Tipo como si varios hombres bajitos se subiesen unos sobre otros bajo una gabardina para parecer un hombre alto. Acabe odiandola, todo esto en un mismo día. Eso si, al dia siguiente seguía en mi muñeca, ya apagado el incendio de ese caramelo quemado, quedaba algo suave dulce y encantador. Pero no compensa aguantar 12 horas para llegar ahi",01/15/25 11:40,Arrabbiata

Sticky Dates Lush,"So I fell in love with the body wash and lotion from this line and decided it was time to finally try the perfume. I was so excited and after waiting for more than a month to get my parcel, it finally arrived just in time for new years!
I immediately sprayed it on once I got it out of the box and was instantly brought to tears by the extremely strong stench. I had to change clothes and tried to wash it off, but it stayed on for the rest of my day. It smells like a very badly burnt sugar, mixed with old sweat to me. Apparently it just does not work on my body chemistry. Maybe if it came out in like a pea sized spritz it would work, but because of the nozzle an entire truckload comes out.
I loved the body wash, with its soft and warm toffee smell, it has just been a delight to use in the shower. But the perfume just smells rancid to me. Maybe it was expired, who knows...

For me a 4/10. Would not recommend blind buying, you really do need to test this on the skin first",01/11/25 12:09,Fcm03
Sticky Dates Lush,"This smells like syrupy butterscotch. If you've ever smelled the shower gel, it smells exactly like that when you first spray. But then settles into a more of a sandalwood scent and doesn't really smell like sticky dates. Kinda sad. I love the smell when I first spray it though",01/10/25 17:52,Choccymilc
Sticky Dates Lush,"This smells like straight up caramel to me, doesn’t even smell like a perfume or body mist, just real actual caramel. It’s very one note and quite intense so I like layering this with other gourmands that I own. It is very sweet since it’s caramel and a little goes a long way with this even though it’s a body spray.",01/10/25 04:03,emmavai
Sticky Dates Lush,It doesn’t smell identical to the sticky date body wash (which is my favourite). This smells super similar but not as rich or developed as the body wash- this is definitely lacking comparatively. It’s very sweet and kind of shallow smelling. I still really like it but i can see how this could be nauseating to some people since it lacks the depth that the wash has which really balances the scent out. Super long lasting and projects far.,01/06/25 20:41,Pixied0ll
Sticky Dates Lush,"Don’t be fooled. It stinks. I am a big blind buyer but I WISHHH more people tell me now. It’s not nauseating because its sweet, it is nauseating because of how chemically it smells. I can only describe it as being stuck in a room with cleaning products for too long. Not as gourmand as people said.",01/06/25 16:26,Gourmandgirlie123

Sticky Dates Lush,This was a lot up front but definitely reflects the notes listed. I honestly just wish it was a bit softer/muskier. It's heavily gourmand in a very sweet way.

Road From Damascus Lush,"*I have 10 ml decants of this available for sale in the USA- message me if interested!

My review: Really beautiful, poetic fragrance. The juxtaposition of romantic rose, bitter orange and dark wood really do evoke a bittersweet, melancholic, but romantic feeling. The notes on Fragrantica don't list wood but I also get a slight woody undertone in addition to the rose and bitter orange.

This is predominantly a rose scent (with bitter orange and a touch of wood). This scent would be a good pick for fans of dark, gothic or pensive, bittersweet rose scents. This scent would also be the perfect while reading a tragic romance or reading bittersweet poetry.",03/08/25 13:43,BlackLocust
Road From Damascus Lush,"This smells very familiar to me in a nostalgic way. It reminds me of a powdery rose perfume my mum had which would be on her woolen scarf which I'd wrap around me when I was cold on the way to school. It may be a little ""old fashioned"" for some tastes, I can pick up the orange as it almost smells like someone was peeling oranges somewhere in the distance, there is a very faint smell of violet as well. I like it, I don't love it though. It's nice and safe for a Lush fragrance, I usually like the loud and wilder ones more.",11/27/24 02:09,Rie_1977

Shade Lush,"I only use the stick version but BEST LUSH PERFUME SMELLS LIKE DOVE SOAP AND SANDALWOOD SHAVINGS OR LIKE SANDER DUST… super clean but in this expensive way, but not trying too hard either… John Galliano bully relaxed nerdy sort of scent, just incredibly pale blue and light light beige! Heaven! Poor man’s Glossier You if you get the travel size.",,glossyjul69
Shade Lush,"I love this perfume so much but the first time I wore this my coworker said I smelled like baby powder and also yesterday I went out to smoke a cigarette on my friend's balcony and when I came back my friend said I smelled like her grandmother < / 3

This is a targeted smear campaign against me but it's not going to stop me. It's actually making me stronger. I will wear this every day now and give you sense memories of your dead catholic chainsmoking grandma just try and stop me.",11/10/25 16:16,meerahmac
Shade Lush,"This is comforting, and the person wearing it seems like they smell good without trying. It smells like what someone wealthy would wear. Reminds me of a la labo scent. Simple, classy, comforting. The notes are not reflected accurately. This has west Timor sandalwood, olibanum, and guaiac wood. It’s slightly sweet, woodsy, and clean without musk and aldehydes. Still one of my favorites in my 400+ collection. Can we worn for any occasion.",11/07/25 06:37,madjo58
Shade Lush,yeah i second that it smells like baby powder,10/19/25 18:59,ryane
Shade Lush,tried this on my skin in store and it just smells like straight up talcum/baby powder on me. sweet and powdery and not much else.,10/19/25 07:38,ghostichor
Shade Lush,"I always like this in it's later drydown, softer sweeter cedar sandalwood with a tiny bit of that almost burnt caramely smell a lot of Lush scents seem to land on eventually.

The opening/first 20 min or so I alternate between loving and mildly disliking, and I really come here to get clues from the comments on what those early notes actually are. Something a bit lemony and bright, which with the cedar sawdust threatens to tip it into furniture polish or bathroom cleaner for me. Maybe that's just facets of some frankincense? I can see how some could get petrol, a little bit, but not overwhelmingly. Same with a camphor/medicinal smell - maybe a little.",10/01/25 10:15,suzzel
Shade Lush,"Kind of reminds me of the smell of unscented candle wax, or maybe beeswax? I don't particularly sense the sandalwood, which is unfortunate, as I was hoping for a subtle sandalwood perfume. It's inoffensive, and has a vintage shop, dark academia-y vibe to it. Might go back for this one, but undecided.",09/27/25 16:38,niepokoya
Shade Lush,"yassified church scent. it's very fresh at first and gets progressively more creamy and woody as it dries down. definitely not an everyday fragrance as it requires a specific vibe to really shine. and by vibe i mean an all black outfit with a long, cape-like coat. this should be a mandatory fragrance for all priests lol",09/22/25 07:36,kysmyaids
Shade Lush,"for some reason this is spelled Shady in Japanese Lush stores/their website but seems to be the same perfume. strangely enough it reminds me of Laboratorio Olfattivo's Salina, but less harsh. they have pretty different listed notes so not sure why",09/05/25 00:49,anaguma
Shade Lush,sexy priest with a small hint of sweetness :-) makes you smell clean and soapy but it also gives woody and frankincense.... yum,09/02/25 10:20,quaileye
Shade Lush,"honestly this scent is really nice. creamy but woody. I blind bought it because the notes really stood out to me. however, I can't get over this certain part of it that reminds me of hamster bedding, the sawdust/wood shavings lolol. however, my solid lost this note after having it for a few years. I started liking it a lot more, so I decided to buy the liquid version! then I was greeted by that familiar sawdust note again. I've gotten used to it the more I've used it though, now i can mostly look past it x) I think this would be a really nice one for layering

(okay I decided to try it with a tiny bit of cinders body spray and this is heavenly ...)",08/09/25 08:34,galaticality
Shade Lush,"Wow this scent is special. It is warm but fresh, clean but sensual. It sort of reminds me of old fashioned soap or shaving cream, but there’s a sweet warmth almost musk like. A citrus element is beautiful and sharp in the beginning but fades quickly. Overall a great unique scent that I think would turn heads in the most subtle way.",08/06/25 15:51,jdb_
Shade Lush,"I love churchy scents and sandalwood and frankincense but this.. it smells like petrol, an immediate scrubber",07/30/25 05:24,soraya.ls
Shade Lush,"I love Lush, but I have always overlooked Shade - I tried it for the first time today, and it totally blew my mind. I love sandalwood but often find that where it's included in a perfume, it kind of floats in the background without being front and centre how I want it.

This is such a delicious, creamy, slightly sweet sandalwood dream. It has a resin-y and almost incense-like quality to it. On a tester strip, this has survived a good 10 hours so far, and I was catching a whiff of it from my handbag for the following 5-6 hours that I was out. £25 for a bottle is incredibly good value, especially considering how long Lush perfumes typically last. I will absolutely purchase once I've used up some of my existing fragrances and can justify buying something new.",07/26/25 15:52,maddieonline
Shade Lush,a somewhat meditative scent. i imagine wearing this in the fall while walking over brown leaves and chestnut shells.,07/26/25 14:15,giuliatrapletti
Shade Lush,one spray of this will without fail give me the craziest day-long sickly headache. the opening is just so offensive to my nose.. evil Men's Cologne.. it actually dries down quite subtle and sweet but by that point it's already over for me and i'm halfway to a migraine. gutting bc it smells beautiful in the bottle cap. my evil skin is very much the problem. i wish i got the nice church-y experience everyone else seems to be having lmao,07/25/25 08:11,mmanyhandss
Shade Lush,I am always in distinct need of a summer perfume. I went into lush one sticky stupidly hot day and talked to the most wonderful worker who happened to be dressed similarly to me (in too much black for the heat). She described this scent to me as a goth in summer sitting in a worn down church after performing a ritual using sandalwood incense... and that is exactly what I wanted to portray! It does that perfectly for me and I am very happy with it!,07/10/25 14:11,Billoux123!
Shade Lush,"if ykyk any of those romanticized catholic trauma childhood edits, it’s the same vibe (i lived it)

smells like church- stale and serene

the cinnamon banana licuado your abuelita made you for breakfast earlier that morning while she was getting your hair ready

embroidered tablecloths and plastic rosaries

sweet warm tortillas

its cool because it’s otherworldly and nostalgic, simple and ethereal. so if you want to be quietly haunting, off-putting, and mysterious, go to your local Lush (I beg of you)",06/30/25 21:08,kittybobo
Shade Lush,"I wore this scent during a weekend spent in a friend’s summer cabin. I slept by myself in a guest house and it was raining all weekend. It was the perfect setting for this soothing and mellow scent.

Shade is almost melancholic in a way, like a distant memory. The herbal opening is reminiscent of the smell when you open a bottle of gin. The dry-down is a gorgeous, barely-there sandalwood. The best Lush scent I’ve experienced so far, and oh so perfect for rainy summer days.",06/23/25 14:42,n0ra
Shade Lush,"I saw a video in a Lush factory once, where they were mixing ingredients and filling up bottles. I do not know if I got a bottle that was filled first or last, when the ingredients may have been separated and therefore out of balance in strength (not really sure if what I am trying to say is coming across correctly here), but mine smells like those white bbq starter blocks. A very off-putting petrol smell. I do not find it creamy at all. It is not a warm, cozy sandalwood at all.

I own several Lush perfumes, about 15, plus the same number in body sprays of other Lush fragrances currently, and have owned several more on the past, I know some of them can be quite earthy and 'harsh' (I am looking at you, original Devil's Night Cap). Shade, to me, is one of those. Fortunately, it is barely noticeable, which in my experience, is not the standard in Lush perfumes, or even the body sprays.

Unfortunately, not what I expected, and I regret spending the money that could have bought me multiple other perfumes. My bottle was produced in July 2023, I received it through online order in March 2025. Maybe maceration may change it, maybe it will be expired before that (2027 it says on the bottle). All in all, not a success.

Oh, and note to self; No more online ordering from Lush in Switzerland, they send you old stuff. Best not buy until I am willing to travel the 2-hour journey to a store.",05/19/25 10:03,These_Waters
Shade Lush,"as someone else said, it's quite cozy. warm and slightly sweet but not cloying or too intense. it's extremely pleasant.
Update 5/16/25: After having the solid version for a few months, I finally tried the liquid version in-store to see how it would sit on my skin. Very little difference between the two, although I find that the liquid is a bit more nuanced and the notes come through a bit more distinctly. I ended up purchasing the full-size bottle because I adore it so much. It doesn't project much but it lasts a long time on my skin. Can confirm what others are saying about the opening being harsh, but it dries down within a minute or two.",03/30/25 15:05,repollo
Shade Lush,This would be a 10/10 sandalwood scent if only it lasted longer and had greater sillage,02/22/25 16:02,pluralfern
Shade Lush,"im not upset about this smelling like camphor, but the sillage is so poor i cant smell anything right after spraying. I thought American Cream is bad enough but this is worse! Not worth the money for buying something that doesnt project at all",02/03/25 08:21,Mamaterer
Shade Lush,Mystical soft cinnamon vanilla and something magic but so close to the skin. Love but cannot justify repurchase,01/16/25 13:26,beavisbonce
Shade Lush,Stunning fragrance it’s dry woody and super long lasting such a cozy scent that will get you compliments,01/13/25 02:04,Dani83
Shade Lush,"Lush's perfumes usually tend to be quite loud and overpowering. Trying to finish a typical Lush's 100ml bottle can takes decades. However, this is not the case with Shade. This gem is like a skin scent. It stays close to the skin. Shade is a unisex, soft, slightly powdery/chalky, minimal sweetness and minimal woodiness perfume. 10/10.",01/12/25 08:35,Archaic
Shade Lush,"Shade is one of those gems that doesn’t smell perfume-y.
You know when you are next to someone and they smell super-good, but you don’t think it’s a perfume because it has this soft presence? Like a fabric softener.

There is an aromatic note in the opening, maybe rosemary which fades away within 5 mins.

What is left is a lingering woody, sweetish veil with an intensity of a good body lotion.

An absolute gem.

Edit: The comment on the mild intensity was for the solid version. The perfume has great staying power and strong projection!

P.S. LUSH, please make a body lotion version",11/30/24 16:08,Sniffona
Shade Lush,"A mix of incense and candle wax. The candle wax is a very prominent smell but I’m not sure what ingredient smells like it. Either way, very nice perfume, I get loads of compliments when I wear it and I think it’s quite a witchy perfume. Very nice!",11/28/24 12:33,Juneygloomy
Shade Lush,"I just want to bathe in that perfume.
When I applied it the very first time I smelled strong older people perfumes. Although my nose had to get used to the difference as I was coming from years of wearing “Lord of misrule”. So not being any patchouli in there, was something I had to get used to at first.
Once it settled, I couldn’t get enough of it. Just absolutely lovely. Since then, it seems to have opened up my love for finer, more distinct fragrances, that are not too heavy. Love it.",11/05/24 07:16,von_orleans
Shade Lush,Very much like Molton Brown Milk Musk.,09/21/24 06:45,The_Entity
Shade Lush,"Good lord, I usually can handle funky scents but THIS IS NOT IT. The opening is awful… it reminds me of my grandfather in that odd powdery older person smell. Not old person like what old people wear as perfume (cause fragrance to me doesn’t have an age) but more like what older humans smell like. So brutal. Total scrubber on me. Disappointing because it seems like on others there are some lovely woody notes and my skin likes to pull wood scents but not this one.",09/19/24 14:27,CB88
Shade Lush,"Once you get past the sharp opening (which reminds me a little of lavander, even though it’s not listed) you’re left with creamy woods and a whisper of incense to balance out the subtle sweetness and keep things interesting. Overall, it’s a fairly simplistic smell but very comforting, like burning palo santo in a log cabin on a chilly fall evening. Soft projection and moderate longevity. Cozy witchy vibes. I very much like it :)",08/29/24 08:35,scentedddiary
Shade Lush,"I recently bought the solid version of Shade, and I’m absolutely in love. It's the perfect blend of warm, resinous, and ambery notes, with the sandalwood adding a creamy, almost vanilla-like richness. The scent has a unique twist, reminding me of a creamsicle, but with a deeper, more resinous complexity. It’s beautifully simple yet utterly captivating. Versatile enough for any season, I’m especially enjoying it even in the heat of summer.",08/11/24 04:52,ivisol88
Shade Lush,Read the review by tanaC..👇👇...it's spot on. Very Zen scent. Calming and centering with that Lush DNA I love.,07/29/24 12:19,Magellan0101
Shade Lush,"While I ultimately love Shade, wow... it has the absolute ugliest opening of any fragrance I have ever tried. Mineralic and greasy, like rancid petrichor, like a stick of butter studded with rusty nickels and stubbed-out cigarette butts, melting on wet concrete after a scalding July sunshower in central Florida. But then it does something miraculous. The oppressive atmosphere lifts and turns into a completely different perfume, softly sugared and clean-woody-resinous, like the sacred soapy sap of the mystical marzipan tree. It's so good, too good. Maybe even too-good-to-be-true good. It almost smells like something about which I would say: ""I love this, but it's not for me."" Because, in some way or another, it doesn't feel like me. Too unstudied and unbothered and carefree, I guess. I'm too neurotic to pull this off! BUT somewhere in the vast multiverse, there exists the chillest, coolest, most untryhard version of me, and this is what they smell like. And when I wear this perfume, I am channeling that person...and it feels really, really good.",06/17/24 14:57,mlleghoul
Shade Lush,"Shade by LUSH
(Store test, skin test)

I really like Shade in the manner of Warm, Mild Balsamic Creamy Sandalwood with Slight tint of Powderiness. It is warmer due to olibanum, which on my skin, have quality of radiant warmth.

Shade, can be worn in any occasion due to it Natural Wood profile without much complexity. But how natural profile of Sandalwood play out, this is so wonderful.

Honestly I like this more than TAM DAO by Diptyque : the blue print of modern Sandalwood fragrance because I don’t like herbal, pickle undertone in that.

I think, I will add Shade to Collection. This is very ZEN scent to me.

8/10",04/24/24 03:35,tanaC
Shade Lush,"Sandalwood, vanilla, frankincense and something woody/ambery I can’t quite put my finger on. Very nice fragrance that almost reminds me of “Chergui Lite”. Similar style as the Serge Lutens, but much more wearable. And Shade will work in any season except for very hot/humid summer days. It is a bit synthetic, but it is well done. Good longevity and sillage as well.

I recently tried Lush fragrances for the first time and this was by far my favourite. I like that Shade is available in 30ml bottles as well. I am impressed with the Lush lineup. Well done for what I have always considered to be just a stinky soap store at the mall. 👍",04/21/24 14:02,SmellSharpe
Shade Lush,"Very light resins over nice, vanillic sandalwood. I agree with others that there's a couple things going on that aren't listed- most noticeably a little bit of bright, lemony herbal-ness on first spray- but it settles quickly. The olibanum does a lovely job of lending a good bit of not-too-sugary sweetness and some spicy complexity, but this is a woody scent first and foremost. It's very comforting and wearable, warming without falling into gourmand territory, and, imo, very well blended for the price point.",04/17/24 07:57,SaintJoanie
Shade Lush,The only Lush perfume that is good enough for me to own in 100 ml size. There is a beautiful cozy warmth to the olibanum amber that complements the freshness of the green woods. I have 30 mls of Lord of Misrule and Dirty.,04/03/24 17:14,Willowthewisp
Shade Lush,"I get a medicinal note from Shade; not harsh, but definitely a bite of herbal-something? Certainly the sandalwood isn't at the forefront of this fragrance, although there is...citrus? Shade is kind of a funky fragrance; quiet, with little of the projection of other Lush scents (which envelope you for hours in a swirling mist of lushness that few can avoid). Instead Shade sits close...so close I'm surprised that other reviewers comment on being ""commented on"" wearing it. There's no sweetness here. Its 100% unisex and 'any season' too. And not a patch of other Lushies like Breath of God or Lord of Misrule.",03/31/24 05:17,Ten2Midnight
Shade Lush,"subtle, resinous, earthy. kind of incense-y in a good way. perfect unisex woody vibe for layering. lush slayed with this hidden gem!",03/18/24 06:45,aweso10
Shade Lush,"Hm. Two separate people on two separate occasions told me I smelt great while wearing this perfume, “just like cotton candy!” Which is a nice compliment but not exactly what I was looking for when I purchased a sandalwood perfume. It smells nice and inoffensive but there’s definitely some kind of sugary note here.",03/15/24 06:46,1954film
Shade Lush,"Subtly sweet,earthy. Hint of citrus and resin/incense

Love this one from Lush. It's not too one-note heavy. It has sandalwood but not overwhelmingly so...its buttery-creamy,but not heavy as there is that brightness(citrus?).
It reminds me of fresh earth with a gourmand slant.
It personally evokes walking through dark thick woods with some illumination from sunrays breaking through the trees
Sorry. I wish I was more clear. But this is one of my faves from Lush. Another one of my go-to on the daily,when I just wanna grab a scent w/o overthinking it.",02/09/24 11:33,LUVscentsNsmells
Shade Lush,"I have this as the solid perfume, and it is surprisingly sweet on me, to the point of smelling almost gourmand. Cozy and fresh and not at all cloying. I am typically not a fan of woody scents at all, but this scent is bright and feminine, as opposed to most woodsy scents I have experienced. Very low sillage, but it lasts a long time for me.",02/06/24 15:05,dustbin
Shade Lush,"This is the best perfume Lush has ever came out with. Buttery sandalwood, lavender, palo santo, incense, touch of citrus. It delicious and so unique. This is also a very underrated product that I think deserves more attention. It’s warm and sweet but not sickly sweet which is right up my alley. Bravo lush! This is my current signature",02/05/24 13:40,suzylana1996
Shade Lush,"I can't believe this only has these two notes listed. I get a very herbal scent from it, kind of fresh, mountainy, perhaps something like fir trees as well. It is leaning a bit masculine and smells a bit like some medicine I have used before. I will see where we get with it.",01/25/24 03:48,ava96
Shade Lush,"i don't like the smell as it's drying down but after a while it just smells like bath and body vanilla sugar and also the eva nyc satin something line? i don't know dude, it was kinda disappointing. i can see why people enjoy it though.",01/23/24 17:07,professionalpansy
Shade Lush,"Smells exactly like some scented erasers I had in 2000 - 2003. Not sure if there's something rubbery about this one or whether those erasers were simply sandalwood & olibanum scented, seems kind of fancy??? As it's been mentioned, Shade has a buttery feel to it. I could never get into American Cream or Vanillary, but Shade feels more fitting on the skin. It's very smooth. And sweet but not gourmand-y.",01/18/24 20:29,hexed
Shade Lush,"light and sweet (cocoa butter sweetness was mentioned below and i'd agree), but i get far more frankincense than sandalwood. linear and pleasant. if you like frankincense, this is the scent for you! would layer nicely with almost anything. i like lush's edgier offerings (i am a freak for lush, generally) and this is Not one of them, but it's so gentle and pleasant that you can't be upset with it.",01/17/24 19:56,amethystfeline
Shade Lush,"Luxurious cocoa butter with added essential oils is what I got the first time and I was digging it. Once I got my own bottle and used it for a couple days I started to notice how it’s not as linear as I thought. The first spray starts with a medicinal lavender but it is fleeting. Within 30 seconds it’s gone and the sandalwood comes in. Nice and creamy like cocoa butter. The sweetness is a touch and that’s from the cinnamon. That lingers for a while until the olibanum oozes in. I say ooze because this isn’t a burning incense smell but a gooey resinous one. That steps side by side with the creamy sandalwood and the little piece of cinnamon.
I really enjoy this scent. Definitely sits close to the skin and develops more beautifully on skin than clothes. Doesn’t last too long but hey, it’s luxurious cocoa butter.",12/30/23 18:27,Bit0sugar
Shade Lush,"I have the solid perfume and it is the perfect nighttime scent. The sandalwood is very alluring and comforting and although the scent doesn't last very long, the convenience of it being in solid form makes it easy to reapply throughout the day in your moderation. It is definitely a staple in my perfume collection and fun to layer on top of scents.",12/09/23 00:02,imanismellsgood
Shade Lush,"I have this in the solid perfume version. The solid version has almost no silage, so you have to get right up next to your skin to smell it. I like how it gives the impression that it's just your natural scent, and it won't bother anyone around you at work. The longevity isn't great (or maybe I'm going nose-blind??!!), but I don't mind. The solid perfume was the cheapest option, after all, and applying it gives me a moment to appreciate the scent.
I especially like to use this in the fall/winter layered with a vanilla based perfume. It gives a perfect warm, woody, slightly spicy note. On its own it's nice too, with a slight natural sweetness. I think this is a very nice scent for anyone!
One last note -- I would not recommend this in summer, sadly. At least on me, it only smells good in cooler weather.",11/14/23 04:48,kestrele
Shade Lush,"this smells SO good. unfortunately i can never wear it because my first love/ex boyfriend wore it but GODDDDD this is one of the nicest simplest most delicious perfumes ever, i sampled it a few times and it really is divine. highly recommend",11/08/23 11:02,fruitypurr
Shade Lush,"Got the solid version first and had to buy the vaporizer a week later just to shower in it. Opens very sharp and floral, smelling like lavender and calendula. Develops into a creamy amber-like sandelwood with spice and incense notes. It's a comforting and natural sweet scent, perfect for rainy fall days.",11/03/23 13:04,Pssnelke
Shade Lush,"Bought the solid perfume so I cant speak for the vaporizer. Creamy and almost buttery sandalwood with a healthy dose of cinnamon and for some reason I pick up geranium though it is not listed in the notes.

Friends loved it! Only thing I wished is that I wouldn't go scent blind to it as with most other lush perfumes that I try on myself. Maybe it's the vaporizer I need?",10/26/23 01:04,villyda

Shade Lush,"I was in the store and decided to play around with their fragrances. (There are less in the shop, than on line tho..)

This one jumped at me. I like both notes that they listed.

Initial spray was harsh and unforgiving. It was very citrusy to me. It smelled like those strong orange cleaners you use to remove gunk..

After about 5-10 minutes it softened. I get this green woody note, that smells really pleasant. As time goes on, it mellows to a powered woody thing on me. I ended up buying a FB, because it was so lovely.",10/02/23 05:59,Can I smell this?
Shade Lush,"Very creamy sandalwood with a little bit of lavender, the solid is better than the spray imo but wish it would last longer than 20 minutes, even with lotion and Vaseline applied beforehand",09/12/23 09:45,MO_
Shade Lush,"Creamy sandalwood, lightly resinous with bright florals at the top. The sandalwood deepens in a very beautiful way as it develops. I’ve been testing the solid perfume so sillage and longevity are basically nonexistent, which I expected. I don’t have strong feelings about it but it’s a pleasant and inoffensive all seasons fragrance.",09/02/23 00:10,jhindsb
Shade Lush,"Within first test I really like that lavender/coumarin/tonka perfume, it reminded me of Lavender 44 from Rania J. and Sartorial.

Shade Lush,"The wind ushers the aroma of woodsy, herby floral incense, rousing you out of your sleep underneath a largely comforting tree with ample shady branches. That's what this fragrance is like; unique, ethereal, transcendent. Like many Lush fragrances, it is an experience that transports you somewhere so specific and niche, simply sublime.

I have this in the solid tin and the bottled perfume. Sensual sandalwood, frankincense and myrrh, freshly bloomed lavender that's still a tad green and fresh, subtle jasmine, or similar seductive floral to my nose⁠—definitely a fragrance for incense lovers. Very long-lasting yet intimate on the skin, darkly sweet and suggestive. An enigmatic unisex fragrance.

This is what a mythical woodland temptress adorns themself with; they offer you a guiding hand through an enchanted forest. They glide effortlessly through the trees, while you stumble and falter, you lose sight of them in the shadowy bush, yet your feet instinctively follow this bewitching scent of theirs. You wound up in a clearing, a cabin illuminated from within by candlelight and outdoor lanterns, something enthralling is in the air. They turn to you, putting your hands in theirs⁠—it is electric, mysterious, yet familiar⁠—a smile on their face. What comes after is a mystery hidden within Shade.

Darkly beautiful, very rare.",05/30/23 22:51,honeyedclover

Shade Lush,"I had such high hopes for this one but it has left me unimpressed. Longevity is above average, projection is moderate, as is the price.

Unfortunately I get no woody, powdery, amber or even Frankincense. There is sadly something in this composition that causes an instant Migraine. Maybe it's a bad batch, or it's an allergy to an oil used in the blend. I've tried a few times to give it a chance but we just don't get along.

This one will definitely be rehomed.",01/31/23 07:52,angienotesjunkie
Shade Lush,"Shade is inoffensive and pleasant, but I found I really didn't like it.

I'm sure if I smelt it on someone else I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it really bothered me being ON ME.

I think I expected more resins, more aromatics maybe, definitely more citrus. The opening had sharp medicinal lavender, which i loved, but it changed into what I can only describe as smelling of baby hygeniene products and milk formula... I felt like a safe mum type wearing it, and I am not that at all, it really doesn't work with my personality.

This was a blind buy, and for me it's a return, my initial reaction to the first spray was LOVE, but within minutes I found it offputting.",11/03/22 09:50,jasminelust
Shade Lush,"The drydown here reminds me a lot of Covet by Sarah Jessica Parker - citrus, lavender, flowers and gentle woods…. Super smooth, light and cosy. It has a similar level of sweetness but without the chocolate note. The florals smell like honeysuckle to me! So on my skin this starts with a strong lavender and citrus smell, but it dries down to smell like honeysuckle, sandalwood and tonka with a hint of a lavender incense stick smouldering in the background. Very soft. Not much projection at all, average longevity, but super pretty and comforting!

This is what I reach for when I’m having one of those sensitive days and all my (non-lush!) perfumes are all smelling super chemically to me!",10/14/22 10:46,Skinscents4Fusspots
Shade Lush,"Bergamot, lavender, ginger/cinnamon, lactonic note, tonka, resins, geranium, and vanillin….are what I get.

Shade is lactonic, aromatic, spicy, and resinous, rather than woody. It does remind me of the ‘drydown’ in another perfume by Lush, 1000 Kisses Deep (like @maelleinrome said), so I feel Shade is aptly named as it could be called a ‘Shade’ or a shadow of that frag. Just that 1000 is heavier with myrrh and more citruses and is much more intoxicating. Shade is very wearable; also smells a bit like the whole Lush shop, outside the sweet bath bomb section though, which is a bit of a turn-off.",10/07/22 11:38,TunyaPe
Shade Lush,"This is very nice, but I don’t think the predominant note is frankincense. I think this smells more like a herbal lavender in the top and benzoin/ vanilla (maybe tonka) plus soft white woods in the mid and base.",06/04/22 12:08,Cicely81
Shade Lush,"The first seconds of smelling it I thought “wow, what a lie!”. There’s nothing ambery or resinous or incensy about it (as the notes lead me to believe) until about 15minutes in -and barely. It starts off very herbal and light/watery, like (slightly rancid) lavender water, then about 15 minutes in it sweetens and warms up quite a bit and becomes a whole different scent altogether: very woody(sandalwood), some tonka, and a slight notion of a resin.
Altogether it’s very light, inoffensive and imo uninteresting, it’s a mildly pleasant-barely noticeable whatever scent. Not a safe blind buy cause I find the notes and the description to be a bit misleading, I don’t think anyone would hate it though.",04/21/22 07:05,ugly_sara_turns_it_hard
Shade Lush,"Shade smells like a Mediterranean summer - creamy sandalwood, lavender and citrus. I’ve bought this for a friend and am starting to regret not getting a bottle for myself. This and Breath of God are by far the best fragrances Lush currently has to offer - Breath of God for autumn/winter and Shade for spring/summer. And at £25 for 30ml they're so goddamn affordable... you could build such a comprehensive natural perfume wardrobe out of Lush's past and present offerings and I will never stop singing their praises",04/09/22 08:26,hotrodangel
Shade Lush,"The note list for Shade should go something like this:

Lavendar, guaiacwood, rose, olibanum, sandalwood, vanilla, and tonka bean.

Basically this is an herbal - woody - floral - incense - vanilla perfume. Shade is beautiful, totally unique, and travels a strange and fascinating path.

No doubt this is top loaded with a soft, slightly green, herbal lavendar (no wonder as Linalool is clearly a top ingredient per the list on Lush's website.) The herbal lavendar floats over the guiacwood which acts a bit crazy and roughshod--it smells of woods, tobacco, charcoal, and the whole accord kind of jumps out at you. Here and there are hints of roses, just light, almost reminding me of actual rosewood. The guiacwood calms down and then the olibanum does show up--bring facets of incense and sweeter resins. About 2 hours in you have the drydown, sandalwood, a hint of power, and vanilla, with a faint lingering of the dark guiacwood underneath. So removed from where this all started!

Shade is strange and lovely--I can't think of a perfume that smells like this does, it's so unique. Lasting power isn't bad, considering, maybe 3 to 4 hours before the very end of the drydown, and outside of the first hour or so it wears like a skin scent. I initially wore this for going to sleep, but it's nice to wear in the daytime too. I've never worn a perfume that has the guiacwood featured so prominently, it's a bit of a jarring note but I love it it lens such character to the scent.

Anyway, highly recommended, plus this is available in a 30 ml bottle, but be aware it doesn't smell anything like the description.",04/09/22 07:06,TillyWave
Shade Lush,"On me, it's strongly reminiscent of Chamomile Tea. Not bad, but not something I would like in a perfume. Also, very soft.",04/03/22 16:50,frangiris

Shade Lush,"I got the solid perfume, since it’s quite affordable, but I found it completely different from the spray, a one-note buttery sweet lemon. The perfume proper is more clearly incense, earthy and woody with the evergreen facets you often find in frankincense. Definitely worth springing for at least 30ml of the spray, as it’s strikingly smokey and mysterious-- just don’t bother with the solid perfume.",03/16/22 09:38,okamikiera
Shade Lush,"Lavender and coumarin, some warm woodsiness and the olibanum more as a calming backdrop than «incensy». Lovely, soft fragrance to relax the wearer and their surroundings.

Shade Lush,"Lush is not a company that I have tried before despite reading a lot of the reviews over the years. While on a trip we wandered into Lush and both my husband and I liked Shade. I struggle to put into words how pleasantly middle of the road it is to me. It is warm, woody, and spicy but in the most mild versions of each. It is sweet but only a whisper. It is not a beast projector but walking alongside me my husband would catch wisps of it throughout the day. I don't think I would reach for this in the heat of the summer but is is soft, cozy, creamy (but not lactonic), and very wearable.",02/15/22 18:06,SmellsLikeAdventure

Shade Lush,"I was a bit disappointed at first, expecting something with al lot of sandalwood and a bit of incense. It turned out to be more of a warm lavender kind of scent.

Shade Lush,"[Shade]
⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️

Colour: Pearl, Ivory
Texture: Velour, Silk, Skin

For me, Shade is a beautiful wearing experience. It plays with your attention, coming in and out of your consciousness. Soft pulses of powder cast in and out by the most subtle of movements. It is a gorgeous aura.

Shade is a nod to the classical fougere without the citric top. Lavender is present but it’s almost like Shade alludes to lavender without speaking it’s name, as the fragile perfume will completely fall apart if it is mentioned. The illusion is broken.

It is a travesty that Lush have marketed this beauty with just two notes (Olibanum and Sandalwood) as this perfume has so much more to offer. The sandalwood isn’t stand out to me, it just softens the base and aids the coumarin in the dry down from becoming too sickly sweet. The Olibanum adds to the phenolic nature and pairs with the herbal aspects of lavender.

In short, it’s bloody gorgeous and a release that will hopefully stick around for a while. Next on my agenda is ‘Sappho’, however I would only need the 30ml which they for some reason made unavailable soon after it’s initial release.",11/17/21 02:53,FatLipWill
Shade Lush,"Tested this today in Lush. Opening is quite intense - smoky and in your face. It then dries down to something I realised was very familiar…Serge Lutens Chergui! I love Chergui and this shares a similar drydown for a fraction of the price. On me it has that same smoky, sweet heady drydown. Very nice.",10/20/21 03:52,Danifresh
Shade Lush,"Starts with a moth killer, ugly lavender (saying that as a lover of lavender), continues to rage as hot pebbles in a spa, then dries down into an intriguing miracle that is resinous, salty, smoky, cozy, warm, and has slightly sweet after sex sweat in it.
It is interesting to find an enchantress through all that mess but oh well, love is love.",10/01/21 13:51,Lidell
Shade Lush,"Why this smells like a lighter version of 1000 kisses deep, on me? 🙄",09/29/21 05:04,maelleinrome
Shade Lush,"I was looking forward to trying this as I love sandalwood and olibanum. This isn’t a bad fragrance and for the price it is surprisingly pleasant. It smells like vanilla and cedar, with a touch of incense and pine. Somehow I detect a bit of beeswax here as well, which adds to the creamy and natural effect. I don’t get any sandalwood. I ended up buying the solid perfume as it seemed a bit creamier and I was worried that, with better projection, the scent would become nauseating.",09/19/21 13:12,mihaela_i
Metamorphosis Lush,"Since this has been discontinued for a while, I managed to get hold of an in-date full bottle on eBay as this was one I have been wanting to try. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect as the listed ingredients are a bit of a hodge-podge, but I was very pleasantly surprised. On first spray, I am immediately reminded of Fentiman’s cola, cinnamon jawbreakers or aniseed balls and Christmas potpourri. Front and centre are cloves and the same red mandarin as in their Icon perfume. There’s a dusky, antiquated background of the labdanum and sandalwood, a combination that conjures images of dark wooden furniture; the worn shelves in which the jars of spiced goodies sit. That would be the image for this perfume, an old fashioned candy shop, but by no means is this blatantly saccharine, it is very subtly sweet, hiding behind all the rich spices. If it were not for the poor projection and longevity, I would declare this perfume as one of Lush’s best. Still beautiful though.",02/11/21 02:52,A.Puppet
Metamorphosis Lush,"This is another Lush creation that I like a lot. Its an odd combination of oomph in the notes/scent itself without having a strong sillage. I find myself wanting to spray more but that does not increase the sillage. Still, the scent itself is lovely. The cloves is very noticeable and I thought it was with bergamot but notes read red mandarin as the citrus (the blood orange shown above in the notes is an error; should be corrected). There is a soft cola like scent in there, a tiny bit like in the Sikkim Girls, another Lush favourite. Metamorphosis is a little bit mysterious, a little bit incense like (maybe the sandalwood which is listed in notes, and the strong labdanum which I always like), but yet it is somehow fresh at the same time (the red mandarin and the neroli). Its a little bit like a natural version of Estee Lauder’s Youth Dew but with extra cloves. Does not change much over time on my skin. Very wearable and enjoyable, a scent you want to spend your day in. A tiny bit more projection and longevity would make this even better.",02/03/21 10:10,Frangipanilove
Metamorphosis Lush,"This is nice as a ""smell"" and a bit less effective as a ""perfume"". It has 3 distinct phases, but the volume of the first two is much, much louder than the drydown, and the first two phases are very short lived.

Metamorphosis opens with spicy woods, bitter floral, and sweet citrus. While dry woody labdanum peppered with spicy clove is the star of this show, the opening curtain is a petitgrain-leaning orange blossom and mandarin. The clove of this fragrance is very classic clean spice. The combination of petitgrain and clove are reminiscent of a fresh morning: Listerine and aftershave. The mandarin and petitgrain/orange blossom fade quickly and the labdanum and clove pervade for 2-4 hours, the clove fades, then the labdanum as well. The labdanum is dry--no amber or resin here--very woody and dark. The last hurrah of the fragrance is a skinscent that is reminiscent of a dry myrrh or a very modern sandalwood, albeit at a barely detectable level.

I believe the inclusion of ""benzoin"" in the Fragrantica notes is a mistake. Though ""benzyl benzoate"" is a component of the materials, there is no balmy vanilla benzoin smell anywhere in this fragrance.

As someone who loves labdanum, cloves, woods, and spicy chypres but enjoys an occasional break from oakmoss, this smell hit the spot for me for late summer/early fall daytime wear. It's not ""pretty"" but it is ""interesting"" and it definitely smells ""good"". To my nose it's perfectly unisex.

Unfortunately, the longevity is short and there is very little development. But it's a nice straightforward Autumn scent nevertheless.",11/20/19 15:49,amberonic
Yog Nog Lush,VERY butter-y. Not bad but I only briefly smelled that in the air so take that how you will,11/12/25 11:52,RDUK
Yog Nog Lush,"I'm soo confused by this one. At first, it is POTENT and will have you smell like burnt butter for like one hour. Then after 2 hours, you start to smell the spicy cloves with a hint of caramel... It might be pleasant for some but not for me. I don't think it smells like gingerbread at all. But after 4+ hours... !!! It blooms into a wonderful caramel vanilla scent with a hint of spice and musk... Not too sweet either (imo) It's so so SO delicious I can't get enough of it. This had me smelling my own arms like a freak. Unfortunately I am STILL not sure if I really want to spend $35 on a scent I can't stand for the first 5 hours lol
It's a quite complex fragrance and really good value for its price . also it lasts forever",11/10/25 12:53,annawawa

Horrendous and not worth it. i'll just stick to the shower gel",11/10/25 09:41,annalovesrian
Yog Nog Lush,"This smells like a gingerbread cookie! It's sweet and gourmand but dry and spicy from the clove. The clove in this is pretty strong, which comes across like ginger or cinnamon to my nose. The clove is almost too spicy for me but as it dries down, it calms down to a more chai-like smell. This also smells similar in ways to Killian's Angel Share in terms of that sort of spicy cinnamon sweetness that I get in that fragrance as well. A little bit goes a long way with this one, like most of the Lush body sprays, so you only need so spray about 2-3 sprays maximum. I like this one but if I had to pick from the plethora of gourmand body sprays Lush makes, Let the Good Times Roll is my all-time favorite (yes, even over the ever-so popular Sticky Dates).",11/05/25 18:57,misssamantha017

Yog Nog Lush,"Copy of my review under the perfume on September 24th, 2024, back when the body spray wasn't on Fragrantica.

This was back in stock as body spray two days ago and I managed to grab a bottle before it disappeared again from the site.
It came today and I smell zero resemblance to Unknown Pleasures, but 80% (almost a dupe) to the discontinued Vanille Charnelle by Annick Goutal, which I own. The ""eggy"" effect is due to the ylang ylang - vanilla combo. Yog Nog has cloves on top, which is all you can smell in the initial blast, so I suggest to refrain from smelling/judging it the first 10 minutes. When the cloves subside, this is a very nice gourmand vanilla pudding with gingerbread dry down.
Very lovely and not too strong: well done, Lush!",10/23/25 16:54,OfTheValley

Yog Nog Lush,"Lush scents can start off as scents for one with an acquired and quirky taste (or sense of smell). Yog Nog is no exception. It starts off with an enormous blast of buttery, creamy caramel. However, somewhere around the 10 minute mark it gets a weird sour quality that kinda throws off the scent, and that lingers for a good 15 minutes before the buttery caramel returns to the forefront, now joined with spices that a reminiscent of the ginger cookies spice mix, without the ginger. Kinda chai-ish as mentioned, but less strong than that.

After an hour it is fully evolved and what remains is that chai being front and center, with the caramel in the background. Kind of the adult sister of SDJ 71. More spice, less vanilla-y caramel.

Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"I have never been a fan of rose in perfumes... or so I thought. I bought it because I was intrigued by it being a rose ""jam"", thinking maybe it would be a little bit fruity.

The day it arrived, I sprayed it and the rose seemed super overpowering. Within a half hour, it mellowed into a delicious, almost berry ""jam"" scent (which I was so excited about!) The rose was still there, just not as intense. Hours later, I still smell the rose and the jam, but also a very light powdery note. I went from being intrigued but concerned about the rose to this being pretty much my favorite perfume right now.

I spray it at all times of day because I love the scent, not because I need to, because the longevity is surprisingly good. I have sprayed it before leaving for work, no re-applying, and still smell it when I get home 10 hours later. Lots of compliments whenever I wear it too. I also sometimes like to layer it with American Cream also by Lush.

didn't like it much the first hour, the citrus was too strong, which i'm not too crazy about . but the rose starts to take centre stage and it's combined with something creamy. i simply fell in love then.

I hate the packaging. It looks like you'll launch an acid attack if you whip it out in public, not to mention the sprayer lets out too much product! Good thing it is easy to decant. I decanted mine into 10ml purse sprays. This is by far my favorite rose fragrance. Sweet, jammy, turkish delight rose with a tingle of citrus. Deep, multidimensional, sophisticated but still fun. I have Imogen Rose (also by Lush) and that one is a potted rose plant, doused with a lot of powdered makeup. Rose Jam, however, is a dessert type rose. I prefer the latter now. The 200 ml body spray is going to last me for years.",10/12/18 03:15,over_caffeine
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"body spray: Sweet, rosy-floral, and lemony. Delectable, especially as it dries down. Powdered sugar covered rose Turkish delight, but with a burst of lemon. Smells middle-eastern at times. This does not smell like the powdery-vanilla-rose toys of our childhood.
In my opinion, the bottle always sprays out way too much, as it's more of a perfume than a body spray.",10/04/18 17:44,moonbeams 1
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"The body spray is, as per usual with Lush/Gorilla perfumes, SURPRISINGLY long-lasting.
The rose is very natural, and seems to kind of move in and out of the picture despite being the strongest and most recognizable note.
I didn't get the citrus at all, the parts outside of the rose smell very herbal and earthy to me.",10/04/18 09:43,hexed

Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"Oohhh….. now this IS nice.

I was browsing in Lush the other day and had a test of their body sprays with the weird-looking caps. I liked several from the range, but I fell in love with Rose Jam straightaway. I wasn't expecting to, because although I love the smell of roses, I often find rose perfumes too light or subtle for my taste.

Well, as is typical of Lush perfumes, subtle is the last word you'd use to describe this. It's rich, strong, deep, rosy, lemony, intoxicating and gorgeous. As someone else mentioned, it really does smell like magical Turkish Delight. It has that enchanting, narcotic quality to it.

It's powerful stuff, not for the faint-hearted, and a spray or two is enough to last all day if not longer. And that's just the body spray, so I can't imagine what the EDP must be like!

I ended up getting the shower gel too, which is also beautiful. Again, a little goes a long way, so I imagine both of these will end up being better value for money that they might first appear.",08/31/18 05:45,bohemianrhapsody
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"* black bottle body mist *

I finally got a 100 ml bottle of this in a trio with a body conditioner and shower gel.
HOLY MOLY. This stuff is BOMB.

First of, let me tell you that
1) I love rose
2) this is the only body mist and only fragrance in general that literally lasts through EVERYTHING

longevity, projection, and sillage are just incomparable to anything I have ever owned, any EDP or EDT, whether celebrity or designer.

I am in awe. I spray this on my hair at night and I smell it soooooo strongly in the morning, I smell like a beautiful rose! I smell this through a full day of work, 3 hours of hot yoga, cold, rain, heat, ALWAYSSSSS

The quality of this product is outstanding as you can clearly feel that it's not one of those cheap diluted alcohol flowery scents or whatever. I honestly fell in love with this.
I got a trio for 50 CAD dollars which includes a 100 ml body spray. It is incredible how this BODY SPRAY is much stronger than any any any perfumes I own!",06/27/18 07:23,Albiretu
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"To my taste, this is the best rose perfume ever!
HOWEVER,it is completely different than all the other rose scents. It is NOT the typical , classic rose scent. It is sweeter, more """"sugary""""...like a cake icing which smells like roses. If it was a rose, it would be a hot pink one...a fuchsia! <3 it!",05/12/18 05:01,Bella B
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"Lately I've been kicking myself for not hopping on the Lush train sooner. Talk about a way to step up your self-care game. And, as your token rose lover...let's just say I'm positively head over heels. Rose Jam has become a bit of a holy grail rose for me, so I can't guarantee an objective review. (Is a perfume review ever TRULY objective?)

Imagine: a bed of roses, macerated beneath lovers entwined, petals crushed again and again between fingertips and palms. There's a heady, surging undercurrent of sinfully dark vanilla oil massaged into skin. Then, from above, yet another fresh fall of velvet red rose petals covering their gorgeously spent bodies, dewed with sweat and the brief, tart lemon edge of passion. (There's a reason I'm not in ad copy, but I've thought about trying my hand at schlocky romance novels.)

There is a persistent aura of sweetness, ripeness, and even an overt edge of decay in these layers of roses and vanilla. And for me, the decay is what keeps Rose Jam interesting, narcotic, compelling, and above all things, gorgeously naturalistic. This is no ordinary rose fragrance, and admittedly, it skirts the very edge of my tolerance of gourmands, which is very slim indeed. For all my repulsion of intensely sweet scents, I can't help but imagine this is a shade of the darkly enchanted Turkish Delight Jadis offered to poor naive Edmund. I am ensnared completely. It IS edible. But it is also stunningly true-rose, in the flower's most resplendent stages, even as the edges of the petals start to blacken and wither. ""Honey"" is another note that other reviewers have mentioned, and I think this is what I may be personally reading as ""decay,"" with its slight animalic edge.

I have the body spray in the terrifically ugly black windex-like bottle. The sillage is MASSIVE. The longevity equally so, at upwards of 12+ hours on my skin. Two tiny sprays will positively fill a room for days on end, in the most spellbinding, intoxicating way. This is absolutely not a safe blind buy, and I strongly recommend trying either the bubbleroon, shower gel, shower lotion, or Ro's Argan soap to see if this is a scent that would work for you. Though it was love at first sniff for me, the edge of decay and overwhelming sweetness could prove an issue for some, even other hardcore rose fanatics.

Valentine's Day is coming up, and I can't think of a better way to fall in love. Rose Jam is a marvelous indulgence with remarkable heft and beauty par excellence. Friends, treat yourselves!",02/11/18 15:20,Silkselkie
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"My daughter bought me a gift trio of the LUSH House “Ro’s Argan” scented body products for Christmas. I had to do a bit of research to discover that the 2017 Holiday edition of Rose Jam is apparently the same formulation of the one everyone loved from 2013 that the line brought back at the request of hard core Rose Jam groupies, & I can understand why LUSH was petitioned to re-create its return. It matches the Ro’s Argan scent which is available in shampoo bars, body butters, body washes, bombs & soaps, to delightfully scent ones self f/head to toe. (Although I can’t even fathom the strength of scent you’d be dealing with!) I craved more of this intoxicating scent, & on last weekends trip to Victoria, BC, I spent the good part of an hour at the LUSH store trying to plan on fitting as much ROSE scent in to my suitcase that I could JAM in.
Rose Jam is one of the most intriguing scents I now own. The complexity of the scent seems to lie within its simplistic notes & they work together to create a Jam that is so damn good you will literally find yourself unashamedly using words like, “swoon”, “narcotic”, and “nirvana” when speaking of it aloud.
Vanilla is not listed above in the data description as a note, but it is in fact listed in the description on the front of my black opaque spray bottle my husband purchased for me as an early Valentine’s Day gift.
The bottle reads as follows:
“A sweet, fruity rose & vanilla-scented mist that’ll leave you with a trail of admirers.”
This stuff is a powerhouse. Spray judiciously & I would not recommend wearing this within an enclosed office space or to church. It’s too strong (in a good way).
I tested 2-3 small sprays (it was a body spray after all, not perfume & a couple of hours later my son’s fiancée commented that if I were to get lost or separated f/ them, all they’d need to do is follow their noses to find me! We went to the theater later that evening & I felt self conscious as I had only brought one coat to wear on our trip, & I was afraid the scent, still radiating off of my jacket, would offend noses of others sitting w/in a square mile radius of my seat.
In general, I do not gravitate toward rose scents, (exceptions: Yves Rosher Rose Absolute, Estée Lauder’s Very Estee), but I literally may be addicted to this. In my head, the recipe card for Rose Jam reads like this:

Rose Jam~
Oil from 20,000 deeply colored, LUSH-ly scented distilled Turkish rose petals
500 marshmallows dredged in powdered confectioners sugar
Extract of 100 Madagascar vanilla beans
200 lemons, ( including zest)
20 ounces geranium oil
80 lbs sun ripened berries, mashed
20 bags full of captured hot August summer air from Sofia, Bulgaria
1 1/2 gallons artisan Swiss glacier water

Mix together in large, antiquated, smooth wooden vat. Let set for 2-4 years. Dogs, cats, & children will be called to you. Apply with caution.
Enjoy! ❤️",02/05/18 12:07,AWHIFFANDAPRAYER
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"I have this as a body spray, but it's very strong and long-lasting, stronger than many EDPs. It's easy to overdo it, but if you spray once into your hair, you get a delicious whiff of honey rose every time you turn your head. Today I overdid it - sprayed twice - and it is getting on my nerves a bit, because the smell becomes too sweet and sticky.
You can get it from a Lush store in Germany.

Update: By now I have permanently switched to using it as a room spray, because it is too strong and straightforward, I couldn't manage wearing it as a perfume. But what a fantastic room spray it makes! I spray it on my bathroom curtain, and it stays for 2 days. It has a perfect balance of sweetness and watery rose freshness for this purpose. As a rose perfume I now use the oils by Abdul Karim Al Faransi.",01/03/18 01:57,Molly Smith
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"A very well named scent. So jammy and mouth watering. Reminds me of these rose flavored candy chews i used to get from Japan.

The opening is strong. Scent stays pretty much the same throughout. Only less intense in the drydown yet i detect an incredible tobacco like note when the scent tames down. Very well could be tonka.

I love this for fall & winter. Maybe even a spring night.",06/06/17 09:45,fyrewoman
Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"This is now sold as a LUSH ""Body Spray"" (more like a real perfume however as it's super strength and lasts for hours), that you can only buy from the Oxford Street (London) LUSH Store or occasionally from the ""Lush Kitchen"" on their website.

Rose, geranium and lemon all mix nicely to create a Moorish, sweet floral perfume that actually has punch and surprising depth. I could see people wearing this in Winter but also Summer, day or evening, seems very versatile.

Lots of comments already define this as a female scent which I would agree with to an extent. However the floral notes are not particularly overpowering and the rose is balanced out by the overall sweetness, so I think young men in general would be able to get away with this easily if they like the scent. A mature man in a suit however... No way.

Not many LUSH scents can claim this, but the current formulation of Rose Jam (Body Spray - Early 2017) is in beast mode. This stuff has nuclear longevity that just goes on and on, especially when sprayed on clothes or in the house. With that in mind I was really concerned about the projection as very sweet perfumes sometimes have a tendency to become invasive and sickly to other people quite quickly. Surprisingly however, on the skin I found it sticks fairly close to you.

It's not overly sophisticated or mature, but I'm still really impressed by this perfume actually. It seems well crafted, and put together nicely.

My only gripe is that from a distance or in the general area it scores 9/10 but when you get in close to the skin for a sniff, the scent is very different and smells almost bitter and harsh, borderline unpleasant. So Overall - 7/10",05/29/17 03:24,Knuxs

Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"This scent is beautiful, girly, romantic, and delicious! I tried out the shower gel first, and immediately had to hunt down the perfume (which now only comes out sparingly on the Lush Kitchen website). I was able to grab a bottle from eBay, and I'm in love.

I would say that ""Rose Jam"" is an appropriate name to describe the scent. The rose notes are the most prominent, but it is blended so beautifully with the lemon and the geranium that there's a sweet zest to it. While this site doesn't list it as one of the notes, the shower gel label mentions that there is some vanilla in here as well, which adds to more of the sweetness.

I feel like the floral notes, the citrus notes, and the vanilla note all blend together to smell like a rosy strawberry jam. Like others have stated, ""floral gourmand"" is quite an apt name for this fragrance.

This has become of my all-time favorites, to be honest. Every time I wear it, I can't stop smelling my wrists!",03/29/16 00:47,spiderleenie

It will dust out everyone around you 10 feet the first hour. I'm used to very strong perfume but I had to roll my windows down! I put it on right before I got in the car. I absolutely love this stuff and can see me finishing my bottle which is something I never do. This has hoardability!

Rose Jam 2013 Lush,"Very decadent! Like others, I fell for the RoseJam Bubbleroon and then went hunting for the fragrance. I layer up with the shower gel and Ro's Argan body conditioner, too. The scent lasts well into the day after it's applied, and lasts a really long time on clothing. Gotta watch the Lush Kitchen or ebay to get it anymore. Seriously, Lush needs to make it part of the permanent collection.

Floral/gourmand for sure! My only complaint is that it can give me a headache after awhile. So sad. Sometimes I just tough it out though, because it smells so deliciously amazing.


EDIT: So I've been trying out the Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab products, and OMG, their ""Alice"" from the ""Alice in Wonderland"" line smells so similar, and, in fact, smells BETTER to me! ""Alice"" is a slightly warmer scent, like more powdery cookie, but I layered it with the ""Ro's Argan"" body conditioner and the ""Jason and the Argan Oil"" shampoo bar and I smell DELIGHTFUL. I'm so happy to have found this, no more overpriced ebay hunting for ""Rose Jam.""

It smells heavenly...like a mix of rose turkish delight and rosehip jam! The fragrance is very similar to the shower gel, only it has slightly more prominent rose note.

It lasts very long time and has good sillage. I also love the fact that they blend real essential oils, none of that cheap synthetic stuff.

Update: I wore it to bed last night despite ""no perfumes in bed"" policy enforced by my other half. It smells so much like my shower gel that he didn't even notice I was wearing one.

If you love rose, or even if you don't but want to ease into it, you have to try this. Also, if you've tried Ro's Argan Body Conditioner or Rose Jam Bubbleroon by LUSH, this is the same scent. :) Longevity is moderate/average, same as with other LUSH scents. Sillage is moderate, which is nice. I feel very comforted when I wear this.

Somehow less than the sum of its parts. The materials used here are gorgeous, however the execution falls short.

The “I’m Home” sentiment here is closer in tone to a crazed Jack Nicholson axing down the front door, instead of the intended image of a loved one returning home to the welcome of baked goods. It is brash and crude.

The aggressive winter spices lift an extremely heavy cocoa / coffee liqueur accord and that’s about all the entertainment you get here. The perfume has too many unfinished edges to be a comforting experience. It feels like an octagon in a brief demanding circles.

I'm Home Lush,"To me, this is a very dark cocoa liqueur with hints of black coffee. These notes then mingle with a sweet, warm and creamy vanilla as you get to the dry down.

This is such a beautiful scent, but it was definitely an acquired taste for me. This was a blindbuy and I got interested in this perfume as I loooveee Lush's Vanillary, vanilla and chocolate/cocoa notes. People describing ""I'm Home"" as a cup of hot chocolate got me excited.

Needless to say that it was far from smelling like a cup of sweet, hot chocolate on me. I'm a sucker for boozy notes and coffee in perfume too but I was not having this chocolate/coffee liqueur situation I just described earlier, at all. I'm Home felt too pungent, vintage and masculine to my nose. To my dismay, both projection and longevity were insanely powerful. I was super disappointed of my blindbuy and reflecting on selling my bottle.

I nearly needed an entire year to appreciate it and then fall head over heels over it. I guess spraying it on paper from time to time help me appreciate its different nuances more and more. I would let a paper strip lay in my bedroom an get surprised by how beautiful and inviting it would make the entire room smell. Also, my mom would always compliment the way my bedroom would smell while the paper strip would be going strong, and she's generally not a fan of gourmand nor chocolate/cocoa notes. She would also compliment me when I would actually wear the fragrance on my skin, when I ended enjoying it.

Believe me when I say I would never think about selling this beauty again, ever! I'm so happy to own it, it's one of my favourite and most precious fragrance now--- I've never smelled anything like it. The very dark, liquorish, unsweet cocoa punctuated with a distant, bitter coffee before opening to a sweet and creamy vanilla in the end. It's such a beautiful story unfolding on your skin and clothes. It completely blooms in the cold, winter weather and in the warmth of your home when you snuggle in your fluffy cardigan. It may not be a hot cup of chocolate, but it's surprisingly more complex and better. It envelops you with its warmth and incredible yet unsuspected generosity. No matter where you go, you're always home. You're loved, cherished and protected.

It works wonderfully with Al-Rehab Choco Musk roll-on oil. The oil is much sweeter, creamier, more vanillic after you leave it to age a bit. Its more people-pleasing sugariness mixes perfectly with I'm Home's boozier, darker and more bitter opening and middle phases.

It's a pity Lush doesn't sell it anymore, it's so unique among its current offerings. I have yet to smell more cocoa/chocolate-centric fragrances but so far it's nothing like I've smelled before. As a reference, I've tried:
- CSP Amour de Cacao -> owned it, underwhelming and short-lived fruity milk chocolate
- Montale's Chocolate Greedy -> owned it, realistic fruity and chocolate cake batter with hints of coffee and vanilla, but bears Montale's infamous synthethic DNA
- Chabaud's Lait & Chocolat -> tested on a paper strip, realistic sweet milk chocolate, seems really yummy
- HB's Private Accord for Her -> tested on a paper strip, a more conventionally-pleasing subtle, perfumey chocolate, but not bold nor gourmand enough for my liking
- Akro Dark -> tested on a paper strip, a dark, dry, powdery cocoa, feels very unique and interesting but not as gourmand as I'm Home
- Guerlain's Gourmand Coquin -> tested on a paper strip, a very elegant, delicate and romantic floral chocolate, but I didn't get to smell it for a long time so I have yet to witness the evolution of the chocolate note
- Cacharel's Yes I am Delicious -> tried on skin, more gourmand and slightly bolder on the chocolate note than Private Accord for Her, more long-lasting than Amour de Cacao, but still, is a perfumey chocolate-scent + fades into a white floral perfume as time goes by

Just wanted to add a recap of my references, in case it could help anyone deciding on whether to blindbuy I'm Home or not 😉",01/13/23 15:00,ChocoLei
I'm Home Lush,"In this order
Jasmine, tonka, vanilla, cocoa and citrus.

Mainly a Jasmine and tonka scent and the vanilla just adds sweetness. It's more like sugar then actual vanilla. Burns the nose a bit. It's pretty though. Kind of smells like their hair milk. Also has a sliiight bug spray scent but I think it's animalic Jasmine mixing with the spicy tonka. It's very sweet but it does not smell like vanilla. It smells like a candied Jasmine and tonka fragrance. Also seems like the kind of scent that would smell better far way or in the air.

Edit: my boyfriend didn't seem to be a huge fan. If you want something gourmand get turmeric latte. He loves that one.",12/10/22 20:08,MaxieF
I'm Home Lush,"Gorilla I’m Home (2016) - vanilla cocoa - On a relaxing day, sometimes you need a fragrance as cozy as this #simonconstantine creation. Heavy in naturals and quite dense (vs. Guerlain’s Charnel Elixir), it’s a combination of Cocoa Absolute, Vanilla absolute, and Benzoin. So you’ll get a hot cocoa beside the fireplace vibe. The vanilla adds a delicious smooth element. I also get some cooking spices like Anise and Cinnamon, while I get floral elements from Rose and Neroli to balance the formulation.",04/23/22 18:34,brokesta911
I'm Home Lush,I love this one I wish it wasn't discontinued.Its a rich cozy potent indulgence of coffee cocoa and spice.It layers nicely w chocolate greedy to bring out more of the cocoa.Even though some of the Lush line can be on the pricey side I'd pay it no prob if they still produced it since it is potent and fills a void in my collection.I scored a great deal on a full 100ml bottle that I'll savor until I can hopefully find something close to it or another backup of this.,06/26/21 10:35,mimi406
I'm Home Lush,"Whoa. I was *shocked* with how potent this perfume is. It's syrupy sweet and I frankly can't think of a time or place to wear this except when I'm at home lounging in my pajamas drinking my pumpkin spice latte or something similar. This isn't really office friendly or date night scent. It's also not a comforting scent per se because it's a bit smokey. It's different but I think I can get used to this one.

UPDATE: This is my staple perfume when at home, and because it's quarantine, I'm at home most of the time. I love it! It also lasts long on my clothes.",04/22/21 03:55,ScarletAnyaBlack
I'm Home Lush,"This in no way smells like anything listed above for replica , it is dominated by fig which isn’t listed and is absolutely deep syrupy and sweet and I’m in love 😻, the cinnamon is absolutely gorgeous in this , what a beautiful scent I’m in love",03/15/21 11:00,karlee79
I'm Home Lush,"Bitter coffee with a dash of cocoa and spices. It takes several minutes for a medicinal vanilla to peak through, which smells similar to the myrrh-vanilla in Mugler Alien Absolue. Hours later, the medicinal quality turns into rum-soaked bread. It's sweeter on my clothes than on my skin. I like this more than Cardamom Coffee as a coffee scent. Only really good in deep winter, but a nice comfy scent for cold mornings nonetheless.

Notes according to my nose (in order of prominence): coffee, aromatic spices, cocoa, sweet vanilla, astringent rum",03/01/21 17:21,Enigmatic
I'm Home Lush,"Everyone I knew hated this. But I secretly lovely it. Coffee, chocolate and something ooh la la. This fragrance didn't perform well but it had an unforgettable smell. I wish I knew who stole it from my bedroom.",02/05/21 15:25,sameenuk
I'm Home Lush,"Is there any cardamom in here? I checked the ingredients but there isn't any though I could swear I could smell it (I'm Lebanese and let me tell you, that cardamom tinge is unmistakable (blame years of drinking Arabic coffee spiked with cardamom mmmm).

To me, this smells like they took Cardamom Coffee and Vanillary and mushed them together, maybe adding some cacao in there but honestly it's not that prominent to my nose at least.",01/30/21 05:15,Celphie
I'm Home Lush,"So, to *me*, it smells spicey-sweet, a bit of honey, bit of vanilla. I dont smell the cocoa at all. Its a very warm scent, it makes me feel incredibly comfortable and safe. I think the name is very well fitting. To me, it also smells almost a little bit leathery and metallic, like an old gym, but thats pretty well hidden behind the sweetness. Its not a shameless in your face kind of sweetness, its more sophisticated imo, with some sour and some spice mixed in. Ive worn it all year round although i would say its more of a winter and fall scent. A personal favorite.",01/21/21 07:38,Kam
I'm Home Lush,"Sadly, my nose struggles with chocolate notes. They frequently come across as smoky, if I can smell them at all. To me, this is a ""Not at all"" perfume and the chocolate note hasn't left alone, it seems to have taken any notes of vanilla or rum along with it. I am very fond of other LUSH gourmand scents, Vanillary, Snowcake and so on, but this one left me very disappointed.",01/11/21 09:08,Lyndale
I'm Home Lush,"I love it and I don’t know why it is discontinued.

I bought the solid version and I enjoyed every drop.

I wanted to buy the full bottle but I found it expensive , just for acquiring that chocolate, vanilla and balsamic effect in my skin.

I found that I could bring this aromatic effect , by using cocoa butter; vanilla, myrrh or amber essence ( or even perfume ), and I saved allot of money.",12/28/20 01:14,YlangLover0912
I'm Home Lush,"Unique fragrance that smells like fall and winter holidays. The smell of your home during baking season! It is very nice but definitely a fragrance I have to be in the mood for. Not an every day kind of scent. I use around 4 sprays which is light for me since I typically am an heavy sprayer. I find if I spray more than four sprays it becomes cloying.

It lists three notes but there seems to be so much more in there.

Longevity with 4 sprays is around 5 hours on me
Sillage is around arm's length
Recommend: yes if you like gourmand fragrances that are sweet and spicy.",12/04/20 06:50,DebiL1211
I'm Home Lush,"Yummy vanilla with a few drops of rum. I perceive heliotrope in there too, and a bit of jasmine.
I like it, but I have to be in the mood for it, it’s not something I would often reach for. I need my perfumes to take me out, not to remind me i’m home.

I'm Home Lush,"This is a really unique scent. Lots of cacao powder and benzoin warmth. Quite intense and a little bit bitter, like pure dark chocolate is. For cold winter days.",08/05/20 15:57,Cicely81
I'm Home Lush,"It's a real shame Lush decided to discontinue this beauty. I got myself a few backup bottles because I love it that much. It is so simple- cacao, vanilla, and benzoin, yet it smells so much more complex, probably because the perfume is natural and not full of synthetic materials. It smells so comforting- sweet, a tad spicy, a tad powdery, and very warm and inviting like rich vanilla bean ice cream with the real vanilla flecks in it. There is also an almost woody aspect. It gives me a Christmas vibe but without all the spices- in fact there are no added spices in this, but there is a natural spice that comes from that gorgeous natural cacao and vanilla. The scent is just heaven and even though I own over 200 perfumes, I find myself craving this over and over. I am so glad I was able to snag a 100 mL on eBay at a good price before it gets impossible to find. And if you like this, I think you will also love Cardamom Coffee, which is in a similar vein, albeit not discontinued, yet (they already stopped carrying the smaller sizes though, but still offer a 100 mL for $200).",07/21/20 14:36,fullbottleworthy
I'm Home Lush,"Apple pie and cinammon or gingerbread dough. This is 100% gourmand and I like it!

I'm Home Lush,"I love this perfume.. but I had to let it go because I think I’m allergic to something in it :(
I still have the solid perfume so I can smell it now and then.
It is now discontinued.
I’ve been searching and searching for something similar, and nothing compares. It has this warmth that you can almost feel when you smell it. I haven’t found that same experience from any other fragrance.

This right here is the perfume that has sent me on a “find the most perfect oriental” journey. Which has been tough, because I’m extremely picky.

It’s so well blended, and linear. But in a good way in my opinion. I can’t smell any particular note. But it still smells so wonderful.
Every perfume I’ve tried (so far) with similar notes are always very non-linear. I can always smell the cocoa, the vanilla and the spices separately.. which isn’t bad, just doesn’t fill the void I now feel I have without this in my collection.
I hope to find another wonderfully blended spicy/sweet scent like this.",05/13/20 16:14,elizurofsinai
I'm Home Lush,"Burnt cacao scent - in I say that in the best meaning of the words possible!

As others have said, this scent is like sitting next to a fireplace at home and having hot cocoa with marshmellows.

Very feel good, but still extremely sophisticated and complex. Not an overly sweet scent.",02/12/20 16:56,JustSimpleThings
I'm Home Lush,"I pray this never gets discontinued. Reminds me of my grandma's house during Christmas. Warm cinnamon rolls and sweet potato casserole baked fresh in the oven with brown sugar crumbles, cinnamon spice candles burning, and little me sitting cozy next to the fireplace with hot chocolate and cartoons.

The warmth of the friction combined with the intoxicating sweetness that intertwines so beautifully with the spices...Pure Nostalgia. Not for everyday wear, but that is my personal preference.

I have moved out of the country to attend university now almost 20 years later. Every now and then if I feel sad or empty, I will spritz a bit on my wrists and rub them together. Then I'm home again.",01/15/20 08:42,ashercore

I'm Home Lush,"I spritzed this on at a Lush store before heading to the cinema and hated it. I'm not a gourmand lover, and I'm Home smelled like a particularly offensive take on the scent family, as though someone had eaten a sickly-sweet vanilla sundae and then used the bowl as an ashtray.

BUT! I kept getting whiffs of it during the film and at dinner after, and it just got warmer, cozier, and lovelier as the night wore on. I found myself back at Lush a few days later buying a full bottle. It's not an overly sophisticated scent, but as far as comforting, homemade-smelling gourmands go, it's a beautiful confection of sweet vanilla, bitter cacao, and a slightly burnt, smoky crust. It's definitely worth considering now that it's being discontinued and is half off. And weirdly, I've come to like that cigarette-butt-and-dessert opening.",01/11/20 23:01,GenevaX

It’s impossible to fight with someone wearing this fragrance.

It doesn’t seem to be discontinued as I see it the website (France) and in the shops in Europe.",11/26/19 10:48,ViouAmara

I'm Home Lush,"At first, testing on a paper strip, the vanilla base seemed the same as in Vanillary, which I dislike, so it was a pass for me.
Trying a few weeks later on skin, I loved it! It is as simple as the notes sound: cacao, vanilla, benzoin. But I swear I smell coffee and also burnt sugar in the dry down. It's long lasting and with decent sillage: I got whiffs of it for hours. I don't find it too sweet at all, but still a gourmand. Very comforting indeed. I plan to get a small bottle today.",08/17/19 04:28,Cajou
I'm Home Lush,"Since I went ‘cruelty free’ I’ve been looking for an alternative to my signature, Mugler’s Angel EDP. This is really nice!

It’s like walking through a soft cloud of cocoa powder, with smooth vanilla and warm powdery benzoin. Somehow... burnt sugar and candy floss are also present.

Performance isn’t as good as some Lush scents but adequate for 6 hours with soft/moderate sillage.

Lovely!",07/26/19 13:03,muncierobson
I'm Home Lush,"I got the solid version of I'm Home yesterday. I wore it today to work, and I swear I received 3 compliments in under 15 mins. I could not believe it. Most days I wear Angel edP, Angel Muse edP, Opium edP, TF Tobacco Vanille or recently TF Lost Cherry...and a compliment comes in here and there, but LUSH I'm Home must work very well on my skin!
I mostly smell a rich, deep vanilla and cardamom. On my skin, I do not smell any chocolate or cacao. Longevity on me is a good 3-4 hours, and then not gone, but a comforting skin scent. I can see layering this with their I'm Home spray parfum or any other boozy vanilla.
I'm impressed.",05/31/19 18:43,Deutsch100

I'm Home Lush,"There's definitely cardamom in here. I use this spice a LOT in cooking / baking and it's undeniable to me. It's a rich, spicy scent, and I would say quite sweet. There are hints of cocoa but that's not as powerful as the cardamom (to my nose) Definitely has that signature lush vibe. That said I'm not sure this one will be a keeper for me...it's a bit more potent than I normally like to wear.",04/07/19 06:06,Cherry_Darling
I'm Home Lush,"A nice, resinous gourmand, and one of my favourites from the Lush line. You can smell every note from the beginning, it's more that their intensity changes over time. The first spray has a bite to it, almost like citronella/bug spray (but in the best way!) from the benzoin. The benzoin also gives the perfume heat, which is where the 'cosy/fireplace' branding comes from, but I live in a warm climate and for me it's more of a burning summer scent. That's the beauty of orientals - in colder climates they are Christmas-y, and closer to the equator they are humid and spicy tropicals.

I'm Home is not overly sweet and most of that comes from the vanilla (the same blend in Lush's Vanillary, to my nose). I don't get much cacao, and it's not a powdery chocolate scent by any means. The cacao notes are more in the periphery, similar to the way cocoa is used as a background note in Mesoamerican cooking to add heat and complexity; an Aztec cacao.

Good longevity and moderate sillage. As the perfume wears on the benzoin mellows and you're left with a deep and lingering vanilla. This is a good perfume to spray in the morning that you can then layer with another later in the day/at night. I have the EDP, which I recommend, but it is one of the few Lush fragrances that translates well to their solid perfume format.",02/26/19 20:22,cartimandua
I'm Home Lush,"This perfume is so wonderful, so gorgeous and it suits me so well. I have gotten so many compliments that I smell so good.

I'm Home Lush,"Hmm... Just tested this from a decanted sample kindly sent by Hell Commander.

On first spraying, I get a hint of cocoa... But then, on drydown, the cocoa departs and all I am getting is a smoky vanilla. Unfortunately, the smoke has a somewhat tar-like quality, which reminds me of cigarettes and ashtrays; as an ex-smoker, I can't bear the smell!

I'll give this another try in a few days time, as I hate to dismiss a perfume out of hand on only one test.",02/19/19 07:20,corkscrewcurly
I'm Home Lush,"Very nice, sweet and comfortable. I get all the notes. Not a lot of projection or longevity, but a semi-closed to skin scent. Reminds me of Abdes Salaam Attars Perfumes Amber Chocolate. Even if there is no amber, the benzoin's sweet resonous quality makes it similar, although not identical.",01/22/19 13:20,maemorin
I'm Home Lush,"I have tried this twice, and it has become on of my favourite Lush perfumes. On me, it smelled like a smoky hot chocolate, or drinking hot chocolate in front of a fireplace, if you will. Which makes the name very fitting.

What are your experiences with Lush cream perfumes?",01/05/19 05:29,alidak
I'm Home Lush,"hmm, at first this smells bready on me. literally smells like a piece of bread or muffin or something. it's quite strange and not what i expected. i guess that's the cacao? maybe this just isn't working with my skin chemistry. i get a hint of something mildly spicy...so it smells like mildly spiced bread. no vanilla. no benzoin.",12/06/18 21:01,mirrorghost
I'm Home Lush,"mmmmmm Not for me, it's just too sweet. I don't get the cacao... It doesn't smell bad though and it's kind of a conforting smell. I can understand why people like it, not my cut of tea...",12/06/18 10:41,pchmad
I'm Home Lush,"Yes! Finally added to the database!
I have fallen in love with this fragrance. It is chocolate-vanilla heaven, with a slight floral undertone, and it melts into the skin.

Honestly might be the most accessible perfume Lush has yet made.",11/04/18 13:45,kbot

Grassroots Lush,"This is my signature scent, I always get compliments and I feel it’s super unique. For me it’s got more depth than the listed notes- there’s a smoky, incense dry down that is so beautiful with the softer geranium after a few hours. I bought this online last year before it became readily available in high street stores as I’d loved the charity pot coins. I don’t think they’re entirely the same fragrance, but grassroots feels like a more grown up edition of the charity pot coin smell. Definitely one to try before you buy in my opinion as many of my friends and family have tried it on and hated it on themselves!",10/13/24 11:32,Roastedginger
Grassroots Lush,"so happy i got my hands on this on a trip to the UK, at an excellent price no less. it's an adaptation of charity pot, which is my favorite scent in lush's bath product line (that's to say, their non-fragrance yet fragranced products.) i feel as if the notes listed don't convey the full story of this scent— intense, herbal, warm (powdery? nutty?), and incredibly nostalgic if you've been wearing charity pot as long as i have.",08/08/24 17:50,amethystfeline

Abiba is weird, fresh and floral while also being earthy, almost leathery, herbal and a little vegetal.
I’m sure most would not agree with me on this, but there is something about this perfume that reminds me of Dzing! By L’Artisan, especially in the opening. Like a deeper, richer nod to it. Don’t get me wrong, it is a quite different perfume, but the essence of it reminds me of Dzing.
As a vetiver hater, I can’t believe how much I love this, finally a vetiver perfume that is strange and beautiful and totally wearable for me.",10/30/25 14:23,midsommarhäxa
Abiba Lush,"I signed up on fragrantica for this perfume because it made me realize that I would love to wear more unisex/male leaning perfumes and also really like that on other people. If I wear them I just don't feel like myself though.
Abiba starts very woody and quite masculine on my skin. I am getting tropical flowers and some creaminess only after more than one hour. At that point is really lovely and quite sensual. Since Abiba does not really project on my perfume eating skin and does not have a lot of longevity, I need to reapply at that point which makes me get the woody opening again. I did not smell any smoke and the perfume appears quite sophisticated. I could imagine an architect or curator of modern art exhibitions wear it.

I was on my way home and rushed to catch my train. When a little later two women sat near me in the carriage I overheard them discussing what a nice, awesome scent they caught a whiff of, so Abiba was an immediate YES. It dries down to a bubbly and long lasting mixture of vetiver and frangipani (at least on my skin these notes dominate).

Peaches Lush,"I had the original Princess Peach and recently got this version on eBay, I really wish this was available all year round! Or at least just for summer! To me this smells like Starburst fruits, a mixture of the pink and orange ones. It’s really potent for a body spray, it has bigger projection and lasts longer than some of my perfumes. Lush perfumes are strong, but for a body spray this has the same if not more strength overall as a fragrance. To my nose it’s not a straight up peach scent, I would describe it as being more along the lines of pineapple but not exactly, it also has that signature lush note that I can’t put my finger on but if you’ve smelt various lush products before you’ll know when you smell them they all have that recognisable “lush” scent. It’s a well rounded fragrance that gets compliments all day long, it wafts a citrus peach sort of scent into the air at first and settles into a really bright summery, fruity and slightly aquatic/tangy scent. It’s ever so slightly ambery in the dry down but I think that could be my skin chemistry as it doesn’t have this note when sprayed on clothing. In the warm weather this smells absolutely divine!",05/17/25 06:35,robertogibson

Yoga Bomb Lush,"This smells like very high quality olive oil to me, which is actually quite nice, just not as a personal perfume haha! I’ll spray it on before baths to make myself feel zen.",09/22/22 13:53,chlorodream
Yoga Bomb Lush,I would do literally anything to get my hands on a bottle of this. Yoga was my favorite bath bomb when I was an employee. If you’re selling I am buying 😭🙏🏻❤️,09/04/22 04:46,_flowersandmusk
Yoga Bomb Lush,"Why does Lush always have to take away my favorite products?? This was one of their best body sprays, it make me fall in love with sandalwood as a perfume note. Cinnamon is not listed, but I always thought it smelled very much like it as well. Name fits, you will smell like a hot yoga master. A sexy spice cabinet.",09/02/22 11:52,smellworthy
Yoga Bomb Lush,"One of my favorite scents from Lush. I’m glad I snagged a bottle of this before it was discontinued. I first tried the bath bomb because I am drawn to woody unisex scents. I really really loved the bomb so I had to buy this. This smells so pretty on me. For some reason I thought it had some neroli in it but I don’t see that listed. Something in the composition makes it lean a little feminine on me and I can’t figure it out, but I love it. (Maybe it’s just my own body chemistry.) Favorite body spray I own. I use it very sparingly now. I could see this one working year-round.",01/30/22 13:30,fairycoffins
Yoga Bomb Lush,Too bad they took this out of their body spray collection. One of my favourite body sprays. The first association would be Karma when reading the name but they're definitely 2 different pair of shoes. This is a woody and grounding scent. The name is definitely spot on!,02/15/21 14:53,rurufu
Yoga Bomb Lush,"It is difficult to find camphor in the olfactory notes. Or it's unusual anyway. This body spray is really special, definitely dedicated to a male audience but that doesn't scare me. Definitely a very powerful meditative fragrance (hence the name YOGA). On the skin it remains ""strange"" for hours, perhaps it is this particularity that tries to open the mind .... It then dissolves over the hours in the meditative note of sandalwood. A fragrance that is difficult to understand, just like the fragrance, again by Lush, BREATH OF GOD, which I really appreciate.",09/06/20 01:32,gmr1967
Karma Lush,"Very strong and spicy to me initially, after a few minutes, I love how it softens up. I really love Karma, it’s a perfect bold orange mixed with patchouli.",11/10/25 12:15,hope744w
Karma Lush,"This is absolutely stunning. I would say that it's not that different from the perfume, the longevity is obviously different but this still lasts a lot. I was dying for them to put this out cause I love Karma and it's 200ml! Great job for Lush to make this a body spray, definitely worth it.",10/16/25 15:37,Tsmarcondes
Karma Lush,just amazing... heavier on the orange than the patchouli but i don't mind that. i prefer wearing this at work than other iterations of this fragrance for that very reason. it's not as complex as the perfume but it's still Karma. it's amazing.,09/04/25 14:04,psychiccat
Karma Lush,"For YEARS now, I wished for a KARMA Body Spray. Dollar for Dollar : LUSH Body Sprays last forever and a single bottle will be with you for a year or 2. 4 sprays / all day ! Well, now they made it. I was not thrilled. It's $42.00 and lacking some notes that make KARMA , Karma. So I passed on the body spray and got the perfume . The latest batches last all day long.",09/03/25 08:09,konga5
Hungarian Fronds Lush,used the tester in lush. smells really similar to avocado co wash to me??? in the dry down it's starting to smell like a graham cracker. its growing on me lol,08/24/25 13:10,hayfevered
Hungarian Fronds Lush,"It’s so weird to me to see other reviewers describe this as rubbery. But I guess that’s the beauty of fragrance, it can evoke different memories/vibes for everyone.
To me this is such a beautiful and unisex herbal tea fragrance that reminds me a lot of The Vert and The Blanc from Bvlgari but with a touch of Lush because well… it’s Lush lol. Think drinking a chamomile green tea blend on the countryside. Very zen and easy going. Really enjoy this one!
I hate that they keep releasing fragrances I love that are only available in a large size bottle though.",08/01/25 12:10,lotusvibes

Hungarian Fronds Lush,"Honestly? It’s awful. Emma Vincent usually does much much better.

It’s some kind of chemical mess that smells like rubber and herbs. If you love the scent of chamomile, skip this one — there’s none of it here. This isn’t a spa, it’s a nightmare come to life.

The longevity is practically nonexistent.",06/07/25 09:28,like_teen_spirit
Hungarian Fronds Lush,"Lush is a brand that will experiment and explore, leading to scents you either adore or hate.

Fronds is a hit for me.

This a floral fennel perfume at the core. Chamomile is definitely at play here to give this scent a very mild natural sweetness.

This lasts well and projects nicely also.

The only issue I have with this scent is that I have absolutely zero clue where it would be appropriate to wear this.

10/10 scent I will buy if I ever figure out when to wear it.",04/01/25 11:58,lalapope
Hungarian Fronds Lush,"I really want to love this perfume and wear it, but unfortunately we're not made for each other. I adore how complex the scent is and how truly it reminds me of my dear Hungarian meadows in the summer with their air of wild flowers mixed with sun-dried grasses. The scent of chamomile and fennel definitely dominate after the perfume dries down. It's an absolutely long lasting fragrance that remained on my coat after I tested it in my local Lush store in Budapest. There's no way I could ever use a full bottle of 100 mls as if I still eventually decided buying it I'd save this scent only for special occasions.",01/15/25 02:50,nostenra
Hungarian Fronds Lush,"This is my favourite of the new releases. It doesn’t literally smell like green tea but it has the same sort of feel. It’s herbaceous in the same way Green tea is - i.e, not overbearing or too green or too bitter. Imagine green tea with chamomile and a touch of sweetness and you can get an idea of how Hungarian Fronds smells. It’s soothing and calm and smells like a spa. It’s pricy but it performs well and has a beautiful bottle and juice.

Edit; I finally worked out what this smells like - a more natural and less screechy version of Fleurs de Lanvin’s Sweet Jasmine! That one gives me a headache but I enjoyed the scent. This is like a refined take on that same profile!

Be warned! The fennel here smells like herbs to me but my husband gets vegetables and hates it 😅",09/14/24 04:22,Skinscents4Fusspots

Dirty Lush,"A good, simple scent for those who are new to perfumes! I got this for my boyfriend who has a sensitive nose and they loved it. Really good to wear to work as well as it's not so strong that it would annoy your colleagues.",01/31/25 03:23,lalalunevail
Dirty Lush,"I've been looking for mint vanilla combo. I love the combo and it performs better that niche IMO. This has no vanilla, but it itches the scratch. I liked Lord of misrule too. But, doesn't seem like many agree🙁.",01/23/25 10:26,HollyBiani
Dirty Lush,"I feel like this gets such hate, and I just don't get it! It's one of my favourites - zingy, fresh, cool, and incredibly uplifting. I've strategically worn this on hot days to feel cooler.

I think so much of it seems to depend on skin chemistry. Personally, I get a soapy mint scent, warmed and rounded off by savoury thyme. It's a complete compliment-getter, for me, with people saying they're straight off to Lush to buy it.

It has a barbershop quality that has filled the gap that Sandalwood by Elizabeth Arden left behind - suspect that's the soapy lavender.

Rather unisex, too. I have nothing bad at all to say about it!

Dirty Lush,"i had it and finished it months ago, not because i wore it often, because i just wanted the day where i would never smell it ever again to come sooner, i used it as a room freshner or as a cleaning spray (crappy perfume works as a cleaning spray if you have kids around and they draw on the walls with markers and such) it smells almost sweet in a not good way, it's horrendous. people say it smells like a urinal cake and i thankfully haven't been sniffing urinal cakes lately, the mint doesn't help it either. it smells like maybe an expired mint tea blend that survived being buried 2000 feet under the ground.",06/14/24 15:30,gourmandscentlover8221

Dirty Lush,"This perfume is the the physical embodiment of a suited crime boss chewing gum aggressively if that makes sense.
It smells exactly like an aquatic aftershave mixed with fresh chewing gum , when I wear it , the most common thing I get is that ' I smell clean' I personally adore this scent , but it's not the type of scent which is comforting and sweet , it's more and masculine and stated",03/10/24 17:02,Zuzu22
Dirty Lush,"This is the scent I use after a shower, when I'm home and want to read a book curled up on the couch all day. Something that is super calming and relaxing. It does have a very strong herbal/ lavender scent. The lavender is not the creamy warming kind and neither is the sandalwood, which is why so many reviews are stating its masculine leaning. I do think it's a true unisex because where it may be more sharp on the nose its a very soothing dry down and is very reminiscent of essential oils in a diffuser. Doesn't last forever on the skin, but I can smell it next day on my clothes.",02/20/24 08:17,Emiliesmells

Dirty Lush,"my favorite everyday scent! i've used about 3-4 bottles of this since 2018 lol
fresh & clean with a pretty moderate scent trail for a body spray (enough that people know when i've been in a lift before them and i've been identified on public transport by scent as well - and i'm not an oversprayer!) find this to be stronger than the actual perfume version

can smell a little sharp in the opening but quickly dries down to a fresh mint with a very subtle floral/woody almost? undertone that makes it more clean vibes~ than straight up toothpaste. forever fav
for ref i live in a very hot & humid country and find that it doesnt work as well on me when i travel n use it in colder climates :-)",11/27/23 17:57,roastedpumpkin

Dirty Lush,"I have to be honest, I do not use this one as a body perfume, but as a deodorizer for the bathroom. So as most people note, it's quite strong and overpowering which works for the circumstance. I love the of the mint and sandalwood, for me the lavender takes more of a back seat. It's very soapy, and largely because of the strong mint.",09/21/23 15:51,primaryunknown
Dirty Lush,"Something in this scent doesn’t work for me. There’s an overpowering sharp and bitter note that is really off putting. It reminds me of earwax.

Dirty Lush,"Honestly don't vibe with the toothpaste medicine situation, but it is the favorite smell of one of my close friends.

Love you, Frances. <3",06/27/23 16:05,hvnent
Dirty Lush,"Exactly like spearmint toothpaste. When i spray it, its like i just cover my entire body in toothpaste or dowsed myself in mouthwash after brushing my teeth. It is however very fresh with a male aftershave kind of vibe. There is something in it which is very masculine.",06/24/23 12:06,Shan101beauty
Dirty Lush,"Whenever I smell this on anyone, I recoil. It pairs so badly with sweat and the mint and herbal notes (tarragon/thyme) give it a medicinal, piercing quality….. reminiscent of hospitals , absinthe and mouthwash. There’s something about mint and sandal wood together that smells like brushing your teeth in a piss soaked men’s bathroom. The projection of this is sadly very impressive and likely this makes it a favourite among people with stronger BO. Genetically I think I detect androgens in sweat like piss, not the lucky other categories of grass /hay. To me , Dirty mixes with androgen heavy sweat in a way that amplifies the piss smell. Or maybe it smells so similar to a urinal cake that I’m inventing the piss smell. It’s also been described as “marine”, fitting if nauseating others like the sea is your thing. Looking at the individual ingredients too… none of them are ones I dislike, it doesn’t make any sense how it turned out this revolting. Lush’s other perfumes are decent but this is just so unbelievably awful I went out of my way to find out about it as self preservation.",11/24/22 17:42,Svetla11
Dirty Lush,"Yes this is quite minty, but to me it was overpoweringly marine smelling which is surprising but also quite nauseating. For a fresh/herbal, it’s probably the strongest fragrance I have ever tried, and I am someone who wears a lot of heavy woody/amber scents.

Dirty Lush,"My signature scent; fresh, pungent, and effervescent. I love this stuff. Loved it since '15, officially my sign scent starting '20. Lush's body sprays are great in longevity and silage. Will forever repurchase and love this scent. The mint is the strongest note but the others give it more body and roundest so you just don't smell like a stick of gum. Never smelt this in the cologne/perfume concentration but so happily pleased with the body spray.",03/01/22 13:49,veedadee
Dirty Lush,"I received this awhile back, and have multiple items from the “Dirty” line. It is in the vein of “You Or Someone Like You” in that it has a very natural spearmint/mint note that is dominant. I have enjoyed this many times for the uplifting qualities it carry’s. I just ordered the actual perfume, but I did so for a reason.

Awhile back I purchased Blue Sugar from Aquolina, while that fragrance leans a little too young and immature on its own, I did get a sense that the sweet and the underlying Anise could layer with a darker earthier more natural scent. I know that layering is not for everyone, but if curious Dirty and Blue Sugar work very well together, even the inexpensive body spray. By doing this I find I can now wear Blue Sugar in public with this modified version. I was lucky enough to pick up a giant 200ml decant of Blue Sugar, and this body spray is inexpensive as well, so I should have a long run of this experiMINT. If anyone has layering suggestions for either please message me. Thanks again.",01/21/22 22:33,Great99
Dirty Lush,"I have always stuck my dark, woody, spicy and gourmand scents (think TF Black Orchid, Noir Extreme etc.) but about 2 years ago I asked my friend what he was wearing as I loved the fresh smell of this and since have been hooked - I'm now on my 3rd (!) bottle of this stuff. This is my absolute go to everyday classic fragrance. I feel the notes listed here almost don't do it justice as you'd think it would be overpoweringly minty and lavender-heavy but it's really more of a fresh sea kind of scent.

This fragrance is not overpowering, it's not bold but it still has some subtle complexity. I always get compliments when wearing this and people always ask what it is! It's so comforting and refreshing, imagine walking through fields of lavender and mint while the cool ocean breeze hits your face.

In terms of how it wears, I find personally the top mint evaporates off very quickly which I actually enjoy, leaving behind the more floral and woody mid and base while still retaining a freshness that isn't pure mint. It's not super long wearing, usually lasts about 5h for me which I wish it would last a little more to be honest. The only thing I don't like is you need quite a lot to get the intensity of say an Eau de Parfum which is fair as this is a body spray. When this bottle finishes I'm going to get the actual Parfum and see if that wears better (same friend above said it does).",01/09/22 06:59,baris.turkmen1@gmail.com
Dirty Lush,"Just got this and am using it as a room spray (bedroom and toilet)... I want to smell mint everywhere I go. I have the perfume and bodywash, and now I need the mouthwash tablets and mask and it will be complete.

It seems like there is some missing notes in the pyramid. What I read from the bottle is that there is Thyme, Tarragon, Sandalwood, Lavender and Spearmint (not sure in what arrangement).

It's actually very mood lifting. I don't get the headache like some reviewers mentioned. Really love the minty scent this gives.",09/17/21 19:01,Riverwind79

Dirty Lush,"Nice dry down, but only that. When you first spray it, it smells like minty gargle. I also get something like sour wood, I guess that it's oakmoss. It’s just not an appealing scent on me. Only part I like is that it’s herbal and aromatic.. I don’t get to use this at all because it's too masculine. This would be nice on guys as it smells clean, aromatic, and sparkly in the dry down. I can imagine it would be a great scent on guy’s shirt or as fabric softener for men.",06/10/21 18:50,violacolors
Dirty Lush,"Very big fan of this. Don't ever use this like an EDT. Body Sprays are more like mists where you just walk into the haze. This is quite handy when you have a stinky toddler or hubby who needs a freshen up. You can use it in place of incense too.

Bombastic opening and I love the wake up call of mint. This wil give delicate types a bit of a headache. But I'm pleased by stuff with dynamite character. However your first thought will probably be, why do I smell like Aquafresh toothpaste. :)

This is ultimately the cleanest scent. Dry down is quick and I appreciate the sandalwood base. It's a simple scent to put together. Wake up and relax. Best for clothes rather than a skin scent",04/17/21 21:40,sameenuk

Dirty Lush,"My partner bought this last year and I think it is possibly the most headache inducing, nauseating, gut wrenching, foul concoction to ever have been sold under the guise of perfume. Never have my nostrils been so offended; not even by the stench of rotting animal carcasses or of pure undiluted ammonia. The fact that Dirty is packaged in the type of spray bottle that wouldn’t go amiss trying to exterminate a nest of killer hornets is an irony not all together lost on me. Once, my partner and I had a petty argument about goodness knows what and in his impulsive rage (knowing my utter revulsion with this disgusting poison) he grabbed the Dirty spray and proceeded to exterminate me. He almost succeeded as I screamed and coughed and spat on my knees, never have I felt so violated in all my many coloured days; I would have been less wounded had he taken a wrought iron skillet pan to my head. The memory has bought bile to my very lips and my face aches with the severe contortion of my features as I type this review. At the very earliest opportunity I threw that abhorrent spray in the trash. I do not speak with jest when I say should that Dirty spray stay in the house then I would not. I am a pacifist yet would feel more at ease if my partner kept a gun beneath his pillow.

I have never really enjoyed the smell (or the taste) of spearmint, I much prefer peppermint, but if you love spearmint and have ever eaten (and loved) those almost phosphorescent blue spearmint sweets that were around in the 1970s, you might enjoy this scent; but I beg of you to please never cross my path whilst wearing it unless you are prepared to unleash a demon of self defence within me that I have but little control over.",10/25/20 13:44,empathyboy

And while it does smell a bit similar,it just doesnt have the same warmth to it. I see many people write about cat pee, licourice, bergamot and herbs, but I don't get any of that. To me,this is not layered at all. All I get is a very ""thin"" Black currant juice with some vanilla,and it mostly dries down to a sweet vanilla scent,and that's it. Not unpleasant at all, but very simple and child-like,to me.",07/10/22 10:03,Marianneaurora

I wore this a lot spring of 2020 when covid first hit the States, a very bittersweet time in many of our lives. It may have been stressful beginning to the year, but I got to spend lots more time outdoors in that bright old sun, with my partner whom I just started dating at the time, with this amazing fruity-green body spray.

Black currant scent profile per Fragrantica: ""A tangy fruit note with a very characteristic ammoniac ""cat piss"" nuance sourced from green leaf buds."" I despise black currant in fragrances for the very reason of that description because my nose is hypersensitive to such smells. I do find that when the fragrance pyramid indicates a scent has the leaves, the scent is more tolerable, but I still get a 'catty' undercurrent. I'm not sure why perfumers gravitate toward black currant rather than using blackberry, but I wish it would fall out of favor...",07/27/20 18:45,DarlingNikki
The Comforter Lush,"I know EXACTLY what people are talking about, when they say they can smell “cat pee”. BUT, it’s the “green” in the fragrance. If you’ve ever walked around, back in the bush, you can smell it on really hot days. It comes from the green on wild fruit, weeds, and some flowers. Some people even think it smells a little “skunky”, like a pot plant. I think their goal was to make it smell real, rather than synthetic. And they did a good job imo. Yes it’s a little “skanky”, but I actually like that. If someone is just wanting to get into some “skank” THIS is now the one I would recommend. It’s STILL fruity, but the scent really does remind me of a hot, and sweaty day in the sun. So it’s a LITTLE dirtyISH, but not really!?!?",07/27/20 17:31,Banana ladyslipper

The Comforter Lush,"Bought the solid and yeah, cat pee. Thought I'd try it anyway in case my nose was just being crazy and it smelled all weird and herb-ish on top of the pee smell.

Really hate Lush's ""limited edition"" shenanigans because the ebayers are killing me.

Anyone know how to get rid of the pee smell? Melt it down maybe?

Because the Comforter bubble bar and lotion, and the ""You Snap the Whip"" all smelled fantastic!

Edit: Just bought a bottle of the liquid -that arrived broken all to hell, but managed to save maybe a third of it- and while it is really, really sweet smelling I'm still getting hint of cat pee. Wtf is up with this perfume? The liquid isn't nearly as bad as the solid, but damn. Something in this is ruining the scent.",07/26/15 20:17,QueenieBee
The Comforter Lush,"I have the solid version of this fragrance. It is a bit licorice-like at first, but then it develops into something creamy, fruity, and soft. I am a huge bergamot fan, and I do get a bit of that. I enjoy this fragrance, but it doesn't last all day. Since it is a solid, I can toss it in my purse to refresh, though. I can't comment on the liquid version, sadly.",03/11/14 18:38,fartknocker
The Comforter Lush,"I blind bought this online in 2012 during the Lush forum special sale that year (I say that in order to establish that the perfume was fresh, presumably no issues with it). I got a very strong cat urine odor with it, just nothing but cat pee -- some other reviews on the web say this as well. I wish I'd sought out more reviews before buying it, oh well. It's definitely one to try before you buy.",01/19/14 12:14,ChypreAnn

Be aware, the first few minutes bring up the cat pee edge of chamomile but this smooths down after a while, allowing for the honeysuckle / white florals to come through.

Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,Cheery pretty Springtime floral. Prominent lavender and chamomile gives way to white florals and waxy-plasticky-fruity 'Lush' smell. The drydown smells like something from my childhood but I couldn't say what. Nice and happy.,11/06/21 14:06,amberonic
Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,"This is really beautiful, hazy, ashy, soft green and sweet scent. Yes it’s sweet, not synthetic sweet, It’s a realistic chamomile and honeysuckle sweet, but nothing offputting. The green edge and hazy-ness balance it out. It also has a bit floral milky, some nameless wild flowers that give soft milky scent. It’s serene and very comforting to wear in summer.

Dad's Garden Chamomile And Honeysuckle Lush,"I love this scent. It was a blind buy for me and I was really anxious because it is a bit pricey, but it worked out! While I also love Demeter’s Honeysuckle, this is not it. Demeter’s is a bright, light honeysuckle. This perfume also smells like honeysuckle, but a beautiful, deep, syrupy honeysuckle, with a dash of chamomile to ground it. Would it smell ‘sickly sweet’ to some, like a commenter mentioned below, but also smell beautifully syrupy to me? Sure, why not! It all depends on what you like. For what it’s worth, my husband who does not like florals smelled this on me immediately after I sprayed it and loved it, asked me right away what it was! The longevity and sillage is not bad, people will definitely smell this as you walk by!",02/10/20 22:40,Rh1071

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"First spray is very strong in alcohol but it quickly dries down to a sweet, cozy, sugary scent. It smells like soft salted caramel to me, not popcorn.

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I see some of the reviews about this smelling like alcohol, and for the initial spray, I would agree with this. BUT, wait! After a few seconds, that caramel, buttery, sweet smell will override that alcoholic smell. I don't know if Lush can address this aspect of the formula, but it doesn't deter me from purchasing and loving this body spray. It has projection and longevity. I feel like for a gourmand, it's a sweet but fresh. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's an overall sweet scent that isn't overly photorealistic or nauseating. I hope this smell does not go away!!",10/15/25 15:26,jesseica09

To put it frankly, this smells like straight up vanilla buttercream. There's nothing else. I don't get any popcorn or cinnamon or whatever tf (which tbf i was initially disappointed about), but this to me is the sweetest icing/buttercream esque fragrance I own and I am obsessed. I can see why people think it's too sweet, but I just have a problem lmao.

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"This is a gourmand lover’s dream! But it’s not just cloyingly sweet like Sticky Dates,it’s much more complex.

Honestly, why pay for Bianco Latte when you can get this for a fraction of the price? If you’re building a gourmand collection, this one definitely deserves a spot.It’s also incredibly long lasting probably the most enduring fragrance I’ve ever worn. That said, I wouldn’t go beyond three sprays. And it’s certainly not for blind buying,the scent is bold, distinctive, and something you’ll either love or find overwhelming.

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"This perfume has the projection of a man's audacity - so wide ranged and invasively present, BUT what separates them is that this is pleasant and very much welcome!

Initial spray is introducing itself as a caramelized buttery popcorn (similar to Werther's caramel popcorns). What this perfume needs is time and patience (hence my first comparison) since after settling on your skin it turns into this beautiful, appetite-growing gourmand sillage that is almost photo-realistic melted sugar with buttery cream added into the process. Usually caramel fragrances tend to fall on the heavy side that clocks my alveoli (i.e. Candy by Prada or Cheirosa 71') but this one is super well blended that it comes off extremely smooth. I sprayed only 2 times on my wrist (which isn't a reliable placement for testing due to body temperature I know) but as I walked around the city the fragrance found it's way into my nostrils and it was still with me the next day!

The longevity is as strong as this one guy's will to add unsolicited commentary in my lecture every two minute- so pretty long lasting as you can imagine! And thus it's strictly a winter fragrance or specifically for cold days.

And plus points for also being a repellent against men who leaves comments on gourmand perfumes (and by comment I mean just straight up hating on women for liking a fragrance group) even though they loathe gourmands, thanks Lush for this 2-in-1 perfume!",07/16/25 11:33,eylulcnar

It smells like yummy buttery vanilla marshmallow cotton candy. It is so beautiful smelling. I had gone in to try Sticky Dates which I smelled on a girl doing the samples at TJs and luckily asked her what it was. The Lush employee sprayed S D on a paper, then this on a paper. I couldn't stop smelling this one so I had her spray 2 sprays on my arm. I left then went to another store fully exoecting ut to dissapear like 99% of all fragrances do on my dry desert like skin. But nah mane. I kept getting whiffs of buttery vanilla cotton candy. It's still just as strong as the minute I left the store and it's hours later. I was like YES! ugh after years of searching I found the ONE. It smells like a very very dry version of Eilish without the mint aftersmell and add lots and lots of butter and a dab of cotton candy.

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"i wish i liked this...for the first 5 minutes after i sprayed it, i was amazed with how nice it smelled...but after that it became so strong and way too sweet (even for me as a gourmand lover) that i felt very sick. im glad i got a decant first because this is really, really sickeningly strong and i can not stand it
Now for the smell, i think it smells ok but i wish it was more on the caramel side, it really does smell like caramel popcorn 100%

I will stay away from this one...maybe i will like something else from this house",05/25/25 13:36,serawi
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,doesn’t smell like popcorn but it’s weird. i bought in store and it smelled exactly as notes describe i loved it but when i got it home straight bug spray/moth balls. idk where im pulling that scent from but i can’t even picture how my fragrance and the one i smelt in store are the same.,05/22/25 19:22,emilymoolina
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I just got this spray after testing it in the store last week. I was walking around the shops and I could smell it on me for hours, I was obsessed with how I smelt. Then I went home and looked at some reviews on it before I bought it, and I was getting thrown off by people saying it smells like popcorn. I do not like that smell and don't want to smell like popcorn. So I was hesitant to buy it but so happy I ordered it as it just smells like a warm, caramel butter dessert! I don't get much cinnamon or popcorn at all which I'm sooooo happy about. It smells like condensed milk and caramel syrup and I couldn't have wanted anything more.",05/22/25 17:16,faithy22
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Honestly one of my favourite perfumes. I bought this as a blind buy due to the insanely low price point - which I have never done before - and it paid off immensely. I am a huge fan of vanilla type perfumes and was expecting a very generic flat vanilla scent I could use to maybe layer other perfumes (similar to solinotes vanilla) but was very pleasantly surprised to find that this worked as a full perfume on its own. Although this is a cheap perfume it does not have the cheap smell I sense a lot from bath and body works or lush scents. Overall has a delectable caramel, sweet sugar smell that projects insanely well and lasts forever but doesn’t smell too generic or cheap. Insane.

This has gotten me an immense number of compliments from both men and women, people adore it - both the people I live with thought I was baking cookies when they got home after I sprayed this! Knowing this, I would highly recommend this to gourmand lovers but would VERY strongly discourage this to those who aren’t.

I find it wears significantly better in the winter where it gives off a rich warmth, compared to the summer where it smells slightly sticky and heavy. I still wear it because it’s still nice, but it definitely isn’t a go-to summer scent.",05/19/25 21:43,anmiko
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"The Lush body sprays are great because they're SO strong, you won't even need a perfume. I adore this one, but it does smell very sweet, almost straight up sugar, so if that isn't your thing, you won't love this.",05/17/25 11:42,spectreszn
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Really confusing scent...initial spray is overwhelming, and has a plasticky note to it that makes it unpleasant, but after a few hours it settles and smells incredible, like to the point where you would want to eat yourself.

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I used to like it more. It’s still a nice scent, but there’s something in it that smells too alcoholic and slightly sour to my nose. I can’t quite define it, but I’ve noticed the same note in Sticky Dates as well.
That said, it does get better with time — if you have the patience to wait, it eventually turns into a pleasant caramel.",05/08/25 03:35,Erynis
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"It starts off with a strong alcohol scent, but as it dries down, it turns into a delicious, milky caramel popcorn scent. On me, it projects moderately but it performs really well. I can get 6-7 hours on my skin, and it lasts even longer on clothes. Overall, it’s a cute and soothing caramel-milky fragrance. I'd definitely repurchase considering the price and longevity.",05/07/25 21:42,starborn
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I can smell sourness.. just tiny. But overall it’s sweet caramelized creamy buttery popcorn, it’s light but not too light, so I can wear it in the summer and it’s sweet enough to wear it in cooler weather. It is a “cute” scent not childish. it's edible, yummy 🍿🤤
Projecting not a lot but the longevity is freaking long… like 8+ hrs so amazing for just a body spray.
I LOVE IT.",05/03/25 23:32,aartelier

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,This can be very headache inducing as it can be cloying it’s very strong and has an off putting burnt plastic kinda smell but as long as you wear it in cooler weather and don’t overspray ig it has a similarish base to 71 cheirosa,04/13/25 19:55,Ceezzz
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I interpret two sorts of scents from this. Firstly, it smells like alcohol - not the type perfumes are made of, but booze. It smells like rum or Brandy - it has the sweetness of the caramel which is rounded out by the warmth of the booziness. The smooth, sweet notes remind me of the booziness of rum raisin ice-cream. The other scent I get is reminiscent of a more sweet ice-cream. The creamy, buttery richness reminds me of caramel ice-cream or milkshake. It's sweet and decadent, indulgent but not cloying. My boyfriend really loves this - he sprayed my bottle on himself and I was getting more of the icecreamy-ness on him. Unlike Sticky Dates which I feel is too sickingly sweet, this is more of a balanced sweetness. I really like this one :)",04/12/25 18:29,Roserra
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"ive definitely posted a review before but over time my opinion keeps changing! after experimenting a bit more with layering and routines, honestly this is my favourite scent ever. it smells like a salted caramel milkshake and is so versatile when it comes to layering. i’ve been layering it with sweet tooth caramel dream and UGH it’s delicious. i spray it just once on my pjs before bed and i wake up smelling milky sweet and my sheets smell so edible. i love it.",04/03/25 21:40,doll.punk

something that is gourmand and basic as caramel and vanilla
something that is affordable to replace
something that has a personality
something that PROJECTS and LASTSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Laissez les bons temps rouler my man, this fragrance is so good I just want to bathe in a cloud of it. I was a little concerned that, being a body mist, it would have a pitiful staying power but actually it lasts about forever on clothes. Well done Lush.

It reminds me of the (discontinued?) popcorn lip scrub. That was delicious...",04/01/25 06:57,matelt
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"A perfect caramel, popcorn scent.

Be super careful not to overspray as it’s super strong and can be a little overpowering!
In my opinion it’s suited much more to winter time, as it’s a little too sickly for the summertime.

The lasting power is incredible and I can smell this on clothes for days after I’ve sprayed.",03/28/25 10:46,Mymble
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I love it deliciously creamy caramel aroma,accented by subtle hints of cinnamon. I don't find the scent too overpowering, !Initially, I compared it to the strong scent of sticky dates at the first spray, like a burnt sugar so strong but then I decided to chose the let the good times roll i don’t smell the popcorn 🍿 though",03/27/25 08:20,Anamargarita
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Tried this at a lush store while I was looking for sticky dates, and while being almost repulsed by the overwhelming sweetness of sticky dates, LTGTR smelt perfect!! its definitely not delicate and an very strong fragrance (I sprayed it once on my wrist and smelt it on me the next day after a shower). But it smells so good and probably one of my favourite gourmands; sooo lactonic and sweet.

I'm surprised no one mention LTGTR has a very sour opening and quite off putting, but if you were able to go pass that short lived sourness, you would get this very sweet caramel scent that i was looking for in Sticky Date. I was too scared of that sourness so i didnt end up purchase it",03/22/25 02:18,ellevam

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"This is strong. It lasts for days and smells like caramel cotton candy. I like it for super cold days if I’ll be outside. I smelled it on my daughter’s jacket a week later. I’m not a gourmand fan, but this reminds me of Halloween and fall happy times. It’s super cold today, I’ve had it in my car, just sprayed a little and it’s developed and changed. I get no mint. That was probably a bad batch. When you first receive, it smells like caramel popcorn, let it sit for weeks and it’s like caramel cotton candy. Whoever said it doesn’t last, I have hyper momma nose, I can smell this a mile away. Don’t over spray. It’s a comforting fall scent. Great for camp fires.

I normally wear lavender, cedar and citrus scents. I never buy sweet gourmand. I do like the cotton candy smell only when it’s super cold.",03/05/25 12:08,Brizzey22

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,the drydown is creamy vanilla essence i love it. tiktok kinda overhype this as a crazy longlasting and projecting body spray but honestly its not. but it lasted more than some EDT that i own so yup its worth the money spent. and i stopped buying BBW after trying this because BBW (recent batches) really lasted 1 hour while this can easily go 5 hours..and it is multilayered not one straight note like bbw,02/02/25 22:17,Mamaterer

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I am so disappointed!

I had read and heard so many reviews about this spray that was supposed to smell like popcorn.

This perfume absolutely does not smell like popcorn. I’m not even sure what it smells like, to be honest. Licorice?
What I do know, and what I’m certain of, is that I’m very, very disappointed. It still cost me 35 euros. And in France, you can’t return products you don’t like. Yet, I think it’s misleading to claim that this perfume smells like popcorn. Just like it’s misleading to say that Honey I Washed The Kids smells like honey.

I bought three sprays. I received them today. Let the Good Times Roll doesn’t smell like popcorn. Honey I Washed The Kids doesn’t smell like honey. And Sticky Dates smells very, very strong.

For me, this is a huge disappointment. It’s a waste of money, even if the product isn’t extremely expensive. I couldn’t test it in-store before buying it, and I regret that. Now, I don’t even want to go to the store to try Lush sprays anymore. I think I’m done with Lush sprays for good.",01/28/25 15:15,Hanounaa
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"At the start, to me it smells like a cinnamony, wintery, spicy, liquorice scent, not my favourite, but after 30 minutes, it turns into a vanilla ice-cream and caramel sauce kind of scent.",01/27/25 23:55,VictoriasSecretAngel
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"No cuz either everyone is lying or idk, this smells sweet yes but not a warm-vanilla-cookies-caramel sweet rather a cotton candy type of sweet… also lowkey a tiny bit floral but yea. Great paired with sdj 71 at least",01/27/25 12:45,Jujustar
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,So I went to Lush to try sticky dates. Thought id like it more. But no. This! At first spray there was a nail polish scent. But it fades in like 15 seconds to vanilla brulee imo. I've been looking for this scent for some time. 20 years ago bath and body works had TUTTI DOLCE CREME BRULEE line. Has anyone else shared this experience? This shares its DNA and it's not 150 dollars for a half bottle. This stuff was back ordered so I must wait to buy tomorrow with new shipment. To me this was more vanilla bean creme brulee and sticky dates was more intense caramel.,01/23/25 10:18,HollyBiani

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Before smelling this body spray I would hear people describe it to smell like buttery / caramel popcorn and I was thinking how I hate the smell of popcorn in fragrances (hence why I hate SDJ 71) so I came into smelling this with low expectations thinking I wouldn’t like it BUT I WAS SO WRONG. It did not smell like what I expected it to smell like at all. I don’t smell any popcorn in this thank god 🍿 it’s hard to explain what this exactly smells like since it’s so unique and I haven’t smelt anything like this before. To me this smells quite lactonic and you do get that buttery smell but I don’t smell any popcorn in this. It smells a tiny bit smokey and you can really smell the caramel / vanilla mainly.

I can confirm this does preform beast mode like everyone says it does and silage is really good. You will definitely get compliments with this one. This definitely deserves all the hype it gets 😋

this is a caramel popcorn scent like that’s it. don’t judge it on tester paper bc i did that and it was just straight up alcohol but after a while (on paper) it dries into such a lovely warm caramel. imo this is nicer than sticky dates (and i looove sticky dates but the body spray version is just too linear for me LTGTR has more creaminess)

Am I being gaslighted, or are the notes completely wrong?

At first spray, you will be hit with a wave of watered down alcohol, almost nail polish remover-esque.
Then, a minty note will take over, finally leaving you with a fresh, and sweet floral base that has 0 gourmand value to it?.
The sillage and projection are crazy. But, it's not as advertised

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,It smells like peppermint bark. It specifically reminds me of doves holiday edition peppermint bark body wash but just a bit softer on the mint.

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Funny how this scent translates so differently for everyone. To me, it opens like a freshly made tiramisu—I swear I can smell the coffee!
The second stage quickly evolves, bringing buttery, salty popcorn into the picture. As it warms on the skin, caramel and cinnamon take center stage.
The projection wraps around you like sweet, warm clouds of cozy caramel and white chocolate. Yet, up close, I still catch those buttery, salty notes.
It’s a homey, comforting scent, perfect for a Netflix Sunday snuggled in a robe with popcorn in hand. Intimate, creamy, and not too strong or overprojecting, it’s also incredibly versatile. Good choice for all seasons—it pairs beautifully with a cozy sweater in the winter or sun-kissed skin in the summer.
It's a suitable layering option for coconut, chocolate, or milky fragrances.

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,i think it smells like the eilish perfume this one doesn't have vanilla in it but it feels like it does idk,12/12/24 14:49,kirstendunst
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,I smelt this on someone and went and bought one! The best caramel vanilla EVER and it lasts on my clothes like 2 days. I love layering this with Kayali Candy Rock 🥰. You gotta let it macerate for the perfume to last. The first few weeks it didn't last long but now it's more creamier and lasts a lot longer,12/07/24 02:51,mamaabearrlovee
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"absolutely obsessed with this and absolutely worth the hype, lush body sprays last more than some high end perfumes. beautiful and rich caramel scent without being overly sweet; almost spicy and minty at some point and the dry down is so chocolatey on me!
i’ve been wearing it to work and everyone keeps complimenting me on it; my coworkers can smell me from a distance!
also it clings onto your clothes so it’s a perfect wardrobe spray…you’ll never stop smelling it :p",12/06/24 08:58,s4rbb
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,This smells like buttery popcorn with sugar on top. I like sweet perfumes. I’m a vanilla and caramel fan but something in this made me a little nauseous I did spray it as a bathroom freshener and it worked well for that. It didn’t work for me but I can see why people love it as an air freshener it lasted almost an entire day! Pretty impressive,12/05/24 12:43,Laura2979
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Ugh I love this!!
I don’t really get caramel popcorn here - but that’s okay because I do get a caramel pie crust, with just an ever so light dusting of spice, and a heaping dose of airy sweetness. It’s so delicious and sooo long lasting! Highly recommend!",12/05/24 02:35,Rishbfrag
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I love this perfume so so much!

🫧 At first spray, it smells like this milky caramel sent to me, but as it dries down, it turns to this vanilla caramel sweet scent with brown sugar dusted on top of it! It smells really good and it’s perfect for gourmand lovers!
🫧 It also lasts very long, so I really like it My mom said that I smell good and she doesn’t even like gourmands lol",12/02/24 17:43,braxypooh
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I absolutely love this. A very realistic gourmand smell. Smells like a softer/less nutty version of SDJ 71 and lasts so good. I am gonna be honest though and say that I don’t think this smells like popcorn at all(even though that’s the main note) but I don’t mind because I never wanted to smell like popcorn either way.🥰 smells caramelly, vanilla, lactonic, VERY sweet and slightly buttery. The projection is amazing. Just one spray and you can still smell it hours later, it’s crazy. My friend wore this and the scent filled the whole room! I could smell her meters away. Definitely my new favorite💕",11/30/24 08:11,noranaomi
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"unfortunately for me, i assumed that the perfume would smell like a cinnamon roll, but apparently it’s supposed to smell like caramel popcorn. however, it doesn’t even smell like that. it just smells like really buttery popcorn sprinkled with cinnamon. the dry down is beautiful and smells far better than the initial smell — but if i wanted that smell then i’d just use whiff of a waffle cone.",11/29/24 22:04,fairyshiro
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"A photorealistic cooking fragrance. Let The Good Times Roll smells like that time when you cook and you add a lot of butter in a bowl, mix it with a mixer to make it more airy, you add sugar, a drop of vanilla essence and mix it again. That resulting smell of you mixing those ingredients, is very subtle, delicious smell, but subtle and light.
The problem is, Let The Good Times Roll smells just like that, but at an insane intensity. I think that there are some scents that are good when they are barely noticeable, becoming sickening if they were intensified. This is exactly that case.
It's a very unique, gourmand fragrance, but to me, the sugar vanilla butter is so strong that it makes me want to vomit. Even so, I understand why someone would like this body spray.",11/24/24 13:00,JuliaToothFairy
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Smells soooooo good ! very warm and gourmand, reminds me of lattafa eclaire (vanilla and caramel dessert) but more buttery and sugary. I don't get the popcorn but at this point it doesn't matter, it really reminds me of a fluffy cake or yummy pancakes being baked in the oven in the morning. Very powerful, a blind buy success. ♡",11/22/24 03:27,Ganii
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"very strong, very sweet! if you do not like gourmands obviously this is not meant for you but i do think the popcorn thing is severely overblown – it just smells like salted caramel to me. definitely super festive though, i'm excited to wear it through the holiday season but im not sure how wearable it'll be if you live somewhere hot or humid. i on the other hand, WILL be wearing it to the christmas market lol.

also lasts an absolute age! my jacket still smells like it from when i first sprayed this at the store weeks ago!",11/21/24 19:05,kikisdeliveryservice
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"First spray is really strange, smells like cleaning chemicals. It smells a lot nicer from 10 minutes onwards, I get a lot of the caramel and butter. I do like it but I'm not a huge fan, probably because of the popcorn note. It also smells really sweet to the point it feels synthetic (agree with someone below, there's a slight nail polish scent in there?), which I don't love.",11/21/24 02:46,ringwald-haze
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,More powerful than a lot of my other fragrances. It stayed two days on my skin even after showering. Amazing! It does smell like pop corn. Caramel and butter .,11/19/24 17:53,rendezvous
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,I Hope that one Will be one day available in edp very concentrated I could bath in,11/18/24 06:46,sosoathenes
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"First Spray I wasn’t too sure about it but the dry down was so tasty. I still have a paper swatch after a week later and it still smells so heavenly and strong so projection is there. I have it laying on my bathroom counter and my whole bathroom just smells so tastefully sweet.

I think this spray would be perfect for going to the gym and spraying your gym bag with or going to school and you spray your backpack with it. This sweet screams caramel scent will just linger for days on end.

It kinda reminds me of Cheirosa 71 vibes however that smell does not last long.",11/15/24 12:37,Poppiie
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"For me, it's a hyper-realistic scent of buttery shortbread cookies. I don't get popcorn at all, but that's not a problem. Comfortable, enveloping, fluffy. I don't smell artificiality.
The scent is very long-lasting (you can smell it in rooms even after many hours) but delicate, it's not a killer. On paper it's meh, but on the skin magic begins to happen. Milk, sugar, butter, cookie, everything delicious, without jarring and dissonance. The lack of dissonance may be a disadvantage for some, as the scent is linear, but for comfort and escape into a better world, you don't need anything more. I love it.",11/12/24 05:18,HanulaC

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"this stuff has lasting POWER. i sprayed it on a test strip at lush, brought it home and put it on the shelf. no joke, for about a month the entire corner of my room where the shelf is smelled so strongly of it. very thick and tooth ache sweet buttery caramel, lovely.",11/11/24 11:12,soulfragrances
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I literally HATED this scent on immediate spray, but it settled sosososososo amazing within 2 minutes of it settling in my skin. I prefer this spray over the Sticky Dates spray for some reason; although I do own the entire sticky dates collection lol. I love to layer this with sticky dates lotion and if I want to add a bit more, I’ll go in with a few spritz of turmeric latte. You’ll smell like a coffee shop bakery hehe.",11/09/24 20:05,fortysevenscents
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"the first whiff is always nauseating but the dry down is heavenly, I’ll spray on my clothes before I shower just to let the scent settle in a bit. Very overpowering, do not recommend for summer but great for cold weather.",11/09/24 18:47,mlariel
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"one of those fragrances i reach out to when i want to stand out. beast mode lasting power and sillage, you only need two sprays on your pulse points and you're good for the whole day. yes this is overpowering on initial spray but the dry down is sweet and leaves a trail. worth the hype but definitely not for everyone",11/07/24 00:34,bittersonata
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Before purchasing this perfume (a blind buy), I sorted the perfumes in my collection into two categories:

Perfumes that make me want to hug people, and perfumes that make people want to hug me.

The first describes fragrances that are wonderful but stay really intimate in terms of projection. I want to seek out close contact so people can enjoy the fragrance that stays quite intimate.

The second category are fragrances with adequate projection. People can smell them if they're in my little bubble, and want to come closer to better appreciate the fragrance.

This knocks them all out of the ballpark. It smells amazing, don't get me wrong, but you don't need to come any closer to me to smell it. It literally fills rooms, and I love sweet scents but sometimes honestly find myself avoiding close contact because I get self conscious about this absolute beast of a fragrance. I would describe it as a fluffy vanilla cupcake with caramel frosting. I bought this to layer with other perfumes, but it seems to outperform and outshine them.",11/03/24 15:17,vanilarie
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"OMG THIS IS SO aSTRONG!!!!! very caramel, very sweet, overpowering, if you wear this, you need nothing else. You can spray it on your body, hair, etc. Just that it's too much for everyday wear. If you like strong sweet smells, this mught be for you, it's very nice, just try it first. Not a safe blind buy!",11/02/24 13:05,sacralogica
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I know most will come after me for saying this, but this is kinda nauseating.

There is something so off putting about the buttery note, it is kinda rancid, and I am saying this with a heavy heart as I was waiting for more than 2 months to buy it.

Someone said that this is “the it girl Cheriosa 71 aspires to be”. Not true. At all. Cheriosa 71 is wayyyyy better!",11/02/24 10:15,Sniffona
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I have enjoyed Lush cosmetics for over 15 years, am aware of the extreme potency of their body sprays, and I do enjoy vanilla/caramel based, sticky gourmands, so and it pains me to say that this is hands down THE most vulgar thing I have ever smelled in my life. It’s weird and waxy, salty and INCREDIBLY sweet, sooo cloying, overwhelming, nauseating. Has the power of nuclear waste, one spray is enough to fumigate your entire home, for days. The butter note is positively vile, a spoiled and rotten funk lurking behind a giant bowl of raw cookie dough the size of King Kong. I can think of absolutely no circumstance where this would be appropriate or pleasant. Even a Yankee candle in this scent would be revolting. I weep for the co-workers of anyone foolhardy enough to wear this in public. “Someone smells like cookies!” (or whatever) is not necessarily the compliment you might think it is. In fact, this is the type of scent that makes me want to mention that not every comment on one’s fragrance is a compliment, you know. Oftentimes people simply remark because the scent is strong, not because it’s enjoyable.",10/31/24 11:32,hellebelle
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Love The smell, its ok but not beast like all people say barely can smell it on myself ( sillage) way over prized and hyped but its Nice smell i just wish it lasted longer",10/29/24 14:23,Feliz92
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,My New Fall Favorite!!! 😍 Keeps giving a pop of caramel several hours after applying two small sprays. It does have the lactonic note I like with vanilla and caramel but not like Cheriosa 71. I can’t wear that it’s so buttery it makes me nauseous. LTGTR is way on the right side of caramel popcorn. I use it for daytime and even sleep but for a night out I’d layer it with something more spicy. I don’t detect the cinnamon note but do get something that reminds of pineapple 🍍,10/28/24 15:00,Scentsitivist
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,I kept getting a whif of something that smelled exactly like cotton candy in the grocery store. I asked and she said she was wearing this. It's a shame cause I decluttered my bottle a year ago. It never smelled like cotton candy to me. But I guess the scent trail is different than smelling it up close. Ugh I wish I still had my bottle!,10/27/24 14:33,MaxieF
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,i had to sell it cause is tooo much like synthetic butter. I think sol de janeiro 71 is what I wanted this to be :(,10/27/24 07:50,tamyohls

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,This is not creamy caramel that i expected at all. Its straight up burnet sugar. I tried new egg nog scent and it was much better.,10/21/24 11:06,cassiopeia1957
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,I really don't like this. It's horribly synthetic. The only way I can describe the scent: Imagine the breath of someone who's just vaped. And forgotten to brush their teeth. Eww.,10/20/24 10:16,sofi<3
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I had to return it (shoutout to Lush's generous return policy!). On first spray it has a weird synthetic undertone. When it dries down its a hyperrealistic caramel corn. Super sweet, but unfortunately the butter note made me sick. Could maybe work as a linen or room spray depending if you're feeling festive.",10/17/24 21:28,jin_thia
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"PERFECT scent. Performs more like a perfume on me. It’s very buttery, sweet and sticky smelling. It really does smell like caramel popcorn. I have SDJ71 too and they are NOT the same! :) SDJ71 is amazing but extremely nutty. This one has no nutty scent and the vanilla is prominent in it",10/15/24 21:01,Beebeebeeps
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,Honestly I was expecting more caramel and vanilla but on me it smelled of buttery popcorn with some kind of sweet synthetic undertone which a lot of lush scents have. I’d buy it if I currently didn’t have enough vanilla/gourmand body sprays. However I do prefer SDJ 71.,10/15/24 13:24,Softpeacelily
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I asked my friend if she was wearing Sol de Janeiro '71, and she said it was this. I thought I was 100% sure on '71, so I'd definitely say this is a dupe. A strong buttery caramel smell, and delicious!",10/12/24 23:55,violetaura
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"this is the perfect fragrance for me. i’ve been a huge lush head for probably a decade now, so this scent isn’t new on my radar like it is to many, but i can’t sing it’s praises enough even after spending significant time with it. if you’ve ever smelled fresh, warm caramel corn or stepped foot into a fisher’s popcorn shop on the east coast, you’ll find a lot of that in a bottle of this. it’s an incredibly decadent, rich, warm melted caramel scent with a grounding saltiness to it and an ample dose of something like pancake syrup - like a step up in maturity and depth from those bath and body works gourmand sprays we all used to have, but with that same indulgent syrupy sweetness. if you don’t love warm gourmands, for the love of god, look elsewhere.

i say “love” instead of “like” for a key reason: this spray is absolutely nuclear. if you use more than one spray of this, god in heaven himself will smell you. i last sprayed my sleep shirt with a single spray of this three days ago and after consistent wear, it still smells freshly sprayed. this is the most incredible value for a fragrance because you only need one spritz to smell of it for the next 5-7 business days. PLEASE exercise restraint in spraying this - i cannot stress enough that you can’t get away with 4-5 sprays around your whole body with any lush body spray, much less this one. all that considered, it means you really get your money’s worth and then some out of this bottle, especially if you find the scent as delicious as i do. for sticky sweet gourmand lovers, this is your dream.",10/10/24 15:35,disgraced
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I have only had this fragrance for a few days so it may be too early to judge, but I am kind of unsure about it. I am a DIE-HARD gourmand so on paper this seemed great for me, but something about this fragrance, especially in the opening, has this weird gasoline undertone. I can't seem to get past it—it smells like this extremely synthetically sweet vanilla mixed with alcohol and gasoline. I even tried letting it dry down, but that is still all I'm picking up on. Am I missing something? Where is the popcorn? The caramel? The Cinnamon? The butter? I must need to let this macerate because I just can't understand how others are picking up on those notes. It is super long lasting so I will give it points there.

EDIT: OMG!!!! Ignore everything I have said above. On initial spritz this fragrance truly needs at least a few days to macerate. Don’t give up if you had the same experience, I have now absolutely fallen in love.

The gasoline note is pretty much GONE now, if anything it’s only there for 1-2 minutes after initial spritz. This fragrance is amazing. It smells like if you were to walk into an icecream shop and you are getting whiffs of freshly made waffle cones with rich caramel and toffee ice cream in the background. I don’t get much popcorn in this because the popcorn in this fragrance is not movie popcorn, it’s like sweet kettle caramel popcorn. It is so freaking delicious. I sprayed only 2 sprays (that is seriously all you need) it and even 2 hours later I had someone ask why it smells like toffee and icecream. GO BUY THIS!!!",10/09/24 14:10,laurenjarrett01
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,I get butterscotch with extra rum but no popcorn at all. It does smell a little like Sticky Dates but no where near as intense. This one is actually more wearable to me. Also I had to let mine sit for a few days because it smelled like straight cashmeran at first.,10/07/24 11:43,SummerMelody
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"such good bang for your buck like genuinely so long lasting especially on clothes and the smell is fucking amazing. i wore this to work layered with tumeric latte and a customer told me i smell like cookies >v< idk about you but having someone tell me i smell like cookies is like the best thing ever. i like to spray this on my pyjamas and i can still smell it the next night. also has the smoothest atomiser, maybe because it's in a literal spray bottle but it gives a really nice even spray. only thing is i'd be careful if you dont want too much sillage because this thing sprays a lot in one go",10/07/24 11:13,snackbot

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"i really really wish i got it like everyone gets it. i was so excited to try ""let the good times roll"", i looove anything sweet, yummy, hyperrealistic. but it was the biggest disappointment. it smells just like very burnt caramel with alcohol that doesn't disappear and kind of feels like it was supposed to be there? as if you took sticky toffee pudding, burnt it and then drenched in vodka. still, lasts forever and projects everywhere, lush is really good with this sort of thing. but no popcorn, no deliciousness, so it's a no in general. :(",10/03/24 14:54,lenkusia

He then comes back home, the lollies’ smell he ate at the fair are lingering on his clothes & hair. A memory that is going to stick with him forever.

Will stick (!) to Sticky Dates instead.",09/17/24 22:34,Haus of Lucy
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I love, love, love the ""Let the Good Times Roll"" face scrub which was the original product for this scent, if I'm not mistaken. Seriously, I have to slap my hand for wanting to eat that stuff. This is really damn close to how good that product smells, but sadly too synthetic in spray form (totally understandable for a gourmand scent, though). Still has a really great buttery, caramel popcorn scent. Very strong to my nose, and lasts a really long time on my skin. Definitely dries down to a strong vanilla, as I am cursed with in all the gourmand scents I love, so not one I can wear without diluting.

As an aside to anyone who is interested in the body lotion in this scent that Lush also recently put out - omg, it's soooo strong smelling. For me, it caused intense headache and nausea. Which sucks, because the lotion is Lush's good, heavy stuff that works amazingly at restoring my dry, rough skin back to something that doesn't resemble someone who moves cinderblocks with their feet all day. It was next to impossible to wash off in a hot shower, too. The scent lingered for days, even on surfaces I didn't even realize I'd touched. This product line is a beast in silage and longevity. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just not for people like me who are very sensitive to strong scents.

But yeah, I'm currently experimenting mixing this lotion with Vanicream to dilute just how freakishly concentrated it is. It takes a very small amount and it is still so strong. So great for someone looking for a stubborn gourmand.",09/17/24 11:08,QueenieBee
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Um what the hell did I stumble upon here? THIS IS A BEAST gourmand that is so edible I just want to rip my pyjamas off and eat them (yes I want to smell like a buttery caramel cupcake when I go to sleep).

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"This fragrance smells absolutely HORRIBLE omg. I blind-bought this fragrance and was absolutely shocked when it arrived. It is one of the worst smells I have ever smelled and I am SO disappointed. So many people on TikTok have raved about this scent and I was expecting something cozy and sweet, but this is sickeningly sweet in the worst way, to the point of making me nauseous. It’s so harsh and synthetic smelling. I immediately ran to the bathroom to get this smell off of me.

🌷 Make sure to smell this in the shop first because this is definitely not a safe blind buy and most likely not what you expect from reading the notes on here!!🌷",09/11/24 06:32,lucreziaborgia

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"I wish I was more fond of this fragrance, but it was the first to go in my collection. It smells like caramel movie theatre popcorn. I’m a gourmand girlie, but I couldn’t love this. I don’t enjoy smelling like the cinema or a Garret’s Popcorn or something. Not for me, but it doesn’t mean it won’t be for you. It may be your next favorite scent. I will say, it smells delicious when I smell the exfoliator which it’s based off.",08/29/24 18:07,Lbustos2
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"The scent definitely lasts for ages and projects a lot. People can smell me from very far. The initial spray is incredibly intense and a lot gets released in one go because of the spray bottle packaging I think, so I spray way less than I usually do for any kind of body mist. The initial spray also smells overwhelmingly like MINT to me and my sisters. As it dries down it transitions into the more ""buttery caramel"" scent that I was expecting and LOVE. I just wish it was like that from the beginning because it was even off-putting to me as someone who loves strong gourmand scents on myself.",08/22/24 09:53,cerrendipity

Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Soooo good ! I’ve never really been into gourmand scents before since I’ve always reached for florals but man this is amazing. This combines a sweet caramel scent with a really nice vanilla. At first, I was really hesitant to buy it because of the popcorn note (I absolutely cannot stand sol de janeiro 71) but it adds so much to this fragrance.
I combine it with other stories “perle de coco” body lotion which has notes of coconut vanilla and caramel. It’s quite subtle but I really recommend it if you’re looking for a budget alternative <3
It’s a very strong fragrance and incredibly long lasting for a body mist ! But other than that I can’t recommend it enough.",08/11/24 10:24,teaa26
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Fell in love with it the moment I sprayed it on my sweater in the store, the fact that it stayed over 4 days sealed the deal for me. Unfortunately, I very quickly realized that I don't like gourmand smells on myself. I always felt sticky, the crazy sweetness numbed everything around me, it caused me headaches. After fighting it for several months I gave it to my friend, who, on the other hand, rocked it until she didn't have anything left in the bottle, and told me that a huge amount of people complimented it. I think I'd recommend it ONLY! if you know you like gourmand notes on YOURSELF!",08/06/24 14:56,BrickShithouse
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"An extremely buttery, caramel fragrance. If you are a gourmand lover, this will be something you'll enjoy very much.

Pros:
- An incredibly sweet gourmand fragrance; the butter and caramel are extremely strong notes, along a popcorn, vanilla, sweet base.
- It will last an extremely long time (I sprayed it and can still smell it on me the next day)
- Sillage is powerful, you walk into a room and the scent will linger after you're gone.
- Extremely good value, I got it for 45AUD, 200mL. For just a body spray with 12h+ wear, this is incredible.

Cons:
- Sweetness can be way too overpowering, cloying and nauseating.
- Initial blast will be powerful so hold your breath for about 5 seconds.

Overall I would give this an 8/10. Extremely delicious, you will smell edible, like a walking baked goodie. And for the value, the product is just phenomenal. Apparently most body sprays from Lush have phenomenal longevity and projection, excited to try more!",08/03/24 23:19,astrophel
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"the opening is sharp and a little sour, just not pleasant at all. Dry down is sweet, gourmand and creamy. I really like the dry down but the opening is just not worth it to buy.",07/04/24 04:17,Dizn
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"This is one I always come back to. I’m a huge lover of gourmand fragrances, especially the ones that smell more edible and literal. This is the perfect edible caramel with that savoury buttery quality that makes it so unique to other sweet scents I’ve tried. The sillage and lasting power are huge, it lasts on my skin for hours and on my clothes for days. Definitely more suitable for the colder weather but I come back to it all year round.",06/28/24 01:25,doll.punk
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,Sweet artificial butter smell with a little bit of a spicy dry down,06/24/24 13:47,fannyf
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"This is amazing!!!!
Reminds me a lot of the OG Pink Sugar by Aquolina only this is much better, this is like the organic version of it.
I mostly smell the caramel and cinnamon, it’s a very warm milky scent, reminds me a lot of the sticky caramel candy I ate when I was a kid.
A really really great gourmand.
However, I am not a huge fan of Lush’s body spray bottles, that’s the only downside.",06/21/24 09:02,Candylover666
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"It smells extremely sweet and artificial, which is not a problem for me. The spray bottle, however, is. This perfume last an eternity. I put it on before work, and even after a 10 hour sweaty shift, it is still half as strong as when I applied it. The fact that it lasts so long makes me nauseous and over stimulated. The spray bottle applies a generous amount per spray, which is way too much for such a strong perfume. I've transferred some of the perfume to a smaller tester bottle with a better atomiser, and now I'm able to use multiple sprays to apply my perfume in multiple places without overwhelming the senses.",06/16/24 04:14,Yrsa99
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Creamy caramel, reminds me of christmas time sweets. Uplifting. Lasts a long time, I can smell it the next day. Two sprays is enough or even one. I enjoy it",05/24/24 04:12,pinkguiTarra
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"It smelled so good on the paper tester that I almost bought it on the spot. Like a Starbucks caramel frappe. Thankfully I tried it on skin, as on me it's a blast of burnt caramel. It's a no for me.",05/22/24 21:36,niepokoya
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,scrubbed immediately. probably shouldve let it develop but it was the most intense initial spray ever. my sister told me i smelled good tho. before blind buying make sure u can handle ur gourmands cause this one is extreeeemely sweet.,05/21/24 14:07,adna
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Let the good times roll is definitely my most complimented perfume, all of my friends went out and bought themselves a bottle. The longevity of this perfume is like no other - if sprayed on clothing it will last for weeks.",05/21/24 04:59,gracesniffs
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"At its best, this fragrance is the gooiest warm, slightly spicy, caramel cookie fresh out of the oven, with sweet creamy butter on the side. It is walking into a cake shop and tasting the thick, light brown syrup dripping down from the centre of a freshly baked cinnamon sponge. The type of treat I promised myself I would indulge in every day of my adult life when I was a kid.
The opening is rather harsh and overly synthetic. If it stayed like this, this fragrance would be one of my least favourites. But it melts into you and becomes you, it takes you over and shrouds you in the most deliciously sweet and approachable scent as the day goes on. When I wear Let The Good Times Roll, people treat me like I am their favourite sweet treat. I become the cookie or cake they have been craving, thus they respond with incredible warmth and softness towards me.
When I don't want to be perceived as overly sweet and approachable, but I still crave a strong gourmand, I love to pair this with Coffee Break. As a much softer gourmand which has similar lactonic and sweet notes, it is balanced out by the pepperiness, and refreshed and awakened by the coffee notes.
Overall a dreamy and dazy gourmand that will send you into a soft daydream of caramel. I receive compliments EVERY time I wear this, people stop me at work or in the street to ask me what I have on. Let The Good Times Roll will be a stable in my collection for the rest of my life. A blind buy I will never regret and truly my signature. A little goes a LONG way!",05/14/24 12:01,anapaula777
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Edit: decant this and wait patiently. It needs to oxidise and then some. All the synthetic vanilla has fallen away and I get to skip right to the good part.

It opens pretty synthetically, and then it's a decent caramel syrup for a minute, and then it turns into an annoyingly strong cheap vanilla bathroom spray, and then I spend the rest of my afternoon craving Werthers Originals and ice cream and wondering what smells so good. I'm glad I don't get any popcorn from this. I find it to be a pretty convincing caramel ice cream in the drydown, but it's hard to justify sitting through that obnoxious artificial vanilla cloud very often. The in store tester smelled much richer from the get-go, so I'm hoping it will age gracefully.",05/12/24 22:33,pessb
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"When I first got this it smelt rancid to me and had a burnt smell and reminded me of mosquito repellent, not sure why. I was so disappointed and put it in my drawer and forgot about it until about 2 months later. I gave it another chance and it smelt so delicious and completely different, I’m not sure whether it was the fragrance or me that changed but I absolutely love it now. It also performs like a high end perfume, lasting over 24 hours when I spray it on my clothes, even surviving the washing machine when sprayed on certain materials and projects like crazy. I sprayed it in my upstairs bedroom and could smell it downstairs when I was walking around. My family always says they can smell sweet cinema popcorn when I spray this, but in a positive way. I’ve also seen this be described as candy corn smelling but I’ve never tried so I wouldn’t know. Definitely great value for money but I’d recommend trying it in a Lush store if possible as Lush scents seem to be quite polarising. 100% recommend especially for fall/winter and a bottle will last you ages since you don’t need to spray much at all, 1 or 2 sprays is already enough and very strong.",05/08/24 10:00,Bella0702
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,Gourmand lovers on a budget !!!!! This is for us !!!! It’s caramel it’s delicious yummy!!! Give it 10-15min for it to bloom on your skin. This is wayyyyyy better than Cheerios 71. Heavenly!!!!! I smell like ice cream!!!,05/06/24 23:29,Lovetolove
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"This spray is very intoxicating. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't really have the buttery caramel popcorn scent, like the face scrub and limited edition body wash do, instead it has an overwhelming spicy butterscotch scent, which sadly gives me a headache. I kept trying it every now and then because I wanted to like it, but it just smells like a Christmas fruit pie with heaps of cinnamon. I ended up gifting it to a friend as it just made my head hurt. I am a bit sad that I didn't end up enjoying this as much as I hoped, as I am a gourmand girlie, but it's just too overwhelmingly spicy and not quite what I expected. It does have great longevity - I can smell it on my clothes even the day after. It definitely lingers and you don't need to spray much. If you like warm spice, then this might be for you.",05/05/24 03:12,breeperfumes
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"Can’t even be objective on this one. I’m in love with it, wearing it non stop. So I think that you can get an idea of my opinion. Everything is perfect.",05/03/24 05:15,cflatorrev
Let The Good Times Roll Lush,"SOOO YUMMY!! For me this smells like a creamy and milky vanilla with a faint hint of caramel. Can’t smell the popcorn note but I’m not complaining as the scent is delicious! Someone said that it smells absolutely good when I walked by and all my friends like it. My friend says it smells like vanilla and my brother says it smells like the fairy floss zooper dopper.
After like 5 sprays and 20 minutes I go noseblind to it and I can’t smell it but other people can if they’re close to me. This lasts for 2-3 hours. Would defo repurchase this one.",05/02/24 22:26,stellawinx
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"It goes on completely citrus cleaner, but dries down to a very intimant honey sweetness quick enough to be worth it. Not a perfect honey perfume, but a pleasant entry to that category which doesn’t mix in too many other scents. Now if only Lush would release a Sticky Date perfume.",10/14/25 20:09,ArtemisCrimson
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,Sweet honey that has a beautiful soft dry down. Perfect.,03/08/25 09:38,macademialove
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I'm not much of a gourmand girlie, so I'm more than content with my wee 10ml via the Kitchen box, but my goodness do I love the HIWTK scent family! Brings to mind orange chocolate, honeycomb and gooey caramel all at once. Makes me feel like I'm being hugged by the person I love most. Super sweet, decedent, and above all, comforting -- but HEAVY emphasis on that 'super sweet' part. As much as I love HIWTK, in perfume format it's a bit too much for me a lot of the time (it released about 2 years ago according to the label, and I've only used about 3ml so far!), so I gravitate towards the handful of other gourmands I own a lot of the time. (FWIW, that would mainly be Replica Matcha Meditation & Kilian Angels' Share.) I'm still glad to own this vial for the handful of times I'm in the mood to rock it, but admittedly I prefer it a lot more in bath bomb, shower gel and soap format.",03/09/24 16:39,kpop_stan
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Why oh why don't they make this scent perfume anymore and why is it always stuck in the U.K. and never in thr states , I just received a lush kitchen version and it it's awesome and honeyed unlike the body spray which is enjoyable , and both have different facets why they should both be here .",09/19/23 12:30,Frankie12
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Initially candy caramel but dries down to vanilla yogurt quite quickly.

Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"This is such a comforting, feel good fragrance. Imagine a creamy toffee, milk and honey, french nougat and orange marmalade. This is probably what Paddington Bear would smell like if you gave him a snuggle!

I own the body spray version of this fragrance, and longevity is really really good.",03/19/20 04:03,Emma0714
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,This review is for the 2018 body spray. It opens with almost a yogurt tang. That tangy scent dries down quite quickly and morphs into a white floral/honey/toffee scent. It eventually settles into a lovely honey/toffee/white chocolate with only a hint of the white floral. I do not detect any citrus in this version. Not huge sillage or lasting power.,06/15/18 20:27,spitandpolish
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I expected a perfume replica of the soap (cf. Devil's Nightcap) but to my surprise it's actually not. There's a bit of sour, white wine tinge. I'd liken this perfume to vanilla yogurt.",10/30/17 19:49,Chaos Reigns
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Wow! It smells just like the notes listed! If you love sweet gourmands then one not to miss. Quite an intense opening. Too sweet for me. Loads of toffee! I was hoping the citrus might be more dominant but nope.
Moderate sillage and longevity",07/07/17 02:32,shushkin
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I'm reviewing the 2015 Lush Kitchen formula.
This is absolutely divine! This smells like toffee/caramel and honeycomb with a light soapy feel which is very true to the original scent in the LUSH soap. There is also a slightly white chocolately vibe which reminds me of the best hot chocolate money can buy. Or a bar of ""crunchy"" chocolate which they sell here in the UK (honeycomb covered in chocolate). It is very wearable, however, and not overpowering. I usually would not wear gourmands this thick in the summer heat, but this is light enough that it works in all weathers. Very clean smelling, despite the foody notes, and perfect those looking for something sweet and yummy without being too much.",06/01/17 13:20,icingsugar
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"This perfume is certainly something else. With a very prominent Play Doh note, crayon waxy toffee, very sweet and unmistakable. The honey is sweet, a little pee-y and the orange is mostly sweet and just a little zesty, bringing out the higher pitch in this caramel. Don't say I didn't warn you. The liquid, long discontinued, smells the same and is as strong as the solid currently for sale in Japan. The perfume is exactly the same as the soap, except the perfume is ten times more potent. Wear in minute amounts and this can be a real beauty.",08/11/16 03:37,paneradfisk
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"They have discontinued the parfum, but you can still find the scent in soap and in the solid shampoo bar. I love the honey with a hint of carmel/toffee scent. It is sweet but not cloying and doesn't make me hungry. My favorite Lush scent.",07/08/16 10:38,Neosmiaphyte
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I LOVE ""It's Raining Men"" shower gel from Lush. It does fabulous things for my hair and smells delicious. I love the ""Gold Fun"" bath playdough, the ""Honey I Washed The Kids"" soap (minus the wax on the top), and even the ""Honey Bee"" bath bomb even though it leaves clay in my tub. So naturally I had to hunt down the perfume to complete the scent circle. I always use their solids when first trying out a scent if I can, since my allergies can be iffy-wiffy. Omg, this smells so amazing and just like the bath products!

Buttery goodness with just enough citrus to balance out the sweetness, and just enough floral to make the honey smell realistic and not like cheap vanilla.


Edit: So the solid of this definitely leans more toward a butterscotch scent, whereas the spray version has a slightly more floral feel going. Both are awesome, though.",07/27/15 10:50,QueenieBee
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"For anyone wondering, the Lush shops in Japan still carry this as a solid perfume: other than the UK, Japan has the most Lush shops in the world! If anyone's looking for this discontinued perfume, you may want to get one shipped in from there. (Japan Lush also carries The Olive Branch solid perfume)

Delicious honey/caramel smell.",06/06/15 08:04,neonvibrance
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Simple 3 note wonder. First scent is largely of caramel, rich and thick but not too syrupy or burnt. It is seamlessly layered with bee's wax and honey, which evens out the smell of the caramel and gives it a 'thick' smell. Lastly, is a bit of orange which keeps the whole thing from smelling too sweet and gives it a slight fruit identity. It smells kind of soapy too, like the wax of glycerin soap. Sort of like clean skin musk. I think this helps create the illusion that the scent was transferred onto your skin by soap rather than perfume.",01/20/15 18:48,cassandra5322
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"They should make this perfume into food so I can eat it. Smells delicious, definitely gourmand but clean as well with a soapy finish which makes it very wearable. I wore this at Christmas all the time as it seemed perfect for the season.",01/15/15 05:24,LOUISELOUISE
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I had a solid version of this perfume and enjoyed it. Cozy and playful, clean and warm, with a touch of honey sweetness. The name of this perfume helps to bring these diverse sniff-impressions together :)",08/04/13 02:12,temporal
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"The soap is great, but the perfume (might have been the bottles I got--I got two different ones, one from each release, though) was kinda...well, it smelled mostly like alcohol and something bitter from the bottle. On the skin, it mellowed out to something closer to the soap, but usually still a little too bitter/waxy for me.",04/27/13 01:01,kayley123
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"It smells like the soap, but not as subtle. It was a special edition. I can see why they didn't put it in their permanent line. Something was just off..",03/28/13 17:41,lcommisso
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Unfortunately discontinued.
I know they still sell it as soap, but I recently tried Flying Fox and actually liked it better. Probably because I love jasmine. I'm hoping they'll eventually produce Flying Fox as a fragrance.",03/20/13 04:25,2746cstreet
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I keep buying the soap , but can't find the perfume in my country ( ITALY)",12/29/12 01:21,delara
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"When it comes to gourmands, I am much more enthusiastic about wearing something that smells like honey rather than cotton candy. I've been searching for a realistic honey scent for quite some time. I did enjoy Serge Lutens Miel de Bois, but it wasn't what I wanted. Since finding Honey I Washed The Kids, I believe I may have found the closest to what I was looking for.

Honey I Washed The Kids is a fairly linear scent, with syrupy honey, sugary vanilla and gooey caramel. It smells delicious and foody, just like a gourmand should be.

The opening is where the honey note is at its strongest. I was amazed by how realistic it smelt on my skin. It was just like sticking your nose in a jar of honey and inhaling. Although the honey note is dominant throughout this composition, it does tend to lessen in intensity. The heart and drydown introduces the vanilla and caramel which helps in balancing out the fragrance.

As far as I'm aware, Honey I Washed The Kids was a limited edition that has long since been discontinued. The last time I inquired about this fragrance in a Lush store, I was re-directed to a shower gel named It's Raining Men and told that it's the same scent, just re-named.

I was lucky enough to be sent a sample from a kind Lush fragrance collector. Since falling for it, I guess I'll now have to join the ranks of fans waiting for a bottle to appear on Ebay.",12/12/12 11:17,missk
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I wanted to love this and I am a honey fan. But the orange and bergamont made this too lemoney for my taste. It dries down and for like an hour, smells divine. It smells like honey, toffee and creamy vanilla. I also didn't care for the solid form which I had to scrape with my fingernail out of the tin. Luckily the Bath and Body Works reformulation of Warm Vanilla Sugar smells like the dry down of this. I highly recommend.",10/25/12 11:20,deliberateangel
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,Does anyone know of a fragrance that truly smells like Honey I Washed The Kids soap and hasn't been discontinued?,10/17/12 15:31,shiverwithantici
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Sweeeeeeet but dont care coz HIWTK is lovely super YUMMY scent! It's rich caramel toffee!!

If you still cant imagine how is the scent and dont have LUSH shop nearby, u can go supermarket & find Werther's original candy, it is the same!!!",09/10/12 11:16,Arkira M.
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Yummy! They captured this scent very nicely. Smells just like HIWTK soap and It's Raining Men shower gel. It is extremely sweet but so yummy. It's a very honey, caramel, and slightly floral scent that just makes you want to eat yourself!! lol",02/18/12 20:31,fullbottleworthy

Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I am a fan of Lush's Honey I Washed the Kids Soap and was excited when the fragrance edition of this scent came out. Unfortunately there's something here that's not quite right with this scent.

On my skin it never settles down to that gorgeous toffee/honey/caramel scent that I've come to love. I believe the bergamot and orange mixture in this is what's making this rather sharp. There's no warmth here, its very much a cold sharp sweet smell that reminds me of white bleached sugar.

However, when my bottle of this leaked onto a scarf I was delighted to find the resulting scent a lot closer to the warm toffee caramel scent I love. I wont be repurchasing this but its a nice thing to have in my collection.",09/07/11 20:47,Raina
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I really love Lush a lot.They care so much for the Mother Earth,and for the animals. I still have a pinch left of the solid for this lovely vegan scent,but I am running really low. I am sad that mine is almost gone.

I simply cannot afford this spray (I want it though,and I am so happy it is vegan)

I have a GORGEOUS dupe from a sweet online seller. It is a roll-on oil. It smells like sweet orange candy, and toffee. Very softly scented.",02/04/11 15:25,tenderhearted
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"There is something fresh lingering behind the sweetness, something that refreshes you while it lulls you. It's not really citrussy rather what's left after the citrussy has gone. A tingy sharpness that gives this sweet scent its charm.

Whenever I use it, people react. I love it, it lifts my mood.",07/15/10 14:26,Nemia
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"Toffee, salted caramelised oranges and honey. Not enough honey IMHO, there's an almost Greek Honey yoghurt quality to this, not too bad at all, but works better in the Lush soap form.",02/22/10 07:13,EnglishCountryGarden
Honey I Washed the Kids Lush,"I used to work in Lush so am very familiar with this smell. It's a one of kind gorgeousness that's hard to describe. The description of Citrus/Gourmand is wrong in my opinion. It's not citrussy.
If you think this blend is going to be overwhelmed by honey then fear not.
It's a very light, almost Tofee-Lite smell which is sooo addictive and comforting. Beautiful beautiful smell. The soap and other products are just as gorgeous. If you've ever had a chocolate bar called ""Caramac"" then you're onto the right track of what this smells like.",02/22/10 06:56,Ouch!
Creamy Candy Lush,"Smells JUST like Snowy Fairy. If you have that, and couldn’t get your hands on this one during the recent launch, you’re not missing anything.",05/05/24 07:20,Frontandscenter
Creamy Candy Lush,"Wanted to like this based off of the description and other comments but there's a synthetic cloud that overshadows the powdery sweetness offered by it. By the time the plasticy smell fades, so does everything else. To me it smells more like trying to smell a strawberry, creamy taffy through the wax paper wrapper. There is a tinge of vanilla but I smell the creamy strawberry more.

WIll let it sit for a while to see if it's having an off day or if macerating will help, but for now it's giving car freshener where the cardboard card overpowers the fragrance itself.",04/01/24 14:42,vinky
Creamy Candy Lush,"This is a really soft, powdery, strawberry-and-vanilla scent, it’s not as bright and strong as snow fairy, but they are in a similar vein.
It reminds me of their candy fluff scent, but that was more sweetie shop, and this is more strawberry candy.
I love it, it’s super sweet but not cloying, very girly but I don’t care, I smell lovely.",02/04/24 13:08,Rosiewebber
Creamy Candy Lush,"To me Creamy Candy and Snow Fairy are cousins, not sisters. Both exude ""if pink was a smell"" energy, but SF is fruity and unashamedly synthetic, whereas CC is a powdery vanilla with hints of violet. They're both extremely sweet so I definitely understand why some insist they're the same scent -- it's like how I feel like Grass and Tramp ""basically smell the same"" even though every time I say this I get an inevitable barrage of WTF?! responses LOL. Scent is subjective et cetera... Anyway, I'll copy & paste my thoughts from my review under the 2012 formulation:

Snagged a bottle from the re-release and I'm pleased to report it smells the same as my 2012 bottle, though noticeably lighter/softer. I'm not too concerned though, it's a freshly made perfume so should grow stronger with age. For now I'll put it aside and allow it to macerate a bit more. **EDIT: well, I have to eat my words. I'm beyond gutted. On release people were comparing this to smelling like Red Bull and I couldn't see it at first, but as my bottle has macerated and grown stronger I can smell it... it's NOT the same as my 2012 bottle. Like okay I know that one is over a decade old but it ACTUALLY smells like the bubble bar, this 2023 version smells sweeter and more synthetic and almost like it has a beer/yeasty note to it. Ugh....",01/06/24 12:25,kpop_stan
Creamy Candy Lush,"I’m happy to have this but as other reviews state, it’s basically snow fairy. Even my Husband who uses Snow Fairy shower gel and also knows my body spray smelt it and said ""That's Snow Fairy""! It’s slightly less fruity than the current snow fairy body spray but essentially it is snow fairy in a (light!) perfume concentration. The vanillic creamy candy comes through in the deep dry down but the perfume has become a skin scent at that point. It's almost white chocolatey before it disappears and it's a shame that doesn't come in sooner, because that's the part that diverges from snow fairy and actually smells creamy.

This is the one I’ll wear as it works a bit better on my skin than snow fairy body spray. I’ll use the body spray on my bedding! Yes it’s a bit of shame that this isn’t quite the creamy candy people wanted but I think it's worth having.... I just think Lush might have annoyed a fair few customers with this and supermilk as neither seem to smell the way people were expecting, but I really like both! Wish they lasted a bit longer though.",01/05/24 06:54,Skinscents4Fusspots
Creamy Candy Lush,"Love,love,love it sooo much.It is very nutty gourmand fragrance,very strong,with good projection.I feel a lot of the sweetness from vanilla, sugar and fruits,also the heart of the seed from apricot.Do not compare to fairy snow,there is a very small similarity.",01/04/24 04:09,Galya
Shade Lush,"The change in packaging is the biggest cancer ever so maybe getting the spray is the next best move! My signature one of these travel Lush perfume’s, super clean… smells almost like dove soap with sandalwood shavings. Love it!!!!!!!!!!",,glossyjul69
Shade Lush,"Very pretty. It's nothing much in the tube, but on skin it becomes a nice second skin scent which smells like high quality sandalwood body cream over skin that was washed with Dove soap.
