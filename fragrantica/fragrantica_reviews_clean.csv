Spring Breeze Clean,"First impressions: (rollerball)
I really like this, smells like white floral clean, kind of like a clean jasmine smell but not too indolic more on the clean side.
Dear Fragrantica an add every 3 seconds is horrendous. Change it.",11/09/25 15:16,AdalynEverly
Spring Breeze Clean,"Ugh. I wanted to like this. *so* BAD! The notes are totally me, Lavender, Lily of the Valley, White musk, and Green Apple, all notes I was hoping would shine through equally and mend together well, but this is too floral, too clean, almost smells like straight freshener, it isn't a chemical like smell, but just so floral it really doesn't allow the other notes to shine through! I got this as a blind buy at TJ MAXX, and I always adore Clean's perfume's, but this one is genuinely too much. On the plus side, I love to use this as a base scent to layer my cleaner scents, usually I will use this as a base and layer on Daisy Dream, which is light enough to where they actually meld very well together, and almost balance out! I still will give this a decent rating simply because it can be a very good base for other perfumes, but alone I think you might smell like Fabulosa. 6.5/10.",10/06/25 01:06,LavenderElixir
Spring Breeze Clean,"I didnt put this on my skin yet, i am too scared. it seems too air freshener-ish. A little too much with the cleaner vibe. Not sure where i would wear this? It is too happy for a funeral, too clean for a date, too juvenile for work, too feminine for the gym, too effervescent for chilling, too bright for night time. It is like music that never seems to go well in any playlist. It’s like someone used chatgpt to come up with fragrance notes for “spring”. This is the kind of thing that Ai could use against humanity, future generations will believe this is what Spring smells like. I dread the future.",09/01/25 06:43,AuthenticAF
Spring Breeze Clean,"Clean really does put out ""clean"" scents. Every one of their fragrances I've tried are compositions that remind me of 'out of the shower' cleanliness. This one, compared to some of their others, is more on the floral side. Yes, you can absolutely still smell the aldehydes, but there's that very bright and crisp apple note that hits you on the opening. The more prominent florals in this for me are the lily and the lavander as it develops. I came across this one at a discount store and since I have loved a lot of their fragrances, I blind bought it. It wasn't anything groundbreaking of course, but I've grown to enjoy this one as the summer has progressed.",08/12/25 16:20,Adenahi
Spring Breeze Clean,"I REALLY wanted to like this. I got it as a blind buy since the notes interested me. I can hardly smell the floral notes, and as much as I love “clean” scents, it just smells like chemicals. if layered with something more floral, it’s a lot more bearable but I probably wont purchase this again.",08/01/25 10:47,sheepfan24
Spring Breeze Clean,"Go to a funeral home, take a nice big sniff, and it will smell the same as the disaster that awaits in this bottle",07/20/25 09:41,onika549
Spring Breeze Clean,"Clean perfumes to my nose have a tendency to smell the same depending on which fragrance (IE: aqua neroli and solar blossom (?) smell the same on my skin after a few hours) but this one is very nice!!
I live in a climate that gets scorching in the summer, so I've been searching for some more clean perfumes and was able to get my hands on a rollerball sample set. This one is extremely clean, almost to the point of it smelling like a bathroom product? But not enough like it to turn me off of the perfume. Super great to keep smelling fresh throughout the hot months",04/21/25 06:57,ghostyhartnotes
Spring Breeze Clean,"I was able to try this from the Clean Classic rollerball sampler I got from Marshalls. Lovely spring perfume. I put it at night before bed and when I woke up the next morning it was the first thing I smelled. Sillage is intimate tho, I think. Overall a lovely fragrance.",04/17/25 21:30,miral19
Spring Breeze Clean,Rosy muguet... somewhat reminds me of Aqcua Universalis.,04/13/25 03:01,Mez0Nez
Spring Breeze Clean,"Spring in a bottle! I' m amazed that they could make such perfekt scent for this season, I'm amazed! Just so nice and effortlessly beautiful.",03/08/25 07:52,Heidi2021
Spring Breeze Clean,"I got a sample of this from Clean. Not too bad, I would say it is a very floral perfume. Tbh it smells very generic on me personally. I would say it's a safe blind buy but pretty boring overall.",04/08/24 17:47,dnfangrl
Spring Breeze Clean,"I am a bit dissapointed. I was hoping it would smell close to Clean Air that has been discontinued. I like the opening, but after a few minutes there is a sharp note to it. After 1 hour it smells like something you would clean your bathroom with. Blindbuy.",04/08/24 12:08,tristan99
Spring Breeze Clean,I love this scent. It’s strong but not overwhelming. Floral but not sweet. Modern but classic at the same time. I think it’s perfect for office as any of the Clean perfumes. I’m scent sensitive but I never had negative reactions on any of the Clean perfumes (I have 7 😅),03/25/24 18:31,desertsnow555
Spring Breeze Clean,Nice spring scent.,03/03/24 15:20,Snj698
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Really good on paper but the atomizer is terrible, and was STICKY on skin. Also didn’t smell great on. It was giving playdough.",10/18/25 15:28,SMELLY00000
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"I love this. It's my second favorite in Clean's H2EAU line (Musk Noir is my #1, one of my favs of all time and my current signature). This is by far my favorite nectarine/peach scent ever. It's sweet, fruity, feminine, with a slight powderiness that really smooths it out. Highly highly recommend.",07/10/25 11:27,caro.mil
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,Smells like peach shampoo,05/25/25 13:36,Nylonx064
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,I can't be the only one who smells watermelon and not nectarine,05/12/25 05:50,junica
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"I liked this on paper—I remember it being pleasantly juicy and sweet. However, this and the one other Clean fragrance I’ve tried (Rain & Pear) have both turned unexpectedly musky when I’ve sprayed them on skin. I know “musk” is in fact listed as one of the base notes, but this felt different from others I’ve smelled and became noticeable immediately rather than in the background or the dry-down. I wrote it off as the chocolate note or some other characteristic of Rain & Pear but the fact that this one had such a similar quality and it wasn’t present on paper is making me wonder. Maybe it’s my chemistry?",05/04/25 15:22,yankeehotelfoxtrot
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Maybe I just have unsophisticated taste, but I really like the whole H2Eau collection, especially this scent. It smells like expensive salon shampoo in the best way. But I am also a sucker for any fresh & clean scent, so I don't necessarily have high standards.",03/09/25 21:59,Violasororia
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Pretty, soft, clean floral scent. This isn’t a show stopper by any means. But it will be nice once the weather warms up in the spring for quick errands or to take the kids to the playground.",02/06/25 13:40,PerfumeLove22
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"basic floral-fruit fragrance 8/10
- kinda smells like Pantene",01/02/25 17:04,Lasodine
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,Summer teenage vibes. Not sophisticated. I’m dismayed at reports that it stains clothing. Got rollerball sample in Sephora kit. Gave it to my mother-in-law.,12/04/24 06:41,Sniffey
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"This scent is bright, juicy and fresh. On my skin it is nearly jammy. It clean but very edible- kind of like the liquid filled bath beads my great aunties had in their Maximalist-Coquette, ruffled powder rooms. This seems timeless, any age could wear this! The fruit does not smell synthetic, the amber really shines hours into wearm this lasts 8-12 hours on my self. It does dry down a bit sticky and can stain clothes.",10/22/24 08:52,jbonesXX
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,Soft floral nectarine scent that I actually like better than Jo Malone's nectarine and honey because the honey sometimes in that scent can be too much in warm weather.,09/11/24 11:53,nickinicole
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"It's absolutely a shampoo-y fragrance, but one that's very fresh and appealing, in my opinion. I really like it. And I can still smell it very well almost 3 hours later. Strangely, though, it has made the part of skin that I sprayed sort of sticky/tacky?? This would make me reluctant to spray it on my hair or clothes!",08/27/24 17:56,Elana
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"A very clean scent. It smells so good, LOREAL kids type vibes, a grown up better version of it. Clean linen on a breezy day, probably by the pool, sipping on cold iced water with an orange slice on the rim just for the aesthetic. I really like it. The chamomile really comes through in this perfume, I'm obsessed with it. It's very calming and energizing at the same time. Could be worn on the hottest days (boat days). But also perfect for cold winter days. From day to night, great after a shower. Very clean girl, (total unisex) light citrus, nothing too sweet but it does smell a bit like sour green apple, in a good way. Pairs well with sunscreen (tanning lotion), Byredo Gypsy Water, Gucci Flora (pink bottle) Le Monde Gourmand Citrus Glace, to name a few. BISOUS",07/18/24 09:51,spaceybailey
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Terrible formula. I got a sample rollerball of this and it dries incredibly sticky on skin. Just a small amount on clothing will leave a noticeable stain. The scent itself is okay, slightly tart, citrusy, and not too sweet, but almost no projection at all. It would be an okay summer scent with a different formula, but absolutely not worth buying as is.",07/13/24 10:29,Apurpleunicorn
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Quite fruity, I just wish the nectarine was a touch sweeter on me. I definitely wouldn’t call it a floral scent. It has minimal sillage and only lasts about 4 hours. In terms of perfumes listed as similar—
✔️ Jo Malone Nectarine Blossom & Honey: very similar
✔️ Oakcha The Beekeeper: very similar",04/16/24 20:20,anamawsity
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Based on the notes I thought I'd love this, however unfortunately this is a no for me. The notes all kinda blend together to smell like a generic fruit scented liquid hand soap. While I applaud the effort to innovate with using a water based formula, this does unfortunately take a while to settle & dries sticky which I personally wasn't a huge fan off",04/09/24 19:02,Lauren_Trouble
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"This is a disappointment. This fragrance dries down STICKY. Not only that but because it's water based, it stains the clothing it touches. While this fragrance is nice, it's nothing to write home about. It's very juvenile, with the nectarine being a lasting note from first spray to dry down. That's all I smell is nectarine and nothing else. This would make a decent scent for a girl in her teens, maybe even early 20s. Not a sophisticated or expensive fragrance at all. This reminds me a lot of Jessica Simpson's Fancy. A very fruity gourmand, your-skin-but-better fragrance.",03/22/24 15:18,LoreinaL
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Hands down, my favorite scent from the line. I'm surprised that the current rating is so low.

It's light, bright, clean - simply lovely. I'd classify it as fresh scent with some floral and fruity touches. Beautifully blended. Easy reach for spring and summer, any occasion. Nonoffensive.

If I could buy only one scent from this line, it'd be this scent.

I only wish the brand replaced rollerballs with travel sprays. I never buy rollerballs.",02/17/24 13:29,fragrance_girl
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,Yes it smells like shampoo but once the Amber note pulls through OUU 😮💨😮💨. This is a perfect perfume for spring and summer time for me because it’s not too fresh but it still has a nice lasting power ! That peach note is wonderful aswell,02/16/24 10:39,ambarmari3
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,The spray was a weird one. It came out almost like foamy or bubbly. The liquid is thick and different. Now on to the smell it’s light and fresh smelling like nectarine. Like others have said it has a shampoo type of scent. It’s pleasant but nothing ground breaking.,02/12/24 18:16,Bibimarq09
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Be warned - this line of H2EAU fragrances stains clothing like a spill of vegetable oil. It is not alcohol based so when you apply, make sure to not let it touch fabrics. Also, it gets gummy / sticky. This line is great in concept but disappointing in execution.",02/12/24 08:59,bvarney_zip
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"I agree with the other reviewers, this really smells like shampoo. Also reminds me of sweet pea from bath and body works. But synonymous with clean, freshness. The floral notes are very pretty. Simple, would be pleasant for everyday",02/05/24 11:33,funkadelic15
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"I definitely get the nectarine, and although it does smell a bit like shampoo, I don't mind it. However, it disappeared on my skin within 2 hours. Granted, I did not prep with any moisturizer or other type of base, but most of my scents last longer than that on their own. Perhaps it is the nature of this fragrance line, so if lighter scents appeal to you, I recommend giving it a try!",01/31/24 08:59,Micarls
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,"Such a pretty fragrance, especially for spring and summer! To me it’s bright, fresh, sweet, radiant, watery, florals with the peach blossom and chamomile. It also has the prettiest sweet and slightly tangy nectarine note and a touch of warm amber and musk! The amber and musk develops more on me during the dry down. It has this rather unique watery scent to it too! I don’t see watery notes listed anywhere, but I do find the watery scent to be fairly prominent. I think the picture they use (Clean Reserve) with the hands, petals, and water really shows the perfect visual representation of this fragrance!

I’m not typically drawn to a lot of floral fragrances (I’m more of a beachy/coconut, vanilla, and gourmand kind of girl), but I was really intrigued by the description and notes of this one. While I can’t say it’s my favorite fruity floral, I still think it’s a beautiful fragrance. I definitely do really like it and hope I’ll like it even more when it’s not 10 degrees outside. I do think it’s slightly similar to Clean Reserve Radiant Nectar, but definitely more floral and watery. For reference, some of my favorite florals are Coach Love, Coach Poppy Blossom, Coach Poppy Wildflower, Flowerbomb, FB Ruby Orchid, FB Nectar, FB Midnight, and Chloe Love Story.

Since this was a blind buy for me, I bought the travel size which is a rollerball. I wasn’t sure what to expect with this new H2Eau water-based formula, but it surprised me. This lasts all day on me and the projection is nice as well, it radiates out about an arm’s length with just a light application.",01/20/24 18:42,Shimmer412
H2Eau Nectarine Petal Clean,Very light. Smells like shampoo. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. Smells good though,01/16/24 20:55,MaxieF
Blonde Rose Clean,"Straight up cleaning chemicals/hospital disinfectant /cough syrup/bug spray or something. Very unpleasant.

There's a hint of musk. Other than that I don't get anything I recognize.",10/23/25 09:22,ElShap
Blonde Rose Clean,The sting of the nose is for sure there. But calms down to a soft fresh blonde scent with roses hinting. For the price it’s a good buy in a smaller size until you find out how your skin handles it. Honestly it’s a spring and fall frag. Unique.,04/03/25 06:27,Scentropolis
Blonde Rose Clean,"This is very soapy and clean, but very strong on me. It gives me 'old lady' meets 'cologne' but I mean that in a good way. The florals come through but the rose doesn't stand out to me. It's very feminine and sexy to me. I honestly want to like this more than I do because I think it's interesting, but most of the time it triggers a minor headache for me so I may end up needing to sell my bottle.",12/28/24 21:01,radshaaay
Blonde Rose Clean,Just got two pieced by a fragrance. First quick jab in the 1-2 combo was the sharp floral that slightly singed my nose. Then soon came the cross that knocked my nose out with the strong soapy aldehydes. At no point do I get any hint of the base notes. Definitely not a safe blind buy. Clean reserve Skin and Radiant Nectar remain as the favorites from this line for me.,12/10/24 12:45,NaeNoona
Blonde Rose Clean,"I am really picky about aldehydic laundry scents (I declutterred MFK 724) but I find this one entirely inoffensive, feminine, and soft. It’s not the most special thing in the world but it does evoke a Cicely Mary Barker flower fairy doing laundry. Layers nicely with Nest Wisteria Blue for a bit more flower dew or Ellis Brooklyn Salt for a bit more sandalwood.",09/18/24 10:05,mewitthaus
Blonde Rose Clean,Woods and musk and woods and soap and woods. Maaaaybe a touch of rose in there. Stings the nose.,07/05/24 13:49,FlowerSeeker
Blonde Rose Clean,"Ummmm, this is a beautiful freshie! I don't understand the reviews but fragrance is subjective. To me, this is a beautfiul feminine, clean girl scent. I don't see in what world that this is masculine leaning. It's clean, floral, and super pretty smelling. The value is unbelievable too. I paid $50 for a 100ml. This is an everyday easy grab. I adore it! Lasts all day on me too. 4.5/5.",04/29/24 13:53,Momto3Balls
Blonde Rose Clean,A blindbuy because I love rosescents (nowhere to test it) ....All I got was the smell of a cheap soap bar ~ gave it away because I couldn't stand it .,02/03/24 09:32,Tsagaglalal
Blonde Rose Clean,The initial scent smells of aldehydes which quickly gives way to a lightly smoked woody celery. I do not detect more than a hint of rose. It is poorly named or my batch forgot the rose!,08/05/23 15:41,bvarney_zip
Blonde Rose Clean,"Was hoping for something more rosey, but this is like all aldehydes.",04/04/23 09:46,restein
Blonde Rose Clean,"I've started going through my honestly massive backlog of fragrances (thanks pandemic era hyper fixation!) and I grabbed this one on a whim and ended up ADORING it. Its cozy but doesn't scream 'wear in cold weather', unique but familiar, sophisticated but not too 'mature'. I can't wait to spend more time with it and get to know it even better. My only real complaint is that I feel like, on me at least, it doesn't have much lasting power. I also wish the company wouldn't use outdated terminology in their marketing.",01/09/23 08:33,kelseyfperry
Blonde Rose Clean,Yes it doesn’t necessarily smell rosey or sweet. The dry down is honestly masculine but its still intriguing and pleasant. I’ve had this perfume for more than 2 years now but I’ve only found the opportunity to wear it maybe 5/6 times in total,11/10/22 21:35,qqcheeky
Blonde Rose Clean,"oh you gotta wait for the drydown!

upon initial spray this does smell like greens and leans masculine

but the drydown smells sooo good. it reminds me of gap grass",08/12/22 01:23,geelightning
Blonde Rose Clean,reminds me of old traditional herbal medicine. yuck,06/18/22 22:13,grack
Blonde Rose Clean,It doesn’t smell like rose. It’s like a cheap synthetic rose that you’d find in a cheap oil. It’s more aldehydes and musk than anything else. This is one of the very few fragrances that I hate.,06/08/22 09:48,PhonePotato
Blonde Rose Clean,"Very clean scent with a backing of rose. Love to wear this when I don't feel like doing much to my appearance and still want to smell nice. Doesn't permeate the whole room, but is noticeable if you are next to the person. Overall good everyday perfume.",05/13/22 19:51,EllePro
Blonde Rose Clean,"Starts off like a dewy fresh green rose for a few minutes and then develops into something oddly rooty-earthy-vegetal. Someone below mentioned peppered celery and that's spot on - a green vegetable V8 smoothie with nothing to sweeten or sex it up, just straight up celery, spinach and kale in a blender. There's something weirdly bbq-ish going in the background, like some smoked ham or salami. A very odd scent that does not evoke ""clean"".",04/19/22 19:17,boozya
Blonde Rose Clean,"The initial spray reminds me of ...peppered celery. Then it dries down into leather or suede and dirt. I can't believe that there are flowers in this! Definitely masculine, but not in a good way. I wouldn't want my man to smell like this.",10/02/21 21:37,PekoeMint
Blonde Rose Clean,This leans very masculine to me unfortunately 😢,08/08/21 14:49,Kswhittaker
Blonde Rose Clean,"Something in this fragrance gave me a huge allergic reaction. When sprayed in the neck, it made my skin very dry and itchy. The next day I sprayed it on my hair, careful to avoid my scalp, thinking that way I would react less to it. The result: runny nose, itchy scalp and face and breakouts on my face. Obviously, not my smartest idea.

Too bad, because it's a pretty nice scent. Nothing special, but pretty good as an everyday scent. Floral and musky, and maybe a bit too masculine for my liking, but the woods had an interesting effect: they gave it a nice hint of cigarettes. Not tobacco, but the lingering smell of a cigarette you've smoked an hour ago. Something I've always had a weak spot for, both on men and women. It transported me to my early twenties, when most of the time I smelled of The BS White Musk and cigarettes.

So yeah, nostalgia and allergies. Not the best of combinations.


If someone in NL is looking to buy this, I have a full bottle for sale :)",05/29/21 12:35,LueurVerte
Blonde Rose Clean,This smells exactly like what it smells like after you fake tan and you’re left with that syrupy smell. I don’t find this to be an extremely pleasant smell. This ones a no from me,03/07/21 15:37,Carolined282
Blonde Rose Clean,"Tested this out today because I was looking for not-in-your face rose fragrance. I was pleased that some people have been mentioning TF white suede and that smoky note! (which TF White Suede also has). -- So it wasn't just me.

I'll keep it short and sweet. I really do not get rose here :( But it's a combination of clean woods, soap, powder, and a hint of smoke. The combination is quite subtly sexy.

Though I have converted to the idea that perfumes are genderless, those who haven't embraced this idea 100% might find this leaning masculine.

Shall I purchase? Hmmm, still sniffing my arm, but it might be in my list of future buys.",02/16/21 03:50,880267
Blonde Rose Clean,"Pleasant, light floral scent. I can't imagine this bothering or offending anyone.",01/19/21 14:15,bdragonfly12345
Blonde Rose Clean,"I absolutely love Blonde Rose. It's a very pretty, clear, tender, scent. I get some roses from the get go and a delicate musky drydown. It lasts for hours, but always stays close. It's my go-to feel-good perfume.
About the whole baby oil vibe: yeah, that's the best part for me!",10/31/20 12:12,liat
Blonde Rose Clean,"I’ve got a tester a while ago, since then I have tried it several times but I still don’t like it.

The name Blonde Rose is very misleading. They’re is nothing blonde or rose here. It smells like cologne for men. I don’t feel rose at all although it’s listed. Just woodsy male smell. If you are into unisex smells you may like it.",10/18/20 03:08,Domina1
Blonde Rose Clean,"Blonde Rose gets male'ish on my skin. Its a wonderful, soft, longlived scent that I would looove on a man. On my skin I get the cedar, sandalwood and an airy note - very fresh mix.",09/04/20 02:05,Mooniq
Blonde Rose Clean,"I really like this. I was surprised that few people commented on the smoke smell. Most perfumes that people say smell like cigarettes just honestly don’t.

But this?

Cigarettes, soap, and roses. I absolutely adore it! The kind of smell that I can’t stop sniffing where I sprayed it because I enjoy it so much. Also reminds me of staying in moderately upscale chain hotels (a smell I am chasing always)",08/29/20 18:21,marymag
Blonde Rose Clean,This perfume smells musky and peppery with just a hint of rose. It has amazing lasting power and is uniquely feminine!,08/13/20 17:49,AllieBree2
Blonde Rose Clean,"To my nose this is very woody. It initially smelled masculine and a bit like an old wardrobe. I kept smelling sandalwood until I kind of sunk my nose into the spot I sprayed the perfume on in the morning and I was surprised - smells like flowers and it's rather sweet! It does smell like baby oil - it's soft and clean, here I can sense the rose and jasmine. It had been developing for 10 hours at this point. Its longevity is outstanding! It sits very close to the skin though, I showed it to my colleague but she has to get very close to the spot I sprayed to feel it. She said she found it floral and clean, she really liked it. Try this on a cold day - I think it flourishes when it's windy and chill. It would probably work well in rainy weather too because the wood makes it feel cozy.",09/27/19 07:48,diva_100
Blonde Rose Clean,"I originally disliked this a lot but it grew on me. What I didn't like about it was how harsh and detergent-like this was but the brand is called ""Clean"" so maybe I'm asking this perfume to be something it's not branded to be. I am catching whiffs of aquatic florals on a soapy base after a while. I also get a nice rose water scent in the dry down. It leans masculine. Not the best perfume ever, but also not the worst.",09/09/19 08:35,colorfulmess
Blonde Rose Clean,"I use these to make my own blends. Love mixing this with the Sueded Oud, the Sel Santal or Jennifer Lopez Still.",05/20/19 18:16,livefromtexas
Blonde Rose Clean,"I am surprised with all the negative reviews! I absolutely love it. Someone mentioned baby oil....yes there is that element in it. It smells powdery and fresh and clean with some hint of smoke (not cigarette smoke, more like campfire) and florals. It reminds me of my childhood, not sure why, something in this scent has triggered an emotional note!",04/30/19 11:23,MaryushaMTL
Blonde Rose Clean,"Definitely unisex - way more masculin than feminin IMO. Blonde roses? Not many roses on my skin, just a lot of sandalwood and soap. Not at all unpleasant, but a disappointment if you wanted some fresh, sweet roses in the blend. And I did.
Very clean, dry and woody. Nice perfume, but not at all what I expected or wanted. Won't use it again, it triggered my migraine.",08/16/18 13:52,GardenDays
Blonde Rose Clean,"This is just a big, huge nope for me. :(",07/14/18 16:55,opalescenttreeshark
Blonde Rose Clean,"Well I don't see Leather listed as a note, but I do see musk. I say this because my first impression after two sprays and 10 minutes is..... a more pedestrian Tom Ford White Suede.

I don't really get rose that much at all, and it has less of that ""laundry"" note than White Suede, but honestly if you like WS there is no reason to bother with this one. And if you DON'T like WS, well there's even more reason not to bother lol!

Clean has some winners, but I wouldn't necessarily say this is one of them. It doesn't really evoke anything specific or fun or intriguing.",04/01/18 05:11,JackieM

Blonde Rose Clean,"I purchased a trio of mini size rollerballs from the Reserve collection, one of the fragrance was Blonde Rose, being that I enjoy rose fragrances it was the first I opened and tried on my wrist... it was a dissapointement to be honest, on me , the first thing that came to mind was Johnson's baby oil. Not unpleasant just not for me.",10/12/17 15:17,AzraElle
Blonde Rose Clean,"Today I am wearing a sample of Blonde Rose that I was sent along in a recent swap. Since I am a rose lover and never cease trying yet another fragrance claiming to smell like the Queen of the Garden, this seemed like a fair attempt.
Let me preface my comments by saying that I truly wish that reviews did not include ageism, sexism or snobbery! The beauty of this site is that we are all here to voice our opinions and thoughts with regard to this wonderful subject of fragrance.
For all of us who adore vintage fragrances...how ""OLD LADY"" is that?
Perhaps the perception is merely misguided and what others imagine to be frumpy or old fashioned just stems from the abundance of inexpensive and highly synthetic fragrances that some maiden aunt, teacher or grandma may have worn due to limited resources and choices.
Having said all this, Blonde Rose explodes with aldehydes (found in many older fragrances) and dries down to a very synthetic smelling concoction not unlike a fabric softener or deodorizer. It's not awful, young or old...just ordinary.",01/28/17 13:15,curlykitty8
Blonde Rose Clean,"No offense to old ladies, but this smells like what an old lady would wear. Musty flowers. After reading comments about how it smells like Chi Silk Infusion (which I am infatuated with at the moment) I put some oil on for reference and hurried on down to Sephora to compare it in person. At first sniff, it smelled nothing like it. I then had the sales person smell me (I'm weird, I know) and then blonde rose to see if the problem was my nose. She thought it smelled similar and told me it may change on the skin. Since I was still on the fence about buying it, she was nice enough to give me a sample. Wearing it today and it still smells the same to me....old lady musty flowers. Oh well...my hunt continues.",01/24/17 12:39,carlene808
Blonde Rose Clean,"I smell the rose but it's heavily concealed with aldehydes. Very fresh, clean, soapy smelling a la laundry detergent and hairspray products. Took me 5 wears to get into this. Initially I could smell sandalwood meshed with musk which turned me way off. I gave it another go during cold weather and viola, amazing! Clean clean clean - but, somewhere in there I get a ashy vibe, almost like an ashtray at a laundromat. Stale cigarette smoke mixed with perfume is very nostalgic for me so I'm digging it. I don't know what is causing this reaction from me, as there is ZERO actual tobacco I smell in this, more like ashy residue. Might be the aldehydes (?)

Rose, ashtray, clean air, soap. Great performance. Full bottle worthy? Not for me, but I sure am enjoying my samples.",01/06/17 10:48,tatonnement
Blonde Rose Clean,"Rose? Where's the rose?

Masculine, musky, watery woods. It is pleasant and has depth. This would be a great man's cologne. The opening is shaving cream, as other reviewers have stated. The drydown is much the same, but with the emphasis on sandalwood. If unisex or femme scents are for you, then Blonde Rose is not. If you prefer masculine scents, then give this one a try.",09/06/16 09:07,Neosmiaphyte
Blonde Rose Clean,"I am glad to see I am not the only one who finds this to be rather masculine.

It starts out with an almost citrus-y bitter lime note (is that the aldehydes?) that gives way to water and wood. The rose is there, but it is drowning in shave gel and hair-cream.

I had a great uncle, a WWII vet, lifelong bachelor and ladies man who, even in his 70's, would slick back his hair, put on his best western shirt paired with a turquoise and silver bolo tie to go out to flirting with all the gals, young and old, at the Elks and VFW. He'd have loved this, I think. Blonde Rose has that same sort of freshly scrubbed vibe to me, and his visage instantly came to mind when I smelled it.

Likewise, I find it as appealing a fragrance for me as I would Ol' Uncle Smokey's cologne.",08/28/16 06:00,artemiss
Blonde Rose Clean,"Yessss I agree with the others that this smells exactly like the chi silk infusion hair product! Hahaha that is so crazy....but anyways, this isnt a very feminine fragrance tbh. Its musky and woody, very masculine. I dont mind it as a hair product but as a perfume, just not my taste!",08/23/16 00:16,MrsTefee
Blonde Rose Clean,"I completely agree with the review below, this smells exactly like chi silk infusion. It has that masculine side to it. This is definitely a unisex fragrance. I don't get much rose, I get mostly woody notes.",08/18/16 17:41,Piperok26
Blonde Rose Clean,"Not what I'd call a ""rose"" scent! Definitely more of a musky/masculine fragrance, almost a dead ringer for CHI hair products (Silk infusion, specifically! Hahaha). I think this is very cozy to wear, I do love it!",06/28/16 19:40,Bloodlust
Blonde Rose Clean,"After a consistent number of run-ins with typical celebrity scents and some pungent outlier scents, I've finally got a new potential favorite. Despite how blandly this scent is billed, it has a lot of character. It's very feminine but there's definitely a masculinity to it that I like. This scent just sinks into my skin and almost warms to it, instantly creating more depth. I do get the feeling that this scent has the potential to become cloying if applied to heavily though. I'm going to use my sample up and if I'm still attracted after awhile, I'll splurge on a bottle.

X-posted/submitted to the Sephora's product page for this scent.",04/05/16 11:22,Renflower
Blonde Rose Clean,"I never paid much attention to Clean, until I received a sample of this fragrance. The most predominant note is the sandalwood (to my nose-the amyris, or West Indian type), followed by musk and rose. It is definitely unisex. I would love to smell a man wearing this! Somehow it reminds me of Prada Luna Rossa. At times the soapy note is so strong that it is reminiscent of Irish spring. Despite these associations, I feel like this scent is very natural and could be recreated by mixing essential oils. I hope to do exactly that. If I am not successful, I will definitely buy this one.",04/04/16 19:49,HanaMaui
Blonde Rose Clean,"I adore this fragrance! I will start off by saying that I might be a little biased, as I truly love rose, but this one is a different kind of rose. There is a wooden element that really makes the bubbly, green notes stand out. I lucked out with this one because the roses are identifiable on my skin. It definitely is soapy, but in a feminine way, unlike something like Pure Grace from Philosophy, which just smells like soap. Oddly enough, I got to make my own fragrance this past summer, and it smells very similar to this. I guess I just like these kinds of scents.",02/11/16 21:25,hjrdaisy625
Blonde Rose Clean,"This is not a heavy, sensual, sexy rose. It's a light scent, a bit of rose, a bit of ""makeup"" or ""soap"" smell. Mostly it's just clean and pleasant and lightly floral. I can wear it to work without gassing people out or coming on strong. It's probably not going to win any awards but I enjoy it.",02/08/16 18:11,tandaina
Blonde Rose Clean,"This is the soapiest rose I have ever smelled. It might even be the soapiest perfume I have ever smelled, but I digress. This is more soapy smelling than even a bar of rose scented soap. Needless to say, I'm not a fan. Yes, it smells clean and inoffensive, like you've been scrubbed all over and are ready to mingle. But it's just so uninteresting, and the drydown is that same boring slightly sweet musk that I can't stand in so many fragrances today. I was really hoping for more rose from this, but it really does smell just like bubbles.",02/01/16 20:36,ntabassum92
Blonde Rose Clean,"I'm not big on aldehydes but they are tolerable here with a fresh, crisp rose. Could be considered unisex.",01/30/16 18:34,ta2kitty
Clean Summer Sailing Clean,"I bought a three pack of CLEAN Summer fragrances and it was a blind buy for all three-I hadn’t even heard of them but 1) I LOVE the brand Clean 2) I love summer fragrances so so much 3) it was a steal
Of a deal so why not! This one is so lovely. Reminds me of sailing day by replica (which I love) I wouldn’t say it’s ground breaking or something never done before, but it’s summer, it’s fresh, it’s beautiful and worth the money! I find it definitely unisex I meant to put that on here but I hit more feminine by mistake. It lasts a decent amount of time. Like I always say-you wear your fragrances when where and how YOU want to! Don’t let specifics make you think you can only wear them at certain times of day, year, etc , with that being said, this does lean it self to being a summer fragrance, but I would absolutely wear this year round. Fresh fragrances are my jam so I think they are beautiful year round but each to their own I suppose!!",10/06/21 13:48,Dort0625
Clean Summer Sailing Clean,"This is a love affair. An unexpected one. My Summer Sailing was one of three 15 ml bottles in a set. A friend of mine had bought it, loved the two other and gave Nr 3 to me, since she knew I like Clean Rain. Did I like it? Boy, I loved it, from the first sniff. I had never tried a Sea-perfume before, and never knew I needed one. But I did, and now I'm in love. It reminds me om a salty, fresh breeze, exactly as they promise in the description. How is it possible to recreate a summer night by the sea and put it in a bottle?
Big problem: It's gone. Discontinued. I'm always looking for spare bottles on eBay, but it seems like it was a VERY limited eidtion. I have to rely on my tiny bottle and make it last loooooong.

Clean Summer Sailing Clean,"I have always wanted to try the ""clean"" scents but they are not always readily available in the UK.
So when I saw this in TK Maxx for a tenner, I snatched it up.

This has the same vibe as Demeter ""Thunderstorm"".

Then I read the perfume notes and it states that the ""heart provides accords of fresh air after storm.""

I wouldn't buy this scent again because my nose is also picking up something that smells like a chlorinated swimming pool.",03/17/15 12:09,Autumnal
Clean Summer Sailing Clean,"CLEAN Summer Sailing is like an ocean breeze and refreshing cucumber water! Salty sea air with crisp cucumber that settles down to a fresh mossy musk and green violet leafs. It is a little more on the masculine side, but I think if you like the CLEAN brand then your taste in fragrances falls more in the unisex category. Every now and then I crave an aquatic type scent that is super fresh and CLEAN Summer Sailing is the perfect fix! Honestly, the longevity is awful so spritz liberally and bring the bottle along for touch ups. I own four other CLEAN fragrances and I think Summer Sailing is tied in third place with Cotton T-Shirt as fas as my favorite CLEAN’s go. They are similar fragrances, but Summer Sailing is more sea notes and cucumbers whereas Cotton T-Shirt is a musky lemon scent. Enjoy!",02/06/15 16:53,Addict2Perfume
Clean Summer Sailing Clean,"This fragrance is marketet unisex. It's more on the masculine side but certain types of women can easily pull this off (active outdoor type women, not super-feminine women)

The fragrance is mossy and marine. A bit dark but very ""outdoorsy"" I don't get any lime or cucumber notes. In whole a beautiful scent but as with all Clean perfumes the lasting power is rather short.",05/19/14 10:51,Roslaug

H2Eau Golden Citrus Clean,"Weird, nonlinear citrus. I get more bergamot than mandarin in the opening, itself more peel than fruit. The astringency and whatever is supposed to be the ""water notes"" would make this smell like a disinfectant (albeit a nice one) if left to their own devices. As it is, neroli and musk create an unsettling someone-else's-skin accord which clashes with the blue-tiled mall fountain profile found in the opening. The overall effect is that of a freshly showered armpit, the final traces of a boyfriend's body wash combining with one's own deodorant. It'll disappear before you figure out how to feel about that.",10/11/25 19:02,canecorso
H2Eau Golden Citrus Clean,"A citrusy, aromatic burst of bergamot and mandarin, with watery bitters. It's not overly sweet.

Then, neroli/orange blossom enters and feels very realistic. The wetness of citrus flowers, cool and fresh. It feels citrusy, but not in the jarring lemon or orange oil way, rather soft and with depth.

A touch of musk that has a touch of skankiness further softens and extends it.

It has a bit longer life than most citrusy perfumes and is very pretty. I am not generally a fan of citrus themed perfumes as they are strident and brash and acidic, but, with the neroli, it is really beautiful. I like it.",10/06/25 09:29,Amber Spice

H2Eau Golden Citrus Clean,"This is kind of your standard issue citrus, neroli, musk fragrance. I didn't notice any staining or residue as others have reported. The brand says they used South American Mandarin, but they make no mention of the providence of the neroli (which is expensive) and this doesn't smell like natural neroli.

It's fine, I'd never buy it because frankly there's way better stuff out there. I think if you want a top tier Mandarin you should look towards LV Afternoon Swim,19-69 Capri, Guerlain Mandarin Basilic, Atelier Orange Sanguine, or Acqua Di Parma Mandarino.

H2Eau Golden Citrus Clean,"Too much musk for my liking. I was expecting citrus to be a bit more noticeable, but the musk overwhelmed my nose. At times it almost smelled like a hospital or nursing home? Like cleaning products trying to cover up the smell of sick people due to the combination of notes.

If you're expecting a fresh citrus scent, look elsewhere.",04/13/24 10:42,Woodsygal
H2Eau Golden Citrus Clean,"I don't know how I feel about this, because it really is a generic clean detergent scent.

H2Eau Golden Citrus Clean,"I purchased a roller ball of this scent as a blind buy. The first 15 seconds or so the scent is very acrid, almost nailpolish remover. It quickly disappears and the orange, florals and musk start to appear. It isn't quite the bright, refreshing citrus I was hoping for. The musk, on me, really overpowers the scent. It is like a dulled orange paired with fresh laundry/cleaning product ""clean"" scent together. It's a cozier (?) type of scent with the presebce of the musk and the florals are fairly strong in the beginning. I was hoping more for a stand out citrus scent but this didn't work for me. I will say that I was surprised by the strength and longevity of this scent, being water-based. This *could* be kind of a headache inducer type scent IMO if overdone.",02/10/24 16:20,jillvee
H2Eau Golden Citrus Clean,"I'm having a weird experience with this fragrance. The top notes are gorgeous- light, fresh, crisp and green with a hint of citrus (I actually expected it to be very citrus-heavy given the name). The dry down is warm and musky, still with a bit of green.

But the middle notes... smell horrendous on me. The first time I tried it, there was a period where the fragrance smelled like decaying flowers on me until it settled into the base notes. I don't know if anyone could smell it since it sat really close to my skin, but I would have been mortified if anyone else could smell what I smelled.

I've tried it two more times since then and depending on when I sniff, I may or may not get some of variation of that ickiness as it dries down. I've never had this happen with any frag before and it's honestly a bit alarming.",02/06/24 22:39,Jadelynn

Sweetbriar & Moss Clean,"The only complaint I have against this perfume is it is too intimate.

If this scent were amped up, it would easily be my must-have.

It is very clean, very meditative and refreshing to sniff. If you want an oak moss scent that is fresh, foresty, and earthy, look no further! This is one of the best rain in the forest scents I've come across. That said, it becomes skin scent immediately.

I normally don't mind scents that are close to the skin, but at this price point, I'd expect some sillage for the first half an hour at the very least. This has none of it.

That said, it is among the best oak moss fragrances I've smelt. The other one I can immediately think of is Rewind 1984 (it's a niche brand from Thailand which is extremely hard to source.)

Expensive. Slightly overpriced, but still acceptable as it is unique.",12/09/24 19:59,washudtoj

Sweetbriar & Moss Clean,"I have sampled most all of the Clean Avant Garden collection and I really like this one! I'm not sure I could identify sweetbrier as a singular fragrance note, but it just translates to slightly sweet florals on my skin. I happen to really like moss scents, so that aspect is a plus in my book. It is woody, but the sweetness, which is not overpowering, tempers that. I think this is one of the few Clean fragrances that doesn't reduce down to one or two notes after dry down, which is a nice divergence. I would call this a safer blind buy than other Clean Avant Garden fragrances, some of which really need to be tested first. It is also what I would consider to be more feminine than other fragrances from Clean, because of the slightly sweet florals, so keep that in mind.",10/18/20 05:16,Wwoman

I tried a few of the other scents from the Reserve line before I sprayed this. Its been almost 3 hours and I can’t stop sniffing my arm! It is nice and earthy but not grassy, it has a woody scent that is very comforting and the moss makes it smell like a wet wood on my skin.

AND.... I HATE THIS!

Possibly among the worst fragrances I've bought. with the exception of headachey mom perfumes.

No idea where people are getting the relaxing floral from.

I second the review that it smells like black licorice. slight burnt rubber. chemical. bitter.

it smells a little bit like shoe polish

it also smells similar to a suede jacket.

it's an absolute masterpiece in that it PERFECTLY REPLICATES the unique smell of a clean itchy wooly sweater, washed without any fabric conditioner. it also smells like freshly ironed clean men's business shirts. the steamy bitter vapours of damp cotton being ironed.

I can see that some might smell it as white woods but not sweet wood, more like freshly cut timber. take a wiff of some raw cut timber or snap a handful of twigs in autumn and smell it. woody. not sweet. just wood.

unusual compared to the other clean fragrances in that it doesn't smell of soap or lemon

occasions to wear it? definately unisex. not feminine at all. I actually wonder if it is men's. I thinkk the only time it would be OK to wear this is in the office if you like the above smells and want something inoffensive and clean. or maybe if you haven't had time to clean your clothes.or as a fabric or room spray if you want your place to smell like everything is freshly washed but not smelling of citrus or detergent.

You really do have the feeling that you're bundled up in a nice warm cashmere sweater. This is a high-quality skin scent. It lasts an incredibly long time, but it doesn't project wildly. It's a little pricey, but deals can be found on the net. It's cruelty free and vegan, which I like. Sadly, I think this is discontinued.

Clean Cashmere Clean,"One of the cosy, musky quartet from CLEAN (Skin, White Woods, Cashmere and Warm Cashmere). I like them all. Warm cashmere definitely makes me think of a cosy cardigan, but not this one. Cashmere is just nice and musky. First minutes there's very much going on. Citrus, flowers, some spices - a hint of tobacco? - and - of course - musk. But it soon settles, and you have more musk, now together with wood and lavender for a while. Then: here comes the tonka beans! Enjoy the sweet musky/caramel blend for a couple of hours before Cashmere fades away. Luckily there are some sandalwood strokes in the sweet mixture. Sometimes I really love it, sometimes I'm not into the caramel sweetness. It's office safe. Unisex? The first hour perhaps. To me, it's definitely on the feminine side, but we are all different and unique and that's great!
// Update a few years later: I can safely say that this is one of my all time favourites, and definitely the best of the CLEAN perfumes. So sad it's discontinued, but I have an unopened 60 ml bottle still. It's elegant, grown-up and safe, and nowadays I don't find it as sweet an caramel-y as I did before. Perfect for me for autumn and winter.",06/26/18 06:34,GardenDays
Clean Cashmere Clean,"It's got a smokey, dry incense feel to it. I daresay soft oriental.
For people who want to humbly enjoy a taste of oriental without making a scene.

Cashmere is different from all the other Clean scents. It doesn't try hard to be clean and fresh.

Close to skin, lasts about 3~4 hours.
Unisex, no doubt.",06/07/17 06:41,de173eld
Clean Cashmere Clean,"Woody and musky, with a slightly sheer lavender undertone. It's almost dry! On me the first hour is straight up pine needles. I'm not complaining. It smells a little like Needles and Pine shower jelly by Lush, which is one of my all-time favourite bath products. After an hour or so the musk adds in with the lavender. In the end it sits close to the skin. Very pleasant. Not that long lasting, though.

I like the woodiness and muskiness. It's so different compared to the other Clean perfumes. I hate them and the detergent-y aesthetic. This I can dig. It's a good combination of feminine and masculine.",05/18/17 14:40,app9
Clean Cashmere Clean,"I love this one, and carry a rollerball in my purse at all times because A) it doesn't last very long and requires touch ups and B) It layers and plays nicely with all other scents. This is a skin scent, and clean white musk. It really does smell like a cosy cashmere sweater! But like all the Clean scents I have, it doesn't LAST and I use it more like a body spray! A good way to try this is the buy the rollerball trio - Clean Skin, Cashmere, and Warm Cotton - and try them all if you like laundry musks and skin scents. They also play well together. I love Clean's scents in the way I love Philosophy's scents - when I just can't think about what fragrance I want to wear, or can't justify using a luxury scent, these are what I reach for. They're easy on the wallet, and you can use them with abandon. As a signature, not really one that stands out or smells unique, but there's a place for these in the world nonetheless.",02/19/17 11:06,laurniko
Clean Cashmere Clean,"This is a really interesting scent...kind of unique. It reminds me of my grandma because IT SMELLS LIKE INSULIN. I'm not sure if insulin has a smell on its own, or maybe they used to add something to it that gave it a certain smell, but I remember how my diabetic grandmother would inject it into her stomach and I remember liking how it smelled. This is a sweeter version of it, but I don't think I can wear this scent without being reminded of insulin and my late grandmother.",01/08/17 12:11,Neckromancer
Clean Cashmere Clean,"My go to-scent at the moment.

Almost liquorice finish to it, this perfume suits woolly jumpers and vintage dresses alike. Personally, I have never been able to smell lavender in anything (not even when sticking my face to a bush of it) so it is lost to me but the scent opens to fresh bergamot which then gently deepens to the liquorice-tinted muskiness. It has almost become a security blanket to me as it simply smells so wonderful.",11/25/16 08:26,Kaleighosts
Clean Cashmere Clean,"Febreze Light Bergamot and Musky Lavender

Clean Cashmere opens up with a burst of bergamot, warms up with a hint of white flowers, while tempering down on the bergamot, a light breezy lavender appears, anchored by a strong musky base.

Sounds nice? Let's explore this a little more. Most of the notes are very thin. The bergamot is pale, the white flowers are but a suggestion, the lavender is not the lush, herbal green camphorous lavender of a garden, but a kind of fractionated type that smells light and a bit powdery, there is a faint hint of powdery vanilla/tonka bean, and while the other notes are light, the musk is about as demure as neon spandex, it is heavy as hell, wears like lead, and the musk base lasts longer than 12 hours on my skin. The musk is identical to that found in commercial laundry detergent.

I never thought about perfumers working in the home care industry, and while the average person who goes sans traditional perfume probably doesn't consider the daily dousing of shampoo, conditioner, body wash or bar soap, lotion, face cream, laundry detergent, fabric softener, air freshener, and linen spray as 'wearing perfume' my lord no wonder no one needs to wear perfume anymore! You are already wearing a gallon of it anyway!

Anyway I read an interesting article by Chandler Burr called ""Purple Odor Eater"" about a perfumer who works for Proctor and Gamble. She was trying to design a new scent for Febreze, and she wanted something that smelled 'natural' as was popular at the time (2007--I think we are starting to enter another fragrance trend now, but that is another subject) and was trying to center the perfume around Lavender. When they blind tested several lavender profiles, most people hated natural Lavender, in all its green pollen sharp edged strong glory. Instead they liked ""lavender"" which just smells like a soft purple flower that has had all the actual lavender rinsed out. So that's what she ended up formulating, a perfume for Febreze centered around that focused grouped lavender.

That's what Clean Cashmere reminds me of. I actually enjoyed the scent a lot, and its lasting power is amazing, I truly got a full day's worth out of it, but lordy that laundry musk base got grating after awhile. As a perfume for the skin it's a no go. If I can find it on sale, say $20 a bottle, I would actually buy it as a linen or car spray, it smells very pleasant, but in no way is it something I want to wear all day on my skin. Does this company just buy perfume formulas from Proctor and Gamble or whoever and then bottle it in minimalistic bottles as ""perfume?"" And why do they charge so much? This perfume has to be among those were the actual perfume ingredients cost pennies per bottle. Oh well these perfume must appeal to someone or they wouldn't keep churning them out. I just think that they would work better as home care perfumes.",10/03/16 08:54,TillyWave_archive

Clean Cashmere Clean,"I really like this perfume. I received a sample vial in from a Sephora order and used it up so quickly. If I can get it discounted, I will likely buy a bottle.

The main note from this fragrance is musk. I can smell some cedar and jasmine when I wear this but the other notes aren't very prominent.

When wearing this out at night, I got several hours of wear and a low-moderate sillage. Other people could smell it on me, but it was more of a skin scent and not overwhelming.

Of the Clean fragrances, this is my favorite. In fact, I despise most of the others and thought I'd hate this one too, but these notes are some of my favorite. Very comforting and safe scent. Not particularly unique though.",06/01/16 13:38,alyxdavidson

Some people say that a few notes are overpowering, but on my body chemistry this scent is only a bit more than subtle, no where near over-powering, and so pleasant on the skin, it smells like skin, but deeper, a smooth yet dark scent, I think the term ""Noir"" in the name fits almost perfect, I really could imagine a gruff detective in a Noir film or a dashing femme fatale wearing this scent, my only real issue with it, since it is alcohol free, it sticks to the skin slightly, and I do like to put it on my wrist and neck, so it feels a little sticky for a time, but it's a small price to pay to smell so mysterious, so eerie, like I hold a thousand secrets that will die with me. Quite irresistible. Will definitely be buying the full bottle. 9.5/10.",10/06/25 04:31,LavenderElixir

H2Eau Musk Noir Clean,"This is the best and most versatile fragrance Clean has ever released. I am absolutely in love with this. My favorite fragrance category has always been powdery sweet iris or violet scents so I am biased but it's still amazing. It's sweet with our being gourmand and it's noticeable without being too heavy. I would say this is a more nighttime scent but it's perfect for the daytime as well. It's definitely one of those ""your skin but better scents"" so it's perfect for warm weather but there's also something very comforting about it making it a great choice for cold weather as well. The violet, musk, and vanilla are definitely the most prominent notes and they are blended beautifully.

I get straight up aldehydic civet from this (hence the name I'm guessing?) and bought a travel spray on impulse at Sephora because it was a total love at first sniff. Personally, most of what I get is musk with maybe a little violet giving it that powdery (some might say ""pissy"") aspect. I don't get citrus or orange blossom/neroli (phew) or patchouli (thank god). I absolutely love this and it will be a getting a lot of wear in the coming weeks/months (it's more suited for cooler days/nights). I have never fallen in love with anything this brand had done but man, this is super good. Lasts a good few hours on my skin which is surprising considering most of what I tested from Clean only lasts 2-3 hours. Pleasantly surprised!",06/20/24 11:19,sorvaahr
H2Eau Musk Noir Clean,"For starters I don’t think the listed notes are correct, big one is a lack of amber and I get zero orange. Anyway, wasn’t expecting to like this one that much, I think the water based thing is kind of a gimmick, but it actually grew a lot on me, I mostly get sandalwood, vanilla, white musk, amber, and patchouli. There’s also a big of fresh almost aquatic floral notes that make it a really nice summer scent, it’s not super unique but I really like fresher take on amber scents and it’s good for when you wanna have something without wasting a more expensive scent, also inoffensive if that’s a concern. Overall it’s a lot better than I expected",05/22/24 13:09,aKa_anthrax
H2Eau Musk Noir Clean,"At first this gives the vibe of a nicer gift shop (I guessed cedar and rose, but that must be the sandalwood and violet). Within a half hour it sours a little on me.

H2Eau Musk Noir Clean,"When I bought Clean’s H2Eau discovery set, this was the fragrance I was the most skeptical of, as I don’t like patchouli, vanilla, or amber (yes, amber. The notes listed here on Fragrantica are incorrect). I tend towards fruity-floral fragrances, as I live in the tropics and almost anything else is too heavy for this climate. When I did a preliminary sniff of all the bottles in the set though, this is the one that caught my attention. It’s warm and musky, but in a soft, comforting way that works for winter here (it’s 80 degrees in February).

This collection does leave a sticky, tacky feel on the skin, but I haven’t experienced any clothes staining. I haven’t sprayed directly on fabric so I don’t know if that would cause staining, but I haven’t had any issues with skin-to-clothing transfer.

The other issue I’ve been having with this line is they all go through a transitional period where they smell… off. Initial application smells great, dry down is lovely, but in between there’s a temporary period where it goes kinda ick. It isn’t as noticeable with this one and I’m not quite sure how to explain how it smells with Musk Noir, but with a couple of the more floral ones there’s a decaying flower/fruit smell. I suspect it’s some sort of reaction that results as part of the water-based, non-alcohol formulation this line uses.

Speaking of florals, this one leans feminine when first applied due to the floral top notes, but the dry down is much more unisex.

Actual notes as listed on Clean’s website:
Top: Lily, Violet, Musk
Mid: Musk, Vanilla, Amber
Dry: Sandalwood, Patchouli, Musk

There’s NO citrus in this.",02/24/24 19:15,Jadelynn
H2Eau Musk Noir Clean,"Be warned - this line of H2EAU fragrances stains clothing like a spill of vegetable oil. It is not alcohol based so when you apply, make sure to not let it touch fabrics.

Muguet & Skin Clean,"at least to me it's muchhhh sweeter than clean reserve, the combo of heliotrope, muguet, and praline gives it an almost fluffy, powdery, chocolatey vibe? dare i say it leans almost gourmand on me which is crazy bc i feel like my skin usually makes things smell a little more bitter -- it's pretty ok longevity (around like 4 to 5 hours for me) and it doesnt seem to project all that much (no one has ever commented on it for me) which makes it perfect for a short, casual outting when you want to smell like chocolate without being intrusive to others with it",02/21/25 13:43,wish4wingz

Muguet & Skin Clean,"I smell the original CLEAN skin (which I also own!) DNA in this, plus a LOT of woodiness, but in a pleasant, musky way.

Mostly musk, woods, and a touch of warmth/spice from the cardamom and patchouli! I like it so far but this is my first wear of it!",05/04/23 22:13,jesses

I also get quite a bit less floral sweetness, making it feel a bit more masculine.",02/06/23 14:58,herarae0
Muguet & Skin Clean,"First impression: As a die hard fan of the Clean Reserve Skin scent and a fan of cardamom in frags, I had high hopes for this one...and I'm a quite underwhelmed. It is very intimate and smells faintly of white white flowers with a shower gel or shampoo element - sometimes I even think of nailpolish :/ there is something harsh about it and to me it has no similarity with Clean Reserve Skin, unfortunately. It does remind me of Gucci Rush somehow - must be that Freesia note? Yeah not sure about this one..
Update: it actually has great projection and lasting power on my skin and really good lasting power on cloths, like for days... but it still find it smelling quite synthetic and will be selling my bottle",08/04/21 09:18,Maschka
Muguet & Skin Clean,"At the beginning there is some spiciness (the cardamom?), but overall the scent is very sweet. The sweetness in the beginning reminds me of extremely ripe fruit, although the scent itself is not fruity.

After the spiciness subsides, the scent reminds me of warm, sweet, condensed milk. Borderline cloying, and not fresh. To me, more cozy than sensual. I’ve enjoyed wearing this during snowy winter days. This could also work as a late summer evening scent. It seems to become more floral when I work out, so might smell different during summer. Sometimes I sense some woodiness, but it’s very subtle.

My boyfriend likes this. Said it smells “sensual” and “like a victoria’s secret model” without me telling him what the perfume is supposed to smell like. I’m very curious how this compares to the reserve skin perfume, as it seems to have a similar vibe.

Two sprays lasts me the whole day, and I can faintly smell the perfume next morning. Others can only smell it when they’re close to me, which I like.

I blind bought this from another person based on liking CLEAN classic skin. The classic version is soapier, fresher, suitable for every day and season. I guess they are somewhat similar, but to me, these are different scents. I currently prefer the classic version. Muguet & skin will probably be something I need to be in the mood for (very sweet and milky).",01/09/21 05:10,tuoksutitta
Muguet & Skin Clean,"I have tried all of the Clean Avant Garden scents and this is one of my least favs. Full disclosure, I'm not a fan of skin scents in general but I love much of the Clean Reserve and Clean Avant Garden line so I wanted to give it a fair try. It smells strongly of the skin component right away, and in the dry down that's all you are left with. I was hoping that I would smell some of the woody notes (which I generally like) but they are AWOL. If you really, really like Clean's other skin scents, this may be for you. But if you are expecting something more multifaceted, at least try before you buy.",10/18/20 04:55,Wwoman

Quite frankly, the bottle is so pretty that even if I hated the scent, I'd keep it for the bottle. It's a simple rectangle of blue glass, but it's this gorgeous carribean aqua blue that catches the light spectacularly, and the lettering is a happy, sunny yellow.

Galbanum & Rain Clean,"I'm sure this is just my funky skin chemistry, which makes many fragrances diverge from their intended notes, but this smells like straight up celery on me. I get that celery is watery and it is definitely the galbanum, not the rain component, that is responsible for this. However, the effect is like taking a deep whiff of celery seeds right out of your spice cupboard. I was hoping it would dry down to something wearable, but the celery seed smell persists. I have Clean's Rain fragrance, and it doesn't do this to me at all, so again perhaps that's just how galbanum works on my skin. Nevertheless, I highly recommend testing before buying just in case you have the same reaction as I did.",10/18/20 04:23,Wwoman
Galbanum & Rain Clean,"Wonderful fresh opening with the patchouli adding just the slightest amount of sweetness to fool my nose into wondering if there is some light fruit hidden somewhere in there. This initial sweetness, however, quickly gives way to a delightful blend of wet green and woody notes. It indeed conjures up images of walking through the countryside, passing green pastures and going by patches of forest right after a heavy rain. It's really really well done.

The dry-down is heavy on the moss and vetiver, but kept at a very fresh level via the ""water notes"" - whatever those are. Btw. is it just me, or does the prominent moss give it a bit of a 70s retro vibe? It just reminds me a bit of some products my mom would use when I was a kid.

Sillage is arm length on me. Longevity is very decent. At least inside in the AC it lasts a whole day.

Personally I find this to be perfectly unisex, and I'm someone who usually gravitates towards so called 'girly' fragrances. There's nothing too harsh in it to make it smell too male or cologne-y to me. The vetiver in here is very pleasing and mild. I would absolutely wear this.

Now, would I spend that kind of money on it? Probably not. But that's just cause at the end of the day it's not completely up my alley. It's very nice alright, it just doesn't knock me off my feet. But that's just me, I can see this being someone's favorite, absolutely.

Bottom line, it's a well-blended lovely high-quality fragrance. Maybe not ground-breaking, but definitely quite lovely. At this price tag, however, testing before buying is a must.",07/11/20 02:55,latafan
Galbanum & Rain Clean,"Very good, but also kind of familiar. I'm guessing that the ""watery effect"" in the official note pyramid is, in fact, violet leaf. The first association for me was Narciso Rodriguez for Him EDT. Then I started to get more woody notes with a bit of incense and was therefore reminded of DSquared2 Intense He Wood. Both are heavy on the violet leaf, which gives off this wet and damp, slightly sour impression. But it seems that Galbanum & Rain doesn't have the artificial ""chemical"" sourness that I got from Intense He Wood.",06/30/20 00:19,kaurg
Galbanum & Rain Clean,"I had high hopes for the Avant Garden collection since I've found previous Clean Reserve offerings to be pleasant but overly ""clean"". This is a bit of a letdown. It's woody-aquatic with some sweet green notes, but it smells like a go-to office scent for a well-groomed man. I gravitate to woody, incensy unisex scents and own quite a few fragrances geared towards men, so it's odd for me to find this too masculine, but maybe what I dislike is the work appropriateness of this particular masculine scent. It's not a bad scent. But for me it's too buttoned up and functional to warrant the luxury price tag or the designation as ""avant"" anything.",04/14/20 23:01,GenevaX

Sweet, earthy, light summer rain. Wet Woody forrest notes. Starts off with water notes and dries down to sweet, woody greens and lovely galbanum.

However, it's warm, soft, woodsy, powdery, and elegant. I would agree that it leans a bit more masculine, but I do love musky scents so I'm still happy to wear it. And I love heliotrope too; it smells mostly of that, sandalwood, cedar, and vanilla to me.",02/07/24 15:38,pisces3774
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"Got this as a blind buy - and am happy I did. At first I thought it was a bit dated, but as the cold weather is setting in I've found it to be a really understated and elegant scent. Great for the office. Sillage is fine, longevity could be better, but overall, a very nice scent.",08/08/23 00:22,Sasspergers
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"I’ve been thinking about decluttering this fragrance because I just have too many perfumes but I’m glad I picked it up and wore it today because this is a really beautiful scent. Someone else said this is a very niche smelling perfume and I totally agree with that.

I don’t have many perfumes in my collection with this combination of santal and heliotrope. It’s sweet, warm, and super duper cozy. I love the combination of the cinnamon, slightly soapy orange blossom, bright lemon, sweet heliotrope and vanilla, and woody sandalwood. The vanilla in the base helps to make the scent increasingly sweet as it dries down.

It projects very softly and has a decent longevity, so I think I’m actually going to keep this. I’m really enjoying my scent bubble. It’s unisex, leaning a little femme but I would love to smell this on my boyfriend as he pulls off a lot of different scents well. Lowkey, it’s reminding me a bit of Mix:Bar’s Vanilla Bourbon. Both are woody, spicy, with a sweet vanilla note. Clean did a great job with this scent.",01/26/23 09:02,nanaa_from_ghana
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"The opening is gorgeous, thankfully the cinnamon is very soft (a note that can get very overwhelming to me) and the lemon is too. I don't find it masculine in this stage, but it does smell quity soapy and clean. It's a very creamy scent through all the stages.

Santal and heliotrope is very descriptive, those are the dominant notes and what dominates as the scent dries down too. It does not smell like almonds, but it does smell like heliotrope.

I agree that it's a cozy and comfy scent. It's very smooth and mild. Longevity and sillage is not the best, and it does get a bit cloying if you overspray. Performs pretty good the fist hour, then settes down to more of a skin scent the following hours. A very nice one!",10/17/22 09:47,zind
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"Initial thoughts were wow, this does smell really clean. And a bit masculine. I think it’s the combination of a citrus opening and a woody base…. Luckily this wears off quick. Like within 5 minutes.

After 5 mins this becomes sweeter, and you can smell the effect of the heliotrope, although not really any orange blossom. During this middle stage it has a nice almondy vibe, a sweet, nutty scent. Not a super strong cherry like almond, or anything remotely as almondy as something like Italica, its more of a soft, gentle comforting warm almond than an in your face one. The middle is infinitely more feminine than the opening. Like a totally different fragrance!

After an hour or so of almond it gets progressively more powdery, but still projects a lovely bitter almond creamy sweetness. If you smell your skin it smells almost soapy, it’s such a bitter almond. Hard to describe but it’s lovely.

From 2 hours after spraying the sandalwood gets stronger. It still projects but is richer, a bit less powdery. I like this stage best, it lasts maybe another hour or 2.

Then in the late dry down you get a sandalwood almost skin scent, that’s more of a soft feminine sandalwood rather than a strong woody note. Lasts maybe 6 hours until it’s just a soft skin scent.

I was hoping for more sandalwood sooner, as currently I have many sandalwood fragrances I prefer more than this. But if you buy this expecting powdery almond it’s really quite lovely.

Very niche smelling, and unlike anything in my collection.",06/08/22 11:00,*loves_shoes*
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"I adore this fragrance. It's cozy and enveloping and for this reason I try to layer with anything I can. My absolute favorite layering combo is this scent with YSL Libre. To my surprise it creates a deeper, richer Mon Guerlain scent.
Definitely has a masculine edge but in a good way. The way a woman turns her partner's oversized hoodie into her own. It's that kind of burrowing comfort.",03/30/22 22:32,ScentBliss555
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"This was a disappointing blind buy. I find it very masculine-leaning and it bears a striking resemblance to the cologne that wafts out of Hollister as you walk by. I don't get vanilla or orange blossom from this at all, just a strong lemon in the opening and a lightly spiced woody fragrance with a faint powdery heliotrope in the dry down. Sadly, I can see how others like this and get a more unisex powdery sandalwood and vanilla scent, but it doesn't come off that way to me. It also gives me a headache on every wear.",03/25/22 10:15,clairesque
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"This one is interesting! I first sprayed on a small area of my wrist at work and asked co workers what they thought. I got descriptions such as ""it smells like a Barbie or baby doll,"" to ""it smells like a cleaning product"", to, ""I just don't like it"" to ""damn that smells sexy!"" That day I agreed with ""I just don't like it."" But I have to give perfumes a real chance to see how I feel. The next day I did a couple sprays around my neck and some on both wrists and went to work. I asked the same question again having different people to check it out. Every single one of them said it smelled really good! And I agreed! I move around a lot at work and kept getting whiffs of it all day. It lasted through an 8 hour shift! This is a soft hug, a log cabin, a rainy day, a fall breeze, because this smells softly and woody to me. It's incredibly cozy and comforting. There's no harsh edges, just softness. It's like cashmere, Madagascar vanilla, and soft woods with a touch creamy floral. This is identical to something that B&BW came out with 7 or so years ago. It was a one time only creamy cozy vanilla fall scent. They only had it one time so I kept my 2 bottles of the lotion for a long time. They're long gone and I'll never know or remember what they were lol! This one is good! Don't be scared!",09/13/21 21:13,islandgirlmaranda
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"Agree with other reviewer, this is gorgeous. Really comforting, warm and cosy. Perfect fall, winter perfume. It comes off to me like a modern re-working of a classic like Shalimar or even Opium. Not nearly as heavy as those. Much lighter and classier. But I love cinnamon in a fragrance when it's done well - meaning it's in the background. And the vanilla citrus mix is great. Dry, rather than syrupy or sweet. I don't get any almond notes from the Heliotrope in the title, but beautiful nevertheless. The santal gives it a lovely spiciness.",11/02/19 12:35,Fumeheader
Nude Santal & Heliotrope Clean,"Expensive and sophisticated scent from clean.

Woodsy, cinnamon, heliotrope and tasty vanilla....very well blended with citrus.

Definitely a unisex.

Sweet ( but not too sweet) and dry. Louder than whispers in the library from Maison Margiela,

Warm and comforting like a cuddle-up-blanket.
Nice clean and highly refined.

Will be perfect for autumn and winter days.

Silage and longevity is both amazing on me. Worth every penny !

This will be an all time clean favorite for me.

Tropical Escape Clean,"I was hoping for a sweet playful summer scent, in the style of Pina Colada. Sweet, fresh, easy to wear. This reminds me of Coconut Skin by Phlur. It's more dark and muddy coconut, more green or woody, to my nose. It's clean, which i really enjoy, but to me, it's more a scent for the colder summer days.

A little fresh sweetness from the pineapple in the beginning, and after a while it becomes a more grow up, woody, creamy coconut, in a not sunscreen-y way.",07/16/25 12:04,TrashCan
Tropical Escape Clean,"I've found myself growing out of my old summer scents. They just don't hit the spot any more: beeing to sweet, to fruity, to strong and even to childish. When I walked by the display of this I immediately became intrigued, as Clean has inpressed with some scents in the past. I absolute love this summer scent! It starts of fruity with the pineapple, but not to sweet or overpowering. The coconut milk then comes through, beeing soft and tropical without screaming COCONUT. After a few hours it smells like warm skin after a day on the beach, warm and delicious, but still discreet. It's a very subtle scent and comes of as quite delicate for a summer scent.",07/15/25 06:14,KatrinePine
Tropical Escape Clean,"I love Clean perfumes and this is no exception. It's floral and fruity, very summery and beautiful. The pineapple note is there but so well mixed in that the perfume doesn't smell like pineapple juice. This has some similarities with Escada summer editions but quality and longevity are better.

Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"Citrus, verbena, cotton, and musk with aquatic notes lingering somewhere in the background. A very clean scent that smells like lemon detergent powder. This smells like walking into a self-service laundromat with every customer busily pouring in detergent onto the machine and simultaneously putting it into wash/spin mode. I've never smelled any fresh laundry fragrance this straightforward. It's so ""in-your-face laundry day"".

It's called ""warm cotton"" but I'm honestly not getting much warmth. Just pure clean, lemony detergent. If you like that, good for you. But if you want more dimension to your fresh laundry fragrance, you might wanna layer this with something floral or warm (I might layer this with some sweet florals just to tone down the harshness). Or try other fresh soap fragrances like Maison Margiela's Bubble Bath or Lazy Sunday Morning.

Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"This thing is quite popular in Japan, borderline hyped, because some people think the smell of laundry detergent to be “inoffensive”. NO!!!
Tried this as I once fell for the hype but had to scrub it off. Very headache inducing because of the mixture of harsh, artificial soapy smell and the linen/sheets notes that are strangely photorealistic…so much so that I could smell the dust underneath. Bedspread without any contextual clues, like the texture, pleasantness of the morning sun…is just a piece of sanitized cloth. Maybe for some people this works alright. I really think we should stop associating the soapy aquaric with inoffensive and crowd-pleasing, at least in my country.

This doesn't sit too well with me out of the atomizer. I really like clean cotton natured scents, especially for a candle, but this smells like burnt cotton to me. Not clean. I can almost smell some kind of cleaner behind the cotton note. That's definitely the citrus. I went ahead and sprayed this onto my blanket because the smell from the atomizer freaked me out, and it smells exactly like Clorox wipes. Not an exaggeration, EXACTLY. I let it dry down too, just because I was confused, but the scent didn't change. If you love the smell of disinfecting wipes and want to smell like it for yourself, go ahead and get this. Very confused where the burnt cotton smell ran away to. Honestly outside the atomizer isn't a bad smell, I just don't think I could wear it because of how much it smells like Clorox. I'll probably keep it to spray my bedsheets or laundry. I don't know.",10/07/24 19:07,candiedpeach
Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"Clean Warm Cotton does capture the essence of fresh laundry in a very photorealistic way, evoking the smell of crisp, clean linens. It’s like walking into a room filled with laundry products, which is both its charm and its drawback. The scent is quite loud and prominent, making it feel intense and possibly overwhelming. While it smells good and true to its name, the strong, laundry-like aroma might not be the ideal choice if you prefer something more subtle or complex.

Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"@bijoubean and @aenflex covered this fragrance brilliantly with their reviews. Clean classic warm cotton succeeds in only one thing, and that’s to create a smell (not a scent..,) that neither leans masculine nor feminine. This toxic waste of a fragrance is as unworthy of being called feminine as the term masculine. I’d like to echo the notion of other reviewers in this thread and concur that it smells harsh, synthetic and overall unpleasant. I cannot grasp how anyone could possibly stand this smell on their own person or their surroundings. Like @bijoubean I’ve been using it on my bed from time to time rather than tossing the bottle in the dumpster, but like her I’ve found it too harsh for that usage as well. I suppose I should probably just get rid of this sooner rather than later. I cannot image myself ever wanting to wear it ever again. Disgusting fragrance in my opinion.",04/08/24 14:46,Ben&Jerry

This Warm Cotton and its counterpart Cool Cotton work very well when sprayed into shoes to make them smell clean and fresh, too.",11/02/23 04:18,joliecat
Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"if im honest i was disappointed with this at first- i smelled it in store as a fantastic fresh linen scent, bought a travel size and found out it dried down to be very aquatic/marine, a scent type i generally hate (a lot of beaches in my area growing up were covered in rotting seaweed and i now i cant smell the ocean without associating the two. if youve smelled it you understand💀). i was resigned to find a new laundry scent, but then a few weeks later i got a bottle for my birthday!

going into retesting the scent with the idea that i hated it kind of made it seem better than i remembered. i think the shock made the marine notes stand out to me more initially, but now after wearing it i think theyre subtle enough that it just brings a refreshing feel to the fragrance, and not much else (thank goodness). it is something i have to be in the mood for, but its grown on me quite a bit! definitely suited for warm weather and although it does wear off pretty fast ultimately i think its great",10/19/23 18:19,NEONinitial

Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"This is so aggressively ""laundry detergent"". If that is your thing look no further, this is the scent for you.

Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"The first 30 seconds are extra citrusy, harsh and screechy, but it very quickly mellows down to a soft and warm detergent-like scent that is very comforting and kind of makes you feel safe.

Projection and longevity are surprisingly good, almost too strong in my opinion. As it will remind most people of detergent, putting on too much will trigger people to react to it, which is not necessarily the goal here.",08/24/23 09:56,nerolyan
Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"This one celebrates my 200th review on this website. Yay!!

Totally agreed with @matchanincense below. I get no 'warmth' from this fragrance. All I get is lemony citrus and a hint of sea salt. It is admittedly pleasant, though the first spray is very sharp and chemical.

Yes, it does remind me of laundry detergent, but I like laundry detergents anyway so I can wear this one without issues.

Despite that, I don't think I'll be getting a bottle of this one. (I've got a 2ml sample with me here.) It reminds me a bit too much of the moist underground laundry room at International Hall (where I stayed during my masters studies) at Russel Square, London. That room smelt like this all the time.

I don't know which season this would fit. It's lemon-scented laundry detergent so I suppose it's all seasons because everyone uses detergents all year round.

I have a lot of citrus scents but this one is not a dupe of anything that I own currently. It is strong, mind you. I was able to fill the living room wearing four sprays from another room and walk in here.

Regarding price, it's not the best, but not the worst, either. Whilst I understand the ethics of Clean fragrances, I guess I would still say it is overpriced by a little. It's not natural (as laundry detergents aren't) and you have to pay about $45 for a 30ml bottle. The design of the bottle won't win any awards and the same goes for the packaging. I sort of expect more, to be honest, but hey, at least, it does smell clean!

Edit: I think it smells somewhat similar to John Varvatos Artisan Blu, though that one is not as sharp or pungent. I prefer Artisan Blu to this one. Clean Warm Cotton lasts 5 hours on me.",08/09/23 05:42,washudtoj

Clean Classic Warm Cotton Clean,"There has been a change because this is now a BEAST MODE freshy that is ready to stay with you until the day is over!

So… I purchased this several years ago and returned it because although it was exactly what I was looking for as far as scent profile, it did not preform well. I couldn’t even justify spending 20 dollars on a perfume that does not last.

Interestingly enough, here we are today. Lol
After the heat started to rise, I began to crave a clean smell. Specifically, I wanted for the clean aroma from my shower, creams and freshly washed clothes to get a boost! Clean Warm Cotton does it for me!
It lasts ALL DAY. It’s STRONG, SHARP, and THE CLEAN BEAST. Lol

This precisely describes the feeling when you open your washing machine and gather the laundry.
To me it is fresh, clean (obviously), warm and somehow cozy scent, invoking good memories and good mood.
Because I love the smell of the fresh laundry.
For people that don't, I guess this wouldn't work.
It is very long lasting on me, more than 7 hours.
There is nothing 'perfumery' in this perfume.
It is just the smell of fresh and clean laundry.
It can cause a headache though because it's so linear and somehow intoxicating.

Outdoor Shower Fresh Clean,"Bought a gift set of four Clean perfumes last winter, blind buy. And seriously, i thought all of them were horrible, very sharp and synthetic smelling, nothing remotely fresh about them, really just eww.

Decided to give them a new try now in the summer, and started with Outdoor Shower Fresh, as that was the one i disliked less in the winter.
This isn't that bad now actually! Once it settles, it does smell very clean and fresh, i don't get the horrible synthetic mess anymore.
Very green and outdoorsy, a bit soapy. Refreshing and cool.
In the winter the sillage and longevity were both outstanding, as usually happens with frags you hate ^^.
I have to explore these further now in the warmer weather, will be interesting to see how they behave. For now, to my own surprise, i actually like this.

This is so not my type of perfume, i don't do green scents. This might really work in the summer heat though.",06/18/12 14:37,KateAnette

Few stating that it smells lemony , detergent like and others say it smells like a bar of soap. There is also a skin difference factor, but I wouldn't go that far as to say it would smell that different on us. But, anyway, it's not my imagination, my bottle does indeed smell like a bar of a good, buttery, white soap. Not citrusy. Not like flowers or cleaners. Tested it again after reading the last review, checked my bottle to see if I made a mistake, but no. So if you're looking for a soapy version I strongly suggest not blind buying and testing it first.
Edit: Checking it on their page it indeed does say and I quote: Reimagined 15 years later, it's back with a bright modern twist. Inspired by the faint scent of your favorite bar soap. So it is changed. Also, mine has The original written under Clean.

I was very confused as to why this wasn't mentioned in the soapy perfumes article. Instead of aldehydic freshness there is a very prominent buttery density of a thick bar of soap. I can almost scratch the surface and feel it collecting under my nails. I also noticed that people don't like wearing it on themselves but rather smell it on others as it gives of very calming aura. The smell of soap is so old and recognisable and yet people are so delighted and surprised when they smell it on someone as if they are used to complex perfumed pyramids of chypre, oriental or floral.

This is described as citrus but while there is citrus, it is not the main note that I smell. I like it but it's no longer what I would pick to spray for my day because of poor longevity.

Clean Fragrance Clean,"I really liked the idea behind the Clean perfume brand when I first read about it. Pleasant, clean, fresh fragrances - brilliant! So I tried this, the very first Clean and was SO disappointed. Wham! So fresh and harsh it almost knocks you out. A very synthetic and intense lemon/lime/verbena mix, way too sharp and strong. It lasted very long too. I kept it on, hoping it would turn into something less intense and more pleasant, but it never happened.

We are all different, and obviously there are many women who love Clean original. But on me it smells like I've just cleaned my bathroom, not like I've just taken a nice shower.

I still like the idea of a classy ""fresh-from-the-shower""- fragrance though. A perfume that doesn't smell like perfume. Luckily I've found Clean Fresh Laundry (for very hot summer days) and Clean Cool Cotton (always). Exactly what I want. All's well that ends well.",06/24/18 15:38,GardenDays

initially you get a blast of lemon grass, which dries down to pure alkaline soap. It's at the top of it's game for clean soapiness, so if this is the smell you're aiming for then this is your bottle. I have a few of the CLEAN range, but all smell very different in a clean way. However, nothing says ""I've just scrubbed up with a soap bar"" than this beauty.

Clean Fragrance Clean,"I feel silly writing a review about a fragrance called Clean, as the name written on the perfume bottle is a nomenclature in and of itself. Over the years I’ve come across many maligning reviews on it which makes me shake my head, unable to understand the negative reactions to it, let alone the “industrial disinfectant” references used when describing it. However, after recently wearing it when grocery shopping and being pulled over in the store by a gentleman who couldn’t compliment me enough on how “so fresh and so sexy like I just walked out of a shower” I smelled (…yeah, I know… sweet but kinda creepy…) that I’ve decided it was time to offer a different perspective on this polarizing fragrance.

I first tried Clean EDP right after it was released quite a few winters ago. One spray on the tester blotter and I’ve wrinkled my nose, wondering by whom and why on earth this perfume was created in the first place. It smelled like anemic, generic musk that you can usually find on supermarket or pharmacy shelves for a handful of dollars. The thing is, I tried this fragrance right after I’d tested “Dior Addict (2002)”, which at that time was also a new release and sported the old heavenly formula. Okay… Honestly, who could give Clean a fair shot on a cold winter day after trying the delicious, spicy soufflé that is Addict?? Obviously, I was smell-drunk from the vanillic goodness that just permeated my nose and so I chucked the bottle back on the shelf and returned to the Dior stand. Fast forward to a few summers ago, I’d dedicated a good block of time in my day to dork around at my local Ulta to find out if I can ever like the allegedly *Clean* line and whether the flankers were also full bottle worthy. And now the truth comes out: Clean is undoubtedly a warm weather fragrance. In the dead of winter, it turns into a mixture of chlorinated pool, tap water, and a facial astringent on me. In the heat of the summer, however, this cold composition turned into a pure and wholesome aroma that gives me the feeling of having just washed from head to toe with a luxurious perfumed soap. In the opening, I detect a light but sharp citrus blend that persistently continues throughout its lifespan. I don’t get any floral notes other than a faint whiff of lavender in the heart phase. At the end, which arrives about a good six hours later, I am left with a citric, cool, musky drydown that is still refreshing with no detectable hints of going off the rails. Suffice it to say that Clean agreed to love my skin, which I believe is a phenomenon that is a prerequisite before anyone says, “Oh yeah - I like this!” about any perfume. So to be fair to the numerous reviewers who pooped on this fragrance, I can see how, with the wrong chemistry, this fume can make you smell like someone just gave you a swirly. I’ve tried another very similar fragrance called “Les Senteurs Gourmandes - Musc Blanc” by Laurence Dumont. The only difference is that Clean utilizes a lavender accentuated heart instead of the faint rose note Laurence Dumont used in his composition. Both fragrances, however, are startlingly similar on my skin. As far as longevity and projection goes, Clean is the winner. It projects about at least 3 feet and stays on me for a good 6 hours.

I don’t think Clean or its flankers (“Shower Fresh” is my favorite!) are meant to be a crowd-pleaser, as are most designer or celebrity fragrances. I see this collection more as a progressive, niche style creation that just happens to be mass produced. It isn’t for everyone, as the copious negative reviews all over the internet would suggest. Nonetheless, those who love sheer florals, light musks, or citric aromas could be in perfumista heaven as long as their skin loves this icy juice back.",06/27/14 14:43,BelleofRivendell
Clean Fragrance Clean,"Are we all smelling the same fragrance?

I LOVE this fragrance for exactly what it's intended to be...CLEAN! I think if you're expecting a burst of florals, or anything other than a clean, ""just out of the shower"" smell...then you should move on because that's exactly what it's NOT intended to be.

This was my signature summer fragrance until I graduated to niche fragrances but this will definitely make a reappearance this summer as a layering scent. I love this on my clothing rather than skin nowadays, as I think it enhances the smell of cleanliness (if that at all makes sense). This is also a good one on days when you don't want to wear any fragrance. It's just a clean hair-out of the shower-no/minimum makeup-relaxed maxi dress-flip flop-no fuss hairstyle fragrance. (If THAT at all makes sense???)

I could never make out the exact notes of this scent until seeing the pyramid here and it makes complete sense! Definitely opens with a blast of clean citrus that is immediately and I mean IMMEDIATELY followed by a musky-lavender-and other astringent (but in a good way) floral notes.

Longevity is moderate at (3ft) as is silage at 4-5hrs.",04/26/14 17:56,LB152

I also think its perfect to wear around children because it is not too perfumey, heavy, or intense.

Clean Fragrance Clean,"I get so frustrated by people not really understanding what Clean fragrances are meant to be. They are not ""perfume"". They are not supposed to smell like perfume. They are anti-perfume. If you go into it expecting perfume, no wonder people are so disappointed. Clean is not for people who want perfume...it is for people who do not.

I went for a couple of years not being able to wear ANY perfume. It all made me sick. I had some health issues that affected my sense of smell and I just could not tolerate anything that smelled ""perfumey"" and could not stand to be around anyone wearing perfume. It made me gag. During this time, I noticed that a client of mine always had this wonderful clean smell, like her clothes were always fresh from the dryer. I asked her how she kept that wonderful, clean smell in her clothes all the time and she said it was ""Clean"" perfume that she sprayed on her clothes. I had never heard of such a thing. So, I tried it and fell in love with the Clean line (give or take a few). It was the only thing I could wear for quite some time because of the anti-perfume issues that I was having.

In the process, I noticed that I was getting complimented constantly on how good I smelled. It was never ""what are you wearing""...people just told me that I smelled good. And I realized they thought of me like I thought of my client. Just a clean, fresh smelling person, completely unrelated to perfume.

I only spray it on my clothes, not my skin. I think that makes a difference as well.

My perfume issues went away (as you can clearly see by my profile) but I still go through periods where I have to cleanse and ""reset"" my nose and just need a break from perfume. Maybe it is hormonal, I don't know. This is one of the very things I reach for - Clean Original. It is clean, lemony and refreshing and allows me to smell good without smelling like perfume. I especially like it in the summer. I don't think I have ever had it on without receiving a compliment - EVER. I can assure you that if I smelled like a toilet bowl nobody would be telling me how wonderful I smelled.

Clean is exactly what is claims to be...a clean smelling fragrance line that is NOT classic perfume, for those who just do not want to smell like perfume. It is for those who like to extend that shower fresh or fresh from the dryer scent all day long. It is also great for refreshing bedding, curtains and blankets. I just love it.",11/02/13 10:04,christianne1

Clean Fragrance Clean,"Whoa!

I've been passing by this one at TJ Maxx for months because I hadn't read the reviews as I assumed it was probably boring and weak (the simple packaging...although nice...is what didn't do it for me)

I have never smelled anything....ANYTHING....with such a lemon/lime sharpness at first blast....in an IN YOUR FACE with an ice-pick sort of way! It was like being maced with ice cold 7-UP.

After yanking my face away from my wrist at a speed that should have induced injury, I told myself not to worry...it was a short ride home and it wasn't all that expensive either.After maybe 2 minutes I dared to take another sniff.

What's this??!!

How could something morph so quickly into something SO different? I have never worn a perfume that was capable of this....going from zero to one hundred in a blink of an eye at application then back down to around fifty ( and something entirely different) within two minutes.Ok......so what did I get after all those sharp citrus notes?? Well....you can probably guess......soap.

What's that gold soap......oh yeah...DIAL. Yeah....like DIAL and DOVE got together and had a baby! Just push a little harder Mam....I see the head...here it comes.Oh look! It's CLEAN!

All joking aside, I really enjoy this fragrance. It's simple...in a complicated way...and for me...unique. It's a way to smell nice but not necessarily perfumed. Sure, you could just take a shower as other's have stated but isn't finding a new perfume that you really like alot more fun?!

I also have to admit that when I read that this is Demi Moore's signature scent it somehow made it more appealing. She always looks so polished and well....clean....and I can imagine her smelling like this.

Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for something different in a fragrance and want to smell like the bath all day!

EDIT: The more I use this, the more I absolutely LOVE it.....it's becoming one of my favorites. The sharp lemon/lime note in the beginning is either becoming less pronounced or I'm just getting used to it. I guess that's one and the same. Anyway....it' just a spectacular lemony, creamy, luscious, soapy, happy, clean smell! I agree that it is related to Avon's vintage Odyssey.....I wouldn't have even thought of it if it hadn't been mentioned. It is, however,soapier, more lemony and fresher and more modern. I like Odyssey though....reminds me of my Mommy and of my childhood!",11/22/11 15:03,Hollie

Needless to say, CLEAN caught me off guard. I was expecting some variation on the aquatic theme, or perhaps something with a soapy drydown. Instead, from the very first whiff down to the light, still citrus finish, what I found was Cointreau.

Clean Warm Cashmere Clean,"Identical to Bal D’Afrique. You would have to be a trained professional perfumer to detect any difference at all!

Clean Warm Cashmere Clean,"Personally I just love it. I have a soft spot for deep, musky, woody scents, and this is lighter than what I usually wear but also definitely more unisex. Where I work - at a perfume section - people who are looking for an office friendly or unisex scent have loved this, also more men than I first thought. I think it doesn't lean on either masculine or feminine side, and it is one of those non-offending scents. A great gift idea for someone, who loves fall, cozy afternoons and woody scents. It is daytime appropriate and not too long-lasting either.",09/24/18 08:33,unipuutarha

Warm Cashmere is one of my all time favorites from clean. So much substans in this one. Reminds me of White woods from Clean. Just a little bit more of it all in this scent.
Because of The small bottle size I immediately bought two.",09/22/18 02:11,louiee
Clean Warm Cashmere Clean,"Warm cashmere starts very citrusy. After half an hour it becomes warmer and woody (I get a lot of cedar after a few hours).

On my skin it lasts for about 4 hours and sits really close to skin, performance on clothes is much better. Definitely on masculine side and it reminds me of a detergent a little bit. Will wear to work.",09/07/18 07:54,nika21
Clean Warm Cashmere Clean,"I liked Warm Cashmere from the first moment. It's a very ""grown up"" scent, for autumn and winter. It's not heavy, but it's more intense than most of the Clean scents, and it takes a while before it settles. Office safe first after an hour or so on me, but I won't wear it at work anyway. This is a scent for lovely, cosy weekends from October to March and perfect for Christmas and New year.

A powerful start, smoky/woody like, but that doesn't last long.Those first couple of minutes it's definitely on the masculin side. Then there´s crispy citrus with the woody smell. Finally you have a nice musky/woody/fruity blend that stays 4-6 hours (on me). Very pleasant, warm, not too sweet, and still very grown up. It's perfect on me (woman 30+), but I can't imagine my husband wearing it. Cashmere hint? Yes, definitely!

EDIT: This perfume has really grown on me. It's become one of my favourites and it's sad it's a limited edition! Why? // New update: Still a favourite, and I found a new bottle on eBay. Seems like i prefer many of the discontinued scents from CLEAN. Hmm, maybe I'm just an oldfashioned girl.",06/25/18 17:28,GardenDays

I love to use it with Chanel's 1932, which sweetens it up a bit. By itself, I find 1932 a bit too screechy, but Radiant Nectar rounds out the edges. I also love to layer it with Dior's Jasmin des Anges because it increases its longevity and rounds out the indolic character of the jasmine.

This is tobacco leaf (an unsmoked cigar, if you will), and honey to my nose. It has sweetness but isn’t gourmand. It’s a woman putting on her man’s jacket after a night at a smoky bar. Very intimate smelling. I have the full bottle after getting a sample of this. I don’t reach for it all the time, but when I do, it’s sooooo lovely. Definitely a fall/winter scent!

They should label this as 'hair mist' strength. Just like their labeling, this perfume is practically invisible. I briefly caught a beautiful fruit wood sap scent but it was gone in moments. Very disappoint, much sad. 😔

It takes several sprays all over to wear this for longer than half an hour & will only stick to natural fabrics like cotton, wool, etc. Don't get me wrong! This scent (when you can actually smell it) is beautiful & delicate & a well built formula. The full size bottle is relatively inexpensive but I highly recommend Skin over Radiant Nectar all day.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"Tested this out because I kept reading that it was similar to Liis Studied (which didn’t last on my skin) and I’d have to disagree. Studied is light and soft, Radiant Nectar is syrupy and dense to my nose.

I see similarities in the notes and can understand why they would be compared to each other but Liis is airy enough to be my post-shower bedtime scent and can be worn on even the hottest of days… whereas Radiant Nectar sits VERY heavy on me, especially if it’s humid.",07/30/25 03:57,taidyee

Radiant Nectar Clean,"Based on the name I’d expected this to be really sweet, but it’s actually quite warm and musky. It does start as a syrupy pear, but it very quickly morphs into a soft, honeyed skin scent with a slight smokiness. This is something I would spray on when I want to smell “naturally” good and like I’m not wearing any fragrance. This smells so much like my usual skin chemistry that I become anosmic to it within about 10 minutes of spraying.",07/08/25 16:28,Jadelynn

Radiant Nectar Clean,"Edit: over two months later, this reminds me of Sonic Flower.

Pear is juicy and light and Ambrette (Musk Mallow) is fresh spicy; middle Tobacco Blossom is an insency floral chypre, Carrot Seeds and Orris offer that vegetal, lipsticky, earthy floral vibe. It’s a pear version of Sonic Flower imh. I really like this! Kind of sweet but ripe fruit sweet versus high fructose corn syrup artificial sugar sweet. It is slightly soapy, which I love!



Upon first spray… it’s not a complete hate, but it’s in that vicinity. I don’t understand the thought process behind this composition. I was hoping for soapy waxiness from the orris and carrot. The best way I can describe what I’m getting is a high fructose corn syrup canned pear, respectfully. Perhaps it needs to macerate??",05/23/25 18:24,12shae21
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I expected to like this perfume a lot and so sprayed a good portion on me only to immediately regret it afterwards. There’s a very strong pear-like sweetness at first which although many have described as warm and natural, I struggle to describe as anything other than artificial, chemical soap. There’s something deeply unpleasant to me about the honey-pear smell that remains after dry down as well, it smells like if you took a poire Hélène and poured bleach all over it. I am such a big fan of sweet perfumes usually but the sweetness in this was genuinely sickening - wayyy too intense and not at all the summery fragrance I had been expecting from the reviews!!",05/19/25 21:19,anmiko

Radiant Nectar Clean,"this has been my signature scent for about a year and i’m finally ready to write about my mostly pleasant, albeit rollercoaster ride of an experience with it.

i’ll quickly preface this by saying that i am a pear STAN. prior to coming across radiant nectar, i had been desperately searching for a musky, pear-forward frag for quite some time. jo malone’s english pear and freesia was my ride or die for a while – but alas, she has the longevity of a toot in the wind and lacks that musky skin quality. i’ve tried just about every pear-forward frag on the market with little success.

enter radiant nectar – clean reserve “skin” had already been in my scent wardrobe, which i quickly burned through a full bottle of, surprising even myself, because i’ve only recently come to like sweeter, musky skin scents. when i found out that clean made a pear-forward frag, i rushed to my local sephora and tested radiant nectar on my skin. reader, my immediate reaction was so kismet, so borderline orgasmic, that i almost fainted. it was a juicy, pear forward, sweet, musky, nutty, PERFECT little sexy musk cocktail on my skin. i distinctly remember sitting in my car, letting myself marinate in my little scent bubble, and thinking to myself that i would devour someone if i smelled them wearing this frag.

in the months that followed, i burned through at least 4-5 travel sizes with joyous abandon and finally broke down and bought a full bottle. in my experience, for a long while, every note alchemized harmoniously on my skin – the sharp, juicy pear opening, the nutty ambrette, the smoky quality of the tobacco flower and that comforting, grounding cedar…if it ain’t broken, don’t fix it. i got so many compliments and several of my friends mentioned that it was “me in a bottle”.

several months into my full bottle, i started noticing that the scent was morphing into a very linear, syrupy, artificial honey bomb. no beautiful, juicy pear note to be found. i stopped wearing it as often to see if my nose was faulty when i returned to it. alas, as i write this, this perfume has transformed into a sickly, uncanny valley-esque chemical weapon. it smells like pure alcohol and nauseating, indistinguishable syrupy honey sweetness. strangely, it reminds me of that artificial, plastic-y quality in ELDO’s “ghost in the shell”.

sadly, i pitched it as it’s now an unwearable scrubber. will i eventually give it another chance and buy a travel size? maybe. i adored this frag so much that it became a personality trait. i’m not sure what about the formulation made this go so rancid, but for those wanting to take it for a spin, i’d recommend sticking to the travel size and burning through it reasonably quickly.

rest in peace sweet prince

Edit: I ended up returning it without opening it because I went to Sephora to smell it and their tester had turned rancid. If I had 1-3 perfumes it would be ok, I would have enough time to use it before it got rancid but I have something like 30 full bottles + 20 perfume oils so…
Also I have sparkling sugar. They are not dupes at all, but I think it’s the ambrette that they have in common; so they have a similar vibe/profile and sparkling sugar doesn’t turn rancid to my knowledge. I prefer the peach scent compared to pear",10/09/24 17:01,AirBeat

Not too juicy, not too sweet, not too floral, not too woody, not too powdery, not too musky…. It has the perfect amounts of all these elements.

This dries down warm and sweet and in my opinion is better than Skin. As much as I love praline in fragrance, it’s too heavy in Skin for me and ruins the scent. But this gets its sweetness from a juicy, almost preserved, pear that balances well as a skin scent. It feels more natural.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"(After the initial blast of rubbing alcohol...) This smells very vegetal to me. I don't detect any sort of ""nectar"" or fruity notes. It is not very sweet. Maybe slightly musky, but not really in a clean or cozy sort of way.
It reminds me of sticking my nose into my parents' spice cabinet in the kitchen and accidentally getting a whiff of fennel. Very much a damp, rainy day, muddy, green, vegetal, sweet carroty, fennel sort of scent to me. Rainbow after the afternoon storm in the garden sort of vibe. I wouldn't say ""radiant"" or ""nectar"" to describe this, but it smells good. Like a clean little garden/kitchen fairy should smell.",08/28/24 20:42,kestrele

Radiant Nectar Clean,"I don't understand what is wrong with my nose or if I'm being gaslit by the entire world, but this, and perfumes similar to it (the AG one, Sweet, Glossier You) all smell SO disgusting to me, I am genuinely shocked that people find them nice enough to wear. Obviously it's normal to not like a perfume, or even hate some, but this to me doesn't even smell like a perfume. It's pure burnt plastic with strong musty undertones. Like, I genuinely cannot imagine what part of this people like. And I didn't just smell these once, I've smelt all of them multiple times in different stores. Reading the reviews feels like I'm living in a parallel reality and I'm smelling something other people don't. Where is the pear?? If pear smelt like that I would never eat pears again. This is in no way sweet at all. I can't even describe the notes because as I said, this doesn't even smell like a perfume.",08/05/24 07:15,vanillaflower4
Radiant Nectar Clean,"pretty and musky, I like the tobacco blossom note! this is similar to GIAW but with less of that burnt toffee vibe that one has. this is slightly earthy but complements the sweet (kinda synthetic) pear. I like it, don't love it.",07/31/24 04:28,sunchild50
Radiant Nectar Clean,"Opening: blasts of alcohol, after: sweet, sweet, sweet, almost cloying sweet. Actually kind of reminds me of Sparkling Sugar -CR but without a certain/ couple of notes. Nothing special, could probably find something similar at BBW.",07/29/24 13:13,Ima_Fly
Radiant Nectar Clean,"This used to be my HG but I suspect the formula has changed :( It used to smell so fresh and sweet with juicy pear notes, and would last quite well on my skin and clothes. Now, my new bottle I find it almost musty, it's not juicy at all, and the projection and longevity sucks. I tried letting it sit for a few months and it hasn't changed, it's very disappointing and I am searching for a replacement :( (I do see the similarity to Ariana Grande GIAW as well but i don't find it has the same juiciness or projection as the original formula)",07/08/24 10:51,Not my username
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I’d had my large bottle for over a year now and it hasn’t lost its pear essence much at all, it also hasn’t developed any alcohol tinge or discoloration. Smells pretty similar to the day I bought it but with the sweetness deepening a bit, like fruit ripening. I recently bought Lattafa’s Kismet Angel/Magic and fell in love with it trying to figure out what it resembled to me besides the popular Angel’s Share dupe claime and it’s definitely this. Kismet Angel is the edible gourmand version of this sweet floral amber. And I get much more amber from this than musk, fresh amber like in JHG Not A Perfume and Dedcool’s Milk, instead of spicy incense amber. There’s nothing at all spicy or dark or caramel about this fragrance. It’s bright and sweet.

I don’t quite agree with the Ellis Brooklyn Sweet comparison, but I can understand it and think that if you can tolerate that *level* of sweetness, then you’d be able to tolerate this one. Both are saccharin and sugary.

This was my favorite spring summer scent last year and I’m really glad to have a spicier warmer version (Lattafa) to wear in the fall-winter.

Overall this one is a fav of mine because it’s much different than my usual sticky-edible gourmands. The only scents in my collection that aren’t edible gourmands are Mix:Bar Cloud Musk, Dedcool Taunt, Burberry Goddess, and a few other sweet florals that are pretty straight forward and hard to compare like Nest Dahlia & Vines or Chloe’s Rose.",06/13/24 10:24,nillamoonlight

Radiant Nectar Clean,"My husband bought this accidentally when he meant to buy Sel Santal, the perfume I wanted. Initially disappointed I came here to check reviews and decided to open it rather than return it. So glad I did! This perfume is perfect for work…musky and sweet but the tobacco blossom and carrot prevent it from being generic and precious. Radiant Nectar has become my go-to perfume this summer. I have the big bottle and I can’t stop wearing it. Ironically, I went back and picked up Sel Santal and ended up giving that one to my husband. Now we’re both happy.",06/06/24 16:34,SmellieKat
Radiant Nectar Clean,Warning: pear is a very delicate accord to use in perfume so there are reports that this perfume expires quickly. Don't get a 50 or 100 ml bottle if you can't use it up in less than 6 months.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"This landed on my radar for ""Nectar"" and my love of honey in perfumes. I happily skipped around Sephora buying pens of all the scents I had on my radar- without even testing them. I'm pretty disappointed there is no HONEY! LMAO!
Oh, pear nectar is in this. Great, I hate pears.
But I don't hate this. I'm wearing heavily to work and it's STRONG but sheer. Flowery pear musk clean laundry. It's nice. Perfect for work. I could even see myself getting more after my pen. I would have still bought this for the tobacco and carrot- I'm always down for trying a new scent with an oddball note. And while this isn't odd- it's good IMO- the kind of good that keeps me interested instead of moving on. BUT- as a whole- it's clean/shampoo and I crave DIRTY and STRONG.
So- very very nice, but not my thing. However a great day time pleaser.
WOW- reading this goes rancid quick. I wouldn't buy a bottle now.",05/20/24 06:35,mschnabel666
Radiant Nectar Clean,"Fun fact: this is the only perfume I've used up an entire bottle of (in 50 ml size) in my collection over 140 bottles. I would tell myself it's too syrupy and cloying but it's a sparkling pear scent with a beautiful tobacco blossom drydown. Turned out to be addicting to me so it became my signature scent last Spring.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"this opens with pear, musk, ambroxan and ambrette. the only thing interesting here is the tobacco flower, which grounds things a bit and adds a hint of a smoky floral. the pear starts out on the more realistic side, then gets cloyingly sweet, ugh. for once, i wish they wouldn't do that. the smoky element is there if i sniff my arm but not wafting from afar. this scent would be much better if there was no pear and no ambroxan, imho.",04/23/24 22:12,mirrorghost
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I was gifted this, so I tried very hard to like it, but after multiple wears throughout all seasons, I just can't. I ended up giving it away.
For starters, I don't like the musk mallow note, it doesn't play well with the ambroxan. I think if it was just one or the other it would be fine but layered together it's just stifling. If the pear is there, then it's giving sugar and nothing else. Then you have blonde woods for more dry, musky sweetness, orris root and carrot seed on top of that to dry it out even more, and at the end of things you have this strangely dense, dry, musky scent that's overwhelmingly sweet but somehow still not gourmand. It's heavy, it's artificial, and worst of all it doesn't remind me of anything. It's like an AI's idea of what a perfume should be. I think if the pear was stronger or brighter it would be better. It needs some tartness to break up the structure.",04/20/24 11:27,scatteredshowers

- Top: Ambrette Seeds, Pear Nectar
- Middle: Orris Butter, Carrot Seeds, Tobacco Flower
- Dry Down: White Cedarwood, Ambroxan, Liquid Musk

The Pear note is strong but it's almost a pear alcohol drink. It's a sweet, synthetic, bright, sharp pear. There's something slightly sour here. It's in the background to the more pleasant notes. Is it the way I'm reading carrot seed here? There's something completely off about this that I can't put into words. Something that leans dirty or subtlety... rancid. I've never been this puzzled with a fragrance in determining why or what I dislike about it. What surprises me most is that I don't absolutely hate it. 😅",04/02/24 13:18,Norie
Radiant Nectar Clean,"This is very similar to Sparkling Sugar, but with a slightly more earthy note-- there's something almost nutty about it.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"One of my fav perfumes!! It’s such a unique, nostalgic scent. It smells just like sweet necatarines cooking on the stove. In terms of perfumes listed as similar—
✔️ Clean Reserve Sparkling Sugar: nearly identical, just not as deep. I love both, but I prefer Radiant Nectar for its deeper and longer lasting sweetness. After a few hours, Sparkling Sugar fades to a kind of powdery sweetness whereas Radiant Nectar stays juicy and rich. BUT you definitely only need one in your collection.
✔️ Ariana’s God is a Woman: very similar in the same way that Sparkling Sugar is
✔️ Versace Dylan Purple: similar but the fruitiness is more fresh and not as deep
✔️ SDJ Carioca Crush: similar but the fruitiness is more fresh
❌ Ariana’s Mod Vanilla: a vanilla with fruity notes
❌ JHAG Pear Inc: much less sweet than Radiant Nectar
❌ Nest Golden Nectar: super faint and powdery
❌ Clean H2Eau Nectarine Petal: much less sweet
❌ Ellis Brooklyn Sun Fruit: much more of a fresh scent and not as sweet

A Beautifully Sweet, tart, and juicy pear nectar that’s bright, radiant, happy, and summery with some lovely warmth from the musk and subtle woods/cedar notes! The blend of notes makes this such a pretty, pleasant, interesting, and somewhat unique fragrance! Very easy to wear, pleasing, uplifting, and great for everyday! Radiant Nectar reminds me somewhat of Coach Dreams Sunset and B&BW Chasing Fireflies, both of which I love! There’s even something that’s somewhat comforting to me and nostalgic feeling with this that I can’t get enough of!

Great performance! I typically get great longevity with fragrances (even body mists) and this is no exception, I get all day wear! The silage is really good too, it can be smelled within an arm’s length.",01/07/24 09:36,Shimmer412

It’s hardly detectable to me until the dry down…I have a rollerball so perhaps that’s why I can hardly smell this fragrance but sparkling sugar and GIAW did the same thing to me.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"To me it’s summer and warm, yet elegance. I feel very feminine using it - even though the scent has a unisex feeling musk. To me the opening is giving juicy nectarine (not really pear to me), followed by a quite strong powdery musk shining through equally. There is also a white floral note in the bottom always present to me. It sparks happiness yet comfort. I must admit i don’t find it very sensual. It’s blissful and pretty. To me it’s not an everyday pick because the musk combined with the sweet citrus is a little unbalanced. I do think it is a little too powdery and musky for me. I still love it, but it has its occasions - for me mainly, fresh spring formal events or summer days in the city.",12/30/23 12:58,ChristineKal
Radiant Nectar Clean,"i’m basically on a mission to smell every fragrance with a pear note and i like Clean as a brand so i gave it a sniff/wear test today and by god i wish i hadn’t.

this is candied nectarines. sugar on top of sugar on top of sugar. i immediately wiped it off with alcohol because it was genuinely too much. not sure how this is described as powdery or musky but that’s not what my nose picked up at ALLLLLL. and my nose loves singling out musks/powder notes

I’ve been buying this perfume for a couple of years now and its perfect for gifting to friends and family since it’s an easy universal likable clean scent and a great price. I love it, I use it constantly in my car, my hair, on my self, for naps, alone or layering, on my bed and especially on my dog; I don’t feel bad wasting it because it’s not expensive if purchased at certain places. It’s a scent that I will never get tired of and it lasts all day on me. It smells like Molecule 02 (which I’ve worn for tons of years) on me but with added sweet pear. But many people are anosmic to M02 and can’t smell it at all, NOT ME 🥰, so I recommend this one as an alternative.

The sillage is perfect for this perfume, it's not even moderate sillage but it's perfect. The lasting power is weak, just like Sparkling Sugar. They smell a lot a like but this smells more clean and fruity sweet. Sparkling sugar smells more sweeter in the sugary sweet type of way. Both of them smell fruity but not in a cheap way.

for my birthday i got myself a full version, and loved it in the beginning! however, it's been less than a year and that expired smell has come back. i honestly don’t know if that's just the perfume at this point, but it's disappointing that it turned into a completely different scent than it was in the beginning. i still use it though, but sometimes it kinda grosses me out???",10/05/23 03:54,krissiekat

Radiant Nectar Clean,"Clean Reserve Radiant Nectar is quintessential late spring: juicy pear dripping in honey nectar, honeysuckle in the breeze, a picnic blanket warmed by dappled sunlight. There's something easy, vibrant, and luscious about this. It's almost heady at times, but dries down to a gorgeous soft and lightly fruity musk.

I don't really get the comparison Glossier You, which is much more musky and peppery to my nose, but this does remind me of Ellis Brooklyn Sweet. Sweet leans more into a candied sugar pear, whereas Radiant Nectar feels like more of a tree-ripened pear drizzled with local honey, but I tend not to love the DNA of Ellis Brooklyn scents and tend to *love* the DNA of Clean Reserve, so take that as you will.

Anyway, I really love this. Besides Clean Reserve Skin (my all time favorite every day scent, arguably my spring/summer signature scent), this is my favorite of the Clean Reserve discovery set. An absolutely easy reach for one of the beautiful, not a cloud in the sky, 75° spring/summer days.",08/01/23 10:03,lilypadflowers

Would not buy for myself, but this is very ""clean girl"" scent, erring on the side of sweet. Makes me think of walking through a park during the spring and getting a biiig whiff of honeysuckle.

Every single version of this scent I tried smelled like it had gone bad! Some worse than others, but overall this had such a screechy, off putting pear note in it (by far the worst pear note I’ve ever smelled in perfume, by the way) and then this awful, musty perfume-gone-bad note to it that almost tingles my nose. I wanted to love it and figured it would be a slam dunk as I LOVE pear scents in fragrance. Instead, it was a major NO for me. How is it possible that every single one of the samples/testers I tried of this smells so off and expired?",07/17/23 18:48,Spinsugar86
Radiant Nectar Clean,"This unfortunately turns bad sooooo fast and I've had the same issue with skin! The samples I have gotten of both of these are amazing so I bought a travel size of both. In less than a year they both lost the brightness and developed the same odd smell making them both sweeter in a bad way. This must be an issue with the house's formula and ""clean"" aspect of it. I can say that I've had a bottle of amber saffron and have not had an issues with that! But if you are someone that doesn't use up your bottles quickly, I might opt to try a travel size! Such a shame because I love this when it's new!",07/17/23 18:29,lnoskin
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I was gifted a travel spray and it sat in my collection untouched for a year because I didn’t love it. I picked it up today on a 90degree day and fell in love. I was surprised at the notes because to me this smells like a deep, rich honey syrup that I remember my Italian grandfather making from the leftover grape skins after he was done crushing them to make wine. I’ll have to purchase a full size bottle!",07/14/23 21:07,MichySpoonz
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I get how people can pick up Glossier You, I think it’s the ambrette and ambroxan that are present in both bottles. The similarities are vague enough but I think this one has a little more depth and fruitier than You. Besides that, this is the only perfume from Clean Reserve’s Discovery Set that I can see myself easily reaching for. The rest of the perfumes besides maybe Rain and Solar Bloom did not work on me. It’s a very intimate close to the skin scent I like spraying on my wrists and smelling periodically through the day. Because of its lightness it’s a very easygoing summer scent. Easily my favorite of the discovery kit, unsure if I’ll commit to a full bottle with the reviews of perfumes turning rancid after a couple months.",07/13/23 10:55,spaced.out
Radiant Nectar Clean,"This one is really a no brainer during the summer for me. I tried it on in the middle of Winter and I did not like it. However, came summer a few months later and this and Very Good Girl are all I wear (yes, I was told by my best friends that it very much smells like ""me""). It opens up with a ripe juicy pear and after an hour, I get musky tobacco with a hint of sweetness. After the 3-4 hour mark, it's just a musk skin scent, which will last maybe another 1-2 hours. It does need to be reapplied, but for a casual summer day, I don't mind. However, there is no way I could make this into a nighttime fragrance even if I tried, which is another reason why I don't mind the shorter longevity. As for projection, I haven't had many compliments, apart from around 30 minutes after applying, but I haven't worn this out very much.",07/12/23 12:51,Bit4
Radiant Nectar Clean,"My problem with almost all the clean reserve line is that they all smell a bit like a body spray and smell cheap for the price tag.
This I would include in that category but that being said this one is pleasant enough.
Sweet nectarine/pear/orris blends into a light musk. It has a bit of a synthetic quality to it. It reminds me a tiny bit of Sweet by Ellis Brooklyn. I wouldn't get a bottle of this by any means but its pleasant",07/10/23 19:59,vwgirl123
Radiant Nectar Clean,"This is not my usual scent type but I found it on a great deal in Sephora and, probably because I was on holiday and feeling carefree, I bought 2 bottles.

It’s sweet pears, a bit of honey, syrupy and almost spicy. Intensely sniffable; I constantly want to smell it when I spray it on myself. I think it performs better in warmer weather, which is good because it’s the perfect smell for a sunny summer day.

This is what I imagine a peach terracotta colour to smell like.

Edit: ohhhhhh I think this has died on me. Alcoholic blast, then very little scent to follow. Sad.

Edit again: my unopened bottle also died on me. This has a shelf life of 2 years, tops. Beware.",07/08/23 15:56,Gillzathrillza

Radiant Nectar Clean,"this is a pretty, fresh, fruity scent. it vividly reminds me of a bubbly pear drink i would have as a kid:) unfortunately this has no longevity whatsoever, disappears after literal minutes on my skin. mine is a rollerball, so it might have to do with that, but i’m not sure if i’m willing to invest in a spray bottle if it ends up having the same performance… so sad because it would’ve been a go-to on warmer days!",07/05/23 01:16,tevdye
Radiant Nectar Clean,This has quickly become my signature scent over the last couple months. It’s a juicy pear that dries down to a sweet musk with some nectarine. Very simple & I love that it’s cleaner than most perfumes. I get headaches easily so I think what attracted me to this is I could spray as much as I wanted & it’s always refreshing without ever giving me a headache or bothering me. I’ve noticed it lasts best in cool/warm weather & tends to disappear when it’s really hot out. I’ve gone through a whole bottle in 3 months.,06/30/23 18:14,Gms02
Radiant Nectar Clean,"Right off the bat this scent reminded me of a synthetic fruity candy. It mellows down a bit and becomes more of a juicy, ripe pear with a bit of musk scent which is perfect for any occasion. I see this as a great Springtime fragrance. It is very close to the skin which isn’t bad but I’d prefer more projection.",06/27/23 09:29,rainelliem
Radiant Nectar Clean,"When I tell you that this and Liis Studied are the exact same perfume, I'm not lying. Down to the notes, performance, dry down, everything. It's the same. They are each other. Juicy pear to start off, then dries down to a soft, fuzzy, and sweet musk.

It's a lovely smell, but both perfumes are skin scents and do not last or project very long. If you really want Studied, save some money and just get this. You won't be able to tell a difference.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"I love Radiant Nectar, it was love at first sinf. Mine did “turn” a bit over time -I’ve har it for little over a year- but not in a bad way, just the woody notes are much more present, which I don’t mind.
Sadly it has very poor sillage and lasts for maybe about an hour on my skin (maybe less) so I don’t think I’ll repurchase.",06/20/23 20:30,Gabi0401
Radiant Nectar Clean,"Like other commenters, my bottle went rancid after about 6 months. It was kept out of direct sunlight, with all of my other perfumes (some 5+ years old and still going strong). The juice didn't even turn yellow. What was once a light, caramelized pear scent turned metallic and sickly, seemingly overnight. I'm so disappointed because I loved this and how it looked on my dresser.",06/12/23 12:07,rb834777
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I sprayed this on and sniffed it, and I was like...""Don't I already own this?"" So I looked at the notes and saw the ambrette note, and said to myself ""Oh yeah...Fleur de Blonde."" I own a bottle of FdB, and this really reminds me of it.

And that's about all I got - the ambrette and possibly some musk. Nice, but I won't be buying a bottle.

Edited to add: I got this out and used it today. It's very warm and humid where I live, and I didn't like this on me in this weather. It's a little sweeter on me than Fleur de Blonde. And wouldn't you know...this is one Clean fragrance that actually has longevity on me, at least in warm weather. Anyway, I put this away to get it out again and use it up in the fall. Thank goodness it's just a sample size.",06/09/23 23:14,fragrancenovice
Radiant Nectar Clean,"A wonderful, juicy pear shampoo scent with absolutely no projection or longevity. It would be a “clean girl’s” dream. Bathed my skin and clothing in this in the summer heat and you can barely smell it. So disappointing because it’s an absolute treat, would be my new vacation signature if even massively over spraying did something, but it doesn’t. Got this directly from Sephora so I know it’s not the bottle. Maybe I’m just one of those people especially nose-blind to ambroxan.",06/04/23 16:24,CorgRage

Radiant Nectar Clean,"This smells syrupy to me, it does smell like nectar but it is very cloying to me. As it dried down it got prettier but I do get something rather bizarre I would also agree I do believe it's the carrot seeds maybe (?). I'm not sure for those who couldn't smell it because on my skin it was quite strong. It isn't a fresh scent just syrupy for me. While it does smell different and unique, maybe I'd want this smell in a candle but not on my skin.",05/30/23 07:51,midwestmeowmeow

Radiant Nectar Clean,"I don't like this at all... The nectar accord is musky to the point that it smells musTy. And listen, i like musk. I blind bought it at TJmaxx, tried it on my skin a few times, and returned it. The mustiness is not a reaction on my skin because the atomizer gives me that same strange smell. This is not all similar to Glossier You.",05/11/23 08:03,Lunaria820

Radiant Nectar Clean,I think the carrot seeds might be turning me off from this scent (?),05/02/23 11:43,amgenus2015
Radiant Nectar Clean,I don't know why... but I can't smell this hardly at all!! It must be the ambroxan in it because I seem to always have a hard time smelling scents with that note in them. I was so excited to get this because I love Glossier You and God Is A Woman. I bought it off Sephora so I know it's my nose and not the perfume. What i can smell of it is delicious though. I get a juicy pear with cedarwood then nothing after a few minutes. Ugh!!,04/28/23 16:46,Sharipie
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I do not get the Glossier You comparisons at all. To my nose, this is very pear forward. It actually reminds me a lot of a softer Zara Unusual Gourmand, which is a sweet and strong pear scent with some salty musks. Glossier You is probably my most worn scent and I know that scent inside and out. No similarities to my nose.

This is a very pretty scent, but it didn’t wow me. It’s not as much of a second skin scent as I was hoping for. If you love the pear note, Unusual Gourmand is a fraction of the price and is much stronger than Radiant Nectar.",04/28/23 13:09,coodler

Radiant Nectar Clean,I'm honestly surprised there's not brown sugar or vanilla listed in the base. This gets caramelized and I kept getting whiffs of this sweet caramelized sugar and i was like it must be on my sweater from days ago and I smelled my arm where i sprayed radiant nectar and I'm like there is it.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"It starts off more peachy than pear to me but there’s definitely a fruity nectar burst in the opening then it dries down to tobacco, a reviewer said it’s like incense cones- that is EXACTLY how it smells on me. Its super woodsy too and I love it. Super unique. I would say it’s also good for winter and autumn despite the votes simply because its warm and woodsy to me barring the fruity start. Goes from summer to winter in seconds.",04/18/23 09:46,OceanLife
Radiant Nectar Clean,"This is the third clean reserve scent I’ve picked up and I must say the moment I smelled it on my skin, it immediately smelled like someone had spilled a flavoured Starbucks coffee on me, it’s quite a strange scent to my nose that I’m still trying to understand.",04/13/23 11:03,KatieM78
Radiant Nectar Clean,"i have to say i’m obsessed with this scent. for me, it’s one of those perfumes that has me wanting to smell my wrists all day.

radiant nectar is the perfect name for this scent. it smells like freshly cut pears/peaches and musk that really lights up on my skin. it has that amazing salty note that i adore, and intensifies with dry down that to me makes this scent sexy. this reminds me of an elevated version of a scent i wore when i was younger , i wish i could recall what it was. there’s also an almost creamy note that makes this heavenly. my only issue is i would LOVE for this to project more and last longer.",04/06/23 17:17,deev222

This is my new signature scent for Springtime that I can wear everyday. The longevity is 3-4 hours max but I do not mind re-spraying.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"Not great as far as sillage and longevity go, so don’t get this if you want something noticeable.
This is almost a honeyed floral scent (to me) but a tad fresh. It’s not too sweet, but if you aren’t traditionally a fan of sweet things it may be best to steer clear. This is for someone who like things moderately sweet and floral.",04/02/23 12:19,Apple_Sweet
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I love this one.

Smells like juicy pears but the other notes balance it out to make it smell ""rounder."" This actually smells a bit like celery in a good way. Sweet and comforting but also like celery.

Even if a perfume that smells like celery sounds unappealing to you, I'd still recommend that you check this out.",03/29/23 14:21,angelflight
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I actually don’t understand the comparison to Glossier You, which I own. I get a hint of brown sugar or honey with slightly sour, natural pear that is much better than the pear in Jo Malone Pear and Freesia. I still find this fragrance very comforting and for longevity I would get this over Ariana Grande's perfume. I got my 50 ml bottle for £35 on Carethy which is a good discount.
My Top 3 recommendations for comforting fragrances that are signature scent material for everyday wear:
1) Clean Reserve Radiant Nectar
2) Le Labo Thé Matcha 29
3) Penhaligon's Changing Constance",03/26/23 15:51,Willowthewisp
Radiant Nectar Clean,"The pear at the beginning is much more potent and realistic in Radiant Nectar compared to God Is A Woman, but once the other notes come forward, I understand the comparison. Radiant Nectar stays more fresh and less sweet, although it does still have some sweetness. If you're trying to save money and don't mind a sweeter scent, I'd say just get GIAW. I also prefer Glossier You to this scent, although they don't smell as similar to my nose. Radiant Nectar doesn't have as much of a pull on me.",03/24/23 14:05,meganlamode
Radiant Nectar Clean,"The name is so apt. ""Radiant Nectar"" to me smelled like tobacco and honey with musk. It's warm and pretty. It's very linear though, like most of the clean reserve line on my skin. Most reviews warn that the fragrance expires easily... so, I am very wary of it and inspect how it smells from time to time. I got it from a legit source last November 2022, and so far, it still smells good.",03/17/23 01:47,mad_mal
Radiant Nectar Clean,"When I first tried this from the Clean Reserve Sampler pack I tossed it aside, thinking it smelled like a juvenile Bath and Body Works spray. However, it has grown on me significantly. By itself it’s a bit linear, but it smells divine paired with Clean Reserve Solar Bloom or Le Labo Another 13. It layers very well with many scents, actually, so I appreciate its versatility. My advice is to buy a small bottle, however, as it can turn rancid. I bought a gift set that was on an incredible sale from Sephora and had to return it because even unopened it had already oxidized— it must have been sitting on the shelf for several months.",03/16/23 12:21,emeraldnyl

Radiant Nectar Clean,"I am still undecided-this is slightly more powdery than glossier you. Glossier does not give me a headache at all but this one somehow does, it’s a little richer and more dense. I also find that glossier turns sweeter on my skin over time but this one turns more musky and powdery. It does project more but I haven’t figured out if that’s a good thing or not
Update: this transforms in hot humid weather! It’s sweet and marshmallowy, with some fruity notes-the musk keeps it from being cloyingly sweet. Less woodsy and more juicy. I really like it but it smells much different in warm weather, I would only wear this spring/summer",03/14/23 15:08,savjlc
Radiant Nectar Clean,"Actually, smells EXACTLY like the opening of Glossier's You, with a touch of honey inside.
""Radiant Nectar"" is right - it's a light, bright, sparkling, organic sweetness from the honey, with a hint of fruity musk from the ambrette and pear.
It's pleasant, with a soft projection and about average longevity. It's definitely less ""dusty"" than Glossier's You (as someone also mentioned below), but on my skin, the difference is minimal.

I don't get as much musk or ambroxan as I'd like, but it's still a pleasant, inoffensive fragrance.",03/14/23 06:57,alternateu

For me this is a rich, jammy fig scent, like a Fig Newton, with a sort of grape juice like sweetness. It has the earthiness of fig too, which gives it an interesting organic feeling. I do agree with reviews below that it is a warm, syrupy, fruity scent. Just disagree on the fruit in question. Definitely a unique summer or fall scent.",02/19/23 11:40,East River Pearl

I did not think something like this with these notes that I generally tend to like would be such a scrubber for me, but something in it is just completely off. I know the sample I tried probably wasn't turned because I got it new from Sephora when the fragrance debuted, so it was something with these particular components and my body chemistry. In the vial it smelled fine. I think it is probably the pear, as some pear notes can go well... pear shaped on me. I have not yet smelled anything in the Clean Reserve line that is spectacular, but I think that is probably good. There need to be safe, easy-to-wear perfumes that don't always scream their presence.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"I didn’t think I would like this perfume because my first impression after sprayed it on a tissue was “Meh, another too sweet one”. I have a lot of perfume vials and it was not remarkable in my memory. But last night, after accidentally sprayed it on my skin before bedtime, I was supprised! It has a strange sweet smell, I thought it was vanilla or caramel at first but didn’t see them on the notes list. I really like the mixture of pear and tobacco - those two are stars in this perfume. Also changed my mind about sweet part, it’s not too sweet and very clean, well blended, and the scent isn’t mainstream. The sillage is weak but I’m a fan of intimate perfumes so I like it even more, and I quite supprised that it’s long lasting. I will use it in spring or autumn, but won’t wear in tropical summer days.

Update 3/12/23: I found out the strange sweet part was tobacco, after I had a chance to smell my friend’s tobacco CO2 extract. In my nose, tobacco now is the leader in this perfume, and how I love it! This perfume became my favorite bedtime scent, made me feel pampered everytime spraying. I changed my vote from like to love :’)",02/01/23 10:13,Chimyens
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I know most people seem to love this in summer, but I prefer it in winter and cold spring days here in Scandinavia.
I find it too cloying and my experience with the fragrance in warmer weather is, that the tobacco note becomes way too prominent for me.

So I will review it, as I experience it in a colder climate.
It opens up with a pear note, similar to that of God is a woman. The pear plays really well with the ambrette, to create a pleasant, soft fruity musk. The tobacco note is not very strong, but it is there, but in a pleasant way. This is coming from someone who struggles with tobacco notes and don't quite enjoy it in perfumes.

I know it is not listed, but I almost get something resembling a brown sugar note, but without it becoming too sweet.
This fragrance pairs so well with a warm cozy sweater and will stay on my clothes until the very next day. It is by no means a projector. I can smell it all day in my cozy little scent bubble, but others will have to get closer to me to smell it.

My experience in summer is, that it becomes sweeter, projects more but the tobacco takes over and ruins the balance for me.

It's a big like for me, but not a total love.",01/26/23 04:46,Loevens
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I was really surprised when trying Radiant Nectar multiple times, because people have been saying that AG's GIAW was inspired by this and that Radiant Nectar was still better. I personally disagree, I would pick GIAW 100 hundred times over this.

From afar, RN does smell nice, a bit floral & rather clean. But you really have to be far away. I generally like how earthy notes add contrast to perfumes, but in here it's too much and it reminds me of celery.

However, what I hate the most about this perfume is how dirty it smells on my skin. I rarely get body odor vibes from fragrances but with RN I experience it completely. The first spray is celery mixed with sweat. If I get my nose close to my skin (no need for me to even touch it), it smells like I exercised really seriously, let my sweat dry, sprayed perfume on me and went about with my day. It gives me flashback of junior high and high school days, when many of my classmates would do just what I described and think that was the smartest move in town.

In comparison, GIAW just smell fruity and clean. Smells plain but pleasant with no dirty undertones to me. RN is really not my vibe.

Edit: After +10 hours, the fragrance is still sitting on my skin, so longevity is actually very good. I surprisingly get whiffs of the perfume without getting my nose close to my arm and thank goodness, only the clean notes are left. It now smell REALLY good... but it also smells similar to Clean's Simply Clean and Kayali's Musk 12, which I both really like.
So for this dry down, I wouldn't bother suffering with RN and would just get the 2 perfumes mentionned.",01/25/23 06:45,ChocoLei
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I really liked this fragrance when I first smelled it in its debut. It worked really well on my skin and had really good performance. I tried it over the summer and it seemed to just blossom on my skin.

I’m not sure what happened, but this fragrance doesn’t work with my skin the way it used to. I’m not sure if because my taste in perfumes has changed or because my collection has exploded, but it’s not giving what it gave before. It smells nice, but I think the tobacco flower gives it a weird and paradoxically dirty smell on my skin.

It does smell very similar to Ariana Grande’s God Is A Woman, so if you have that, you probably don’t need this one too. However, I don’t see the comparisons to Glossier You. This is something you can wear year round without offending anyone.

EDIT: I sold my bottle.",01/16/23 00:42,nanaa_from_ghana
Radiant Nectar Clean,I absolutely love the smell of this fragrance. I definitely get the tobacco note which I love! It’s a fresh leaf tobacco not a smokey one. And I’m surprised by the pear note because I’m getting more of a juicy nectarine. This one definitely has a fresh vibe that is different from most freshies. I’ve also gotten compliments when wearing.,01/09/23 15:57,Bit0sugar
Radiant Nectar Clean,"*PREFACE* After having Covid, it's taken about a year for my nose to get back to normal-- and it's still not quite 100%. With that said, my tastes have changed with my nose, but this scent is one that still smells the same to me as it did before Covid, which has been such a blessing. I can no longer do really heavy or smoky scents because my nose never adjusts to scents in a room-- I'm always aware of smells around me now. I wanted to preface this because my needs with scents are probably different than others.

*REVIEW* With all of that prefacing out of the way, this scent is fresh, juicy, musky, and just all around pleasing. It's in the vein of JHAG NAP, JHAG Pear Inc., Glossier You, and the ""clean girl"" scents. This has a fresh, musky and clean woody vibe on top of juicy pear and a bit of fresh honeycomb mixed in. The nectar vibe is really present. What is lovely is that I can douse myself in this scent, and my nose adjusts well but also, it just makes me smell fresh and clean without being too intense. I can layer any scent over it and it really gives a great base to any other fragrances. I love to layer it with Gucci Gorgeous Gardenia.

Dupe-wise, it's very similar to God Is A Woman from Ariana Grande, but GIAW is much more sugary and you can tell the ingredients are not as high quality as the Clean Reserve. CR is muskier, more woody and unisex while GIAW is more sparkling.

More than just being pleasant, this scent is just a perfect staple for day, night, any occasion, any season-- it's foundational to my perfume wardrobe and it's been a great reentry into fragrance now with the changes I am experiencing. I wear it to the office daily and get compliments quite often. Overall, this fragrance is a must for me and I'm so thankful I can lean on it as a safe go-to.",01/02/23 17:43,LunaLovespell
Radiant Nectar Clean,"This smells almost identical to JHG Pear Inc (which I love), but with a touch of honeycomb. Clean, simple, not cloyingly sweet — I really like this one for right out of the shower. A very “meet the parents” scent.

Radiant Nectar Clean,"Smells amazing! Like Fruity and Musky at the same time. Extremely similar to God is a Woman from Ariana Grande and kind of similar to You by Glossier, but this is a sweet version of that one. The only downside I see from this brand is that it seems like most of their fragrances turn bad really quick. I guess that is because this is a clean brand that uses other types of ingredients which may not be as durable as others. So make sure to store this is a very dark, cool place where it can last a little longer.",12/29/22 05:42,Adjr1087

Radiant Nectar Clean,"On my skin, this smells like honey & pear with some depth to it. I don’t normally gravitate towards this type of sweet scent, but this one got me. It’s sweet but not cloying at all and it still has some clean vibe, which I love. I personally would wear this indoor during a daytime.",11/28/22 09:41,nadmau
Radiant Nectar Clean,"As a few other reviewers have mentioned, this is reminiscent of brown sugar bubble tea (minus a lactonic milky note). It's sweet and syrupy without being cloying. I love it so much. My only gripe with this fragrance is that it doesn't last long on my skin, but that's to be expected with clean scents.",11/15/22 07:39,schnocampy

Radiant Nectar Clean,"My partner's immediate response to this one was ""That smells just like You, the Glossier one."" I was really impressed, because although I knew of people frequently comparing this to You, I actually didn't personally pick up on a strong similarity between them. This is syrupy sweet on me—too sweet, in fact—which is not how You pulls on my skin (I get more of the pencil shavings side). I'd say this is a pretty 50/50 combination of You and Ellis Brooklyn's Sweet. I will say that the pear note here is gorgeously rich.",11/04/22 23:24,broro117

Radiant Nectar Clean,"On paper this was a little too sweet and loud. On skin this really does embody the word ""radiant""-- a warm scent bubble of pear (not green pear, but ripened, warm, juicy pear) and musk. Ambroxan is hit or miss with a lot of people but when done right it adds an airy, resinous sweetness, such as in this. Reminds me of warm sunshine at the end of summer.",10/30/22 12:51,rainydays
Radiant Nectar Clean,"On first spray, I was a little disappointed, smelling only a sweet alcoholic scent.
But then... WOW!
The most divine, warm, sweet and comforting bouquet bloomed upon my wrists! I was so shocked. I actually left Sephora to walk home, and then I ran back to spray more. It is so good. Warm, powdery and delicious.
The warmth of this scent has parallels to coffee dates, cosy jumpers, autumn walks, phone calls with friends and vintage love letters.
It is a lovely scent with a nice projection and lasting power. Not insane silliage, but suits the intimate aura of this perfume.",10/27/22 14:08,toastgirl5
Radiant Nectar Clean,"I really really hated this one for some reason, I had to scrub it off. However, I found it kind of difficult to wash off and I guess that would be a positive if someone enjoyed it. Syrupy sweet + tobacco, I'm not getting pear at all for some reason",10/27/22 13:50,katieyaryes

Clean Air Clean,"I actually own this perfume and this perfume is really interesting on my skin. For instance when I first wear it the first few month during summer (2019) it smells fresh, clean, musky and unique. I tried it again last year (2021) summer and the smells developed really well. It starts with the usual boring fresh, clean scent then it turn aquatic...and sweet at the same time. I always use the same Granny's soap with no perfume and put on Nivea unscented lotion. Nothing had change in my prepping routine except the perfume just kind of develope. I have gotten loads of compliments from co-workers about myself smelling sugary sweet when I wore it. Even when my boyfriend and I both wear it he tells me that it's sweeter on my skin compared to his.
I still adore this perfume and I sometimes even layer it with Gucci Mémoire D'une Odeur to make it smells a little earthy and really unique. I also add layer it with Tom Ford F*cking Fabulous to prolonged and make other perfume more unique.",02/23/22 15:04,PerfumeAddict30

I'd rather buy a fake than this. It smells nice, but I could hardly smell anything. The smell lasts for like 5mins before it disappears. I'm only disappointed because it's very expensive (70 AUD for 60ml) for a very short lived perfume. Should be like USD $15 RRP nothing higher than that.

On a good note, smells so fresh 💯💯 & is definitely not offensive or over powering.",03/28/21 01:49,Chonesty

Clean Air Clean,"It smells powdery on me, I don't get the citrus or the green notes unfortunately. I do like the musk and how this scent will disappear and reappear throughout the day.

I like this more during the colder nights.",03/11/21 18:38,nishamilk

Try before you buy.",08/12/20 07:00,diva_100

I quite reluctant a little bit because I see two different designs of packages with different prices respectively and I do not know if they are original perfumes or not.

Clean Air Clean,"I’m a Registered Nurse on a critical care unit - patients are very sick and do not want to smell overpowering fragrances. I’ve stocked up on Clean Air because it smells as it’s named - clean and fresh - just like laundry detergent or soap. I gather that’s a major negative for a lot of fragrance connoisseurs out there, but there has to be a niche in the perfume world for crowd and work safe scents and this one is it. IMHO, this is a feminine scent. Unless a man wants to smell solely of laundry detergent and soap and lightly of flowers.",06/12/19 08:42,Petals_and_Perfumes

They are all so pure and clean. They simply replace the morning shower, ...actually they replace all kinds of cleaning procedures.

Gorgeous! I adore this stuff.

Clean Air Clean,"I liked the names of Clean Rain, Clean Skin and Clean Air. So simple and natural! Tried them and loved them all. Air is now my all time favourite and definitely my signature scent. It's clean, fresh, pure, discreet, uncomplicated in a very good way - wearing it feels literally like a walk in the park. Fresh breeze, flowers, leafy trees in spring or early summer. A nice walk a perfect day. Definitely for day wear, definitely office safe. Kind to us who easily get migraine and headaches. It's sold as unisex, but I don't know... Would not like it on my husband, but it's absolutely right for me. Smells very good from the start until it fades - sadly to fast, like most of the Clean perfumes do.
// Update a few years later: Things changes. I still like this scent, but it's no longer my signature. Guess I used it too often, too much and got a bit tired of it. There is a wiff of something artificial, chemical in the mixture that I didn't notice before, or maybe CLEAN has changed the formula lately? I loved my old bottle to the last drop.",06/25/18 00:25,GardenDays
Clean Air Clean,"I know what the previous reviewer is talking about with the rotten melon in L’eau D’Issy. I personally have problems with a lot of perfumes with melon. Honeydew, on the other hand, is an exception. That smells great on me, but melon as in cantaloupe reads marigolds on me and is quite stinky. Clean Air is not like that at all on me. No melon note!

The bergamot blossom is citrusy, but not tart. Mixed with fresh air accord, this is very nice and cooling. With musk and cashmere wood in the dry down this is a lovely fragrance to wear in spring and hot summer. Clean Skin which I LOVE is more for fall, winter, and early spring for me. Doesn’t wear well in the 100 degree weather we have here during the summer, but Clean Air IS!! So glad I tried this and wish I tried it sooner. Now I have a clean fragrance to wear to work all year long.

I work in a doctor’s office and these fragrances work wonderfully. People smell them, but they’re never overpowering. They LOVE how clean and fresh I smell and some compliment me all the time. Some people, including myself, even find these two scents very comforting. I haven’t tried layering them. Perhaps I will sometime.",03/29/18 18:53,ChelleBelle84
Clean Air Clean,"I like the freshness of this scent. I kept wearing it, trying to figure out where I had smelled this before....then I realized: Air smells JUST LIKE my favorite hairspray, from the L'Oreal Studio line of products!! It's actually a great smell...but I wouldn't pay to have a perfume that smells like it. It is a very crisp, simple, and light. But seriously...if you wanna know what this smells like before an online purchase, go to your local Walmart of Walgreens, and sniff the L'Oreal Studio products!",01/16/18 10:17,kristamb
Clean Air Clean,"Air is a very simple sweet musk. I'm smelling something citrusy even though there's no citrus listed in the notes here.

Clean Air Clean,"As someone who's always been sensitive to strong scents, I never considered myself a perfume lover until this year. Then I found a rollerball set of Clean fragrances. Hey, why not, I thought -- an inexpensive way to try five perfumes at once AND an invitation to experiment with layering? I felt like a kid again with that toy from the 70s, the Barbie perfume maker or whatever it was called.

Cool Cotton captured my attention first. Air was so light, I pretty much saved it for when I wanted to add a floral note. But I kept coming back to it. Eventually I decided it really was a gorgeous scent. I kept wanting to smell it again, and I found myself reapplying throughout the day and smelling my wrists more and more often.

I finally bought the 1 oz. spray bottle. Now I can smell it at arm's length and it lasts longer than just a few hours. I'm in heaven! I'm not ready yet to commit to one fragrance (still having fun experimenting), but Clean Air is the closest I have to a signature scent.",11/04/16 14:02,verity3

OK it opens citrusy but then I get this strong plastic vibe, smells exactly like those blow up beach toys I had as a kid back in the 70's and 80's. Like the air inside them tasted and smelled like! Quite fun :) And then there's an ok musky thing growing stronger whilst the beach ball fades down. Fresh, light, perfect for the beach, but I prefer CLEAN Ultimate, White Woods and Skin. Very poor sillage and longevity is less than an hour on me.",05/27/15 11:02,LoneCamel
Clean Air Clean,This clean is one of my favorites. It smells a lot like the clean skin but with added watery and light floral notes.

The scent is not overpowering, and for lack of a better word is simply clean, like fresh cotton or newly done laundry you bury your face in.

Air & Coconut Water Eau Fraiche Clean,"Nice enough, but honestly instantly gone. It's a steal for the amount you get, but you kind of have to overspray to get any kind of ""longevity"" out of it which never lasts longer than 10mins. I think you're better off trying to find something that lasts longer with similar notes if you want a long lasting scent.

Air & Coconut Water Eau Fraiche Clean,"I just received a huge bottle of this and am in love. I completely agree with Wwoman's comments below, and I would add that there is a Hawaiian touch to this because of a hint of green tropical lushness just slightly wafting with the fresh ocean breezes and solar notes. I love spraying this liberally when I want to feel refreshed and lightened up. I also do like that it lasts longer on clothes and hair, making everything smell like it's been on a laundry line in Hawaii.",11/30/20 08:22,Noelanii
Air & Coconut Water Eau Fraiche Clean,"Not to be trite, but this truly smells like a tropical vacation to me. First it smells fresh, like Clean's other fresh air type fragrances. Then there is a lovely note of coconut that is *not at all sweet*! I hate that ""tropical"" scents smell like a pina colada smoothie half the time and are sugary as all get out. This fragrance, on the other hand, smells like you are standing on a beach with the breeze blowing and someone just cracked open a fresh coconut next to you. No fake sunscreen scent, no overly sweet fruits, and no weird seawater smell like other fragrances of this type. Sure, because it is a body spray, you have to reapply and it is not very pungent. But having the realistic smell of a beach getaway at your finger tips is worth all that.

I also get the milky sandalwood, a tiny bit of citrus, some airy white florals and vanilla in the background.

I think you cold wear this any season, as I don't think it would be to light for cooler weather, but light enough for warmer weather!",04/21/23 12:24,sundayinheaven

Nordic Light Clean,"A relaunch of my dearly beloved and discontinued White Woods from the same brand. Citrus opening and cool and comforting woody notes. The listed notes on them are almost the same and so are the scent. Clean, soothing and calming for a cosy fall/winther scent.

Love this little affordable gem.",11/30/22 09:04,louiee
Nordic Light Clean,"This is actually very pleasant, mostly powdery wood with some subtle sweetness. Decent longevity and a soft, comfortable sillage.

H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,Your typical floral fresh scent. The best way I can describe it is as a slightly sweet watery peony. Simple and gorgeous. If you love aquatic fresh florals this is definitely worth a try.,07/10/25 11:19,caro.mil
H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"Brilliant Peony alone is very linear, but it's not a bad thing. It smells like straight up peony with a water note. That is it. If you love that, you will love this.

BUT when I mix this with Clean Reserve Skin, it turns into this soft, cozy, floral musk. It smells like cuddling in fresh sheets in a garden, under the warm sun with a cool breeze.",06/27/25 05:13,claudiatalaugon
H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"I like it, but I have other similar fragrances I just prefer because this is just so subtle and the product execution just.. isn't the best. It can leave a sticky film. I have this in a small rollerball, so it's also making the roller ball less functional with the residue. When you first apply there's a very 'sour candy watermelon' smell and then after about 30 minutes it gets pulled back and the peony comes forward. It's nice. I love fresh aquatic florals for spring and summer. I prefer 'Flower Fresh' also by Clean over this, though. If you want a fresh clean smelling Peony, I also really like 'Flower Bed' from Fine'ry, too.",04/27/25 10:58,Be0_ulv

H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"Very odd dichotomy on my skin, simultaneously it smells like a delightful aquatic peony that is irresistible, but then smells a bit salty out of the blue in the next breath.

H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"Smells like aquatic peony fabric softener, very clean, this is in no way a dirty och jammy peony. I believe this is the best clean/fresh laundry fragrance on the market. As stated before it is fairly one note. But I must say it is a classy, refined, elegant and office appropriate scent. It doesn't have the hash detergent note of warm cotton and smells soft, the sweetness is really subtle. Really great everyday fragrance that is unlikely to bother anyone. I imagine Charlotte York smells like this. This H2EAU line has gotten really mixed response on the formula, but I feel like it bothers my nose and lungs less than regular perfume with alcohol, so it's a win in my book.

H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"The fragrance is nice but but pretty one-note. It does not overpower, but gives character. It gives you that smell of fresh laundry without smelling like fresh laundry.

The nozzle broke after just three weeks of use which is a HUGE minus for a product on this price range (even cheap 5€ fragrances won't suffer from this).

Another big negative is that this perfume gives me rash after few days of use and the rash won't go away quickly (and I never get rashes from perfumes). It might be due to it being water-based and the perfume not dissipating properly from the skin.",08/06/24 07:00,Metroite
H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"I just don't get the point of water based perfumes, Oil and water are typically not a good mix, And water lacks the preservative and anti-bacterial properties of alcohol, So they won't keep well. I wouldn't buy any, Only alcohol based or pure oil perfume for me. It's kind of a shame though, As some of these scents sound very nice.",02/23/24 16:55,vixen1995
H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"This is, as others have stated, a more ""one note"" fragrance. It isn't complex. It smells like peony from start to finish... Maybe with just a whisper of white musk right before it completely disappears.
If a watercolor painting of a bouquet of peonies had a scent, this would be it. It's soft and sweet.
I don't find it to have poor lasting time. Quite the opposite of what I expected. After putting it on only skin, I still catch whiffs of this 8+ hours later. It's subtle, but it's there.
As to formula concerns, this is entirely unique to anything I own. It is not a typical alcohol based perfume and you can't wear it the same way. I tested it on cotton fabric and I didn't find that it stained, but I could see how that would be an issue if you sprayed the perfume too close and didn't allow it to fully atomize. It might also depend on what type of fabric you spray it on. It will make your clothes slightly sticky and it is tacky on skin. I put it directly on skin before clothing and just don't bother trying to apply it to my clothes.
It's a skin scent that forces you to wear it that way.",02/15/24 22:47,MrsNicole
H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"Be warned - this line of H2EAU fragrances stains clothing like a spill of vegetable oil. It is not alcohol based so when you apply, make sure to not let it touch fabrics. Also, it gets gummy / sticky. This line is great in concept but disappointing in execution. Sigh.",02/12/24 08:41,bvarney_zip
H2Eau Brilliant Peony Clean,"This smells gorgeous, but very one note on me. The top notes give me nothing but peony, and it continues to be all peony when it dries down.

The bright and floral peony and the fresh watery scents are what stand out the most to me. The musk and sandalwood are more subtle, but become more prominent on me as the fragrance dries down.

I think the peony is very well done. It’s very realistic smelling, just like the peonies in my garden right after they open.

I typically get great longevity with my fragrances, but I wasn’t sure what to expect with this new H2Eau formula. Surprisingly, it lasted the whole day on me. The projection was also nice, about an arm’s length with a light application.",01/21/24 14:40,Shimmer412

Cool Cotton Clean,"I definitely fall on the side of reviewers who get a light, cool, fresh scent rather than a synthetic lemon cleaner scent, so I like this -- it's great for days when you want a low-key fragrance. The only reason this is getting a ""like"" rather than a ""love"" from me is that the longevity is pretty bad -- 2 hours max, then you need to reapply (however, given the reasonable price, not the end of the world I suppose).",05/01/24 07:26,steelfeet
Cool Cotton Clean,"Dewy-Cool & Fluffy Cotton-Linen & White-Musk...

This is overall a white-musk scent, but with a dewy-coolness that verges on fresh. Opens with a soft, fluffy citrus with faintly fruity tones, but the musky cotton is swelling through with distant reminders of scents like Light Blue Dolce& Gabbana (although this isn't a dupe). As it transitions to the heart, the cotton-musk comes more forward with a hint of mint & mimosa that lend a powdery, fresh clean laundry vibe. Although this isn't a dupe, there's a dewy coolness here that reminds me of Cool Water Women Davidoff, but this isn't as sweet, and has a more musky-cotton vibe. The white-musk has some reminders of White-Musk The Body Shop, although again this isn't a dupe. The base notes, mostly white-musk, keep the effect going for average performance for a spring-summer wearing experience.

Overall there's an understated cooling, clean cotton/linen effect. I just have an aged sample of this, but this is nicely done and fans of understated white-musk scents might like this. Enjoy!",03/03/24 07:41,suzanne_ronald

Longevity is mediocre, around maybe an hour or two. So reapplying comes into play.",11/14/23 18:06,candyxoxo589
Cool Cotton Clean,"Here's a comparison of most laundry scents Clean offers:

Cool Cotton - definitely straight up lemon cleaner as many people have said. I was expecting a strong lemon based on the reviews, and generally I like the smell of cleaners, but this is way too realistic, it doesn't smell like a perfume but like a literal window cleaner. Not much else to it

Fresh Laundry - compared to Warm Cotton this smells more like actual laundry washed with floral/sweet laundry detergent, rather than the citrusy laundry detergent itself, which is what Warm Cotton is. Fresh Laundry is almost fruity in comparison. Not masculine, but somehow leans towards a more mature scent I can't see myself wearing. It just doesn't have that clean, after the shower feeling I was looking for, it's actually pretty heavy, almost dusty.

Soft Laundry - not similar to Fresh Laundry at all. This is more youthful and lighter. Musky, slightly floral, and citrusy. There is definitely citrus in this despite what the notes show. Not sure if I would use it, it's a bit more like a cleaning product rather than laundry detergent or clean laundry which is what I was looking for. My main impression is that this is a soft musky neroli + lemon or some other unsweet citrus scent, not bad but not at all what's advertised.

Fresh Linens - very very musky. Musk is the dominant note. This is the closest one to Skin by Clean in a sense that this is a very warm musky clean skin scent as well, with some amber in the base. This one I can actually smell on myself unlike Skin, although barely. Definitely has amboxan or Iso E or whatever they put in these skin type scents. It's very weak on me but I wonder if it's stronger to other people that can smell these types of scents. I assumed this scent is exactly what Skin would have smelled like based on the description. Overall it's very nice, not what I was expecting but I am pleasantly surprised.

Warm Cotton - Tide detergent scent but in the best way. Pretty unisex but only if sprayed lightly, if you spray a lot it turns slightly masculine. These types of laundry scents aren't supposed to be loud or it comes off as a cheap cologne, so I would definitely recommend only spraying one or two sprays as this is extremely strong and lasts hours. The best one out of all the Clean laundry scents in my opinion.",11/09/23 15:10,vanillaflower4
Cool Cotton Clean,"Darnit. No. It really is too sharply synthetic. It smells like laundry detergent much more than I like and has a sharp edge. I really wanted to like this and tried hard, but it’s a clear no. Warm Cotton is much better, much less synthetic on me.",10/27/23 14:36,tessture
Cool Cotton Clean,"its my favorite perfume, my go to for almost any season/occasion (though its especially suitable for spring and summer days), its a lovely fresh scent that mixes well with my chemistry :)",06/11/23 02:56,baguettes
Cool Cotton Clean,"I don't understand what the other reviewers are smelling here. I really enjoy fresh, clean scents, but this is a hard no. Cool Cotton has the same cheap, shriekingly synthetic scent as Febreeze and certain toilet bowl cleaners. And in my mind that always makes me think someone is lazy and doesn't clean or bathe properly - like it doesn't smell clean, just like you're trying to cover up the fact something isn't clean and that's just kinda gross to me - sorry ladies! (It seems like everything made by Clean seems to really make me ill. They're just so synthetic-heavy and headache-inducing. I'm pretty sure they all must contain some level of d-limonene because my allergies go crazy around that stuff.) This one has a minty note that makes it more bearable, but it's difficult to breathe when someone near me is wearing this. I guess the bonus is that this stuff is very resistant to fading and seems to stick to skin and clothes like glue. It's also a sillage monster, easily filling a room. With that said, due to the reach, it's probably not work-safe and definitely not health industry job safe.",01/07/23 03:14,mejohann
Cool Cotton Clean,"This is one of my favs and go-to when I need a scent boost to lift my spirits. I love it because it just smells clean and fresh.

Does not smell cheap or heavy. It’s just a great everyday scent.",10/11/22 19:59,angelmtaylor
Cool Cotton Clean,"The touch of mint gives this one a refreshing, cooling quality. Cool Cotton starts with a quick mist of lemonade, then dries down to a fresh crisp cotton fabric scent. It's like air conditioning for your skin in summer, or a cold breeze from an open window in winter. The cool feeling stays with you even after fragrance becomes a close to skin scent. Cotton flower, mimosa and white musk combine to create the very slightest hint of a powdery feeling. It's really more soft musk than powder. Non offensive, office friendly.. Uplifting, refreshing, and a real crowd pleaser. Perfect for anyone, any age, to wear anywhere, all year round.",10/06/22 13:09,joliecat
Cool Cotton Clean,"This is a pile of cut lemons on top of laundry. I enjoy warm cotton, but this is much more tart than that one. Mint is listed in the notes but unfortunately I don’t smell any here.

Cool Cotton Clean,"This scent is interesting. This perfume smells almost like men soap (you know the green dove one) but on the dry down it's a little more pleasant.

I like it for a “non perfume” kind of day, when you just want to smell like you went into the shower and put freshly out of laundry clothes on, while someone cut an apple in the background.

The sillage is weak , a skin scent after around half an hour. The longevity is moderate.

It’s citrus, fresh and laundry soap sort of, but it’s how I love it. Give this one a try!!!",05/31/21 11:03,Dort0625
Cool Cotton Clean,"I won't duplicate all the other reviews by describing how this scent makes you feel like you're fresh out of the shower after using expensive soap or wearing crisply ironed shirts, because this fragrance can be both of those things, but it also reminds me of burying my face in freshly laundered European linens while sprawled on a deliciously soft bed.

I like wearing this when I'm feeling blah and want to feel comfortable and calm--and very, wonderfully, fragrantly clean. It's also good for days when you get bogged down in between complex fragrances. This is simple and well blended: it's hard to pick out the distinct notes. Cotton flower, mimosa, and white musk are the most I can find in this.

Sillage is low-moderate and longevity is about 4-5 hours on me, finishing with a lovely skin scent that lingers for several more.",02/06/21 18:12,Quixotic Blue
Cool Cotton Clean,"This is a type of clean scent that is bright and chilly, like stepping out of the shower on a sunny, spring day. It is brazenly acidic, unapologetically soapy, and absolutely refreshing. The best thing have been learning, as I make my way down this line, is they deliver exactly what their name suggests. This is critical for blind buying, and acknowledges the customer deserves some basic respect in determining olfactory identification. Unlike some that think you won't know the difference. Take Pure Honey, which smelled like everything but pure honey! They have claimed Cool Cotton, and that is exactly what you will get. Where as Clean Laundry had slightly warm, fuzzy chords, Cool Cotton jumps out with sharp citrus. One is cozy, and one is refreshing. I don't think I will go further with my analysis, because that would be like critiquing laundry detergent. I will say this one last thing. Dry down lingers with this herbaceous brightness that reminds me strongly of Bath and Body Works, discontinued and now deemed vintage, body spray titled Lemon Basil. Which I can no longer find. So bonus! That verdant characteristic has extremely respectable longevity for a Eau Fraiche, which also amps up my affection for it.",01/14/21 22:51,echurch1979

Cool Cotton Clean,"Straight out of the bottle, Cool Cotton brought back memories of a lot of the fresh aquatic/green scents that were popular in the 90’s. Think along the lines of Cool Water, Polo Sport, Nautica, Tommy Girl, etc. As it began to dry down, though, it really started to exemplify its name. It’s not a “going sailing” type of aquatic smell, but more along the lines of “recently bathed.” It smells like fresh laundry that has been dried in a fruity-floral fabric softener. There’s really no other way to describe it. As their Warm Cotton scent also smells like fresh laundry, I think the mint note is what makes Cool Cotton different.

It’s not something I’d wear for date night or an evening out, but you could definitely wear this to run errands or to the office. (I mean, c’mon, who’s going to complain about working next to someone who smells like they showered today?) This could also be a workout scent or when you just want a good pick-me-up, as it gives that just-washed-up vibe. I’d say it’s a good selection for Spring/Summer, however I could see it appealing year-round to people who are fans of this type of scent. Cleanliness doesn’t really have a season.",09/06/20 14:21,SeauxGood

I, personally, don't want to smell like detergent or my laundry, as my clothes already have that slight smell to them, and I don't need the world to know how often I do my laundry - doesn't much matter to me. I want people to smell me and wonder ""That fragrance is gorgeous, what is she wearing?"" or ""she smells delicious"" rather than ""someone must have just done their laundry!"" So I would not reach for this ever again on myself, though I would perhaps buy another one just to have to spray on my linens and blankets and such!

Cool Cotton Clean,"Very fresh, laundry detergent, clean scent. Citrus and apple are prominent. Like a “cotton” or “linen” scented candle. Normally not something I am very much into, but I wore my little sample of this extensively while in Barcelona this January, which was a bright spot in a very dark time for me so this scent to me is tied to unusually calm, relaxed feelings in a comfortable, “clean, well-lighted place.”

Cool Cotton Clean,"It smells just like laundry detergent so personally I like It! Moderate sillage for maybe 20-30 min before turning into a skinscent. Weak to moderate lasting power depending on your skin, moisture makes it last longer so use some lotion before spraying.

Cool Cotton Clean,"I would say this is a unisex fragrance.
I second the voter saying warm cotton vs cool cotton is the same as warm towels from the dryer vs a shower with expensive soap.

Topnotes are juicy sweet apple, lemon and bergamot warmed with cotton flower and a hint of a bitter masculine tone. The citrus is not a very sharp smell - more like a very bright smell, more like rubbing your hand hard on a lemon peel and smelling the oil, than actually biting into the shapness of the lemon.

As it dries down, there is a hint of lemon cotton flower and musk. Base notes - definately some amber

It has a very weak sillage and is not long lasting. On me it lasted maybe 15 minutes?

Makes me think of a watered down version of Guerlian Acqua Allegoria Herba Fresca but less green, more warmth from the cotton flower and amber

A definate (but weak) ""expensive soap"" smell . Not a ""laundry chemicals"" smell.

Its OK but not memorable in any way. It is much more 'perfume like' than the other cleans (simply soap, clean original, ultimate, shower fresh, fresh laundry, summer linen) , which basically imitate detergent or soap . This one is definately a perfume with all the artisticness that goes into the perfume. If I didnt know it and smelled it on someone else, i would say it is defiantely a perfume and not simply clean soap or fresh clothes. The trouble is, in creating this fragrance Clean has shunned it's cult status of imitation smells, and has produced a perfume which is 'perfume like' with layers and artisticness but simply doesnt do it very well. So you have a perfume which smells like a perfume, but in fact is a mediocre one. I cant imagine it would be anyone's favourite because there isnt anything to make it stand out.

It is very similar to Clean Provence (discontinued) which was the expensive triple milled french soap one BUT this one is more green and warm, much much weaker

In summary.

Unremarkable, weak but pleasant expensive soap fragrance.

VEry different to warm cotton which is more of a warm clean towel smell. I would recommend warm over cold",07/17/19 06:46,pongwiffy

It's more soap than detergent or softener. Cool Cotton is clean and fresh from the start and it settles that way too. It offers no drama, no surprises, no excitement. It's simple and reliable, good and safe. You smell nice and you know it. Sometimes that's exactly what you wan't from a fragrance. Nothing more, nothing less.
// Update a few years later. I still like this no fuss- no problem- scent. I've noticed that of all my perfumes this one have given me the most compliments through the years. We're a good match.",09/03/18 06:48,GardenDays
Cool Cotton Clean,"I'm really jealous of whatever it is that you guys are smelling in the other reviews, because to me this smells like febreeze and a portable toilet freshener had a child. I absolutely loathe it. I blind purchased at a deep discount, thinking that if I didn't like it I could at least use it as a room/linen spray. Nope. Never want to smell this again.",02/03/18 09:05,kodyloki
Cool Cotton Clean,"To me this smells like soft, cool cotton sheets. It's natural, clean, and refreshing. It reminds me just a bit of Estee Lauder White Linen, but a softer, fresher, less sharp and more updated version of that scent. If you like clean and fresh fragrances, I recommend trying this out (actually the entire Clean brand).",11/20/17 08:06,kristin126
Cool Cotton Clean,"I tested a manufacturer's sample, and dabbed it. This is an aquatic, clean cotton t-shirt type of scent. I can't pick out any of the individual notes that Fragrantica lists (besides the cotton) as it is very well blended - but the overall effect is very aquatic, reminiscent of something Issey Miyake might make.

The sillage was quite powerful upon initial application, but died down to a skin scent within 2 hours.",09/26/17 14:57,lovelyhazel
Cool Cotton Clean,This smells exactly like the green dove shower gel.,03/08/17 06:51,kerimometi
Cool Cotton Clean,"Here's how I'll put this because I'm being honest. If you like the scent of soap after a shower and want it to last longer, this is THE perfume to put on. It's just a blast of clean towel dried cottony goodness. You're gonna smell a little like dove soap and if that's your thing, you will love it.",05/13/16 07:01,minusvminus
Cool Cotton Clean,"I intend to by this one... :) recently I discoverd #Clean produscts and I think it;s another level of scent, androgyne, light, contemporrary.",03/25/16 04:30,Iris_S
Cool Cotton Clean,"This smells clean, oceanic, and almost fishy because it smells so close to the ocean. It also smells like clean laundry. It smells like the Yankee Candle scent 'Home Sweet Home' I don't like it.",01/22/16 11:34,HeavyBeatsUK
Cool Cotton Clean,"So to start I will say that my favourite type of fragrance is a clean, fresh smelling perfume. So when I got this as a free sample I thought i couldn't go wrong, and technically speaking I didn't. It does smell amazing! It does smell fresh! And it does smel clean! But here's the thing.... It smells EXACTLY like the towels I took out of the dryer! So yes, this is absolutely fresh and clean....but it's like, how you want your clothes to smell as they come out of the dryer, or how you want your bedding to smell when you go to lay down at night! This one would be perfect for if you were to have a bath or shower in the evening right before bed, and then you spray your clothes with it, lightly on your body and then your bedding as well! As far as a perfume goes, no....I will take a pass on smelling like laundry!",07/25/15 17:48,Dort0625
Cool Cotton Clean,"Guilty pleasure... I kinda love this stuff! Perfect for summertime, when I myself don't necessarily have a signature scent, but like to experiment with different fresh fragrances outside of my usual warm/spicy preferences. I get the zingy citrus and clean cotton up front, followed by the gentle musk drydown, and it's really nice! I must be one of the lucky one's who's body chem mixes well with the product, because it lasts a good 8 hours on my skin and longer on my clothes. I love wearing this with a crisp white tee that smells like my laundry detergent.. Putting it to good use this summer, cuz who doesn't wanna smell fresh & clean on a scorching hot day? Very pleasant stuff for the warm season.",06/15/15 11:13,ell_bee
Cool Cotton Clean,This smells like a wc duck in a public restroom. Including the urine leftovers.,06/10/15 10:33,The Swedish girl
Cool Cotton Clean,"Surprised how much I like this! There is a distinct dryer sheet/laundromat smell with something metallic and fresh right in the beginning. The dry down is quite nice on me--light, clean white musk--and it comes on rather quickly, about thirty minutes in. I can tell that this is strictly a scent to be worn for one's own personal satisfaction because there is next to no sillage and longevity is poor. If this came in a set with matching lotion and shower gel/body wash then it might actually be worth paying full price for, but I am happy with my small rollerball sample. This is also a good scent for layering with the other Clean fragrances, especially the Warm Cotton and Air.",05/26/15 14:44,DarlingNikki
Cool Cotton Clean,"Smells very similar to Clean - Warm Cotton. Unfortunatly this has absolutely no lasting power on me, it smells ok on me for like 15minutes, and then its gone.

Very weird, especially because Warm Cotton lasts all day on me.",03/30/15 09:57,Hewlett
Cool Cotton Clean,"Meh, what's to say about this scent.. I personally did not enjoy it too much, it's very fresh and clean smelling but there is nothing intriguing about it. My friends really enjoyed the scent, and one of my friends loved it so much I ended up giving it to her. It's ok I guess, but there's nothing special about it.",01/05/15 16:32,Lovelylittlelisa
Cool Cotton Clean,"This is not a scent I would normally gravitate towards, but since it was a free sample I decided to try it. The name is certainly accurate - cotton, with a bit of citrus to make it more interesting. Projection is low, as I tend to expect from Clean. I enjoy it more than I thought I would. But honestly, I wouldn't purchase it. Perhaps I will finish the sample, perhaps I won't. I am finding it difficult to muster any opinions about Cool Cotton at all. It's ""nice,"" but nothing more.",10/28/14 21:21,angellama
Cool Cotton Clean,"Smells like crisp, clean, laundry detergent. I wouldn't wear this personally, but it smells so good :) I would use it as linen spray!",08/27/14 10:05,arenee92
Cool Cotton Clean,This smells like a cotton candle. Way too strong of a scent for me. I thought it would be more soft. Didn't care for it but I did spray it around the house.,06/20/14 08:48,DandelionPicker
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"i don't usually go for a fragrance like this but smelling this made me feel like i had just been transported into a luxury spa. it's a nice break from the scents i usually go for, and an easy reach!",11/11/25 17:34,w_isteria
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"I adore this scent, whenever lending it to others I tell them it's what I think a freshwater mermaid would smell like. The perfect summer or spring scent, the lotus scent mixed with cucumber and marine notes is so perfect, it really paints an image in your head. It is definitely more feminine, but I could see anyone wearing it as well. This may be a little niche in this community, but if you play the game Overwatch, this would definitely be Lifeweaver's signature scent. 8.5/10",10/08/25 08:40,LavenderElixir
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,I love this. Clean and fresh. It's honestly real subtle but also a wonderful intimate fresh out of the shower and spa fragrance. The longevity is quite impressive it definitely remains pretty intimate for a long time it's a nice scent bubble for those who don't like wearing fragrances that project farther than arms length or to offend. The cucumber is obviously the most prominent note. It's like B&BW Cucumber Melon grew up and got her life together. She's in her healing era. I'd say this is a safe blind buy. You really have to dislike cucumber as a whole to not like this.,08/14/25 09:58,thickesthoneyyy
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,I smell water… just water. Disappointed. Nothing about this perfume stands out and I wasted my money,07/26/25 20:56,narro629
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"I’m basically obsessed with this whole line. I have full bottles of this, waterfall and nectarine petal. They all smell amazing, but like many I’ve tried from Clean they don’t have a tremendous amount of projection or sillage. My biggest issues are: 1. The product is sticky when you spray it on, and stays sticky for at least an hour while wearing. I assume this is due to the water-based nature of the perfume. And 2. Again, due to the perfumes being water-based they have a pretty short shelf life. The website says they are only good for a year, unlike most of my perfumes which can last for years if not decades when stored properly. I haven’t actually had these long enough to test that shelf life, but it is a concern of mine.

Edit a few months later: when these sit on the shelf long enough they take on a musty quality.",07/22/25 14:29,nessie.jesse
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"As true to its name as it gets. A slightly sweet very watery lotus scent. I am an enjoyer of light scents, though I tend to go for the powdery iris/violet ones, I still thoroughly enjoy this and if someone walked past me wearing this I would think they smell really good.",07/10/25 11:35,caro.mil
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"smells like a lemon lollipop at the pool on a sunny day when you were a kid, very refreshing and not that sweet",07/03/25 09:15,666rchid
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"I've been obsessed with aquatic, clean scents lately so this one hits the spot! I agree that H2Eau Water Lotus is similar to the Dove cucumber soap, but there's an added floral sweetness to it, which I love! Sometimes cucumber notes turn picklish on my skin, but I don't experience that here. The projection is only a 1 foot radius and longevity is moderate, which I've come to expect from ""freshies"". Still, I think this is a solid choice to add to my aquatic fragrance collection!",06/28/25 08:51,As Above
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"sweet, aquatic, id call this a wet floral. evocative of lily pads, damp moss, and gently moist air. the lotus/peony/cucumber accord gives this levity and airiness but it still is fresh and undeniably saccharine. i would drink this if it was a tea/beverage",06/14/25 13:15,nenuphars
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"dove brand cucumber bar soap. the light green one that always felt fancy as a kid. it's lovely, and inoffensive, and not worth what I paid for it, but it fills a niche in my collection well enough.",05/14/25 21:24,solarity
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"one of the things i love about the clean brand is their ability to make inoffensive scents that make you smell shower fresh. of the ones i’ve tried, this is one of my favorites.
it reminds me of the cucumber melon bath and body works scent - very nostalgic, but a more modern take on it. this one is just an easy reach, especially for spring and summer.",04/23/25 07:21,guntlia
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"The other reviews are a bit baffling. I thought maybe I just didn’t have a good enough nose or wasn’t rolling it properly, etc. I sniffed and sniffed and waited and sniffed again. I put it on my skin, I put it on paper. I applied a little, I applied a lot. I waited overnight, I sniffed more. I just do not sense any of the notes in this. It just smells like strong, synthetic perfume to me. What I must be smelling i the amber or musk. At one point I thought I got a bit of cucumber upon initial application but I quickly lost it. And I’m very familiar with cucumber fragrance as cucumber melon was my go-to in the 2000s. There is nothing aquatic. There is nothing white floral. It’s just generic artificial which I can only attribute to the peony perhaps mixed with the amber/musk if going by the notes. I will say it was only tolerable when I applied a very very small amount, the fragrance did have a light freshness to it then, but not without perfuminess. I purchased another brand’s perfume the same day with beach notes—that one smelled like salt water and sand brought in by the breeze, so I know it isn’t my nose to blame. Maybe I got a bad batch, I was really let down that this perfume didn’t have any of the important notes and is barely wearable, despite the good reviews.",04/12/25 09:39,Grassygourmand

H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"cucumbery, aquatic, light. very fresh and lovely, but also nothing to write home about. still a good scent especially if you're into cucumber, this definitely has a good note of it. also felt very ozonic, which is a gorgeous combination of water and sky in a smell. suspicious about lasting power, lasted only about 3-4 hours on paper so can't imagine it to be better on skin. also i don't like limiting scents to seasons but this is like 99% summer frag",04/01/25 22:11,lelipeli
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"I never thought I'd like a cucumber-y scent so much! Excellent, clean, fresh, and the sweetness almost turns that cucumber into a very watery watermelon, but not in a bad way at all, as I don't usually like watermelon in fragrances. This scent is so lovely, I can't wait to wear it on spring strolls by the pond watching damselflies buzz by young green lily pads.",03/09/25 22:04,Violasororia
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"I bought a gift pack of the new H2eau line from clean that had all of the new line in it and some of them I looooved. I can’t remember all of them but I knew this one and musk noir(maybe that’s not even what it’s called) we’re ny favourites so I ordered a full size of this. The scent is so nice, it’s really aquatic and fresh smelling. If you are into fresh, aqauatics, citrus or aromatic perfumes this will absolutely be your jam. The one thing I will say about this whole line is that it has kind of a gross feeling to the liquid. It’s almost oily and sticky and then if you were to slide your finger along your skin it would kind of be like when you neeed GOO Gone for tough stickers, gross description I know but I can’t describe it any other way. It’s so gross in fact I changed my rollerball head and dumped it into a spray bottle, so I could spray it onto my clothes rather than my skin, it really is that bad. Scent 10 out of 10 , the liquid -10 out of 10 lol",03/02/25 11:50,Itsadortthing
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"So fresh and clean. Doesn't smell synthetic at all, the scent is soft without harsh edges. This isn't a head turner but the perfect fragrance to wear to the office or day to day when you just want to smell clean and put together. Wearing this kind of gives the vibe you go to an expensive spa surrounded by a peaceful lake with lotus flowers on it, and serene zen gardens. After taking a shower with their expensive body washes and shampoo, you leave smelling like Water Lotus.",12/30/24 08:27,Alice99

H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"this scent is one of my favorites! it is a light, summery scent that encaptures a vision of sitting nearby the lake. i can smell the lotus, water, and other greenery in this perfume. it also gives off a clean scent as if you just stepped out of the shower. my only wish is that this perfume doesn't spray too well and leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky. avoid spraying it directly on clothes, especially light-colored clothes, as it will leave a stain! overall, though, it smells soooo good. one of my faves.",06/18/24 11:02,itsMak
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"Really pleasant aquatic floral, but nothing remarkable. It reminds me of countless other aquatic florals out there.

Some things to note about this line:

The spray does come out bubbly/foamy and is more likely to drip before it absorbs.

This collection does leave a sticky, tacky feel on the skin, but I haven’t experienced any clothes staining. I haven’t sprayed directly on fabric so I don’t know if that would cause staining, but I haven’t had any issues with skin-to-clothing transfer.

The other issue I’ve been having with this line is they all go through a transitional period where they smell… off. Initial application smells great, dry down is lovely, but in between there’s a temporary period where it goes kinda ick, like a decaying flower/fruit smell. I suspect it’s some sort of reaction that results as part of the water-based, non-alcohol formulation this line uses.",03/06/24 12:44,Jadelynn
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"One of my top 3 scents from this collection.
Beautiful fresh, aquatic scent with a touch of green. I envision being on summer vacation at a park with a pond with lotuses - you can smell water and greenery. Doesn't smell artificial.

Great marketing photos and concept of the collection.

I would buy the discovery set if it contained sprays, not rollerballs.",02/17/24 13:42,fragrance_girl
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"a cute green, floral scent. Im not too crazy on the florals but this one I will get in my collection. The longevity on this one is okay though. About 3/4 hours on me",02/16/24 10:41,ambarmari3
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"Be warned - this line of H2EAU fragrances stains clothing like a spill of vegetable oil. It is not alcohol based so when you apply, make sure to not let it touch fabrics. Also, it gets gummy / sticky. This line is great in concept but disappointing in execution. Sigh.",02/12/24 08:40,bvarney_zip
H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,This is so beautiful! It’s very much like a cucumber melon fragrance but stepped up a few notches! This so far and brilliant peony are the two tops of this line for me and if you are into fresh watery light floral or aquatics in general you will live this! I have a travel size and I’m absolutely buying the full size soon!,01/24/24 19:43,Dort0625

H2Eau Water Lotus Clean,"When you get a bouquet of flowers from the store and you open then up at home and start cutting the stems to fit into your vase, that green earthy fresh scent of the green stems, that's what this smells like at first.

Sel Santal Clean,"Leans too masculine on me. Giving my sample to my husband.


This does not smell like Santal 33, Bois de Balincourt, Santal Vanille, nor Gris Charnel—I have all of those and this smells nothing like any of them. This is an ozonic salty Santal where the “sel”, wood, and orris/Iris notes dominate.",09/23/25 18:39,OlfactoryTopTier
Sel Santal Clean,"Too watery and ozonic.
This company aimed to create a light, refreshing woody fragrance. However, the scent is overly artificial and disharmonious. The fig, floral, and woody notes are all at odds with each other. The ozonic notes ruin the overall balance. It reminds me of plastic-coated paper. I don't recommend blind buying this perfume.
+ It's completely different from Santal 33!!",09/19/25 06:32,rhamnosus
Sel Santal Clean,"This is A LOT more masculine than I expected. I was hoping for more of a Wood Sage & Sea Salt kind of vibe, and just got a sharp, masculine, aquatic/woody. It's fine, but I don't enjoy wearing it, it's too sharp for me.",09/18/25 06:35,ntabassum92
Sel Santal Clean,"A soft, woody fragrance. Only get the sandalwood in the dry-down, and only then does it remind me of Santal 33. To me, this is unisex, but I can see how it might lean masculine to some people. This house does a good job of representing their brand, imo. All their frags are ""clean"" takes or interpretations of whatever fragrance type (or family) they take on. I get a clean vibe from this woody frag. Still prefer other woody frags of this type with more body or presence.",09/16/25 08:30,tanss
Sel Santal Clean,"This smells so, so good, and also so very uninspired. Salty aquatic with fig. This leans masculine for me, because yes, it does make me think of Axe body spray.

Sel Santal Clean,"This fragrance smells like what Bali looks and seems like. Specifically Ubud, Bali.",09/06/25 03:04,Ya3895
Sel Santal Clean,"Fresh out of the box review: this is somewhat high pitched on my skin. The fig aldehydes… the tonic water bubbly aldehydes, and the styrax is animalic quality. Hazelnut and whipped cream round of the sharp edges of the aldehydes in a creative way. It smells like soap bubbles enveloping all the notes with beautiful roses all around.

with maturation, it’s going to be REALLY beautiful and unique. The iris powderiness is so pleasant and modern. It’s strong and sensual… little sweetness and creaminess to balance the aldehydes. Salty, earthy, aldehydic, rose, dry ocean wood, creamy, powdery, slightly sweet fig, clean. Very unique.

It’s clean but not in a fresh out the shower way or dryer sheet/ warm cotton clean. It’s a purified or refined clean with salt and bubbly tonic, fresh out the ocean, a modern and versatile, slightly fruity/ rosy/ powdery/ nutty/ earthy creamy clean aquatic. Lovely scent.",08/11/25 15:33,12shae21
Sel Santal Clean,oof. this is so harsh and unpleasant for a good hour. it dries down to an aftershave type smell. like a typical men’s fragrance reminiscent of the early 2000s. i love sandalwood but this is such a sharp mess. i understand notes are just marketing for perfume but the notes listed here can’t possibly be what anyone is smelling outside of a nasty “sandalwood.” smells like it cost $8 and would be a deodorant or men’s shower gel,08/11/25 06:43,bookishgoods
Sel Santal Clean,"Santal 33 pales in comparison to this beauty. I was so disappointed when I tried a sample of the former after being spoiled with this.

There's something about this that reads like a warm hug to me.",07/13/25 20:32,GrimApatheia
Sel Santal Clean,"This is in my top 10 fragrances. I love the salty note and wear it layered over many other fragrances, from nerolis to roses to gourmands.

Sel Santal Clean,"Havent been super impressed by any of the Clean Reserves so far so I was nervous to try this, but I actually super like this one! Yes it does err on the side of masculine/cologne-y but I dont think that should deter anyone looking for a medium-affordable sandalwood fragrance. I havent smelled Santal 33 yet but I dont get any of the ""pickle notes"" that I've heard can be found in this as well. Sillage is not amazing, and after trying a second time I do get what people are saying about the Axe Body spray/Mens Cologne thing, but this has much more depth and layers up close. Cute bright fall smell, not very dark or spicy but kind of a fresh sandalwood :)",06/13/25 11:56,Katchke
Sel Santal Clean,"To me, this smells like straight sandalwood, I do not get any of the other notes. Maybe a little bit of the salt. It also leans more masculine. I normally like scents like Santa 33 and Bois de Balincourt to give you an idea, but do not like this one. I personally use it only to add a little bit of a woodsy note to floral or fruity fragrances in my collection.",06/02/25 11:50,martineski

Sel Santal Clean,"does bear a resemblance to santal 33, but less woody, more salty, sharp, and ambery. this kind of leans more driftwood to me, that sort of artificial sandalwood that every masculine bath and body works scent smells like. the opening is surprisingly floral and soapy, lots of violet and almost a lavender scent, maybe this is the tonic water accord. then it turns more creamy and sweet, the whipped cream comes out along with that intensifying driftwood or sandalwood note and a tiny bit of savory nuttiness. i do actually like the dry down, velvety violet and sandalwood with a nice light salt accord, it's quite pretty but delicate, not much staying power
not my preferred formulation of this scent profile, but i could actually see myself wearing this occasionally when i want to mix it up a bit",03/05/25 05:27,n8super

Sel Santal Clean,"I just finished a 1.5 ml sample of this and I liked it, but I just did not love it. It didn't leave me with a feeling of needing it in my collection. It IS a nice fragrance though! I currently own something that's just too similar to this, Dolce & Gabbana's K EDP. My husband didn't like it so he let me have at it and while they are very similar to my nose, Sel Santal is very obviously unisex, much more softer and slightly creamy. D&G K is very obviously targeted to a masculine audience and lacks that softness, it's very aromatic whereas Sel Santal is more of a woody fragrance. Still very reminiscent of each other in my opinion. Both very good! I do recommend you sample, don't recommend you blind buy.",10/25/24 14:38,Adenahi
Sel Santal Clean,"I have a travel size of this and I just don’t love it. I tried to reach for it throughout the summer when I wanted something neutral. I ended up finding it to be a little sharp on the nose, however, in the same way that some might find cheaper men’s colognes to be. I would wear it in the hope that the sharpness was coming from that tonic water top note and that it would dry down to something better, but it just never sat quite right in my skin.

Additionally, I didn’t find the longevity or sillage to be great, however that ended up being more of a positive based on how much I’ve liked it. I will try mixing it with some of my other fragrances to see if I can get through it, but overall I’m not a big fan.",10/03/24 08:28,oagirl9339
Sel Santal Clean,"This one smells like salty pickles on the opening, similar to Santal 33. The dry down is strong, masculine, salty & woody. Bergamot heavy with mild spice.

Sel Santal Clean,"I bought this in Aussie Summer of '23. It was interesting but not what I wanted for the season. This winter however, it's my absolute favourite. Fresh, sharp, woody. Divine on its own, or lovely paired with S.F Mysteriosa, T.M Aura or M.B Signature- for that sharp woody, winter fruits vibe. I'm out and I need another bottle!!!
I must confess though, I work in a fragrance department and I'm kind of obsessed with more niche scents 😅",07/19/24 03:03,Sheena Dee
Sel Santal Clean,"Fresh. Nutty. Crisp and warm. Sparkling and subtly citrus. Familiar and bright, slightly aftershave and cologne and I enjoy it. Love that pop of amber and woods. The salt and fig invigorate. Nutmeg and hazelnut warm and sweeten, but it maintains a softness from distinctive iris and rose. It's a busy ingredient list, but its character is one of simple nutty and woody freshness. Includes the same airy backbone as Yesterday Haze with fig, woods and nuts; but fresher and without too much gourmand creaminess. It's relaxing, casual and fresh, and a favorite from the line.",06/18/24 10:30,wannabeconnoisseur
Sel Santal Clean,"this is the first sandalwood fragrance that doesn't give me straight pickle. it's aquatic, but not overly so. it's an uplifting, clean wood that fades into watery florals. i love this so much. i'd say it's unisex as well",06/13/24 21:41,mayvray

- Top: Mandarin Leaves, Bergamot, Nutmeg Tonic
- Middle: Iris, Salted Fig, Violet, Hazelnut Cream
- Dry Down: Sandalwood, Decadent Amber, Styrax, Rose Musk

I'm halfway between picking up the sandalwood and picking up dill. 😂 The fig and hazelnut cream are nice and lend a nutty creaminess to the lovely addition of Iris and Violet - but I honestly can't get past that dill pickle mix and the overall composition seems muddied.",04/02/24 12:47,Norie
Sel Santal Clean,"I do not personally think this is exact dupe for Santal 33. Same vibes, absolutely, but Santal 33 smells like literal hot garbage on me, whereas this does not. Blind purchased and do not regret; it’s a strong like. Sel Santal is definitely in the same lane as Banana Republic Classic (but more complex), and I get some Grassland in there, as well. There’s a bit of an Irish Spring component in there, but not in a bad way. I think the reason I like this more than the BR scents I mentioned is because it’s a but more complex and less pungent.",03/25/24 00:51,Msquared1985
Sel Santal Clean,"I like this very much! Warm and woody with a hint of freshness. I don't think this smells masculine whatsoever, but perhaps my perception of what makes a masculine scent is somewhat skewed. It avoids overt sweetness and the irritating ""green"" note that I associate with designer fragrance flaps in magazines. So far this is my favorite scent from Clean!",03/12/24 23:36,Lothere55
Sel Santal Clean,"Sophisticated perfume! I liked it , definitely can smell the mandarin and sandalwood but the dry down is more citrusy notes.. I feel like it’s something your boss would wear at a business meeting or if you want to be professional.. The sillage is not to strong on this though .",03/08/24 16:09,Kisskissdelrey
Sel Santal Clean,"Yes, very similar to Santal 33. They share a savory slightly powdery sandalwood accord. Sel Santal layers salty air and a humid greenness underneath the sandal which differentiates it from 33. It gives it a beachy-vegetal tang, which I really like. That said, they are still very similar and Sel Santal could be a flanker of Santal 33. It is very clean without being fresh and heat-compatible without being calone-cologne; an effect I love and it makes sense with the brand philosophy.

It is indeed unisex leaning slightly masculine, but not in a ""generic man cologne"" kind of way. It's more like a rugged outdoors scent. I feel comfortable wearing it as a woman.",02/24/24 07:05,Avian

Sel Santal Clean,"Blind bought on a TJ spree. Yes, quite masculine. Herbal and woody. But clean. Gets more powdery into a unisex smell that still leans a bit too mas for me. I haven't given up tho, I think misted over bare skin and fully dried will give a great clean woody vibe, and although cold Fall for me- this could be refreshing in heat? Has a refreshing gin/tonic and green vibe too.
Sort of reminds me of Pharrell Girl. Never smelled Santal 33, but this had an initial smell of the book/library/paper perfumes- which attracted me.
Might give to my hub. Love the bottle tho for displaying next to my Commodity.",11/17/23 17:59,mschnabel666
Sel Santal Clean,"nonononon I don't like this.

Sel Santal Clean,I really enjoy the layers in this one. More complex than the other clean reserve fragrances. Fresh spicy sweet fruity woody musk.,07/07/23 15:25,JLaw7
Sel Santal Clean,I like this one. It’s a fresh sandalwood fragrance. It smells like a good quality aftershave. A bit basic and too masculine for me to wear.,06/27/23 09:07,rainelliem
Sel Santal Clean,"First Impressions (sample spray):
If you love Santal 33 this might be a more affordable dupe for you. Other than that I feel like it's way more salty than santal 33, and has way less fig. I am already not a big fan of santal 33. Thus, I give this perfume a meh rating.
Edit: okie after trying the rest of the clean reserve this one is not bad. To me, it just doesn’t smell clean for a woman. This is a nice I like, but on a man perfume for me. It still does have a pickled dry sandalwood that still does remind me of santal 33 with maybe a clean shave version. It does remind me of something that I know yet I can’t remember. That might be the same dna as santal 33. Definitely more masculine, and has a man cologne feeling to it.

Summary:
Smells like: male cologne, a good santal 33 clone.
Family of: santal 33 (-pickly, +masc)
Silage: moderate to intimate

Verdict:
Pass- smells a little bit too much like man’s cologne. If a man wore this I would be impressed ngl.",06/25/23 17:41,AdalynEverly
Sel Santal Clean,"I bought the Clean Reserve Discovery Set of 8 small eau de parfum sprays, and this was the first one I tried. The first note I noticed was an odd kind of sour spice. I see that tonic water is listed as one of the top notes, so that must be what I noticed and what other people describe as a dill or pickle smell. And then I got wood, and it lasted for maybe 2 hours.

This is a weird one, and I'd say it leans masculine. I'm sure I won't be buying a bigger size of it. I may try layering it over musk oil when the weather gets cooler, but I'm doubtful that I'll like it much better that way.

Maybe this is one of those fragrances where if it works with your body chemistry, it's great. And otherwise, it's awful.

Edit: I've changed my mind; I'm not giving this another chance. I just can't get past that pickle smell.",06/09/23 23:07,fragrancenovice
Sel Santal Clean,"Yuck. Sorry, just don’t enjoy this one. Got the dreaded dill opening and the rest of the fragrance is unpleasant in my opinion.

Sel Santal Clean,"I think what Im getting is a lot of fig, salt and woody tonic? It is definitely masculine leaning to me. I like it but I would not wear this one.",05/30/23 16:36,Lolodojo
Sel Santal Clean,"This is a very nice, clean creamy sandalwood dominated scent. The creaminess is subtle attributed by the whipped cream note. Bergamot, tonic water and salt is lightly in the background supporting the blend. The florals are non-detectable at first, but ever so slightly come through within a 15-30min dry down. This is perfectly unisex, 49% feminine and 51% masculine leaning but if you’re into warm woody scents this is a pleasant, well blended easy wearing non-offensive scent.",04/12/23 13:01,SindiScent
Sel Santal Clean,"I found an old sample of this that I must have tried years ago, before I was as serious about the hobby, and forgot, because it wasn't full. Anyway, thought it sounded like something nice to try on at bedtime after a shower tonight. I was a little surprised when I sprayed it, as I'd looked at the notes but not the reviews, so I could react without being influenced. Well, as most everyone else has said, this is very masculine. I don't always mind a bit of that, depending on the notes in question, and what feminine notes are in the blend for balance. Like, I love spices, lavender, many woods. This had no balance though, smelled overwhelmingly like a traditional aftershave or cologne. Out of my comfort zone for sure.

As someone else said below, there's no noticeable whipped cream here, maybe barbershop shaving cream. The dry down is more pleasant to me than the barbershop fougere type opening, but still decidedly masculine, and I'm a pretty feminine person, so it feels a little weird. I would've given it to my husband, but don't think there's enough left now. I don't really get pickles. I also don't get nutmeg, florals, cream, hazelnut, or fig. This would be amazing if I did. It's a clean scent, and has sort of a beachy vibe to it, which is pleasant. I definitely smell salt and sandalwood on the dry down. They are the prominent notes, so it's appropriately named. I get a touch of citrus, maybe a little amber and musk, mayyybe a hint of vanilla, but that's kind of a stretch. I basically smell like I'm having a gin and tonic w lime at the beach, and was recently canoodling with a well groomed gentleman. I don't dislike it, but it's not for me.

Edit: The dry down was reminding me of something, I just couldn't place it, but now I have. Salt by Ellis Brooklyn. If you want something like this that actually is unisex and has a similar vibe, minus the aftershave accord, I'd recommend trying it!

I found that after an hour or so, this settled down to something much more like Salt. Still slightly more masculine, but far better and more unisex than the opening. I think I am getting a touch of florals now. I think it's mostly the rose? I'd still never buy this for myself because of its other side, but it's nice. That was on my skin. On my shirt, it still smells quite masculine, but has lasted longer.",02/13/23 01:26,candi_n_spice
Sel Santal Clean,"Well blended fruity sandalwood! This is a really cool unisex scent, with all kinds of interesting notes, but still quite crowd pleasing.

Sel Santal Clean,"I made the mistake of buying this upon only smelling it on paper. The top notes are feminine leaning but when that goes away it becomes definitely masculine to my nose. This smells amazing on a man. Picture your office crush who looks like he smells good (and actually does). Clean yet striking but still approachable. And even after a hectic work day, he still smells good. Salty, aquatic, woody and creamy in one bottle. This doesn't smell like Santal 33 to me and I don't get the sour pickle vibes at all.",01/13/23 23:10,Angelasaurus
Sel Santal Clean,"I drink a lemonade walking on the beach at sunset; here and there lie wet pieces of drifted sandal wood and algae, a salty breeze brings fresh floral-fruity aromas from the gardens and orange orchards on the coast. I run my fingers through the sand and can almost taste this beautifully scented air...",11/12/22 08:33,Venusia
Sel Santal Clean,"This notes list is a hot mess express. They took everything that ever sounded good and just wrote it down and ran with it never mind what’s actually in this scent cause I guarantee you not even half of them are in here at all in any of their molecular forms. I get two things that pull concurrently in this scent but never really blend together cohesively. Those two things are men’s aftershave or some sort of abrasive (and cheap) fougere we’re accustomed to associating with men, and pickle juice. The pickle juice note must be sandalwood. I’ve heard that scents could pull this way on certain chemistries and I never doubted them I just never thought mine was one of them.

I get a delicious leather (albeit overpowering) in Santal 33. I love fragrances like Santal Blush, Samsara in all it’s concentrations and most recently Santal Massoia from Hermes, none of which I get a pickle smell from. I get the salty accord as well which only adds to the briny affect on my skin, but what I find most intriguing is that it doesn’t repulse me. I’ve tried seaweed fragrances that haunt my nightmares. A fragrance by Balenciaga that contains a pea note is what I imagine the demons in my own personal Hell would pump through the vents. I’ve had my fair share of trying perfumes that have reduced to celery water after poor storage. Pickles are a first for me, and I’m not running for the hills.

I wish there was more fig, or some of those other delicious notes that are in the pyramid but I accept Sel Santal for what she is as well as what she isn’t. Is it neurotic that I’m considering a travel spray of this? I’ll play with this sample some more, gladly.

Edit: after I finished writing that review I kept getting whiffs of something that was so savory I could at first only think it was food I was smelling. Was it my husband reheating leftover pepperoni pizza? Did someone order cheeseburgers with extra pickles? No, it was my perfume. I don’t know what it is about this scent that not only smells of pickles, it also begins to smell like warm cheese, probably due to how it reacts on warm skin. It’s still not entirely repulsive but way too weird and not what I’m going for in a perfume that others might smell, and I’m definitely smelling on myself. Hard pass.",09/27/22 19:46,Aland2020
Sel Santal Clean,"Definitely more masculine. The combination of sour and salty is reading as STANKY FEET to me. Very little, if any sandalwood, no spice, and certainly no whipped cream. Fades to a soft, generic, men’s cologne scent. It’s a no for me dawg.",08/13/22 09:10,mandalynnwin
Sel Santal Clean,"to me, sel santal is the more interesting and fun cousin of santal 33. it's more aromatic and complex, and definitely more masculine-leaning. it's very classy and almost aquatic- smells like you just went to the barber shop then stopped at a flashy new bar for a G&T. i like decently on myself, but i'm sure it would smell amazing on a wide variety of people!

EDIT- the drydown smells pretty minty/herby!",08/03/22 13:16,aweso10

Crisp bergamot, w/ a salty twist, woody notes combined w/ a subtle florals, especially violet create a very pleasing easy dumb reach for any guy. The whipped cream and hazelnut are very subtle in this, lending a subtle sweetness and creaminess to a very fresh and aromatic woody floral masculine fragrance. This would be a good everyday fragrance for any guy to wear and could be a signature. Very pleasing and a good performer w/out being overpowering.",05/26/22 13:35,LSAUG
Sel Santal Clean,"I'm pleasantly surprised by this one from the discovery set...in the initial spray, I swear I get a hit of saffron which could simply be that 'tonic water' note. I honestly am not getting the Santal 33 comparisons, the sandalwood is not the main star in this fragrance on my skin. There's an aquatic citrus vibe that predominates throughout. All this being said, pleasant fragrance but much like other Clean Reserves it disappears on my skin pretty quickly. Shame about the longevity on these.

Next day edit: okay I sprayed this again a day later and I'm getting a much more masculine vibe overall today. I suddenly think I'll give this to my boyfriend (lol!)",05/16/22 23:41,asg6

Sel Santal Clean,"It's not bad, but if one's looking for a Santal 33 dupe there are better and cheaper alternatives. Otherwise... Clean Sel Santal has that aromatic vaguely pickle-ish sandalwood note with a dusty wooden pantry full of various herbs. Smells like a spa and aromatherapy scent, or Sam's Club Member's Mark Italian Herb grilled chicken breast.",04/20/22 18:11,boozya
Sel Santal Clean,"To me, this is a pretty good alternative of Santal 33, only this is much green/woody/sharper and lacks some of the sweet softness and complexity Santal 33 has. If you can layer scents well, you can get a similar effect easily using this scent. Personally, I love layering this with Bronze Goddess Eau Fraiche (not the EDP) to get more layers of warm sandalwood and coconut to this. If you try this combo, spray Santal first, then spray about 2/3 as much of Bronze Goddess on top. Divine. If it had a bit more leather and papyrus, I'm not sure I'd be able to tell the difference between this mix and Santal 33.

The same main notes dominate both Sel Santal and Santal 33 with the immediately recognizable sandalwood, though I’m still unsure if this distinct scent is the result of a note blend, a specific type of sandalwood, or if the fragrance is synthetic. I never smelled this type of sandalwood before in my life until a decade ago, in Los Angeles, when suddenly every 20 something began wearing the same scent. Though if you asked any of them what perfume they were wearing, they’d claim that they designed it themselves at one of those diy perfume oil counters. Recently I picked up a “santal” scented candle while shopping. I fell down a rabbit hole searching the web about the scent. Reluctant to blind buy such a high priced bottle, and unsure if I wanted to smell like half the people I meet, I ended up grabbing this instead. I found the scent refreshing and I felt like it grew on me more over time.

Both 33 and Sel Santal aren’t anything like sandalwood I’ve known for my entire life. They are GREEN. Like the scent actually smells like it’s the color green. It isn’t the deep smoky sandalwood of incense, or the grandpas cologne crisp and musky sandalwood. In Sel Santal, it’s citrus and peppery, in Santal 33 it's that but also somewhat milky. When I smell either scent, I think of limes and a faint woody dried coconut shell, or driftwood on the beach, maybe with a touch of cucumber and some sexy sort of spice. Instead of grandpas musk, these make me think of fresh sweet white musk. Other people get pickles and plastic. Predominantly, they’re very similar and most people won’t know the difference if you’re wearing this, unless they have excellent noses and wear Santal 33 regularly. Even then, one might write off the variation as one's distinct body chemistry.

I find Clean Reserves note lists to feel a bit off for the scents I’ve owned. This opens with the strong “lime” woody note, which I think is actually a combination of the sandalwood and violet, with some bergamot/citrus pepperiness. It’s mostly just that. If you smell close, you can pick out some more florals, almost get a faint cucumber water touch, then something I guess is the cream, lurking deep under to try to soften and sweeten this up. But it fails to come off as creamy, ultimately I don’t find this to be a sweet scent at all, and I wish there was some coconut, vanilla, or more amber in this to smooth it out and warm it up. I can’t smell the tonic exactly but I did think this gave bubbly cocktail gin vibes without seeming alcoholic. I’m not getting any of the fruit, nutmeg, or others, which is disappointing as I hoped for some rich spice.

I consider Sel Santal unisex, mostly due to the fact I was introduced to this fragrance when it was worn by a woman, but it would definitely be too cologne-like and masculine for some women's taste.

Besides Bronze Goddess Eau Fraiche, layering with jasmine femme-s this up nicely, I prefer wearing with jasmine body oil. I know there are people that don’t consider this a warm or summery scent, as it feels a bit winter cologne-like, but it’s actually versatile and can be worn all year, especially if you layer.

I also bought Cremo’s Palo Santo EDP and it is also “in this family,” even though it claims to be Palo Santo, and doesn’t have any florals. It’s somehow still a typical Santal fragrance. It doesn't have any creamy, spicy, or flowery notes like Santal 33 or this one, so it comes off as about 20% more masculine and is $20 a bottle. It smells great, and it’s a beast, so if you’re looking for a better bargain that’s more masculine, grab that one.",03/23/22 18:24,wondervalley666
Sel Santal Clean,"Initially i get salty herbal citrus with a faint background juiciness from the fig. The fig is kind of overtaken by the citrus. There isn't much sweetness here, it's kind of salty-sour. Fresh and uplifting, almost makes me think of laundry detergent or soap. The florals are faintly present if you look for them. I don't get any whipped cream or hazelnut. The woody notes are pleasant and don't really steal the show.

I'd say this is pretty unisex. I wouldn't say i'm in love with it but i certainly don't find it offensive.",03/02/22 19:29,twoski

Sel Santal Clean,This reminds me more of men's perfumes;it smells marine-like/aquatic but also kinda sour which I dislike. It reminds me of Acqua di Gio Profondo but I think Profondo smells way better. I wore this on me and let it sit a while but I didn't get any creaminess nor did I get floral notes. It's not the worst scent or something but it isn't good either.,02/08/22 13:36,wenshere
Sel Santal Clean,"I have this, Maison Louis Marie No. 4, a small decant of Santal 33, and several other Santal 33 clones/dupes. I don't understand how Sel Santal is anywhere similar to what Santal 33 smells like; while MLM No. 4 and the S33 clones/dupes are very close to the OG in terms of being leathery, earthy, and somewhat herbal, Sel Santal, at least to my nose, smells sweet, creamy, and salty, with a faint background of woods and musk.

I can pick up the bergamot and nutmeg on initial spritz, and then definitely the hazelnut, whipped cream, and some of the fig once it dries down. The vibe is very different from S33. This smells quite bright to me and might work for warmer days, while S33 and its variants are definitely more appropriate for sweater weather.

I love wearing this on its own, but I also enjoy layering it with SJP Stash. They work very well together as they both smell quite comforting.",02/05/22 07:37,elaremuyser
Sel Santal Clean,"I wasn't expecting to, but I really like this fragrance. On my skin, I am experiencing a woody musky fragrance with a touch of citrus. I really don't feel like you can describe any Clean fragrances as ""strong."" Maybe at the initial spray. But once it dries down, Clean fragrances become either a light scent or a skin scent. This one goes pretty light, which makes it even more lovely to wear. I don't think I would buy a huge bottle of this, but it is travel spray worthy in my opinion. Sel Santal is a great day time fragrance that can be worn all year round.",02/03/22 03:53,mrsoutlaw
Sel Santal Clean,"Does anyone else think this smells a bit smoky? Like a flannel shirt the morning after a bonfire . . .
Anyways, this is one of my favorite fragrances in my collection. The sandalwood is front and center, and the fig and fresh/citrus notes complement it nicely. I can't smell the hazelnut, whipped cream, or rose AT ALL (fine by me), and the rest of the notes sort of fade into the background. My favorite part is the salt, which gives the fragrance an almost savory quality, which might be what makes me think of a bonfire. Projection and longevity are nothing crazy, but more than adequate for everyday wear. It does smell a bit masculine to me, but I don't mind. My one and only complaint is that I wish the fig was a bit more prominent, but I think layering with Diptyque's Philosykos or Demeter's Fig Leaf will easily fix that. I will definitely be getting a full bottle when I finish my travel size.",01/16/22 13:52,sodalite

Sel Santal Clean,"I’m one of the people that gets straight up dill pickles from Santal 33 the entire wear. I did get that with this on the opening but it faded or I went anosmic to it after about 10 mins and I could actually enjoy the sandalwood. I’m not getting any of the other notes except for a bit of salt and iris maybe. So the name is very accurate. It’s straightforward sandalwood and salt. It’s a foggy autumn morning in an old cottage on the beach. A simple, mature, understated, masculine-leaning fragrance.",11/10/21 05:06,jessr777
Sel Santal Clean,"Don’t get the flowers, nuts or whipped cream. It’s tart, salty, woody and masculine leaning. I’m all for wearing gender bending perfume but, this doesn’t connect with me. Am I crazy or is there vetiver and aftershave-like smell in this?

Sel Santal Clean,I have to say it leans more masculine. I am used to unisex or bit masculin scents but this one i had to give to my husband. He liles it and i like it on him too. But it was strange on me. The beginning is salty more like an after shave and it dries down to a woody pickely scent. I do not smell the florals at all nor the nuts or the whipped cream. It is nice but definitely not a blind buy.,10/23/21 07:23,proscarabeus
Sel Santal Clean,"I'm a bit disappointed that I get absolutely no whipped cream. I get a touch of masculine shaving cream perhaps, but no edible whipped cream. I don't get much violet and iris, either. I definitely get salt and sandalwood, exactly as the name says, but not many of the supporting notes with the exception of fig and tonic water. I do smell some green fig, which may smell more green due to the tonic water accord. To me this starts out masculine, slightly wood polish-y, then dries down to a softer scent. It's not a love for me, just a like, and I find myself wanting to layer it with a simple vanilla, such as Comptior Sud Pacifique's Vanille Intense, because I am wishing for the creaminess that I should be getting according to the listed notes. It does last well- 8 hours or so. I would wear it casually in the daytime, as it is not elegant.",09/16/21 09:23,christinky

It leans more masculine to me, especially in the opening, in the dry down it’s more unisex.

Sel Santal Clean,"Another blind buy for me. It is very different from my expectations. But I really like the juice, though. :)

I expected to get a sandalwood scent, but to my nose, salt, fig, violet and amber are more prominent than sandalwood. Maybe the sandalwood in this one is more fresh and green than what I've used to.

However, I think the scent is quite different and original, and fresh and pleasant, too. Definitely a keeper for me.",02/19/21 11:44,calculus

Sel Santal Clean,"A coarser blend of Santal 33 with even more synthetic smelling ingredients.

I'm not Santal 33's biggest fan but I moderately like the fragrance and can tolerate the scent. This one straight up gives me a headache from start to finish.

I highly recommend Byredo Gypsy Water or Diptyque Tam Dao if you want a sandalwood fragrance that doesn't smell like a fistful of aromachemicals slapped together.",12/28/19 23:21,17seyed
Sel Santal Clean,"I tried this from a Birch Box sample. This struck me as very chemically, especially considering how natural it apparently is. At times it was rather astringent.

I highly recommend giving Sel Santal a sniff!!",01/15/19 05:40,HighCountryEsq
Sel Santal Clean,"Clean Sel Santal was a blind buy which was a bit out of the norm because I typically only blind buy gourmands. Though it wasn’t exactly as expected, I actually like it quite a bit. Upon initial blast, it does smell very masculine (absolutely not a bad thing) and fairly medicinal. As the fragrance starts to warm on the skin, it becomes deeper and more inviting; to me, cozy. The drydown had me stumped at first because it reminded me of something and I just couldn’t place it. Then I figured it out- MINT TEA!!!!! It literally smells like a hot cup of mint tea and besides it smelling nice, there’s something nostalgic about it, like the memory of sipping mint tea on a cold, rainy winter night. I can see this being a fragrance one would wear during the summer, but I will wear this in the winter. It’s not my favorite among the CLEAN line (amber saffron holds that place), but I definitely like it and if you like fragrances which are sharp and herbal, you should enjoy this!",12/16/18 00:27,amarelumene

Sel Santal Clean,"I usually stick with perfumes like Light Blue and all the Armani code fragrances. This perfume is so different from my norm, but something about it has made it my ultimate favorite fragrance. It is def unisex, but I promise you won't smell like you're wearing a man's perfume. It's so strange but in a good way and you'll want to keep sniffing your arm. I especially love the smell after the first 20 minutes. I'm all about the Sandalwood. I agree with a few comments here. One that in summer it smells like the best beach perfume ever and another person commented that it smells like you spent time at your bf's fancy apartment and showered with his expensive sandalwood soap -couldn't agree more. Many many people have given me a hug or within close proximity have commented ""oh my god, you smell amazing!"". I love how I can wear this perfume any time of the year both morning or night.

I've never been impressed by many of the Clean range but I reaaaallly like this one.

Sel Santal Clean,At first spritz Sel Santal is almost a perfect dupe for Santal 33 but that quickly fades and the sandalwood gets a little softer and cleaner than Santal 33 (IMO).

There's something of a shaving cream scent to this but it's absolutely addictive. It has an interesting evolution. It starts a masculine and bit harsh, but it mellows into a clean powder with bits of spice. Lovely.

At first it might smell like a modern masculine fragrance but you just have to wait for the magic to happen.
After the harsh initial notes disappear, you are left with a calm, slightly powdery and clean/green scent. Sandalwood persist all the way.",08/02/17 20:47,esteban747

This will not annoy anybody. Smells so nice, more expensive than it actually is. Doesn't cause my sensitive mother a headache. What inspired me to buy this, was my neighbor, a woman in her 50s. She told me that she enjoys these scents a week ago. I really wanted a light scent to accompany my La Vie Est Belle Vanilla Nude. This is just fantastic. The bottle is so cute.

I find it redundant for the line. With this one you get a molecular, inoffensive peach scent that is almost identical to Liis Studied. I had tried Radiant Nectar first, and already thought it was very similar to Studied, but this one is also almost the same to my nose. I've also seen it compared to Floating, which I had a remaining sample for. To me, Floating is softer, and not as similar. But all these fragrances have the same vibe. They are all inoffensive, nice, clean scents to wear when you don't want a loud fragrance, like for appointments or bedtime.",09/17/25 09:54,tanss
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"If you like Liis Floating but it doesn't last on you, try this! It's very similar. The main difference is that it's not quite as fresh/sheer smelling since it doesn't have the linen note that Floating does. It's still very much a skin scent like Liis but this one's not as airy.

It’s such a beautiful scent, it reminds me abit of the erba pura this super fruity scent profile with the only difference being this peach note that’s so addicting. Right after dowsing myself in this I went to Canada post to pick up a package and one worker in shoppers told me I smelled really good and one of them asked I write it down on a piece of paper.

That boosted my likeness to this scent even more cause I’m guessing others can find that it smells really good. It lasts and projects for about 2 hours but it dies down to a skin scent at 2/3 hours after spraying.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"i do not get blackcurrant or peach from this (radiant nectar smells exactly like this but way more fruity, to me), i also don't particularly get sweet, but it is a very nice white musk on my skin. it's definitely overwhelming and a little synthetic at first but settles down fast and lasts all day with a pleasantly warm scent and a hint of fruit. i've been in the early stages of getting into perfumes and this is the first one that i've really felt suits me and that one day i might want a full bottle in my collection. makes me feel older and more capable somehow, kind of my girlboss confidence scent. i wore this to a job interview and then got the job.

not sure why majority vote places this as a spring/summer scent because it's very fall/winter to me, a rich perfume that is nowhere near light and airy enough for a warm day, but maybe that's just my personal taste and also the fact that there is minimal fruit when this hits my skin.",04/25/25 06:37,flutes
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I got this in the sampling kit that also came with “Skin (Reserve)” for my birthday and I was excited to try it.
The name is a honest description of what this thing smells like, it’s a way too bright blinding artificial sugar that really snaps at your nose. Prepare yourself to smell this fragrance if you want to try it.
I’m being a bit dramatic but this is a very mediocre scent, the blackcurrant hits your nose first being carried by the musk and if you stick around for a little, you’ll also smell the peach!
This perfume brand gives me very “Organic” perfume, and this one to me does not fit into their branding. It gives very much Pink Sugar on a budget or a body spray mean’t for a toddler, not shade to either of those but this one didn’t hit me quite right.

i could see someone really liking this, as long as this texture of musk is your thing. i think it's pretty nice for a sweet, fruity skin scent, not offensive, not overpowering, not too sweet",03/27/25 06:49,n8super
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Smells like a tart peach, and the peach's skin, with sugar sprinkled on it. Like if I Want Choo and Glossier You had a baby.

I don't know why there are so many votes for moderate sillage... this sits SO close to the skin for me, but again this is my first time wearing her out. I even went a little overboard on my sprays because I know clean fragrances tend to be subtle. I guess I was just expecting a little more than *this much* subtlety?? Aka you smell it maybe inches away or holding your wrist directly up to your nose. I definitely need to try her more but idk. Will update.

Update: actively giving her another shot… sillage is better than previously described. I’d say it’s fittingly moderate. Perhaps I had gone noseblind before. This is pretty nice. Longevity and sillage are pretty good for a Clean frag!

But as it dried down I keep getting wafts of it and it smells like glossier you to me. It may have something to do with what perfumers use for ambrette and musk, maybe they’re similar raw materials? Maybe they interact with my skin that way? Honestly, I’m 42 and love it. I don’t think it’s too young at all.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"The peach and white musk blend seamlessly, for a somewhat caramelized fruitiness. Meanwhile, the musk and black currant also blend seamlessly, creating between them a sort of fizzy-fuzzy, effervescent woodiness.

Peach can often be syrupy and cloying as a fragrance note, but the blackcurrant and musk lighten things up with their dry, fuzzy crispness, turning the entire composition transparent and light.

It's like a dessert of peach slices sprinkled with warm brown sugar, accompanied by a bottle of crisp champagne. The table is decorated with a vase of blackcurrant clippings, but the woody-green pong of their leaves remains thankfully mild.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"i don’t normally gravitate towards peach scents, but as a white musk enjoyer, this left me with a newfound appreciation for fruity scents. if you’re looking for a perfume that carries peach shower gel vibes outside the shower, give this a try.

initially sprayed, i get peach scented oxyclean. but once that wears off, you’re left with a pleasant fruity scent. definitely peachy, but i also catch something tropical— maybe coconut or pineapple? whatever it is, it evaporates early on, turning into an impressively realistic peach scent, like you just took a bite out of the stone fruit. this is also where the white musk really shines— clean, sweet, alhdehydically powdery, a touch salty. the scent doesn’t project much, but i think that’s a great choice for a scent like this, as it could become overwhelmingly fruity. great longevity imo, definitely fades quicker on the skin but incredibly long lasting on fabrics, more than i would ever expect from a scent that sits close to the skin. i wouldn’t say this is a safe blind buy. it’s not particularly offensive, but i could see some perceiving the fruity scent as juvenile.

i don’t think the comparisons to glossier you are accurate. the only overlap i detect is in the white musk, but the similarities really end there. reserve’s white musk reminds me of you’s ambrox+ambrette+iris combo. sparkling sugar is all fruit, bright, unwaveringly sweet while you is woodsy, earthy, floral pink pepper. essentially, sparkling sugar is a fruity take on clean reserve skin.

this scent isn’t for me, at least not as a perfume. i’ve used most of my sample up on my sheets and the peach white musk base notes have been really pleasant to wake up to.",01/02/25 07:41,teasleeves

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"No pear? Really? To me this smells just like Ariana Grande's G is a woman. Sparkling pear. Very sweet and fruity. I don't really get the sugar thing. I could not wear this, too sweet for my taste and doesn't have the Clean vibe.",11/04/24 07:17,sarage
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Sweet in a somewhat watery manner, sort of like those early 00's clean fruity fragrances. Has an undertone of something hospital-esque - a bit too clean, perhaps.",11/03/24 21:16,hexed
Sparkling Sugar Clean,I like the scent and all its aspects but it just leans a little too sweet for me. The peach really comes through and I think that's great. Combined with something really fresh or spicy it might be perfect.,10/18/24 14:18,yepnoodles
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"The smell was fine - I liked it enough to try it on my skin - but it was headache-inducing, as many fruity and sweet perfumes are for me.",10/14/24 16:15,hstase
Sparkling Sugar Clean,Peachy and sugary sweet. This reminds me a picnic on the set on Pride and Prejudice just after rain. A nice lakefront gazebo and frilly white dresses. Perfect for spring and summer.,10/06/24 14:46,caulicake
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I wear this when I'm on vacation, usually in a tropical setting, and it lasts all day... projection is not crazy but if anyone is within 3 feet of me, they can smell it. It's sugary but not too sweet that it becomes cloying. It's an easy throw on. It gives off ""catching a whiff of your sweet and fruity shampoo after a shower.""",10/04/24 11:18,Akayyyy
Sparkling Sugar Clean,I get musky pear. That’s about it. Poof it’s gone. On the positive side the pear is very juicy (yes I know pear isn’t a note but that’s how it reads to me.) it’s pleasant and would be easy to wear.,09/30/24 19:15,Goldena35

Sparkling Sugar Clean,Initially I get a note of the most lovely refreshing juicy pear with a sweet sparkle. But ten seconds later I'm totally nose blind. It doesn't matter how much/little I put on on skin or clothes. I smell nothing. Identical to how my senses work with JHAG Pear inc. I'm so sad over this because what I catch initially from both these perfumes is sooo beautiful. I'm happy for those of you who can smell it.,08/16/24 11:01,Kayleebreeze

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This is an easy to wear, everyday scent you can wear to the gym, groceries or picking up kids. Heck, I even wore this to work(healthcare setting) and it does not offend anyone. In fact, I have gotten compliments on this scent. It's sweet but not too sweet, subtly pleasant whispery type of scent. I wear it whenever I am in the mood for easy softer fragrance.",07/20/24 11:13,Jeongh01
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I was pleasantly surprised by this perfume. I often anticipate ""sugar"" notes to be gourmand/musky burnt sugar, but this was very light and fruity, like a fizzy fruit soda. I smelled sweet pear notes predominantly. This perfume sits very close to the skin and has poor staying power. I could detect it on my clothes for maybe 15-20 minutes before it completely disappeared. Enjoyable scent, but wouldn't be worth a purchase for me.",07/18/24 19:39,GinkgoLeaf
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I purchased a Clean discovery set at Marshall's earlier today, and I think I like this scent the best out of the bunch! It's a very fresh and pleasant fruity floral fragrance that's not overtly juvenile, much like Ariana Grande's Ari but sweeter and more berry-forward. Unfortunately, the scent is incredibly faint and barely there. It fades so fast that I won't consider purchasing a larger size, and I'll just stick with my beloved Ari.",07/08/24 10:31,nicole.3
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I had a small sample of this a little while back and I really enjoyed it. It was the perfect mixture of a sweet but fresh and clean scent, despite sugar being in the name. I do wish it had more moderate sillage on me as I found it sat very close to my skin and didn't last as long as I would've hoped. I do think as a daily scent I would enjoy this however when I'm looking for a scent that isn't too strong or powerful.",07/07/24 20:34,mbel
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This smells like dish soap.

The berries are very prominent, and there is a faint musk in the background. Super simple, sweet and fruity scent. It’s a scent profile that should be super safe.

But there’s something synthetic about it that reminds me of Victoria’s Secret fragrances. It also has a very effervescent quality that I normally love in fragrances, but here it makes it very soapy in a dish soap kind of way, not a fresh and clean way. So screechy and annoying.

Projection is almost nonexistent. 2 hours into wear, the dish soap smell subsides a bit and it becomes better, but the overall longevity is poor.",07/05/24 23:52,hnk11
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Whatever is in this fragrance is what is in Arianna Grande’s Thank U, Next, Le Monde Gourmand’s

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This fragrance is very sweet and fruity, yet clean smelling at the same time! Makes you smell like you just had a shower with fruity body wash or shampoo.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,Smells like a peach dipped in sugar. Very sweet and musky. It is a skin scent though. No sillage or projection. It's VERY similar to Radiant Nectar,06/16/24 14:11,cunt.dracula
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"At first I could barely smell this on myself. A squirt to the wrist wasn’t enough to get any sort of impression. My hand cream was stronger! So I did a couple on the arms, and a couple inside my shirt. I still need to get up close to my skin to detect notes. My initial read is light, faintly fruity (but I wouldn’t have guessed peach without help), fluffy and soft. On the dry-down I get the white musk which mostly smells like pencils on me. (BBW Musk no. 2 is straight no. 2 pencils and nothing else to my mind). Someone described it as shampoo, and I would put it in that category. I get zero sugar sadly. I mean, no cotton candy or gourmand notes like I hoped from reading the name. This is a snuggly fragrance, like it will be cozy to those who give you a hug since it is not too strong.",06/10/24 17:58,curlycomedy

Sparkling Sugar Clean,i love a good sickeningly sweet scent but this smells sour on me :(,05/28/24 16:42,mynutsackhangs
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"sometimes it smells precisely like *sparkling* sugar, a bright, vibrant sweetness, walking near the line of sickening, but never crossing it.

sometimes the peach note on my skin sours, like fruity notes tend to do with me.

sometimes, when i overspray on a second-day unshowered skin, the peach turns bitter, pouty, resentful, rotting. i love that aspect more.

never feel the synthetic musk base tho, the pre-diabetic sweetness just never evaporates on me.

not particularly complicated, fun warm weather scent. not gonna repurchase, but am enjoying my travel size bottle very much.",05/28/24 05:14,henderson_the_rain_king
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Sweet, fruity cotton candy, but very soft. I like it, probably won't buy a full bottle but maybe a travel spray.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I actually really like this fragrance despite how soft it is. I tend to prefer strong, powerful perfumes. This is slightly fruity and sweet, but in a refreshing way. I do wish it projected a little more. I received a sample, and will likely be purchasing a full-size so I can douse myself in it. Lol Is it a new mind-blowing favorite? No. Is it worthy of adding to my collection? Yes.",05/01/24 08:38,kntmomma

Sparkling Sugar Clean,This reminds me of Meliora from PDM!!! It’s so good!!!,04/21/24 15:51,AG2330
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Happy, bright, sweet, fruity, feminine, and overall just a pretty fragrance! This surprisingly reminds me of Clean Reserve Radiant Nectar, especially in the opening. I really agree with how another reviewer had described it… that Sparkling Sugar has more of a Berry peach white sugar scent and Radiant Nectar has more of a pear brown sugar scent. As it dries down I notice a softly musky, warm, and subtle woodsy scent as well. There’s this warm and comfortable feel to it too that’s rather nostalgic for some reason. I get the same thing with Radiant Nectar and B&BW Chasing Fireflies. I also agree with the reviewer below me, that it’s a sweet and fruity fragrance for the clean girl aesthetic.

I find this to be just an overall pretty fragrance! Something that’s easy to reach for, uplifting, and inoffensive. I love the nostalgic feel of this, it’s somehow comforting because of it. It would work really well for at the office because it is a softer fragrance, but it also lasts really well on me.",04/17/24 16:20,Shimmer412
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Smells like a fruity/sugary version of Glossier You in the dry down, but very similar to Ellis Brooklyn Sweet in the opening. I wouldn't consider this a gourmand. It's a fruity fragrance for the clean girl aesthetic.",04/16/24 11:03,noneya88
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Reserve Sparkling Sugar (notes from Clean's website):
- Top: Cassis berries, Ambrette Seeds
- Middle: Peach Nectar, Jasmine Petals, Pink Sugar
- Dry Down: White Musk, Tonka Bean, Blond Woods

Isn't as complex as the listed notes suggest. It also reminds me of a fragrance mist from Bath and Body Works but quite a bit more expensive with worse longevity and sillage.",04/02/24 13:22,Norie
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This is a great spring/summer perfume for people who love fruity gourmands. It is bright and zesty and the word “sparkling” definitely describes the overall feeling of the scent.

The sillage and lasting power on this perfume surprise me. It is a light, intimate scent but one that I can smell on myself all day long. I’ll get a whiff of peach even 6+ hours after spraying.

I got it in a tester and will be buying a small bottle for the spring/summer. Definitely not a fall or winter scent.",03/31/24 12:14,Jnh_fm
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Reserve Sparkling Sugar has the same fruity opening as Reserve Radiant Nectar, mixed with the aquatic musk from Reserve Skin. Radiant Nectar has a woody (pencil shavings) type of musk which smells so harsh and bitter on my skin, and that's the reason I can't wear it. Sparkling Sugar has the best parts from Radiant Nectar, but it's a lot fresher and a bit juicier and sweeter. Sparkling Sugar dries down to a subtle sweetness with fruity nuances. It's inoffensive and easy to wear. It's a so called dumb reach for everyday. It works anyday, anytime, for any occasion.

The longevity is surprisingly good, I get 6-7 hours on my skin, and it lasts forever on clothes. Moderate projection. It's not my favorite fragrance, but I really like it, and it's one of those easy reaches that never fails.

7.5/10.",03/31/24 10:50,Nina Eli
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I found a 100ml bottle for $50 at Marshall's, it was actually a blind buy. I LOVE this frag. It's sweet and fruity at first, but quickly turns into a soapy, aldehydic, pleasant skin scent. It doesn't throw super far, which makes it a great ""every day, wear anywhere"" fragrance. The longevity is actually great for the price point. I can still smell it on my skin at the end of the day.

I usually don't like aldehydes, but the sugar accord and fruitiness softens it quite a bit. I'm hooked.",03/25/24 14:20,Jenronzello
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"When I first tried Sparkling Sugar all I could think of was Clean Reserve's Radiant Nectar. It felt so close in memory that I could have sworn they were nearly identical. As the day wore on it started to feel less and less like Radiant Nectar and like a sweet Dylan Purple. Eventually the sweetness dies down and I swear it smells nearly identical to Dylan Purple.

I tested out spraying the 3 and I have to say Sparkling Sugar and Radiant Nectar feel like similar DNA - though Sparkling more like a berry peach white sugar, and Nectar more like a pear brown sugar. Nectar keeps the sweet brown sugarness on the die-down for me, while Sparkling Sugar is more of a fruity musk that almost entirely matches Dylan Purple.

I think my biggest frustration with all 3 is that they're so short lasting. Sparkling Sugar seems like the best preforming for me, but even then I'm getting 3-4 hours if I do some heavy-handed spraying. Radiant Nectar seems to last 2-3 hours, and Dylan Purple lasts a hilarious 30minutes to an hour max. I have fairly oily skin which holds perfume pretty well so I was pretty surprised at the poor performance of all 3. The sillage is pretty close to the skin and intimate, which I don't mind, but could see it being frustrating combined with the poor longevity.

Overall I'm happy and am keeping the bottle, and would highly recommend to anyone who loves Dylan Purple but is frustrated they can't even get an hour out of it.",03/24/24 21:38,Kieath

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Wow, I am pleasantly surprised by this one! I don't like too much sweetness, and I figured something with ""sugar"" in the name was going to be no bueno for me, especially after its cousin Skin Reserve was too sweet for me. But it's a balanced sweetness in this case! Feels like you just had a shower with a nice fruity shampoo. I think this is a light, everyday springtime fragrance, and office friendly as it's not terribly loud. I typically prefer something more unisex, but I can see myself spritzing this on when I'm feeling femme.",03/13/24 23:04,Lothere55
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"The top notes give me hairspray vibes, similar to Versace Dylan Purple. The dry down though…beautiful. I love the ambrette blended with the tonka & blond woods. This isn’t sexy by any means, it’s very much a girl next door vibe, but if your man likes a simple sweet girly scent that isn't too strong you’ll definitely get his attention. Honestly, this is what I’d imagine a Valentino Donna Born in Roma eau de toilette to smell like. Sweet & sugary with a clean girl vibe. Highly recommend this for summer if you love Donna but you find it too thick and sweet for hot weather.",03/10/24 19:54,judearose123
Sparkling Sugar Clean,It smells like Thank U Next without the pickles!,03/10/24 18:57,MaxieF
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I'm impressed with this one! It does smell exactly like sugar to me. Not refined white sugar but unrefined sugar. I didn't like it but only because I don't like gourmand smells but If you like how sugar smells, you'll be in love!",03/09/24 17:00,BeetleButter28
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"More clean musk than anything. I’m surprised it was described by Clean as warm and spicy. Very dryer-sheet, shampoo freshness, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Peach does provide a little tang. and it is sweet, but not as sweet as the name suggests, certainly more fresh musk than candy. I’ve been combining this with Boardwalk Delight from skylar and they compliment each well- sweet and fresh for daytime. Sparkling Sugar is office-safe, if a little youthful, and could work for daytime pretty much anytime of the year, but I would say especially spring.",03/08/24 10:27,Margoose
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Smells almost exactly the same as Radiant Nectar, just a tiny bit of a lighter scent. I love both, but I prefer Radiant Nectar for its deeper and longer lasting sweetness. After a few hours, Sparkling Sugar fades to a kind of powdery sweetness whereas Radiant Nectar stays juicy and rich. You definitely only need one in your collection. Has a beautiful personal sillage but only lasts around 4 hours. In terms of perfumes listed as similar—
✔️ Ariana's God is A Woman: very similar, just a bit fainter
✔️ Versace Dylan Purple: a bit similar, but a bit more fresh
✔️ SDJ Carioca Crush: similar but more fresh
❌✔️ Glossier You: I see a resemblance ONLY after You sits for about 30 mins, but the initial dry down smells like dirty laundry on me
❌ Ariana's Thank U Next: very coconut heavy on me
❌ Ariana’s Ari: has distinct floral notes
❌ Ellis Brooklyn Sun Fruit: much more fresh and not as sweet
❌ Ellis Brooklyn Myth: much lighter and kind of gives me grandma energy
❌ Skylar Peach Fields: much lighter and less sweet
❌ Skylar Boardwalk Delight: a much more airy sweetness
❌ Parfums de Marly Meliora: fresher and has a grassy note on me
❌ Victoria’s Secret Tease Sugar Fleur: much less musky",02/22/24 19:35,anamawsity
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This is a safe blind buy if you’re ok with low silage and longevity. It’s a light, sweet, fruity scent that doesn’t have the synthetic smell you get with some sugary perfumes. I would call this the grown up version of bath and body works sprays.",02/20/24 14:33,Mellybeans0
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I tested this in the air at Sephora yesterday real quick before I left. Did not smell good. Smelled hecking weird if I’m being honest. I’ll sample it on a test strip next time, but, I wanna say this smelled like weird skin? Same thing happened with Radiant Nectar. These 2 scents are raved about in the frag comm, I gotta wonder if their Clean Reserve bottles went bad or something.",02/20/24 05:51,girldeadbug

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This has a similar lightness to it as Clean Skin, but with an added tangy fruitiness which I love. It's a bit more of an active scent than Skin -- think the sharp scent of Herbal Essence shampoo lingering on wet hair rather than the subtle warm sweetness of body butter (which is more of what Skin is to me).

I can see this working really well for younger femme folks. Reminds me a lot of Viva La Juicy (if it geared more fruity rather than floral) and Gucci Flora Gardenia.",02/18/24 12:52,snackwithtea
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"not a gourmand, despite what it says on the tin. evokes pleasant, fresh, slightly underripe fruit, like something plucked too early in springtime. it is cool and bubbly like sparkling grape juice, but it also reminds me of a high-quality shampoo. i like it, though it is nothing special. i would not have bought it at full price, but it was at tjmaxx for 30 dollars, which is great for this. lasts for a decent amount of time!",02/12/24 10:10,chloemars
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This is Radiant Nectar without the sour juicy note (which is what makes it special imo). It is beautiful and soft (too soft?) Think laundry drying sheets sprinkled with sugar. Having bought a 50 ml for the size of a travel size (a STEAL), I'll still be probably giving this one to a friend and purchasing Radiant Nectar as I like that one better. I'd say if you like Radiant Nectar, Skin, or even laundry scents, give this one a try.",02/06/24 10:39,Bit4
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"This is a very subtle, but beautiful scent. It is very sweet but not overly sweet. From beginning to end, this scent was gorgeous.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"It's fine. It's totally unsophisticated and fruity safe. Skews young and simple. It's not trying to pretend to be anything it isn't. It has a lot of dopplegangers, of the Ariana Grande variety.",01/26/24 18:34,Seens
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I reviewed this not long ago, but I have to come back again to say that this is so good that it's ruining other perfumes for me. 9 times out of 10 lately when I wear something else, I think to myself that I wish I was wearing THIS perfume instead.

The sparkly opening is already bright and beautiful, a nice balance of sweet and sour fruitiness... but that clean, powdery-sweet, musky dry down is positively ADDICTING. That's what makes this really shine to me.

It's so hard for me to find sweet/fruity scents that don't come off as juvenile (or generic, though I don't mind that as much) but this one doesn't at all. It's just... perfect. I wish the silage was better (especially for the price), but other than that I can't think of a single complaint or anything I would change. I could see this becoming my signature scent for sure.",01/26/24 13:15,whodoesyourtaxes
Sparkling Sugar Clean,Received a sample in my last Sephora order. I’ve been very into sweet/gourmand type fragrances lately so I was excited to try this but this is a sickly sweet scent. Smells more like an inexpensive body spray rather than the $110 bottle it actually is. I think I will give this to my daughter.,01/21/24 20:31,billiedenise
Sparkling Sugar Clean,It smells like it's notes. It's a very close to the skin scent. Headache inducing for me. Not a safe blind buy. (none of the clean perfumes are safe blind buys imo) dry down smells like gone off fruit,01/21/24 00:55,ShiloKiernan
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Unexpectedly love this perfume. I don’t like Skin or Radiant Nectar and typically don’t love offerings from this house. I got a free sample from Sephora and really love it as an every day, light, clean and sweet perfume. It sort of falls into the same category as Glossier You - except sweeter and fruitier. Easy to wear, light, and effortless you but better kind of smell. Kind of has a creamy spun sugar accord.",01/20/24 16:26,earlyeveningsoup
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I second that this smells nothing like cotton candy. Or sugar really. To call it a ""fresh gourmand"" is dumb.
It smells like a shower. Just clean skin, water and lightly scented floral shampoo.

Dry Down: White Musk, Tonka Bean, Blond Woods",01/19/24 15:10,MrsNicole
Sparkling Sugar Clean,This does not smell like radiant nectar. Maybe a cousin. This smells like ellis brooklyn Sunfruit. As for the comment below saying it smells like cotton candy...no. this smells good don't get me wrong but it smells nothing like cotton candy. Honestly people leave comments cause they want to help sell their declutter. Absolutely no resemblance to cotton candy.,01/09/24 19:33,MaxieF
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Sparkling sugar is Clean's fruity version of their Skin perfume - less gourmand, a little peppier! I love that this fragrance has an effervescent-ness to it - a little like a sparkling fruit juice. There's a juicy, sweet, fruity opening. Most of the fruitiness melts away after an hour or so and I'm left with a clean musk, which I enjoy because it layers very well.

This doesn't last super long and sits close to the skin. If you have Clean Reserve's Radiant Nectar, this is a little redundant in mood and occasion to warrant purchase of both. I'm wearing this in the winter, because of the ""sparkling"" quality of it - I feel like it's maybe suited to fall as well because it warms up as it sits on the skin, but it is primarily a spring/summer fragrance in my opinion.",01/08/24 10:11,emilybecca
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Cute, sweet, lighthearted. It does smell like radiant nectar just a little more “sugary”. I spritzed my tester all over but my nose could barely detect anything initially and I was pretty disappointed. This fragrance is all about the dry down. It’s still very intimate to my nose but the musky sweet dry down is comforting and pretty. I wouldn’t buy it because I need a little more oomph from my fragrances for the price point, but I bet this will be a nice one to layer with other fragrances. This wore very well on my husband too so don’t sleep on it being unisex either.",01/03/24 18:18,QueOndaGuera
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Never have I been a person to see something with the word ""sugar"" in it and think Wow! I must have this! No I would run farther away, especially for scents. My whole world view changed when I got this is as a sample. ADDICTIVE. I had to roll it all over my body I couldn't get enough. It's sweet, yet not syrupy, soft yet head turning, has a whimsical nuance of being young yet suitable for mature women. Masterpiece of fresh & gourmand like the bottle states. Who knew that was a thing? I personally see this as a spring/summer scent because it is pure sunshine and happiness. Anyways, I bought it.",12/31/23 16:07,lizziapple
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I feel like Clean's perfumes very often get the hate they don't quite deserve. Sparkling Sugar is no exception, unfortunately. It's pretty nice, fresh and sweet mood enhancer. Instead of peach I, for some reason, clearly sense pear. I agree with people saying it's pretty similar to Radiant Nectar, but, in my opinion, it's better. Cotton candy and bubblegum, it sits close to skin and reminds me of simpler times, my birthdays when I was a kid. Balloons, shiny wrappers, laughs and friends. It's a very innocent scent and it actually would work very well for a teenager. But it doesn't mean grown ups can't wear it. It's been on me the whole day and my mood definitely improved (if you, like me, suffer from season affective disorder, this is a must try to shake up the depressing greyness outside).
My main complaint about Sparkling Sugar and the reason I don't think I'll go beyond a 10ml bottle is the fact that both longevity and sillage suck. This is, indeed, a very big problem with Clean.
Overall, not a very complex yet also not a boring perfume for people who just simply want to smell nice.",12/27/23 16:40,acidgypsycat

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Sent a sample by Sephora. Not the sample I wanted, and not something I will buy. Why? Clean girl, fruity shampoo. Nothing groundbreaking but pretty. I agree with other reviews that this scent profile is easier purchased from BBW for a fraction of the price. Furthermore, it reminds me of Si Passione, which I had and liked, but didn’t love. However, it’s a nice and safe scent to gift to a young lady.",12/12/23 08:15,TexasOrangeBlossom
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I feel like whether or not you like this one is going to be heavily dependent on how the musk in this reacts to your skin. For me this is a wonderful fruity musk that doesn’t smell overly synthetic or shampoo like, and I get wafts of it still an insanely long time after I apply it (I’m talking I put it on before bed yesterday at 11p and I got wafts of this over my sotd at around 7p today once I started moving around and my body heated up a bit) but I just KNOW that it will smell synthetic on some people and it probably won’t perform well on a lot of people either. Basically this isn’t one you should try to blind buy, get a sample or a decant/travel spray and actually wear it for a day or two before you decide. I would advise that for every fragrance but ESPECIALLY anything from this brand.

This also layers amazingly over top of so many fragrances, I’ve layered this with gentle fluidity gold, La belle, vanilla 28, CR Skin, br540 (regular and extrait) and a few other random vanillas I have samples of and it’s smelled great EVERY TIME. I think this may very well turn into my signature scent",12/04/23 21:03,HoneyRum

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I have this in a travel size bottle. I have worn it a couple times, including today to go run errands and on a run then brunch. I will give it credit, I can still smell it on myself, about 5-6 hours in. I experience it as a sweet musky perfume. I struggle with the musk notes in Clean Reserve, so I would not purchase a full bottle of this. I also cannot differentiate this from Skin. I could quite literally copy and paste this review for Skin.",12/02/23 13:17,RachelPhd
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Very similar to Radiant Nectar - I would sample both and pick one if you’re a fan of these types of fragrances.

Sparkling sugar is just that - super refreshing and juicy with a soft and fuzzy musky dry down. The opening is almost a thirst quenching effect - like a sugary peach cocktail in the summer time.

I personally find this very pleasant and playful. Fun to smell! Great for every day - it doesn’t stray far from the skin. Leans more summer/spring to me, but could easily be worn all the time.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I’m not the biggest fan of this line, but this perfume is gorgeous! Sugary peach but not overly sweet, I completely adore it.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"omg. This is the Italian villa summertime romance scent of my dreams; musky, heady, dripping with sugar, intimate. This smells EXACTLY like a sophisticated, adult version of Bath and Body Works’ “Pretty as a Peach”. I have always wanted that to exist.",11/25/23 10:11,Jasmine7
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"So glad to have gotten this as a free sample; this is a sugary candy smell done just right for my tastes! It's fresh and bright, not at all heavy. I almost get hints of citrus? Probably a little sour note from the peach if I had to guess. It's a fun, happy-go-lucky kind of scent, then turns into a gorgeous, sweet powdery skin scent after ~5 hours. Personally I think it'd be great in cold or warm weather.

I have a lot of trouble with sweet, candy-like scents, but this one doesn't read medicinal or juvenile at all to me, both of which tend to happen. I initially thought this wasn't a scent I'd pay full price for, but... I absolutely cannot stop wearing it. If I couldn't find a deal, I would absolutely pay the price, even if I'd hate myself for it lol. It's just that pretty!

(edit: take Glossier You, replace the pink pepper with peach, and that's Sparkling Sugar! I'm very surprised I don't see the comparison more often because they remind me of each other so much.)",11/24/23 13:34,whodoesyourtaxes

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"a sweet sugary sparkling berry with a hint of musk. This is a ""safe"" scent in that it is not overly strong, pleasant and soft. It's a little more grown up than the pink sugar craze from the early 2000's but I feel this isn't just a young kid scent and could be worn by different age groups for a fresh,clean, sweet scent. In the sephora edition clean reserve sampler set on the clean website, it's a great bargain for a good size bottle. I wouldn't purchase a full bottle when it runs out but in the meantime this is nice for layering, spraying on a sweater or scarf.",11/12/23 10:04,jillvee

I give this 10/10.",10/20/23 05:17,perfumepearl
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Edit: This is almost an exact dupe for Liis Floating! Barely can tell the difference. Interesting that Liis Studied and Radiant Nectar are so similar and here Liis Floating and Sparkling Sugar are dupes...

This fragrance is really fascinating because it is so similar to Radiant Nectar but still really distinct in its own rite. I find this is like a black currant/berry version of Radiant Nectar where instead of a woody base you get a strong skin musk.

The opening is sparkling, sugary, and very pink/red berry with a musky, clean base, with almost an Iso E Super effect in the base. There's nothing earthy or super woody here, just clean berries and juicy peach and some laudry-esque clean musk.

The dry down is extremely distinct from Radiant Nectar, however, and I actually cannot handle the dry down. It becomes an acrid, sharp, almost BO-ish musk on my skin. I think it's a lovely scent in the opening, but it does NOT hang with my particular body chemistry! I can imagine it for other people, but it is not for me! I will stick with my tried and true Radiant Nectar.",10/11/23 15:45,LunaLovespell

Sparkling Sugar Clean,Absolutely intoxicating in the best way. It's super sweet and warm with a hint of musk. Great girly sweet everyday scent- I put on even when I go to bed because I love it that much.

It is very clean-smelling to me and did give me a headache the first time I wore it, but I liked it so much that I risked wearing it again, and I'm good with it now, even overspraying like I normally do. I know some people have performance issues with this, but this will get me through a full workday, and I never have to go searching for the scent.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Picked up a sample vial of this. I'd read some describe it as a lovechild of Skin Reserve and Radiant Nectar. I absolutely love the Reserve blend of Skin, and I like berries, so I wanted to try it.

I was really surprised how much I dislike it. The notes are pretty but it's a little too 'bright' for me and gives me an instant headache unfortunately. It reminds me of fruity body spray from the drugstore. I can totally, absolutely see a lot of people loving this. Just for me, I think it needs a little more grounding. I have to learn that fruit + sugar tends to equal headache for me, no matter how bad I want to love it.

I will say the name is 100% dead-on. This is a sparkling, sugar fragrance! Light, cheerful, youthful. It reminds me of the vibes of Sparkling Hibiscus by Mix Bar. Not bad holding power for a clean fragrance, either! It lasts much better on me than say, Skin [Reserve].

I do think it's overpriced for something not particularly unique, but on the other hand it's vegan CF. I also love this brand's packaging. It just matches the 'eco' theme perfectly, and the full size bottle feels really hearty.",07/16/23 07:19,boolprop

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"Gourmands are tricky to pull off–more than any other scent profile, they often teeter the line of being too sweet. Sparkling Sugar by Clean at least delivers what its name promises–pure, unadulterated sweetness, an elevated and more mature version of the ""Pink Sugar"" spray scents of many a generation's youth. Although the notes listed include musk, peach and black currant, to my nose, Sparkling Sugar reads as cotton candy with a slight hint of fruit flavoring–the peach reads as almost candy strawberry, as well as the blackcurrant, which more resembles grape hard candy, if more subtly.

On my skin, gourmands can be a gamble. Outside vanilla and certain fruits, musky sugary gourmand fragrances can read as heady and cloying, almost nauseating when I wear them. Unfortunately, that's the case with Sparkling Sugar–this is definitely not a blind buy! I also read it as a bit of lightweight as far as fragrances go–good sillage, but less impressive longevity. This seems to be a pattern with many fragrances from the Clean Reserve collection.

For those who can pull of sugary sweet smells with pride, or those who pine for the Pink Sugar of their youth, then give this a try.",05/08/23 16:21,HannahRosesAreRed

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I really enjoy this one. In my top 10 most worn. Very sugary soapy sweet scent that i adore. I own Radiant Nectar and I think Sparkling Sugar is more crowd pleasing. RN is moreso honey drizzled over pears, sitting out in the sun. Whereas SS is peachy pear water that makes you smell clean and sweet. I feel like SS is the better option if you want everyday use, because sometimes RN bothers me. Both very faint but I was actually complimented twice wearing SS this week on vacation. I think it’s easy to become nose blind to these. . Both are very carefree, fruity and clean.",05/03/23 12:36,shoujomarina
Sparkling Sugar Clean,"The peachy top notes disappear almost instantly and you are left with something that is almost, but not quite, indistinguishable from Radiant Nectar. I love Radiant Nectar, but they are similar enough that I do not think one would need both. If you have neither then I would say that Radiant Nectar is deeper and cosier. It's like honey milk bubble tea. Sparkling Sugar is lighter, like a peach bubble tea, if that makes sense.",04/25/23 19:31,Mirille

There might be a hint of sweetness in there,  but not enough for me. Unfortunately these types of scents just turn into rubbing alcohol on me.

This would be such an easy every day reach for the spring or summer months. This is also highly inoffensive, I couldn't see anybody getting mad at this or thinking that it's overbearing.

This was so pretty the first wear and I was thrilled to find the fruit notes were still prominent for several hours. The second time I sprayed in on skin and on my sleeve and pretty soon after started noticing something sour and unpleasant wafting up…I think this was a case of the cassis note going wrong 😟 It was a little horrifying and I had to scrub it off as soon as I got home and immediately wash my shirt.

I’ve also read that others had a similar issue with Clean Reserve’s Radiant Nectar, so perhaps it could be something in their musk note that can sometimes pull chemical-like and off. Be sure to test before buying!",02/20/23 11:45,PerfumePonderings

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"While this is nowhere near FBW or even a scent that I like a lot, it is decidedly not bad. I just don't think it is interesting at all. It is a pretty straightforward milky-musky peach skin scent, so perfect for the person who wants a ""non-perfume perfume"" or something that is very subtle. It is a skin scent, so the throw is very close to the body. You will smell nice but in a way that others likely would not be able to identify as perfume. I could see this being a banger for layering to add a hint of sweetness or skin-ness to other fragrances that have a kind of airy quality but do not last, and that is likely how I will be using the remainder of my sample. This smells clean without being shampoo-y or soapy, which is the brand's whole ethos, so I think they have been very successful in what they've created. For me it is not something I'd buy more of, but I will likely make use of the remaining amount I have in the carded sample I got from Sephora.",02/17/23 07:33,silverlocusts

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"The scent is nice but REALLY light....like seconds after spraying I had my nose against my skin to smell it. I sprayed it on paper to test if it performed different, but it faded on the paper too. I returned it because it lacked projection.

This is one of those scents that are good for people who only want to be smelled if they are skin to skin with someone, otherwise even inches away it will be hard to smell. I would hope there would be some sort of projection with a heavy spray....but even after it sat on my skin for a few minutes, it became such a faint smell that it seemed not worth keeping.

I do like the packaging though....gives a minimalist/day vibe.",02/14/23 07:23,ThornyComplexRose

It’s clean, fresh, sweet and refreshing. It’s fun and flirty without being completely juvenile. Like a comment said below…if you take the sticky, syrup sweetness in Radiant Nectar and replace it with the freshness of Skin, then you have Sparkling Sugar. I really enjoy the Clean line. The perfumes are simple, light, easy and smell so good. The way they do skin but better scents is impressive. Like CR Skin, it’s an easy reach for everyday use when you aren’t going anywhere special…running errands, quick lunch, straight of the shower and lounging around the house. It’ll brighten your day a little when you wear it.",02/11/23 18:57,JustAsh

It’s such a Pretty Scent that’ll be perfect for Spring & Summer because it’s not a Heavy Syrupy Sweetness. I don’t think it’ll be offensive if You work in an Office or with Children. It’s also a Clean Brand. I purchased this in a Travel well my Husband did but I’m going to get a Full Size bottle. Definitely worth a Sniff!

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"On the Clean Beauty Collective’s site, the notes are listed as ..

Top: Cassis berries, Ambrette Seeds
Middle: Peach Nectar, Jasmine Petals, Pink Sugar
Dry: White Musk, Tonka Bean, Blond Woods


I smell mostly peach nectar with a bit of light musk in the drydown. It’s bright and super juicy, and it is shampoo-y … sweet and clean and nice. But it’s also screechy. However, that loudness does give it some strength and protection, so it’s a bit of a trade-off.

I bought a travel spray but will be returning it. On a day like today, after testing a skunky failure (Sorry, Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry ..), it’s a welcome blast of clean, fresh sweetness. However, I just don’t love how screechy and juvenile it reads, and it ultimately gave me a headache.

Sparkling Sugar Clean,"I'll preface this with saying I haven't really ever been a fan of super sweet, sugary perfumes. My nose also typically prefers niche or indie...I have very few designer perfumes in my collection (my wallet wishes this were different). However, I've been on a sweetie kick lately and I am thoroughly enjoying Sparkling Sugar. It doesn't smell juvenile at all, I also don't think it smells that similar to Radiant Nectar or Skin. I find Radiant Nectar to be pretty similar to Glossier You, which also smells nothing like Sparkling Sugar. The fruit in Radiant Nectar never translated on my skin, which is what I was after.

Sparkling Sugar is juicy, bright, fresh, with the perfect amount of sweetness, the musk isn't warm and never overpowering. To me, this is an elevated body mist type of scent - something I want to wear on Saturday or Sunday while running errands because it beings me joy and isn't fussy. I don't want or expect scents like this to be beast mode, it does exactly what I want it to do.

I like this opening. But within 30 minutes, it is musk, musk and more musk. And the longevity is powerful, and it keeps getting muskier until eventually I feel anything but clean.
I got this in a set with Clean Skin for a pretty good price. But it’s going back. Because Clean Skin is only straight up musk from top to bottom, all day, and it’s just too much musk. In fact they smell both exactly the same eventually.",05/22/21 06:31,violet violin
Clean Ultimate Clean,"This fragrance has two distinct faces.

The first one it reveals when you spray it on fabrics: Dry, slightly powdery, a hint of herbals. I associate that with freshly-ironed white cotton.

The second one is the impression it leaves on my skin.
After a moderately strong, herbal opening there is a soft, yet slightly medical cloud of lavender and lily of the valley which lingers on the skin for quite some time until it turns into a soft, neroli-infused musky note.

Clean Ultimate reads as a slightly unusual twist of a classic everyday-scent one could easily wear at work and at home alike. It is very unisex, has moderate to low sillage and lasts about four hours on my skin. It is an uncomplicated fragrance that I wear quite a lot.",05/03/21 12:09,Eribert

Clean Ultimate Clean,"So, I gave this another try. We all deserve second chances. I realized at the time I tried this the first time, I was taking medication that may have altered my PH. This time, the result was so much better. I didn’t smell much in the way of lavender too much, but it wasn’t all lemon either. In fact, it is a blend and reminded me kind of like the original 4711, with better longevity. At times the jasmine can come through to remind of Susan D. Owens’ perfume, Child. Be careful how you spray this, can be strong if sprayed too heavily. Very citrusy and musky with orange flower and jasmine. I’m liking it now.",11/05/18 18:30,ChelleBelle84
Clean Ultimate Clean,lovely and light for days where you want to smell fresh as a daisy. Still noticeable enough to project well. Definitely a casual daytime scent but a very pleasant one. Nabbed a bargain in TK Maxx so really pleased with this blind buy.,08/31/18 17:08,sharon.ramsey.900
Clean Ultimate Clean,"One of the better Clean fragrances. But it still is lemon and suntan lotion at its core. Like another user mentioned, this is clean without being laundry scented. That doesn't mean it doesn't smell like soap, though. To me, it is similar in scent to Lush's Sea Spray.",02/22/18 10:34,EnergeticCrab
Clean Ultimate Clean,"A musky Lemon, the most underwhelming perfume in the clean line. Yet, it fills a niche, for all of you who love the smell of lemon-scented cleaning products. This is your chance to smell like you’ve been diligently cleaning your house all day. Would I wear it? probably.. I generally prefer flamboyant orientals, but we all have our day jobs. The “clean” line is as “office-safe” as office-safe gets.",02/15/18 14:42,Ms.Mink
Clean Ultimate Clean,"Lavender? Where? I wish! All I smell is lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, oh, and uh.... lemon! Wish I could have caught the other notes, but lemon has this affect on me with fragrances. If your chemistry amps lemon, try before you buy if possible. Did I mention all I smell is lemon? :p",02/04/18 16:51,ChelleBelle84

Clean Ultimate Clean,"My ""palate-cleanser"" perfume. I wear this when I want to clear my head, to start fresh, to start anew, to rest my nostrils following the days I wear heavy perfume. I also bring this on holiday when I know I wouldn't be able to shower everyday. Perfect for spraying on clothes after you've been exposed to car exhaust, or after you have been into a smelly kitchen. Weak sillage and staying power especially for an EDP, but I can't complain. Clean Ultimate really lives up to its name.",03/01/17 18:39,over_caffeine
Clean Ultimate Clean,"Squeaky clean, maybe to the point of harshness. Sometimes I really like it, but sometimes it's too sharp and soapy. I bought a bottle but don't use it all that often. I wish it had a touch of sweetness to it. I find it strong, but doesn't last long; maybe two hours. I can see the similarity to pure Grace, but Clean Ultimate seems more lemony/citrusy, and Grace a bit softer and mellower on me.

I can't smell anything floral in this; just lots of citrus and clean white musk. When I smell this in the winter it makes me crave summer and sunshine.",04/02/16 21:29,scentedrat
Clean Ultimate Clean,"Great fragrance! Smells like fresh lemonate early in the morning. If you want to smell clean and feel energized, that's your fragrance. Not offending at all, but definitely recognized. Great choice for hot summer.",02/23/15 00:44,ex_marmalade

Clean Ultimate Clean,"Smells mostly like lavender and musk which I think is really nice. It's both cosy and clean at the same time. I was very calmed by the lavender smell. Unfortunately it's very expensive for what is essentially a very basic fragrance, nice as it is, and it doesn't last more than a couple of hours at the most. Still, for that hour or so I did like the smell of it very much.",01/14/15 15:21,LOUISELOUISE

Something about this fragrance makes me feel confident and sexy. The combination of musk, floral and spiciness is well blended.. keeps me fresh and clean despite being exposed to sun the entire day! Suits my body chemistry so well. Though longevity is not so good (3-4hrs), i don't mind re-applying to experience the heaven in this gem. Can't count the compliments that I got from both men & women everytime I wear it. I highly recommend to those who hates strong scents but wants to captivate attention in a non-offensive way.",10/19/14 13:09,kattleia
Clean Ultimate Clean,"This is a great CLEAN fragrance. For some reason on me, it lasts far better than other CLEANs and even some of my other citrus/green/fresh types. It seems to last better on clothing than skin. I'm happy with it and may even repurchase. With the floral element, it's more unique than the usual fresh or citrus.",03/06/14 03:57,EastCoastRose
Clean Ultimate Clean,I absolutely LOVE this fragrance. I have had tons of compliments on it. It is not overpowering however the only complaint I have is that is has very minimal longevity.,10/07/13 09:38,kwoudzia
Clean Ultimate Clean,"Meh,very soapy,but that's the point,right? I guess I am just not into this kind of thing.Nice enough,if you're looking for a clean,soapy smell. Very light,I definitely get the lavender and citrus scents,and if I liked the soft,clean, laundry type smells,this one is very good.It's just not what I look for in a scent.
Sillage is minimal,definitely a skin scent,and longevity is not good wither,an hour or two,and I had a hard time smelling it on my wrists.Then again,I had a hard time telling the difference between this and my fabric softener,so,who knows,maybe I was smelling that.
End results,if you like clean and soapy,this one does not disappoint.If you want it to last all day,be prepared to take it with you,as it does not last long.",09/22/13 17:36,dawn.brooks.391

It's pretty awesome when I layer a spritz of TBS' White Musk over it, though. I don't really like White Musk on its own, but combined with Clean Ultimate it smells really nice. Try it!",09/09/12 15:57,jessbug

Anyway i gave this a try because of QVC, they were going on and on about how great it was and you know if you've ever bought anything from them... you watch long enough they'll convince you :)

Clean Ultimate Clean,"I love this perfume!!! soapy, fresh, so clean!!!",07/24/12 22:06,kuke
Clean Ultimate Clean,"I used to think that the brand Clean made insipid and bland soapy fragrances, but since giving them a fair go, I have come to understand the beauty of a crisp and clean scent for everyday wear.

Heavy hitting fragrances can become tiring after awhile, and that's when a scent such as this one is highly appreciated. Clean Ultimate has unisex tendencies, with the dominant lavender accord giving this composition a slightly masculine edge.

Lavender has many soothing properties, so it's easy to feel comforted by wearing Clean Ultimate. It's casual, clean and smooth. I find it inoffensive and versatile enough to be worn all year long.

Some may complain about the linear composition, but for something so soapy and delicate, I don't know why you'd want it any other way. I personally believe that the simplicity works a treat.

I do happen to adore the scent of lavender and musk, so Clean Ultimate suits me to a tee. The only disappointing factor, was its lack of lasting strength. It lasted a meagre two hours on my skin.

I'm giving it the thumbs up despite the longevity issue, and I whole-heartedly recommend it, especially if you enjoy the somewhat unique Clean Warm Cotton as well.",07/09/12 07:39,missk

Anyway, its light and nice soap. When i wake up, i get a shower and i put my ultimate on and all i get is a euphoria feeling.

I wish it could last longer...

Clean Ultimate Clean,"Clean Ultimate EDP is the only fragrance in the entire Clean line that I have enjoyed. It's the first one that truly smells ""clean"" without smelling like laundry detergent. Like the others in the line, Clean Ultimate is a bit short-lived, but it's also so light that it would be impossible to over-apply it, and a second or third touch-up during the day is not going to overpower anybody. This scent could easily fly under the radar in offices that ban scent in the workplace. It truly smells like you just showered with a nicely-scented soap or shower gel.

The overall aroma is floral, but not too sweet. My husband also tried it and it smells great on both of us. Defnitely unisex. (I read elsewhere that it smells similar to a men's fragrance called Gendarme which I have not tried.)

Clean Ultimate is a great daytime scent, and suitable for hot or cold weather--smelling clean and fresh is seasonless!--but is not strong enough or mysterious enough for evening wear.",04/17/10 08:39,NebraskaLovesScent
Clean Ultimate Clean,"This is my first Clean perfume and I love it. It's really an ultimate clean scent like what the name says.

Smoked Vetiver Clean,"Currently, I have over 100 samples and came across this one over the last few days. On my first wearing, I wasn't sure, and today I put it on and still feel the same way. The opening is one of the best in all of perfumery, but in 1 minute flat after the fresh opening, the smokiness comes out, and it's quite bitter and tangy which I like, but also something which reminds me of an antique furniture store, but not an unpleasant dinghy one. It's definitely worth a shot, because I can see some really pulling this one off. To me this kind of reminds me something a witch could wear. It would be a favorite scent for a witch. I'm not even being sarcastic. I could envision this being a signature scent for some, but this is not a mass appealing scent. I could understand the mixed reviews, and completely understand how some will love it.

Smoked Vetiver Clean,"I don't get much of a vetiver vibe off this. On me it smells very sweet...kind of like burnt homemade caramel or burnt sugar. I am resisting the urge to wash it off, but even after 1 hour, while lessened somewhat, the burnt sugar smell is still there.

I do sense the myrrh and amber, and some woods for a slightly resiny scent, but this is very far from the green vetiver scent I know and love.

Not for me since I am not a gourmand frag fan.",05/30/18 16:18,atarilynx

nil sillage, weak longevity; as a ""smoked vetiver"" this leaves a lot to be desired. not for fans of vetiver to try. if you really wish to smell like dryer sheets, with that same headache inducing chemical sweetness/freshness, then be my guest.",11/23/16 23:14,ameagari

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Ok, Clean, I see you!

I love neroli, but found most neroli fragrances to be too bitter on my skin, until I tried Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino (the OG, not the Acqua version, which I have yet to try). I actually prefer Neroli Portofino, which I find to be brighter and fresher, while Clean's version is softer and soapier, but I can't justify the price of TF, considering how poor the performance is. Acqua Neroli is much more affordable, and honestly quite beautiful. Even though Tom Ford suits me better, this smells close enough that I can happily overspray and respray without feeling my wallet clench.",06/02/25 19:03,Jadelynn
Acqua Neroli Clean,"There's something kind of gross about this. I might have to try it again to put a name to it but the word 'sweaty' came to mind. I think it might be the mix of the white floral and musk...

The best I can describe it is like the end of a long, hot day at the beach, after sunscreen has been applied a few times too many and the sweat has mixed in. Your group heads back to the car, there are half dried beach towels on peoples laps or on the seats and you're on your way back to the hotel to clean up. All you can smell is sunscreen, sweat, and and undercurrent of BO. It's tolerable but I wouldn't choose it.",05/13/25 15:13,hstase
Acqua Neroli Clean,Clean and oddly nostalgic. It smells like spray can sunscreen. Reminds me of being a child headed to the beach in Florida and walking past the hotel’s warm laundry room vents on the way. Summery without being tropical,04/30/25 14:53,SpiritsnStars
Acqua Neroli Clean,"Snuck a generous few sprays of this from someone's bathroom cabinet. Such a naughty way to smell so good. On my skin this had a delightfully clear feeling, exuding melodic neroli, orange blossom, and citruses, with some extra depth from what smells like perhaps lime blossom. The base notes are fleeting, so the cheery top and middle fizzle out rather than giving way to a new scent profile. I cannot imagine somebody objecting to this smell.

My coworkers, roommates, and girlfriend were all coming right up to me to put their noses to my skin. Perfume should not be about the opinions of others, but it is an undeniably good feeling when a fragrance makes others want to get close to you.",04/27/25 18:00,erouissant

Acqua Neroli Clean,"I loathe this perfume...disgusting. I felt a lot of negative nostalgia when I sprayed this. I thought of sunscreen, then old ladies in the 90s, then the waterpark I went to as a little kid. I agree with all the reviews that say it smells like cleaning product. I've used neroli water as a toner, so I'm not sure if neroli is the issue for me; it might be the orange instead. This is not a fragrance I want to smell, nor one I want to smell like.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"As far as I've smelled, this is the pinnacle of clean smells. It projects and lasts surprisingly well on me too, I had someone sniffing all over the house trying to figure out what they were smelling (it was me). Definitely a clean laundry smell but just slightly complicated by the neroli, which gives this a mild, delicious streak of greenery and earth. One of the safest fragrances I have ever worn, and I tend to opt for things with more depth and less universal appeal, but this is a great scent.",12/05/24 13:26,erouissant

Acqua Neroli Clean,"I like this so much! Most will say it's smells like cleaners or detergent. And granted citruses are usually used in them because they do so well eliminating odors. But that's just what cirus smells like. Now to me, this smells like I just stepped out of the shower and used all lemony bath products and the steam in the room brings all of that out. It smells clean, as do all of the fragrances in this brand. Yes, it smells of citrus but obviously without that chemical smell that also comes with cleaners and disinfectants. But to me this was just so uplifting. It reminded me of the way I feel when I'm done cleaning the house for the day and the smell of cleanliness just makes me feel fulfilled and like I can only attract positive vibes. Very spring and summer this fragrance. I finishes a sample vial, now I'm going for the full size.",09/19/24 08:26,Adenahi

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Smells sooo good! Many might disagree with this but on the first spray I got a blast that reminded me of Sundazed by Byredo (minus the cotton candy) because of the neroli. Then it dries down to linen dryer sheets (which I don’t mind at all!) This is veryyy clean. Can’t wait to layer this and see what delicious combos I can come up with :)

After a few moments, orange citrus juiciness, slightly floral and soapy and very aquatic. Refreshing, simple. Bright and crisp. But it settles into hollower citrus florals and without any woods, it's lacking notes that I typically find interesting or enjoy. Still a solid freshie.",06/18/24 08:04,wannabeconnoisseur
Acqua Neroli Clean,"This is a great summer/spring scent for sure, very clean and fresh. Upon first spray, I was getting overwhelming zest and orange blossom, but as it settled a little bit, the mandarin and neroli really came through pleasantly. The musk and sandalwood really save it from having that stringent headache-inducing quality that a lot of white florals have as well. Personally, it's a little too fresh for me to wear on its own, but I've been layering it with a really nice peppery-woody fragrance that seems to bring out the warmth a bit more.",05/06/24 11:50,stakasaki
Acqua Neroli Clean,"This is pretty BORING. this definitely sits very close to the skin … does not project … it is fresh - but it’s very hard to even smell . Maybe for a bed time scent ?

Acqua Neroli Clean,"That's a whole lot of Neroli, and maybe a little bit of Jasmine. Honestly all I get from this is floral and I don't get citrus at all. It's also quite strong for the person wearing it, but it stays really close to you, so it's basically like a personal scent. It doesn't smell bad, but I don't particularly like it. If you like neroli and you want to smell it on yourself, then this would be a good choice. Otherwise, there are plenty of other floral options that are generally less offensive.

Acqua Neroli Clean,I love this perfume but the neroli and orange blossom are so sharp that i'm embarassed to wear it ouside of my house. I feel like this could easily be headache inducing. I tried layering it with sweeter frangrances but haven't found a good combo yet.,03/26/24 13:45,ash96

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Ooooh, this one is yummy. The citrus isn't overwhelming, I'm mostly getting the neroli with a hint of jasmine (I didn't like Dolce&Gabbana Light Blue bc the orange scent came through VERY strong for me). It feels light, fresh, and flirty. I could see myself wearing this throughout the warmer months. It's the kind of thing that COULD be a bit obtrusive if it had strong projection, but it sits fairly close to the skin.",03/13/24 08:39,Lothere55
Acqua Neroli Clean,"I think this is a really quintessential fresh-neroli-and-citrus fragrance at a pretty decent price point; clean, sun-kissed, and tangy-sweet. It's an easy reach that effortlessly evokes summer days, minimalist sandals on sun-warmed streets, soapy buckets of hand laundry on apartment balconies, and the glint of azure sea water somewhere in the distance.

Acqua Neroli's fresh, sweet-tart citrus is inseparable from its lemony-vanillic white florals and soapy musk, like multiple facets of the same Riviera-daydream. The base adds a little velvety woodiness, but citrusy-floral freshness remains the fragrance's defining feature well into the dry down.

When I smell this on its own, I really like it. However, when I smell it side by side with other, similar fragrances, I end up liking most of them better. So I guess I'm just a ho for summery-citrus-and-white-floral scents in general. ¯_(ツ)_/¯",03/08/24 16:28,ginandrice

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Great big blast of orange blossom and neroli with the first spray that lasts a good hour at least. The drydown keeps the neroli going for a few more hours, but the projection ramps down and there’s more of a musky soapy backdrop. Its like a fancy floral bar of soap - clean, classy, and close to the skin. It’s not my usual scent profile, but it does make me feel like I’m wearing linen and drinking a $17 negroni at a garden party, which isn’t something I do too often but is nice every once in a while.",08/10/23 12:31,brightawake
Acqua Neroli Clean,"First Impressions (sample spray):
I thought I would like this perfume because I do love soapy, and indolic fragrances. However, I was very mistaken. The neroli and the orange blossom become very sharp, and the mandarin orange is EXTREMELY synthetic to my nose. This comes of as extremely cheap soap that's trying to be clean but has a weird after smell.
Edit:
Tried my sample of it again. Yep still have the same thoughts. At first it smells like a citrus Neroli detergent. So far so good for me b/c I love that detergent smell. After a time tho it becomes completely rancid to me. The piercing Neroli is getting too much. The indolicness mixed with the citruses is giving pee I will say.

Summary:
Smells like: aggressive cleaning products in the worst way.
Family of: neroli portofino (worse version)
Silage: moderate to strong

Verdict:
Big pass- synthetic neroli cleaning products.",08/09/23 21:19,AdalynEverly
Acqua Neroli Clean,"I have searched for months for a blue fragrance. I have bought (and given away) or tried everything. I just don’t enjoy the standard blues like Dylan, de gio, D&G etc.

Absolutely love this one.

The opening is invigorating and the flower notes perfectly settle them down.

Sandalwood always performs well on me, so it makes it masculine enough, without screaming look at me, I’m a man.

And as with any blue or green, one spray of Beach Walk under it…boom, instant ocean banger.",07/14/23 12:39,R.diggity

Acqua Neroli Clean,"There’s something about this house that constantly puts a dryer sheet/detergent accord in every single fragrance and it’s inescapable save for a select few (looking at u Sueded Oud).

This is just your Nana’s old flowery lotion you found in her bathroom. It’s probably been sitting there since 1989. A little crusty around the lid. And then it dries down to... detergent. Again. Skin and Rain do the same exact thing.

It’s not my style and I won’t buy it. There are plenty of other more dynamic neroli scents out there.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"I'm basing this review on an EDP spray from the Clean Discovery set. I'm so disappointed because this is awful on me! The second I sprayed it, all I could think of was ""Detergent!"" And strong detergent, at that.

I expected to like it because I like citrus and orange blossom. IDK, maybe this is one of those fragrances that just doesn't work on some people, and I'm one of them. YMMV.

This Clean fragrance lasted on me better than some of the others, so there is that! ( I have dry, perfume eating skin.)

I'd say this is a safe office scent mostly because it smells like laundry products, and it doesn't have much sillage or longevity. It's not a safe blind buy because of the laundry smell some get from it. I suggest trying a sample before buying a bottle. For a gift, maybe, if you know the recipient's taste in fragrances.",06/15/23 22:11,fragrancenovice
Acqua Neroli Clean,"There are better neroli fragrances to add to your collection then this one. It opens pretty sharp, than the neroli is dominant for about 30 minutes.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"A white flower mix that smells of yellow pollen, fresh flowers and dusty wood undernotes. Not terribly original but pleasant and cheerful.

Easy to wear, but you get what you pay for. That being said, I'm very pleased with several anyway.",06/03/23 20:18,tessture

This morning I tried Leila Lou by Rosie Jane and the Jasmine was too much for my liking. As far as silliage and projection, I will need to wait and see. So far really enjoying it.",06/01/23 09:21,Xenabea

Acqua Neroli Clean,"This is my favorite fragrance to wear when I expect to get hot and sweaty i.e. the beach, boating, working outside, or going to the gym. This refreshing, light perfume makes me feel clean and sexy, despite having a little swamp-ass.",05/12/23 06:58,LizMango
Acqua Neroli Clean,"The Clean Reserve Collection really lives up to its name, no matter what fragrance it sells. All of their perfumes smell and feel very clean and fresh, not too strongly aromatic or heady. However, this can be a drawback when its fragrances star scent notes that are, by default, highly heady, aromatic or indolic. Neroli is such an note. Anyone who has smelled neroli in real life knows how powerfully sweet, alluring and even a little skanky these little cluster flowers can be, giving the equally skanky and overtly sexy jasmine a run for its money. It's a potent and likable scent, which pairs nicely with juicy or fresh notes. On paper, a neroli aquatic freshie fragrance sounds like the perfect fit for the Clean Reserve brand.

However, performance-wise, Acqua Neroli isn't everything it should be. Yes, it's a very sweet, fresh, watery and likable scent. There is nothing offensive or unpleasant about it. However, it smells too similar to some of the other Clean Reserve perfumes. The orange and citrus notes overpower the neroli, which all but disappears, or is rendered as soapy and almost detergent-like. Such a note worked for Clean Reserve ""Warm Cotton,"" but it takes the neroli out of ""Acqua Neroli,"" once again leaving it as a sweet, but unoriginal, freshie fragrance in a sea of other similar clean freshies on the market.

It's a shame, because had it been better executed, this could have a been a standout for this brand. For a better take on an aquatic neroli scent, I suggest Acqua Di Gio, which plays up the white floral sweetness without drowning it in the aqua notes.",05/08/23 17:24,HannahRosesAreRed
Acqua Neroli Clean,"This is definitely a little too soapy to wear alone, but like all Clean fragrances, it’s great for layering. It smells great with Solar Bloom (freshens up the coal note in that fragrance a bit) and improves the longevity of that fragrance.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Oh, how I adore this one for the warmer months. It has all of the citrusy and floral notes I associate with spring and summer, and the neroli really shines. It’s got this high end soapy quality to it, which usually isn’t my style, but this just wears so beautifully for a day in the sun. It’s layering very well over my BBW Sensual Amber lotion, and Fairytale body mist. Plays very well with other citrusy/floral products, especially when I’m fresh outta the shower.",03/05/23 09:52,fairycoffins
Acqua Neroli Clean,"Got a sample of this from Sephora and I must say, I like it! Definitely smells fresh & clean, which I think is great for errand days and beauty appointments.

However, I did try it on my skin twice and I would've liked a more lasting longevity.",03/01/23 11:01,mrntrs
Acqua Neroli Clean,"This one is a fresh scent of lemon and a bit of orange, no jasmine or other white flowers (most importantly no orange blossom), not that I can tell. Off the cap I get a soapy neroli. There is a slight strange ""after smell"", as indicated by another reviewer, which I too noticed. I'm thinking this is what was used to synthesize the ""musk"" note in this (ambrellotide?). I heartily disagree that it's like ""Eau Des Sens"" by dyptique. Eau Des Sens has a fragrant sweetness, a high-quality pureness, with no ""after smell""; it is the closest one can get to an organic orange blossom in perfumery. This one is simply a synthetic citrus. It is not a ""warm"" scent, nor ambery or resinous as described. I get watery and ""cool"". Musty, even. I do feel it's necessary to reiterate that there is no comparison to the sweet, floral, and herbal orange blossom of Eau Des Sens. If I have to make a comparison, it's most like Artisan by John Varvatos, both in smell and weak performance.

Update - tried again 7 April - I'm getting straight up lemon pledge furniture polish. It's really kinda icky tbh, and it's burning my skin. I have it in miniature rollerball form, received from another fragrance collector. Simply not a fan at all, sorry.",02/12/23 15:14,Autumnal Elf

Acqua Neroli Clean,"This is really similar to Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Acqua or 4711, it lasts longer on me than TFNPA, if i may say, its even better, been layering this together with Jo Malone's Lime Basil and Mandarin, very refreshing scent.",11/21/22 05:52,pcsanjuan_89
Acqua Neroli Clean,"I go to the gym late in the evening as I have a long commute for work. After the gym I shower with 4711 Soap. After the shower I spray 4711 EDC all over then relax. But, on my days off i find myself in the gym much earlier. At first, this was why I purchased a travel spray of Clean Aqua Neroli; it is a fresh, invigorating neroli that will last longer so i can put it on at 3pm and it will carry me into the evening rather than die off in 30 minutes like 4711.

Now I am Hooked. It is a damn good fragrance and incredibly underrated. If you took the time to read this and you enjoy 4711, Neroli Portofino, Bright Neroli, etc. then pick up a sample of this. It is an accessible, amazing scent. It teeters on the edge of clone to Neroli Portofino by Tom Ford, but it is less refined and has some imperfections compared to its far more expensive cousin.

This coming spring i know i will be purchasing a big bottle of either:
This (Clean Aqua Neroli)
Neroli Portofino
Neroli Portofino Forte
or Ferrari Bright Neroli",10/27/22 23:07,nicki_san

Acqua Neroli Clean,Wow! Was not expecting this. I just LOVE the way the Clean line settles and develops into the skin and Acqua Neroli doesn’t differ. I’ve been searching for a bright and fresh citrus that settles into some thing a little more sensual and this is the one. Can’t believe it’s been right in front of me in a tester said I had for so long! I think this may be my new daytime scent or definitely one that I wear into the office when I head in. The description below from the last poster was absolutely correct bright and fresh soft and airy really beautiful all together. The first spray definitely comes up with a light fresh citrus something you kind of want to smell more and more not some thing you want to avoid. And then develops into a sexy soapy light skin scent. I’m excited to wear this out as I haven’t yet I definitely think this is some thing that people will want to get close to and discover more without being it offensive. Really well done!,08/04/22 04:56,Literaryflower

Acqua Neroli Clean,"A couple months ago I got a free spray sample of Clean Reserve Acqua Neroli with a makeup purchase. I told myself it would be such a light scent I'd likely be unimpressed. Then I tried it on and found myself sniffing and sniffing my skin without really thinking about it. I couldn't get enough of the scent. Once I admitted to myself I was really into the fragrance, I went ahead and bought it when a sale came around. (More recently, I went through the same process when I got a tiny roll-on sample of Clean Reserve Skin.)

To my nose, Clean Reserve Acqua Neroli is simple and linear. It smells like Neroli. I don't live in a tropical area, so the scent of Neroli reminds me of happy vacations. My fragrance collection is not huge, but this is one of my top five favorites. I'm not sure it would be a crowd pleaser though. So many people complain about floral scents. So I wear it at home and on errands when I'm just interested in pleasing myself versus getting compliments.

By the way, I noticed when I received my bottle of Clean Reserve Acqua Neroli, the bottle juice projected more than the spray sample juice did.

Update: After wearing this fragrance for a couple weeks, I started to notice more of the woody notes coming out on my skin. I've learned over time I don't like woody florals, so for me that's not good. However, today I tried wearing the fragrance on my clothes instead of my skin, and now I get the linear floral accord I prefer again.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"I can see the similarity to Tom Ford Neroli Portofino in this, but I think an even closer perfume to this would be Diptyque's Eau des Sens. This starts off with a beautiful green neroli and citrus opening which it maintains for a while, but the heart note in this was mainly the orange blossom for me with a little bit of sweetness that reminded me of the sweet musk in Clean Reserve Skin. There is a soapiness in the dry down that is sometimes found in a lot of orange blossom perfume and is especially found in Eau des Sens which is probably why this one reminds me so strongly of it. I love that kind of clean scent in warm weather, though and really enjoy it in here as well.

Neroli Portofino:

- delicate and crisp
- terribly overpriced (although I keep buying it because it’s just a love)

Acqua Neroli:
- herbal musky undertone, almost fresh spicy
- sweet, but with a strong lemon opening
- performs more like an EDT

Acqua Neroli Clean,"rare that i will have such a strong negative reaction to perfume, but i find this disgusting! smells like windex or something else janitorial. reminiscent of what a school custodian might use to clean children’s vomit off of the cafeteria floor. the neroli is just so strong and synthetic, it actually makes me ill. i can taste it in the back of my throat just thinking about it! this might be alright on someone else—it isn’t quite heavy enough that it would make me sick on another person unless we had to share a desk or an airplane—but having such a dense cloud of cleaning solution trailing after me and lingering around my head all day is nothing short of a guarantee for a very nasty migraine.",03/25/21 20:28,ssickboyy
Acqua Neroli Clean,"I got a large sized sampler as a gift with purchase for buying CLEAN Rain, and I honestly thought I didn’t like or wouldn’t like many of the reserve blend that they have put out but this is beautiful! It’s very citrusy and aquatic for those who are into that-for those who aren’t into those you likely wouldn’t like this. But this has changed my mind totally on the reserve blends! Definitely going to try more of them",03/19/21 06:59,Dort0625
Acqua Neroli Clean,"Does anyone else smell Smarties candies? To me it smells exactly like what Smarties tastes like and instantly transports me back in time to very specific moments of my childhood. (It is so fascinating how scents can trigger long forgotten, even decades-old memories) Ok back to the subject... Smarties candy smells and tastes good to many, including me, but I'm not too sure I'd want to smell like it personally.

Also, a lot of reviews have mentioned this perfume smelling so fresh but to me it seems to smell more chalky/slightly viscous-feeling? than fresh (probably because I'm already thinking of the candy) Oh and disclaimer: This is my first experience with neroli so I really have nothing to compare it to. Overall, this scent is very nice and evokes happiness within me but it's not something I'd often want to wear on my body. Could grow on me though.

Purchased 5ml size from Sephora that came in a 2 pack along with Radiant Nectar (Which was LOVE at first sniff!) for around $20. A very well worth it purchase.",03/18/21 02:03,Elle71

Acqua Neroli Clean,"OMG that citrus & orange blossom first opening, it's sooo good! Made my eyes roll back in my head!! But it lasts for about a minute. I agree with other reviewers that there's something about this that gives cleaning product/laundry detergent vibes. But I kind of dig it for the first 10 minutes. The orange blossom note in this is pure and fresh - not heavy/heady like some are. But wow, that clean-laundry scent is aggressive. It's giving me a headache. If you want to smell like clean laundry, you will love this!

I don't understand why, but some note in here reminds me of how my piano teacher used to smell. Clean Acqua Neroli is a scent memory portal for me.",03/01/21 10:42,fragrances-fanatic
Acqua Neroli Clean,"Smells like a laundry detergent with a cheap, chemical aroma. I used a tester and in 5 minutes I was scrubbing my hand as hard as I could, to get the scent out.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"I like it because it DOES smell ""clean"". However, after an hour it starts to give me an headache which is rarely happened to me before. Then, couple hours later when it is completely settled on my skin, I feel like it gave me very fresh feeling. But then there is something in there really gave me a ""familiar feeling"" and I finally figured out. It smells like a Dawn bottle or the cleaning smelling after you washing dishes.",02/04/21 11:33,nhilicious
Acqua Neroli Clean,"Such a lovely fragrance. I get orange, neroli and bright citrus. Over time it becomes more musky and soft. It's definitely a skin scent but I don't mind that personally. I can already picture myself spritzing this on a hot summer day as a little refresher! In comparison to Neroli Portofino, this smells more of clean laundry and oranges where NP smells like a Mediterranean seaside. They are both very unisex, however, NP is the most ""masculine"" leaning of the two.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"This is hands down my favorite Neroli scent that has incredible silage and longevity. Up to this point Issey Miyake Soleil de Neroli was my favorite neroli scent but this has eclipsed that. It is so full-bodied, fresh and clean. There are some fragrances that have it all and leave you totally satisfied. This is one of them. Whoever the perfumer was who created it didn't miss a beat. This smells as wonderful on first spray and throughout its hours and hours of wear (10 hours!!!) right until the very end when it finally becomes a skin scent. This is NEROLI. Every other note is there just to accentuate that clean, creamy, lightly citric, sweetly floral note. The whole composition is a deluxe sensuous experience. Best yet, it is all natural too.

Another remarkably clean citrusy, white floral scent with a hint of sensuality.

Neroli, musk, jasmine, sandalwood and bergamot amalgamated beautifully.

I wear this everyday alone or layered it over other perfumes to enhance or improve their scent.

This is another masterpiece that I hope stays available for a long, long time.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Nice, relatively accessible and affordable neroli that actually lasts on the skin? Yes please. I have been disappointed with many big names (Tom Ford, Jo Malone) when it comes to staying power with their neroli blends, so I was pleasantly surprised when Clean's version outperformed the higher priced versions. I have never been much of a fan of Clean in the past, but this one is very well done, and just what I want on hot summer nights when I need a little bit of an escape. It is clean, fresh, and invigoratingly crisp. Total winner in my book.",06/21/20 15:02,pleasuretoburn
Acqua Neroli Clean,"What Neroli Portifino should have been. Long lasting freshie!! What a gem. The perfect summer scent for men and women. My wife bought a bottle and we were blown away about how good it was and how similar it is to TF. I was so blown away that I bought a second bottle for myself! I don’t agree with most frags that say unisex because they always lean more to one side But not this one; this is truly 50/50. Smells great and still performs in high heat. Oh and it’s all natural!!! How on earth did they do this?? C’mon big name brands, take notes! I’m really surprised this isn’t rated higher than it is.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"The first thing I thought when I smelled a sample of this was ""wow! that smells clean!"" Then I saw the brand name and felt like an idiot. But even a year later, the first word that comes to mind when I smell this is clean.

It doesn't smell like a perfume. It smells like doing laundry on a sunny afternoon but not laundry detergent. It smells like stepping out of a warm shower on a cold winter evening but it doesn't smell like soap. It is a close, comfortable scent that is light, airy, and fresh without being too cold or warm. Aqua Neroli is a solid neutral clean in a bottle.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Female 27.

I tried this on my wrist in a store. I LOVED it! One spray and I felt like I was completely wrapped in it. I couldn't stop smelling my wrist all the time for the rest of the day. Lasts long on me. I don't get citrusy, though. More a warm, cozy, woody feel (I tried it in cold weather).

HOWEVER. I wasn't sure if I enjoyed it on me - or if I enjoyed it because it smells like sexy man.

I brought a male friend of mine to smell it in the store too. While I loved it, he absolutely didn't like it. He thought it was too weird that it's both masculine and feminine at the same time. He told me not to buy it.

Though, I can't seem to get it out of my mind. Still, I'm hesitant to get it as I'm afraid people will think I smell like a man..

Definitely not a safe blind buy.",05/11/20 02:19,kristinek20
Acqua Neroli Clean,"This was a blind buy based on reviews because I wanted to try a floral citrus fragrance for a change. And it was on sale. :) Still, I cannot believe I paid that much money for a perfume that smells exactly like the ""Soft Cotton"" air freshener from AirWick's Pure range that I have in my bathroom. The same sharp synthetic citrusy opening that fades into a soft synthetic ""white flowers-fresh linen-clean air"" combo that is very, very pleasant, almost heavenly, and makes you wonder why can't laundry detergents make your sheets smell like this, even though you're not really sure why you associate this smell with freshly laundered sheets or clean air or white flowers. Or what those flowers might be. I don't regret buying it but the price, even on sale, might not have been worth it. On the plus side I smell very clean. One could say pure.",04/28/20 07:11,adamsnicolas
Acqua Neroli Clean,"This was a gift from a friend who dislikes perfume, but who knows I'm a fragrance lover. She tested a bunch of fragrances and chose the one she personally liked best. This is key to Acqua Neroli, because it's the kind of fresh scent that is nearly universally appealing. It's a neroli citrus combo - a ""white t-shirt"" scent, just perfectly comfortable and easy. Comparisons to the enduringly classic 4711 are almost unavoidable, but that's such a beautiful-yet-fleeting scent, and this does a great job of creating a more robust version of that masterpiece. Clean's Acqua Neroli is a perfect - and perfectly unisex - summer fragrance, but it's also an uplifting pick-me-up for any time at all.",04/08/20 02:25,GenevaX

Tom Ford starts off with more of a bite and then the smell fades at a quick rate.
Clean Acqua Neroli starts mellow and stays consistent in terms of longevity.
However, there's an underlying synthetic, dryer sheet vibe in Clean's Acqua Neroli. It's not blatant, but noticeable enough that I prefer the Tom Ford version more.",10/14/19 05:49,and_then_some_7

The citrus and freshness at the beginning are very nice. It lasts for about 45 minutes. The neroli comes out and is lovely. But, then, towards the end, something else is coming out. It feels round to me, but I can't smell it. It's like my nose goes completely blind to it, and I can only catch whiffs of the perfume now and then. So odd.
Don't get me wrong, this is a nice perfume. This most definitely won't happen to you.",09/11/19 12:02,thecoffeeslayer
Acqua Neroli Clean,"Very nice scent, it does really smell clean on clothes! I'd prefer more neroli though, the orange/clementine here has more power than the white florals. For a more floral version of this I would suggest Serge Lutens Fleurs d'orangers (and Lutens' Fleurs de citronnier smells very similar to Acqua Neroli actually!)

Nothing to write home about though, I feel like Acqua Neroli could be a blend of all other neroli scents out there. It doesnt stand out in its category, but could satisfiy your fresh citrus fantasy.",09/01/19 14:26,nerolyan
Acqua Neroli Clean,"This is TF Neroli Portifino. If you smell them side by side you might convince yourself there is a subtle difference, but in a scent trail they are identical with Clean Reserve having better longevity for a better price point.

Longevity: 6 (5 hrs)
Projection:5 (2-3 feet for 1 hr then very close with a good trail)

Acqua Neroli Clean,"If Tom Fords Neroli Portifino lasted longer than an hour, it would be this. I have both an they are honestly 98% the same in scent and $200 different in price.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"I loved this immediately upon first sniff. There are all kinds of citrus in here, with some white pith to add a touch of bitterness, some green to keep it from being syrupy, and a little bit of musk for staying power.

Acqua Neroli Clean,"I wrote a previous review, but I want to add a word to the wise: this is *only* a warm-weather scent. If it's below 50F / 10C, I caution against wearing it. In cold weather this turns harsh and astringent, like a dryer sheet with a dab of rubbing alcohol. I got no citrus at all with this in winter, and didn't repeat the experience after one day. (Luckily, this doesn't last as long in the cold, either.) So please, save this beauty for warmer days.",03/13/19 19:07,baerro
Acqua Neroli Clean,"Yes, it's similar to 4711, but it's closer to Acqua Di Parma Colonia Essenza, as it seems to have more of a masculine bite, although still unisex IMO, and not as masculine as Essenza. I'd say it would be a great alternative to Essenza. I'd say this would be a must have fragrance for 40 dollars. It's a bit overpriced, as I would rather have an Acqua Di Parma bottle on my dresser for less than $70 on ebay. This is still a 5 star fragrance that is unisex for lovers looking for a summer neroli fragrance.",02/20/19 15:34,Forever Neil
Acqua Neroli Clean,"My first love was 4711. When I was younger, I’d soak cottenballs in the cologne and tuck into my bra to try to squeeze some longevity out of the fragrance. Then I found Tom Ford’s Neroli Portofino, and discovered it’s the same scent but lasts longer. It was also rather pricy. So I later: I used the 4711 body wash to shower, splash on the cologne head to toe, and then spray with a small bit of Tom Ford I got from samples. I can still smell it after a long day but it’s definitely a skin scent.

Then I found Clean’s Reserve Acqua Neroli, and again, it’s very similar to Neroli Portofino and 4711. So, I’ve added that to the rotation. (I got it and a bottle of Neroli Portofino for Christmas,)

While I won’t go hard and heavy until it warms up, I’m very pleased I have enough of my favorite scents to spray hard and smell like the fresh Mediterranean all summer long. I’ll happily spray away.

Now all I need is a hair mist...hmmm.

Clean Reserve’s Acqua Neroli is lovely, summer in a bottle, lasts all day on my skin and it puts me in my happy place. Try it-if you are a Neroli lover you won’t be disappointed-man or woman. The bottle is beautiful and will sit on a man’s dresser as well as a woman’s. And while it’s not inexpensive, it’s less per ounce than Ford. On me, it lasts all day. I haven’t been in public wearing it to get compliments yet, but I know it’s coming.",01/08/19 01:31,Justapixel

Acqua Neroli Clean,"Going off the notes alone, I didn't think I'd love this as much as I do. This was a blind buy based on my general agreement with Clean brand scents, and they didn't let me down. This is from their more expensive Reserve line and it's noticeably better than their standard ""laundry"" type spritzes. This is unisex, bright, fresh, sparkling, and clean, with a warm, neutral base. It reminds me of Sun Light dishwashing liquid mixed with Palmolive, but infused with heated citrus and creamy, sweet musk.

If bergamot typically doesn't wear well on you, give this a try - the oranges overtake it and leave no hint of it behind after 10 minutes. The neroli top melts perfectly with the tiniest hint of sandalwood in the dry down. The zesty ""clean"" note from most of their fragrances does make an appearance in the middle, but it's nowhere near as prominent as in Fresh Laundry & Warm Cotton. Longevity is as expected for this price point, though I have not yet tested it in summer temps.

Notes I pick up but that aren't official are lemon, honeysuckle, and iris.",11/14/18 18:58,intlV
Acqua Neroli Clean,"So, I took this and Tom Ford’s Neroli Portifino on a test drive today. The scents matched almost identically on my skin. I couldn’t tell the difference between the two except the TFNP was just a bit louder at the beginning. Dry down was the same scent too, however the TFNP was much more of a skin scent that faded much too quickly, especially for its price point. 4 hours is horrible for an eau de parfum. In the end, longevity went to Acqua Neroli. 8 hours and still going strong. You get much more value for your money with this one.

Edit: I fell in love! This can be worn as a day scent year round and it lasts a long time. Plus, $95 for 3oz is not bad considering there are some going for $130 for a 2.5 oz bottle, plus a little goes a long way. Then there’s the eco-friendly packaging and sustainability for people. It’s a win-win.",11/04/18 17:27,ChelleBelle84

I almost missed it at Sephora yesterday evening; thank God I turned around and saw it and took the bottle to my nose. I would've missed out on this masterpiece! I fell head over heels for it right away. I absolutely LOVE Tom Ford Neroli Portofino but I cannot afford a bottle. This smells so identical, but less sharp and softer. It's so mellow and airy. I discovered right then that Neroli is my favorite note in a fragrance, and boy, does it shine through or what?! Had I had the money, I would've bought a bottle of this on the spot.

Longevity: 10/10! I sprayed it on around 7 PM and when I woke up at 7 AM this morning, I still smelled it on my neck!
Sillage: 11/10. With only one spray, I freshened up the subway and trains I was on with this amazing, bright, beautiful, and sexy Dudu (insider) scent! It's not overpowering at all. I felt so sexy.
